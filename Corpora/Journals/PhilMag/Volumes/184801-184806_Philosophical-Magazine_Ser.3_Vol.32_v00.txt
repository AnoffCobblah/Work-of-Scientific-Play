         Muscae volitantes; with Observations on the Structure of
         the Vitreous Humour, and on the Vision of Objects placed
         within the Eye. By Sir DAVID BREwsTER, K.H., D.C.L.,
         F. IR.S., and V. P.R.S. Edin.*
          LTHOUGH some of the phaenomena of Muscar voli
           tantes may be seen by persons of all ages, and with the
     best eyes; and though those which are more peculiarly en
     titled to the name are exceedingly common beyond the middle
     period of life, yet no account has been given of them that has
     even the slightest pretension to accuracy. M. De la Hire, in
    his Differens Accidens de la Pue, describes these Musca, as of
    two kinds; some permanent and fixed, which he ascribes to
    small drops of extravasated blood upon the retina; and others,
    as flying about, and changing their place, even though the
    eye be fixed.      The first kind, he describes as like a dark spot
    upon a white ground; and the second, as like the knots of a
   deal board. Some parts of them, he says, are very clear, and
   surrounded with dark threads, and are accompanied with long
   fillets of irregular shapes, which are bright in the middle, and
   terminated on each side by parallel black threads.
       In order to account for these knots and irregular fillets, De
  la Hire supposes that “the aqueous humour is sometimes trou
  bled with some little mothery ropy substance, some parts of
 which, by the figures of their little surfaces, or by refractive
 powers different from the humour itself, may cast their distinct
 images upon the retina. He supposes them in the aqueous
humour rather than in the vitreous, because of its greater
fluidity for a freedom of descent, and because they will then

              2    Sir David Brewster on the Optical Phaenomena, Nature,
              appear to descend, as being situated before the pupil, or, at
              least, before the place of intersection of the pencils”.”
     . . . . . Dr. Porterfield, who has given a very inaccurate drawing
        ... of the filamentous Muscar, considers them as produced by dia
              phanous ºrwicles and filaments, that swim in the aqueous hu
              ifiotr before the crystalline; and he regards the distinct pic
 A. : :: *tures of them upon the retina of long-sighted persons, as pro
. . . . . . . duced by the rays which pass through the dense particles,
              having suffered a greater refraction than those which pass by
              them, so as to be converged to foci upon the retinat.
                  The latest writer on this subject, Mr. Mackenzie of Glas
              gow, describes the Muscae as resembling minute, twisted, semi
              transparent tubes, partially filled with globules, which some
              times appear in motion; while another set are more opake,
              or perfectly dark, and follow the motions of the eye. The
              latter he considers as “of a more dangerous character than
              the former, and as occasioned, generally, by a partial insen
              sibility of the retina,” either from the pressure of some “irre
              gular projecting point or points of the choroid, or from some
              other cause.” Mr. Mackenzie regards the globules within
              the semi-transparent tubes, as probably “blood passing through
              the vessels of the retina, or of the vitreous humour;” and he
              remarks, “that neither these semi-transparent tubes themselves,
             nor any of the filamentous Muscae, or black spots (which are
             so frequently complained of), possess any real motion, inde
             pendent of the general motion of the eyeball;” and hence he
             concludes that they “must be referred either to the retina
             itself—including, of course, the three laminae of which it is
             composed,—or to the choroid coat.” “The probability is,”
             he adds, “that the semi-transparent Muscar, of a tubular form,
             are owing to a dilatation of the branches of the arteria cen
             tralis retinae <U+017F>.”
                 Such was the state of our information on the subject of
             Muscae volitantes, when my attention was specially directed to
             it, in consequence of finding in my own eye a good example of
             the phaenomenon; and, having carefully investigated the facts
             as observed by other persons in their own eyes, I trust I shall
             be able to lay before the Society a correct description, aud a
             satisfactory explanation, of the general phaenomena.
                 Although the bodies which are within the eyeball, and give
             rise to the phaenomena under consideration, are often seen
             under ordinary circumstances, yet, in order to see them with

distinctness, we must look at the sky, or a luminous object,
either through a very minute aperture, or, when the light is
Mimited or feeble, through a lens or microscopic doublet, of
 very short focus, held close to the eye. By this means we
 shall observe a luminous ground, covered, more or less, with
 transparent filaments or tubes, transparent circles, exceedingly
 minute, and (when they do exist) with Musca, or black spots
 like flies.
    In examining the transparent filaments, I have observed
 them of four or five different sizes, the smallest of which are
 the most distinct.    These distinct filaments are bounded by
 two sharp black lines, and the space between them is more
 luminous than the general ground on which they are seen. Ira
 the larger filaments, the black lines are coloured at their edges,
 and, on the outside of each of them, are one or more coloured
 fringes.
    The minute transparent circles, when smallest, have a lumi—
 nous centre, with a sharp black circle round it.     In the larger
 ones, this circle is coloured at its edges; and, on the outside
 of it, are one or more circular coloured fringes. These sphe—
 rical bodies sometimes exist singly, and sometimes in groups,
 partly connected by small filaments, and partly by an invisible
 film, to which they seem attached. They sometimes adhere
 to the outside of the filaments, and very frequently occur with frz
 the filaments, so as to prove that these filaments are tubulaz--
 These spherical bodies have, like the filaments, four or <U+017F>izze
 different sizes.
    In making observations on these spherical bodies, the ob —
 server will sometimes see luminous spots pass through the field 5
 but as these arise from the state of the lubricating fluid on the
 outside of the cornea, they have no connexion with the phae–
 nomena under our consideration.
    The transparent filaments, already described, are seldorra
 seen single. Two or three are united, like threads crossin
 one another; and sometimes a great number are united, like
 a loose heap of thread, in which case obscure spots appear at
 the places where the crossings of the filaments are most nu
 Imerous.                                       -
    In some cases a single long filament is once or twice dou
 bled up upon itself, and sometimes a knot is, or appears to be
 tied upon it, consisting of several folds, as it were, of the fila:
 ment. This knot has several very dark spots at the places
 where the different portions of the filament are in contact .
 and this accumulation, as it were, of black specks, constitutes
 the real Muscae. In many, indeed in almost all of these Muscº.
 when distinct, a little bright yellow light accompanies the
 black specks.

4   Sir David Brewster on the Optical Phaenomena, Nature,
   All the bodies which we have now described have two dif
ferent motions; one arising from the motion of the head or
eyeball, and the other when the eyeball is absolutely fixed.
By a toss of the head they are thrown into different absolute
and relative positions, sometimes ascending and descending in
succession, sometimes oscillating between two limits, and ge
nerally with different velocities. When the eye is first applied
to the lens or aperture, the field of view is tolerably free of
these moving bodies; but the light seems to stir them up, as
it were, and, to a certain extent, the longer we view them, the
more numerous do they become.
   If the centre of motion of the eyeball coincides with the
centre of visible direction, the Muscae will ascend when the eye
looks upward, and vice versd, whether they are placed before
or behind that common centre. If the eyeball remains fixed,
the Muscae in front of the above centre will have the direction
of their real and apparent motions the same, and those behind
that centre will have these two directions different. Hence
the appearance of two opposite currents when the eyeball is
turned quickly from one extreme of its range, either vertically
or horizontally, to its mean position; and so rapid is their
motion through the luminous field, that it seems covered with
continuous lines parallel to the direction in which the eyeball
has been moved,—an effect arising from the duration of the
impression of light upon the retina.
   If we mark individual filaments, or groups, or knots, we
shall find that they change their shapes, one part of a filament
doubling itself over another, and again resuming its elongated
form. The minute spherical bodies separate and approach
one another; but I have not been able to satisfy myself that
those within the tubular filaments change their place. They
often appear to do so; but as this necessarily arises from the
bending of the filament, and from the varying obliquity of
different parts of it owing to its change of form or place, we
are not entitled, from this apparent motion, to consider them
as moveable within the tube. It is certain, however, that they
have no progressive motion, as supposed by Mr. Mackenzie.
   In order to obtain a correct knowledge of the phaenomena
of the real Muscae, I confined my attention to one in my own
eye, of which I first made a drawing in October 1838. It is
represented in the annexed figure, and consists of four fila
ments, ABC, BDE, FGH, and AK.                 Between BC and
BDE there is a sort of transparent web containing a great
number of minute spherical specks, and something similar,
though less extensive, below FGH. The real Musca exists
at A, and has obviously been produced by the accidental
overlapping of the different filaments which are united with it.

In four and a half years, the Musca at N has perceptibly in
creased in size, and the length of the associated filaments has
diminished. It is distinctly seen without any of its accom
     F

 paniments in ordinary light, but is in no respects injurious
to vision, as it is never stationary in the axis of the eye. When
seen by means of the lens, the long branch FGH takes various
 positions, sometimes falling below the knot or Musca A, and
 sometimes crossing the main branch AB, below B. The
 branch BDE has often a loop at D, and FGH another at G.
    Having had occasion to study the phaenomena of the dif:
Jraction of light, as produced by transparent fibres and films of
 different forms, I could not fail to observe that the phaenomena
 above described were the shadows formed on the retina by
 divergent light passing by and through transparent filaments
 and particles placed within the eyeball. They are indeed
 perfectly identical, and may be accurately imitated in various
 ways. If we crush a crystalline lens in distilled water, or
 macerate some very thin laminae of it, and dry a drop of the
 fluid on a piece of glass, we shall perceive, with a fine micro
 scope a little out of focus, or with an ill-adjusted illuminating
 apparatus, a number of minute fibres, single and in groups,
 and knots, with minute spherical particles, which display the
 very same phaenomena of diffraction as the analogous bodies
 within the eyeball.
    Hence it follows, that the filaments and spherical particles,
  whose diffracted shadows have four or five different sizes,
 have the same magnitude, and are placed at four or five differ
  ent distances from the retina; those which give the sharp,
  black, and minute shadows, being placed near the retina, and
  those which are large and ill-defined at a distance from it.

6 Sir David Brewster on the Optical Phaenomena, Nature,
 These various bodies, though they change their place, still
 preserve their general distance from the retina, thus clearly
indicating that the vitreous humour is composed of cells within
 which the filaments and Muscae are lodged. That they do not
 exist in the aqueous humour is very obvious, because if they
 did, they would either rise to the top or sink to the bottom
of the aqueous chamber when the eyeball was at rest, and thus
withdraw themselves entirely from the field of view, which
they never do.
    f order to obtain further information respecting these
 Musca, I fixed the eyeball in different positions", and looking
 at a sheet of white paper, I marked upon it the various posi
 tions on the paper where the Musca rested. It never with
 drew itself from the field of view, and suffered no sensible
 change in its size; but it rested in positions at different di
 stances from the axis of vision. In one position of the head
 I could bring the Musca into the optic axis so as to obtain the
 most perfect vision of it, but in all other positions of the head
 it rested at a distance from the optic axis; though in these it
 could, by a toss of the head, be made to cross the axis of
 vision. In making these experiments, we must recollect that,
 as the Musca is generally seen by oblique vision, it will very
 frequently disappear, though it has not withdrawn itself from
 the field of view. In all positions of the head the Musca ap
 pears to descend, so that it must actually ascend in the vitreous
 humour, and be specifically lighter.
     Now, it is obvious that, if we determine the visible position
 of the Musca when at rest in different positions of the head,
 we determine the direction of lines passing from the centre of
 visible direction through the points in the vitreous humour
 where the Musca rested, and thus obtain a general notion of
the form of the cell in which it is contained. But we may go
 still further, and determine with considerable accuracy the
diameter of the Musca or its filaments, and also their distance
from the retina, and thus obtain a knowledge of its locality,
and of the form of the cavity by which its excursions are
limited.
    In order to do this, I place before the eye two bright sources
of light, so as to obtain from them, by the method already
described, two divergent beams of light, and I thus obtain
double images on the retina of all objects placed within the
eyeball. The filaments or Muscae in the anterior part of the
vitreous humour will have their double images very distant:
   • In order to do this, the observer must place himself on his back, on
his face, on his right side or on his left side, or he may place the vertical
axis of his eyeball at any angle to a vertical line.

                   and Locality of Muscae volitantes.                    7
  those in the middle of it will have their double images much
  nearer : those near the retina will have their two images close
 or perhaps overlapping each other; while any object on the
  retina itself, any black spot arising from defective sensibility,
  will have only one image, as it were. Now, if we measure the
  distance of the two sources of light from each other, and also
  their distance from the centre of visible direction, when the
  two images of the filaments, &c. are just in contact, we may
  determine the size of the filament and its exact position, as
  well as its distance from the retina. In making this experi
  ment, I first found that the angle of apparent magnitude of
  the shadow of the filament ABC was eight minutes, and con
  sequently that it subtended this angle at the centre of visible
  direction *. Now, if we take the radius of the retina as O'524
  of an inch, the diameter of the shadow of the filament will be
  0.0122, or ºpth of an inch, and its distance from the retina
  0-018, or ºrth part of an inch.
     When we use a small aperture alone for producing a diver
 gent pencil, the centre of divergency must necessarily be with
 out the eyeball; but we may throw the centre of divergency
 within the eyeball, and place it at any distance from the retina,
 by using a lens of the proper focus. If we wish to place this
 centre near the retina, a lens of considerable focal length must
 be used, and as the light collected by it will be powerful, it
 will extinguish all the smaller filaments and minute spheres,
 and allow only the larger Muscae to be seen. We must there
 fore reduce its aperture by looking through a pin-hole or other
 minute opening. When we wish to have a clear field of view
 for examining the larger Musca, we may extinguish all the
 smaller ones by increasing the luminosity of the field. If we
 wish to study the filaments or Muscae that may be placed about
the middle of the vitreous humour, we must use a lens of such
an aperture as will obliterate all those more remote from the
 retl Ila.
    It is very obvious, from the preceding observations, that
objects placed within the eyeball are not seen, as Dr. Porter
field believes, by rays which pass THROUGH dense particles
having suffered a greater refraction than those which pass BY
them. A fibre or particle of glass of nearly the same refrac
tive power as the vitreous humour will be seen distinctly by
means of its image formed on the retina by diffracted pencils.
If the light is not sufficiently divergent, or is too intense to
produce and exhibit the diffracted image, the object will be
   * This may be done by projecting it upon a luminous surface, and mark
ing its apparent size; or by comparing it with the images of objects of
known dimensions seen with a fine microscope.

invisible, unless it be of such a size, and so near the retina, as
to show itself by its ordinary shadow. But in whatever way
the image of the object is formed, the mind takes cognizance
of it, or gives it an external locality, by means of the same
law of visible direction which regulates the vision of objects
placed without the eyeball.
    While these results exhibit the true physical cause of all
 the optical phaenomena and limited movements of the filaments
 and Musca, they lead also to some important and useful con
 clusions of a more general nature. It had been conjectured
 that the vitreous humour of animals was inclosed in separate
 bags or cells connected with the hyaloid membrane by which
 the vitreous mass is enveloped. The preceding experiments
 not only appear to demonstrate that this is the structure of the
 vitreous humour in man, but to show that there are at least
jour or five cells between the retina and the posterior surface
 of the crystalline lens. The limited motion of the Muscae in
 dicates that the cell in which they float is of very limited ex
 tent. When the vertical diameter of the eyeball, in its natural
 position, is placed, by the inclination of the head, 30° to the
 right-hand of a vertical line, and the optic axis of the eye di
 rected 20° below a horizontal line, the Musca is seen along
 the optic axis, and consequently in the most perfect manner.
 One point of its cell must therefore touch the optical axis.
    I have endeavoured, with the assistance of my eminent col
 league lyr. Reid, to discover cells in the vitreous humour of
 quadrupeds and fishes by the aid of the microscope and other
 means, but we have not succeeded : and unless some chemical
substance shall be found which acts differently upon the albu
minous fluid and the membranous septa, it is not likely that
they will be otherwise rendered visible”.
    Mr. Ware, in a paper on the Muscae volitantes of nervous
persons f, describes some as “globules twisted together, and
 others as like the flue that is swept from bed-rooms,” and he
 considers it “probable that they depend on a steady pressure
 on one or more minute points of the retina which are situated
 near the axis of vision f.” In the cases described by Mr. Ware,
 the Muscae were liable to great and sudden changes in inten
sity and number, particularly from causes affecting the nervous
   * The vitreous humour, when slowly dried, either by itself, or along
with parts of the septa in which it may be contained, shoots into beautiful
crystalline ramifications proceeding from the four angles of a quadrilateral
crystal. Thin six-sided plates frequently occur, but they seem to exercise
no action upon polarized light, probably on account of their thinness. The
same effects were produced when the vitreous humour from a fresh eye was
well-washed in distilled water.

system, and hence they cannot be regarded as of the same
character as the Muscae described in this paper, unless we
suppose that Muscae, invisible under ordinary circumstances,
become visible in consequence of an increased sensibility of
the retina.
   This supposition, however, is by no means probable, be
cause the Muscae are not visible by any light of their own, and
an increase of sensibility in the retina would affect equally the
luminous field on which they are seen. But as this point is
of some importance both in a physiological and a medical
aspect, I have submitted it to direct experiment. With this
view, I examined the Muscae in the morning before the sensi
bility of the retina had been diminished by exposure to day
light, and found that they were neither increased in number
or intensity. I varied this experiment by diminishing the
sensibility of the retina. This was done by holding a bright
gas flame close to the eye, and near the axis of vision, till the
retina lost its sensibility to all the rays of the spectrum, except
a few of the more refrangible ones”. In this case, too, the
Muscae were as numerous and distinct as before, and we may
therefore consider it as certain, that the Muscae described by
Mr. Ware, in so far as they were of the same character as
those in the healthy eye, are not affected by any variation in
the sensibility of the retina. I am disposed to think that they
consisted of the ordinary Muscae seen simultaneously with
others produced by the pressure of the blood-vessels on the
retina, and that it was the latter only which underwent the
variations which he describes.
   It is not easy to form any rational conjecture respecting the
cause and purpose of the numerous filaments by which the
Muscae are produced; for as they exist in all eyes, whether
young or old, they are neither the result of disease, nor do
they indicate its approach. Were they fixed or regularly
distributed, we might regard them as transparent vessels which
supply the vitreous humour; but existing, as they do, in de
tached and floating portions, they resemble more the remains
of those vessels, or of others whose functions are no longer
necessary. But though these filaments have no morbid cha
racter, they may nevertheless obstruct and even destroy vision.
They certainly interfere with nice microscopical observations,
and in observing the minute and almost imperceptible lines in
the solar spectrum, I have found them to be occasionally in
jurious. It is quite possible that some of the cells behind the
 lens or even near the retina and around the optic axis might
 be filled up with accumulated Muscae, and produce a consider

  able degree of blindness; but this is an effect of them which
  there is little occasion to apprehend.
     Mr. Mackenzie” informs us, “that few symptoms prove so
 alarming to persons of a nervous habit or constitution as
 Muscae volitantes, and they immediately suppose that they are
 about to lose their sight by cataract or amaurosis.” Professor
  Plateau of Ghent, to whom I had communicated, at his own
 request, some of the preceding results, mentions to me, that
 few physicians are able to distinguish between the Muscae de
 scribed above, and those appearances which indicate amauro
 sis, and that they often, without cause, alarm patients who
 consult them for the first time respecting such affections of the
 eye. He assures me that the results contained in this paper
 have already been the means of freeing from alarm many per
 sons with Muscae volitantes, and that they had even done this
 to a distinguished physician f.
    The details in the preceding pages may, therefore, be con
sidered as establishing the important fact, that Musca volitantes
 have no connexion whatever either with Cataract or Amau
 rosis, and that they are nearly altogether harmless.                  This
 result has been deduced by the aid of a recondite property of
 divergent light, which has only been developed in our own day,
and which seems to have no bearing whatever of an utilitarian
character. And this is but one of numerous proofs which the
progress of knowledge is daily accumulating, that the most
abstract and apparently transcendental truths in physical
science will sooner or later add their tribute to supply human
wants, and alleviate human sufferings. Nor has science per
formed one of the least important of her functions when she
enables us, either in our own case, or in that of others, to
dispel those anxieties and fears which are the necessary off
spring of ignorance and error.

led to suppose that the Muscae had their seat in the vitreous humour rather
than in the aqueous; but that he had been stopped by the difficulty of re
conciling this opinion with the viscosity of the vitreous humour. As the
vitreous humour is perfectly fluid within each cell, the viscosity here sup
posed, being only apparent, no longer presents any difficulty.

    been deduced from it.       By J. R. YoUNG, Professor of Ma
    thematics in Belfast College”.
IT      is the object of the present short paper to remove some
      obscurities connected with the ordinary treatment of the
simple    integral/#.       It will be anticipated therefore that the
remarks which I have to offer are of a very elementary cha
racter: too much so indeed to entitle them to a place in a
Journal of this kind, were it not that such obscurities, in the
first elements of science, as experience has often shown, are
frequently the source of important errors in its more recondite
applications.
    The integral just adverted to is a particular case of the more
general form<U+017F>ºde, of which the value, disregarding cor

rection, is known to be m + 1"        In the particular case noticed,
that namely in which n = –1, this expression for the value is
said to fail; though it is admitted to be valid in every other
case, whether n be whole or fractional, positive or negative.
    It may possibly be remembered by some of the readers of
this Journal, that such an isolated failing case, in a general
algebraic formula, is an occurrence that I have endeavoured
to show can never happen; and that if any such formula hold
for all values between a and b, it must equally hold for the
extreme limits a and b themselves.
    In the instance before us, the particular information, which
the general form is supposed to fail in supplying, is obtained
from other considerations; and the value of the wanting inte
gral affirmed to be log w. And the reason sometimes assigned
for the inefficiency of the general form, in the particular case,

 pears to me that this explanation is by no means sufficient to
 justify the assertion that the general form fails. Every student
 of the calculus knows that, by integrating the same expression
 by different methods, different functions of the variable will
 often arise, which can only become identical, in particular
 applications of the results, when each is connected with its
 own supplementary constant. One method may lead us to
 logarithmic functions, another to circular; and though they
 both arise from one and the same differential, they cannot, in
 general, be equated till each has received its own peculiar
 correction.              In such instances it appears to me that it would
 be just as proper to say that one of these methods fails, as in
 the instance before us. The fact is, that in all cases of general
 integration, where the supplementary constant is suppressed,
 the process is really performed between limits, one of which
  is fixed, and the other arbitrary. To be strictly accurate,

   In Liouville’s well-known memoir on General Differen

error, in consequence of being governed by the prevailing
views respecting the failure of the general form here discussed.
He is led (page 84) to the formula

which, in accordance with those views, he affirms (page 85) to
be “absolument fausselorsque p-0.” In justification of this,
he maintains that the definite integral

   How this can be pronounced to be zero, I am at a loss to
conceive. That it is infinite, instead of zero, necessarily fol
lows from its interpretation in the left-hand member of the
original equation, even if there were no internal evidence of
the fact. In the particular or extreme case considered, that
left-hand member becomes ao- 1 ; and the right-hand mem
ber is the series here exhibited multiplied by 0, the limiting
value of p : the form therefore is merely a particular instance
of 0 x 30 ; interpretable, as all the cases which this termi
nates are interpretable, by the unambiguous form on the left.
Several errors of like kind occur in Liouville's memoir; all
traceable to the same oversight respecting fundamental prin
ciples.
   It may not be superfluous to remark, in reference to the
foregoing series for log (1 + x), that whenever that series is

not convergent, a supplementary correction is considered to
be comprehended under the “&c.” In the various transfor
mations which this series is made to undergo, in order that it
may serve the purpose of the actual construction of logarithmic
tables, it will be found on examination that they are always
such as to preserve throughout the convergency of the series,
so that the correction adverted to disappears.     If however we
replace a by a-1, a being the base of the system, we then
render the series necessarily divergent; and it is common in
writings on this subject (see for instance Miller's Diff. Calc.,
p. 10) to apply to it in this state certain transformations, by
which it is said to be converted into a converging series. But
no diverging series can admit of such conversion; and whenever
this appears to be accomplished, it will always be found that
the original series is taken, not by itself, but in conjunction
with its correction; and thus the change apparently brought
about independently of this correction, is, in reality, a new
development of the function generating the original series.
   There is a well-known theorem of Lagrange, which, in the
case of Taylor's series, enables us to assign the limits within
which must lie the error we commit by taking any finite num
ber of terms of the series as an equivalent for the undeveloped
function. In the form in which Lagrange delivered it, the
theorem is

in which he says “u désigne une quantité inconnue, mais ren
fermée entre les limites O et a " (Théorie des Fonctions, p. 68);
and the same conditions are always said to be necessary when
ever the theorem is announced. It is certainly of little or no
practical moment to correct this statement; yet in order that
extreme cases even may not be improperly excluded, it is
necessary to widen the limits so as actually to include 0 and
ar. For it is plain that if the series be finite, and we stop at
the last term, which it is conceivable we might sometimes do
without knowing that the final term was reached, u would be
actually 0; and if we stop at the first term, then in every case
w would be equal to a ; so that, leaving the term at which we
stop entirely unrestricted, the generality of the theorem re
quires that the limits 0 and a be included. . From an exami
nation of this theorem, I am inclined to think that it is capable
of greater definiteness and precision than is at present given
to it, the range between the limits depending in general upon
the place of the term at which we stop : but the discussion of
this point must be reserved for a future occasion.

WE possess in benzoic acid       and its derivatives a well-de
        fined group of substances connected in a variety of
ways with a large number of organic families. These inter
esting bodies have been made subjects of investigation by
several chemists. The study has been a fascinating one, and
has resulted in a thorough development of their history, and
of the products of their decomposition.
   This group may be considered the prototype, as it were, of
several parallel groups, presenting a very close relation with
the composition of the benzoyle family. The careful study of
the former has gradually made these known to us, in the same
manner as the study of alcohol and its derivatives made us
acquainted with several corresponding classes of bodies.
   The methyle compounds, with which we have become fa
miliar through the experiments of Dumas and Peligott on
pyroxylic spirit, and the amyle series, the origin of which we
owe to the investigations of Cahours f on fusel oil, form two
groups, the analogy of which with the alcohol series can be
traced in every direction; they differ in composition from the
former only by a multiple of C, H2, thus—

 The same relation is likewise observed in the acids resulting
 from the oxidation of these bodies, and these acids are per
 haps even better adapted to point out this interesting regu

 filled up in the series of the acids, which may be formed in a
 great variety of ways. A glance at the following table will

    Now it seems that benzoic acid is a member of a similar
series of acids, distinguished from each other by the same
amounts of carbon and hydrogen, and that we may expect to
find a representative of every single term of the benzoyle se
ries in these other families. An examination of cumin oil by
MM. Gerhardt and Cahours” has brought to light a new
acid,    cuminic acid, HO, Cao Hu Os, which exhibits a per
fect analogy with benzoic acid, not only in its physical pro
perties, but also in the metamorphoses which it undergoes
when acted on by chemical agents. This acid is distinguished
from benzoic, HO, Cia H, Os, by containing 3(C., H3) more;
it stands to benzoic acid as valerianic acid stands to acetic
acid, and when distilled with lime it is converted into cumol,
Cls H12, which represents benzol, C12 He, in the benzoyle
series.   The same investigation of cumin oil has made us ac
quainted with another carbo-hydrogen cymol, Cao Hla, which
is also a representative of benzol in another series; but up
to the present time the acid from which this carbo-hydrogen
derives, and which would contain 4(C, H2) more than ben
zoic acid, has not been discovered.

 tion has been made to the number of carbo-hydrogens, and
 we have obtained knowledge of a new body, which was de
 scribed by the first chemists under the name of retinaphtha,
 by the second under that of benzoëne, and by the last under
 that of dracyle; for all three Berzelius+ has proposed the
 more appropriate name of toluolf (Cha Hs); this body, which
 differs from benzol in containing C, H2 more, also represents
 that carbo-hydrogen in a new family, a number of members
 of which has already become known. Thus Deville has
 shown that on treating his toluol with sulphuric and nitric
 acids, the corresponding terms of hypo-sulphobenzolic acid,
 nitrobenzol, and dinitrobenzol are obtained. Investigations
 of the action of nitric acid on oil of anise by Cahours t, and
 on Oleum dracunculi by Laurent $, have led to the discovery
 of anisylic, nitranisylic acids, and anisol (draconic, nitrodraco
 nic acids and dracol), corresponding respectively to salicylic,
 nitrosalicylic acid and phenol; more recently Cahours| has
 found in hydride of anisyle even the term corresponding to
 hydride of salicyle, and Drs. Muspratt and Hofmann'<U+017F> have
 produced the organic base corresponding to aniline; in the
 paper in which this new and remarkable substance is de
 scribed, these gentlemen have given a table, in which the
 analogy between the anisyle and salicyle groups has been
 pointed out.
    In order to render this parallelism complete one principal
 term of the new series has hitherto been wanting, viz. the
 acid corresponding to benzoic acid. . In the following paper
 will be pointed out the formation and properties of this sub
 stance, and the corresponding nitrogenous acid, both arising
 amongst the products of the oxidation of cymol.
   * Jahresbericht, xxii. p. 354.
   + On comparing the properties which Pelletier and Walter ascribe to re
tinaphtha with those of benzoène given by Deville, it is nearly certain that
both substances are identical, though Deville seems to be inclined to esta
blish a difference. A comparative study is however still wanting. Regard
ing dracyle, I may mention here that when engaged in the investigation of
toluidine with Dr. Muspratt, we prepared a portion of this body according
to the directions of Glenard and Boudault. The dracyle obtained possessed
all the properties of toluol; we converted the body thus prepared into ni
trodracyle (nitrotoluol), from which, by treatment with reducing agents,
beautiful crystals of toluidine were obtained. In our paper on this organic
base an analysis of the sulphate is given, and on referring I find that we
forgot to mention that the salt analysed was prepared with the very toluidine
obtained from the carbo-hydrogen arising with the distillation products of
dragon's blood. This experiment removes any doubt that might have re
mained as to the identity of toluol and dracyle.—Dr. A. W. Hofmann.

18     Mr. Noad on the Action of Nitric Acid on Cymol.
                       Preparation of Cymol.
   The experiments of Gerhardt and Cahours have shown that
cumin oil (oleum cumini) is a mixture of two distinct oils,
cuminol (C20H12O2), a body corresponding closely to oil of
bitter almonds, and cymol (Cao Hui); by treatment with
potash, the oxygen oil is converted into cuminic acid, while the
carbo-hydrogen distils over unaltered. As, for the experi
ments about to be detailed, it was the latter of these two oils
that was required, the mode of separation which I found it
most convenient to adopt was the following:—The oil was
first submitted to distillation alone, and about two-thirds of
it drawn over; this portion was then repeatedly distilled with
sticks of caustic potash, until the alkali remained unaltered;
fresh potash was introduced after every third or fourth di
stillation, and the oil was regarded as pure when it ceased to
lose anything after two or three distillations; latterly I found
it advantageous to employ a retort of copper in this operation,
the heated alkali proving exceedingly destructive to vessels of
glass. The quantity of cymol obtained averaged about 7 oz.
for every pound of cumin oil; and here I must be allowed to
express my thanks to my friend Mr. Warington for having
kindly undertaken to furnish me with a supply of oil obtained
directly from the seeds by distillation: without his assistance
 I should scarcely have been able to have followed out my in
 vestigation, on account of the high price and varying quality
 of the oil obtained in commerce; from three-quarters of a
 hundred weight of seed Mr. Warington obtained at four di
stillations 2 lbs. 12 oz. of oil, which yielded me 18 oz. of beau
tiful and pure cymol.
   To render cymol perfectly anhydrous, it was left for some
time in contact with pieces of fused chloride of calcium and
again distilled; in this state it is a limpid, colourless, highly
refracting oil, of a very agreeable odour; its specific gravity
I found to be 0.8576 at 16°, and its boiling-point, as a mean
 of two determinations with two specimens of the oil obtained
at different periods, and which agreed closely with each other,
 1719.5 C.                                                         -
    Cymol has been identified with camphogene, a substance
previously obtained by Dumas”, by the action of anhydrous
phosphoric acid on camphor, and lately studied by Dela
landet. At the commencement of my experiments I thought
 that this might probably be a useful practical method of pro
 curing the carbo-hydrogen; from the difficulty however of
obtaining anhydrous phosphoric acid in sufficient quantities,
     * Liebig's Annalen, vi. 249.            t Ibid. xxxviii. 343.

       Mr. Noad on the Action of Nitric Acid on Cymol. 19
and from the small amount of camphogene obtained, I found
it otherwise, and I merely prepared a sufficient supply to en
able me to obtain an additional proof of the identity of the
two oils, which I did in a manner hereafter to be described.
I may remark that even after repeated distillations with re
newed quantities of anhydrous phosphoric acid I was unable
to procure camphogene quite free from the peculiar smell of
camphor, nor was there to be discovered in it the slightest
approach to that fragrant odour by which cymol is charac
terized.
                Action of Nitric Acid on Cymol.
   The action of nitric acid on cymol or camphogene has never
hitherto been the subject of minute examination. Gerhardt
and Cahours in their paper only mention that nitric acid of
moderate concentration does not attack cymol when cold;
that on heating nitrous acid is disengaged, and the carbo
hydrogen gradually passes into a peculiar acid, which on
cooling is precipitated as a curdy mass; that this acid is ra
ther soluble in water, alcohol and aether, crystallizing only
with difficulty, and decomposed by heat, partially subliming
in fine light needles or woolly flakes; and that fuming nitric
acid decomposes cymol with the formation of the same acid
and a yellow resin; none of these substances were however
submitted by these chemists to elementary analysis. Delalande
states that on treating camphogene with boiling fuming nitric
acid it is converted into a white solid matter, becoming cry
stalline in the acid, and containing nitrogen. From these
 statements it seemed evident that the action of nitric acid on
 cymol gives rise to a variety of bodies, a supposition which
 experiments have completely verified; indeed, by a careful
 examination of this reaction, I have ascertained that not less
 than five or six different substances are produced; these bo
 dies, some of which are acid, and some of a neutral character,
 are separated with considerable difficulty. In the present
 memoir I propose to confine myself to the acids only, re
 serving the regular substitution products of cymol, with the
 basic bodies arising therefrom, the substances representing
 nitrobenzol, aniline, &c., in the cymol series for a future paper.
    I commenced with fuming nitric acid of the highest degree
 of concentration, the action of which on cymol is exceedingly
 violent; to avoid explosions it was necessary to keep the ves
 sel cool by immersion in water; the oil was added gradually,
 drop by drop, to the acid, which speedily became of a dark
 red colour; by repeated distillations I obtained a beautiful
 crystalline acid, the analysis of which, leading to the formula
                                C 2

20    Mr. Noad on the Action of Nitric Acid on Cymol.
HO, Cig Hs NO, rendered it evident, from the mode of its
formation, that it must be considered as a substitution pro
duct of a corresponding non-nitrogenous acid, HO, Cid H. Oa,
the very acid that is wanting in the toluol series, to the pro
duction of which acid my attention was now particularly di
rected.
   Many attempts were made to oxidize the oil without ha
ving recourse to nitric acid; long-continued distillations with
chromic acid, or with peroxide of manganese and sulphuric
acid proved quite ineffectual, but after a great number of
tentative operations, I at length succeeded, by the following
method, in obtaining the wished-for substance, for which I
propose the name of toluylic acid:—Ordinary nitric acid was
diluted with about six times its bulk of water, and cymol
added in the proportion of about 2 oz. of the oil to 1 lb. of
the acid; the mixture was then introduced into a capacious
retort and the distillation continued for two or three days;
 with acid of this strength there is no fear of a violent action;
the oxidation of the oil proceeds slowly and quietly; it first
becomes of a bright blue colour from the absorption of nitric
oxide gas, then yellow, and after having been ten or a dozen
times poured back into the retort, it begins to change more
 and more its physical character; it becomes heavier and more
tenacious, and finally sinks to the bottom of the vessel; the
process is known to be completed by a portion of the newly
formed acid passing over with the vapour of water, and con
densing in the receiver, and if the whole operation has been
successfully conducted, the contents of the retort become
nearly solid on cooling from the crystallization of the acid;
the weaker the nitric acid employed, and the longer the time
consumed, the whiter and purer is the resulting acid; if a
much stronger acid than that above prescribed be employed,
violent action takes place when the boiling-point is reached,
nearly the whole of the contents of the retort is projected into
the receiver, and the new acid is found at the close of the
operation to be contaminated with a considerable quantity of
the nitrogenous acid, from which it is impossible afterwards
entirely to free it; even when the operation has been slowly
and carefully conducted with a very weak acid, it still con
tains a certain quantity of this acid, as numerous analyses
proved, from which it is only to be freed by a series of trou
blesome operations; and it was only after a careful study and
comparison of the salts formed by the respective acids that I
was enabled to lay down a precise method for their separa
tion. This method is founded on the great solubility of to
luylate of baryta in cold water, and the very sparing solubility

        Mr. Noad on the Action of Nitric Acid on Cymol.        21
 of the corresponding salt of the nitrogenous acid in the same
 menstruum.       The crude acid is thrown on a filter, and the
 adhering nitric acid removed by washing with cold water; it’
 is then boiled with hydrate of lime, and the resulting lime
 salt, filtered when quite cold, afterwards decomposed by nitric
 or hydrochloric acid; if the acid does not precipitate tolerably
 white, the same operation is repeated, and the well-washed
 acid is then dissolved in baryta water and carefully evaporated
 to dryness on the water-bath; it is redissolved in cold water,
 filtered, reprecipitated by hydrochloric acid, washed, and the
 process repeated until the dry baryta salt dissolves completely
 in cold water; it should then be once or twice crystallized,
after which it is generally quite pure.
    The quantity of pure acid as thus obtained from 2 oz. of
 cymol is very small, but I have not hitherto been fortunate
enough to discover a better or less circuitous method of pro
curing it; could an oxidizing action be effected on the oil
 without the use of nitric acid a great saving would undoubt
edly be achieved, but, as before stated, all my attempts in
this direction proved unavailing; it is not impossible that the
object may be obtained by permanganate of potash. I made
one experiment with this salt, and there was evidently a re
duction of the permanganic acid, but no trace of toluylic acid
could be discovered, from which it seems evident that the
oxidation had in this case proceeded too far and the cymol
become converted into carbonic acid; this reaction has not
however as yet been sufficiently studied.                       -
                    Composition of Toluylic Acid.
   On submitting toluylic acid to elementary analysis in the
usual manner, by burning it with oxide of copper, I obtained
the following results:—
   I. Acid obtained by sublimation, not having been previously
treated with baryta:–0-2225 grm. gave 0:569 grm, carbonic
acid and 0°1190 water.
   II. Acid obtained as before from a new preparation:—
0.2105 grm. gave 0.540 grm. carbonic acid and 0.1130 water.
   III. Acid obtained from the lime salt:-0-160 grm. gave
0.415 grm. carbonic acid and 0.085 water.
   IV. Acid obtained from the baryta salt:—0-3120 grim.
gave 0-803 grim. carbonic acid and 0.161 water.         -
   V. Acid obtained as before from a new preparation:—
0.320 grim. gave 0.825 grim. carbonic acid and 0.1715 water.
   These numbers correspond to the following per-centages:—

     This acid thus becomes isomeric with hydride of anisyle
and benzoate of oxide of methyle.
                     Properties of Toluylic Acid.
      From an aqueous solution of any of its salts toluylic acid is
precipitated by nitric or hydrochloric acid as a snow-white
 curdy mass, which under the microscope resolves itself into a
 great number of small acicular crystals: it is soluble to a
 considerable extent in boiling water, out of which it crystal
 lizes on cooling in small needles; in alcohol, aether and pyr
 oxylic spirit it is soluble almost to any extent; when heated
 it fuses and sublimes without decomposition in beautiful
 needles: in its state of perfect purity it is inodorous and taste
 less, but the impure acid has a peculiar and sickening smell,
 somewhat resembling that of oil of bitter almonds. When
 boiled for some time with concentrated nitric acid, it loses an
  atom of hydrogen, in the place of which an atom of hyponi
 tric acid enters, nitrotoluylic acid being formed; and when
 heated with caustic lime or baryta it is decomposed into car
 bonic acid and toluol.
      In the formation of toluylic acid from cymol four equivalents
  of carbon and six equivalents of hydrogen are eliminated in
   the form of oxalic and carbonic acids and water.        In several
   preparations large quantities of oxalic acid were found. There
   exists a striking similarity in the manner in which nitric acid
   acts upon cymol and oil of anise, an oil in its composition
   closely connected with cymol, and which gives rise to anisylic
   acid, between which and toluylic acid there is also a marked
   resemblance. The composition of oil of anise being Cao Hue O,
   we may consider it as cymol which has lost two equivalents
   of hydrogen and taken two of oxygen. The composition of
   the acids formed by the action of nitric acid on these two oils
   is as follows:–
              Toluylic acid . . . .       HO, Cie H, Os
              Anisylic acid . . . .       HO, C6 H, Og.

   From the extreme difficulty of obtaining this acid in a state
of purity in any quantity, I have not been able to examine
as many of its salts as I could have wished; the following
will however serve to confirm its composition and establish
its atomic weight.
    Toluylate of Baryta.-The formation of this salt has been
already described; I was unable to obtain it in a well-defined

nitrate of silver into a perfectly neutral solution of toluylate
of ammonia; it fell as a white curdy mass, which was
washed on a filter with cold water and purified by two or
 three crystallizations out of boiling water: it crystallizes in
 small needles. On analysing this salt the following numbers
 were obtained :—
    I. 0-3785 grm. burned with oxide of copper gave 0.544
 grm. of carbonic acid and 0.1045 water.
    II. O-334 grim. ignited gave 0.1485 silver.                    -

solution of sulphate of copper into a perfectly neutral solution
of toluylate of potash; it fell as a bright blue precipitate
closely resembling the corresponding benzoate. It is very
soluble in ammonia, forming a dark blue solution, and soluble
to a slight extent in boiling water, separating on cooling as a

   Toluylate of Owide of Ethyle.—This compound was formed
by transmitting a stream of dry hydrochloric acid gas through
a solution of the acid dissolved in strong alcohol, until the
latter fumed strongly; it was then distilled, about two-thirds
drawn over, and the residue in the retort mixed with water;
the new aether precipitated in the form of a dark heavy liquid;
it was digested with ammonia to remove any uncombined to
luylic acid, well-washed with distilled water, dried, by being
allowed to remain for some time in contact with pieces of
fused chloride of calcium, and then distilled : it passed into
the receiver nearly colourless, but on standing it deposited a
small quantity of crystalline matter, which proved to be the
aether of the nitrogenous acid, the acid employed not having
been obtained from the baryta salt. By a second distillation,
collecting only the first portions, the whole of the other aether
was removed and a pure substance obtained.

 grant liquid, having an odour closely resembling that of cin
 namic or benzoic aether, and a pungent and slightly bitter
 taste. It boils at 228°C., which temperature may perhaps
 be one or two degrees too high, the determination having been
 made before the last traces of the nitrogenous aether had been
 removed ; still it exhibits a new confirmation of the obser
 vation of H. Kopp, that the difference in the boiling-points of
 two analogous compounds, which differ by two equivalents of
 carbon and two of hydrogen, is lºº C. Benzoic aether, the
 composition of which is C, H, O, Cid Hs O, boils at 209°.
 Unfortunately I had not a sufficient quantity of the liquid
 after purification for a second determination.
    The following salts I have examined qualitatively only,
 considering the composition and atomic weight of the acid
 well-enough established by the preceding analyses.
    Toluylate of Potash, formed by exactly neutralizing the
 acid with caustic potash, is a very soluble salt, crystallizing
 with great difficulty in small needles.
    Toluylate of Soda is still more soluble than the preceding.
 I could not obtain it in the crystalline state.
    Toluylate of Ammonia crystallizes in small prisms.
    Toluylate of Lime crystallizes out of a concentrated aqueous
solution in long shining needles.
        Products of the Decomposition of Toluylic Acid.
   Nitrotoluylic Acid.—I have already observed that on treat
ing cymol with concentrated and fuming nitric acid violent
action ensues, and that by repeated distillations a crystalline
acid containing nitrogen is obtained. I must now describe
this action more in detail. The nitric acid employed should
be concentrated and fuming, otherwise there will be a con
siderable formation of another crystalline substance, which is
in its chemical character neutral, and which is not easily con
verted into nitrotoluylic acid. The properties and composi
tion of this new product will be fully considered hereafter.
The distillation must be continued as long as nitrous fumes
continue to be evolved, and the retort then allowed to cool,
upon which a considerable quantity of crystalline matter is
deposited, and on adding cold water a copious precipitate
takes place. The whole is now thrown on a filter and washed
with cold water till all the nitric acid is removed; the pre
cipitate is then digested with ammonia, the greater part
dissolves; a portion however collects at the bottom of the
vessel in the form of a red oil, which is to be separated. The
ammoniacal salt is next decomposed by hydrochloric acid, the
acid collected on a filter and well-washed with cold water, in

which it is very sparingly soluble; it is then dissolved in hot
alcohol, boiled for a few minutes with animal charcoal, and
filtered; by spontaneous evaporation the new acid crystal
lizes out in beautiful rhombic prisms of a pale yellow colour.

   II. O-382 grm, gave 0.7396 carbonic acid and 0.136 water.

   Nitrotoluylate of Baryta.-This salt was formed by adding
chloride of barium to a neutral solution of nitrotoluylate of
ammonia. A white curdy precipitate was determined, soluble
to a considerable extent in boiling water, out of which it cry
stallized on cooling in beautiful stellated tufts, having a

   Nitrotoluylate of Silver—This salt was formed by dropping
nitrate of silver into a neutral solution of nitrotoluylate of
ammonia; it fell as a white curdy mass resembling chloride
 of silver.     It is soluble to a considerable extent in hot water,
 and by long boiling becomes partially decomposed; it cry
 stallizes from a hot aqueous solution in beautiful feathery
 tufts; it is only sparingly soluble in alcohol.

     I have already mentioned that I prepared a small quantity
  of camphogene by the action of anhydrous phosphoric acid
  on camphor; in order to obtain an additional experimental
  proof of the identity of this substance with cymol, I have
  studied the action of concentrated nitric acid on it.                     I found
  it most convenient to prepare a silver salt of the acid thus
  obtained, the analysis of which yielded me the following
  numbers:—

     I. O-396 grm. gave 0.486 carbonic acid and 0.85 water.

 And by comparing them with the preceding they will be
 found sufficiently near to warrant the conclusion that the two
 carbo-hydrogens are identical. On treating the acid formed
 by the action of fuming nitric acid on camphogene with am
 monia, the same heavy oil which was observed in the case of
 cymol separated, and after a while crystallized; but from the
 small quantity of camphogene at my command, I was unable
 to procure sufficient of this substance for a comparative ex
   eriment, or to bring forward any additional proof of the
 identity of the two oils.
    Nitrotoluylate of Lime—This salt was prepared by decom
 posing nitrotoluylate of ammonia by chloride of calcium. It
 fell as a granular crystalline mass, much more soluble in water
 than the corresponding baryta salt, and crystallizing out of
 its aqueous solution in small clustering groups of oblique
 rhombic prisms; it was obtained perfectly pure by two or
 three recrystallizations.

consisted of a mixture of alcohol and hydrochloric aether; the

which all adhering undecomposed acid was removed; it was
then thrown on a filter, well-washed with cold water, and

crystallized into a mass of needles radiating from a common

   Nitrotoluylate of Ovide of Methyle.—To prepare this sub

compound. On distilling the fuming acid liquid, a consider

vinous smell: an attempt was made to purify it by distilla
tion with water; in consequence, however, of its high boiling
point, very little passed over into the receiver after two or
three hours’ distillation. It was then heated with strong
nitric acid, and after boiling for a few minutes, water added;
the aether now readily separated in clear, light yellow oily
drops: ammonia was then added to remove any nitrotoluylic
 acid that might have been present, and the oil collected on
 a watch-glass; in a few minutes it solidified into a crystalline
mass, which was dissolved in aether, filtered and recrystallized,
and then exposed for some time to the heat of the water-bath;
on cooling it solidified as before, and was then considered
sufficiently pure for analysis.

     The following salts of this acid I merely examined quali

     Nitrotoluylate of Potash is a very soluble salt crystallizing
  with great difficulty in small needles.

        Mr. Noad on the Action of Nitric Acid on Cymol. 31
    Nitrotoluylate of Soda, like the corresponding salt of tolu
ylic acid, I could not obtain in any definite crystalline form.
    Nitrotoluylate of Ammonia crystallizes out of its aqueous
solution in long needles; it is very easily decomposed, losing
the whole of its ammonia when boiled with animal charcoal.
I intend to return to the study of this salt, and hope to ob
tain from it the body which I failed to procure from nitro
toluylic aether, viz. nitrotoluylamide.
    Nitrotoluylate of Strontia.-This salt, which in appear
 ance is not to be distinguished from the corresponding baryta
 salt, was formed by dropping chloride of strontium into neu
 tral nitrotoluylate of ammonia: it is rather more soluble in
 boiling water than the baryta compound, and the crystals de
 posited on cooling are rather larger.
     Nitrotoluylate of Copper.—On adding solution of sulphate
 of copper to perfectly neutral nitrotoluylate of ammonia a
 basic salt is formed. I have not yet obtained a definite cop
 per salt of this acid.
 Action of a mixture of Sulphuric and Nitric Acids on Nitro

     When nitrobenzol is boiled repeatedly with the strongest
  nitric acid it loses an atom of hydrogen, in the place of which
  another atom of hyponitric acid enters. The transformation
  proceeds very slowly. The new substance (dinitrobenzol) is
  however obtained very speedily, as Drs. Muspratt and Hof
  mann” have shown, by dropping benzol or nitrobenzol into
  a mixture composed of equal parts of fuming nitric acid
  and concentrated sulphuric acid as long as the liquid re
  mains homogeneous. This method has lately been employed
  with great success by M. Cahours, who, amongst many
  other interesting products, has obtained trinitranisic acid,

   after digesting the acid with the mixture for several days
  the anticipated transformation had not taken place, the

 luylic acids have established the composition of these two
 compounds in a perfectly satisfactory manner, there still re
 mained one experiment to be made in order to prove that
 toluylic acid occupies in the toluyle series the same place which
 benzoic acid has in the benzoyle series; in order to prove
 that the acids analysed are really the true toluylic and nitro
 toluylic acids, and not merely bodies having the same com
 position, being isomeric with them: this experiment was to
 attempt the transformation of toluylic acid into toluol under
 the same circumstances by which benzoic acid becomes con
 verted into benzol.    I devoted the acid from four ounces of
 cymol to this experiment, and by distillation with caustic
 baryta, which I found to answer much better than lime, I
obtained some grammes of a beautiful limpid colourless liquid,
 having the precise smell of the carbo-hydrogen sought for.
 By distillation from a fresh portion of baryta the oil was ren.
dered perfectly anhydrous; in this state its boiling-point was
taken. It began to boil at 109°, the thermometer gradually
rose to 110°-5, barometer Om:763 (30:1 inches).
   It was burned in the ordinary manner with oxide of cop

   The remainder of the carbo-hydrogen was converted into
nitrotoluol by the action of fuming nitric acid : the well
washed oily fluid was then dissolved in alcohol, saturated with
ammoniacal gas and treated repeatedly with sulphuretted
hydrogen, the whole being distilled after each saturation with
hydrosulphuric acid, to facilitate the deposition of the sul
phur; the dark red solution was evaporated to expel the al
cohol, water added, and then submitted to distillation with

potash, in addition to ammonia and aqueous vapour, a yellow
oil passed into the receiver, which did not however solidify
on cooling, probably in consequence of the presence of am
monia; it was therefore saturated with oxalic acid, evapo
rated to dryness in the water-bath, redissolved in boiling
alcohol and filtered; on cooling, oxalate of toluidine sepa
rated in fine white needles, these were washed, dissolved in
boiling water, and decomposed by potash; the toluidine,
which separated in colourless oily drops, was taken up by
aether, on the evaporation of which it remained in the form
of a crystalline mass. Although the nature of this substance
was sufficiently obvious, nevertheless, to remove all doubt
respecting it, I converted it into the double platinum salt by
mixing it with hydrochloric acid and bichloride of platinum.
The beautiful orange-yellow spangular mass was washed with
aether and dried on the water-bath. Its analysis gave the
following result:—
   0.930 grm. gave by ignition 0.292 grim. of platinum =
31:398 per cent.                                   -

   By the production of toluylic and nitrotoluylic acids there
is not only filled up a gap which has hitherto existed in the
toluyle series, but an important step has been made in the
series of acids to which I have alluded at the commencement
of this paper, of which indeed at the present time a few scat
tered members only are known. The following table presents
a general view of some of the most important members of the
different groups, and exhibits the gaps which remain to be
filled up by future experiments.

   Mr. C. Brooke on a remarkable Magnetic Disturbance. 35
   The preceding table shows that there are indeed a great
number of substances still to be discovered. In the first series
it will be seen that as yet we have only one member, semi
naphthalidine”, the base corresponding to aniline and toluidine,
and obtained by Zinin in a very curious reaction of sulphide
of ammonium on dinitronaphthalol. The second series is best
known; it is closely connected with the indigo series by sali
cylic acid, nitrosalicylic acid and aniline. As however the
term of indigo is as yet not represented in any of the other
families I have omitted to connect them.          The third is the
toluyle series, which has become enriched by the present in
vestigation with two of the principal terms: of the following
no term whatever is known.      The next contains a series of
interesting compounds arising from oil of cumin, and of the
last group we have at present only cymol. In a future paper
I hope to introduce some of the substances deriving from
this carbo-hydrogen.
   This investigation was conducted in the laboratory of the
Royal College of Chemistry, and I cannot bring it to a con
clusion without acknowledging the great obligation I am
under to Professor Hofmann for the constant advice and assist
ance which he afforded me during its prosecution, and ex
pressing my warmest thanks to him for his valuable instruc
tions in the method of conducting organic investigations
generally.

DURING         this period, which was marked by the appear
      ance of the unusually splendid Aurora Borealis described
in the November Number of this Journal, a greater amount of
consecutive disturbance of the magnetic instruments took place
at the Royal Observatory than has ever been noticed since
the establishment of the magnetic department.
   A continuous record of the great and incessant changes of
declination and horizontal force has been obtained by the self
registering photographic apparatus designed by the writer,
and described in the Philosophical Transactions, part 1, 1847.
The vertical element of magnetic force was not subjected to
any corresponding amount of variation. By permission of the
Astronomer Royal, a fac-simile of one of the most remarkable
portions of the register of the declination magnet is annexed,

36 Mr. C. Brooke on a remarkable Magnetic Disturbance.
as a favourable specimen of the present state of magnetic
registration.
    The scale of time is marked on the photographic base-line,
and is about 1:2 inch to one hour; the hours denote Göt
tingen mean astronomical time. The scale of angular space
is 5 inches to 1* in azimuth, and is measured in a direction
perpendicular to the base-line, the position    of which corre
sponds nearly to 23° 41' of W. declination.
    During 22", and 234 the W. declination      ranged between
22° 17' and 23° 37', but the greatest change    is that which is
represented in Plate I. This comprises the      variations of de
 clination from 24d 11h to 22h.   The declination is observed to
 decrease rapidly from 23° 14' at about 11h 40m, to 21° 58' at
 about 12* 5"; and after several considerable fluctuations, to
 increase to 23° 35' at about 13h 13", indicating a variation of
 1°42' in little more than one hour.    The breaches of conti
 nuity in the line during these large excursions, indicate that
 the magnet has not rested at any one point long enough to
 mark the paper. The least time during which the tracing
 pencil of light will produce a visible impression is probably
 about 4*.
     Between 16" and 19" the excursions of the magnet are so
 incessant and considerable, that periodic observations, even at
 the least periods at which an observer could continuously
 record them, would scarcely give an adequate idea of the pro
 gress of the disturbance. This vibratory movement of the
 magnet probably corresponds with the “peculiar mechanical
 agitation ” mentioned by Captain Lefroy in an account of the
 disturbance of the 24th of September at Toronto, published
  in the November Number of this Journal, and is quite distinct
  from mere oscillation of the magnet about its mean place. The
  secondary vibrations accompanying the larger excursions of
  the magnet are very well shown between 18h and 21h. These
  have very rarely been observed in the photographs thus ob
  tained during the last two years. They would appear to
  indicate the simultaneous existence of two distinct disturbing
  causes; of which that producing the larger and more gradual
  excursions is far more frequently in operation.
     The register has been disconnected at 18h for the conve
  nience of the Plate; and the register of the bifilar magneto
  meter, obtained on the same paper, in order to avoid confusion,
  has been altogether omitted.    It may however be remarked,
  that at the time when the variation of horizontal force was
  most considerable, amounting to more than one-tenth of the
  whole force, the northern hemisphere was brilliantly illuminated
  with coruscations, as described by Mr. Glaisher, and at this
  period the disturbance of the declination was not proportion

ably great; but shortly afterwards, when the streamers shot
up to the zenith, and the arch of light was formed, the great
changes of declination took place, the disturbance of horizontal
force being at the same period comparatively inconsiderable.
   After the period represented in the Plate, the disturbances
were diminished both in amount and frequency; and after
25° 12h they entirely ceased.
V. Note of the occurrence of a Deposit of native Earthy Car
 bonate of Manganese in Ireland. By Sir Robert KANE*.
Tº: place where this substance has been found is in the
      townland of Glandree, parish of Tulla, in the eastern
portion of the county of Clare. The precise locality is near
the top of a mountain, about 900 feet above the level of the
sea, on the side of a new road connecting Scariff with Gort.
   The rock of the locality is the old red sandstone, from under
which the clay-slate rises close by. The surface is, however,
very much covered by boulders of sandstone and by bog, and
broken into hummocks, separating little basins, in which de
posits of marl, very rich in lime and of much value for agri
cultural purposes, are usually found. The extensive employ
ment of these marls made me very anxious to find additional
localities of them; and I took advantage of a new road bein
opened through the district during last year by the Board of
Works, to have collected for me specimens of all such materials
as in any way resembled marl, as could be found in the cut
tings along the line of road. Amongst them, and from the
precise locality already stated, was one fawn-coloured earthy
matter which effervesced strongly with acids, especially when
heated, and which, on more exact examination, turned out to
be not carbonate of lime, but carbonate of manganese.
   This substance forms a layer of several inches thick, lying
under a stratum of bog of about two feet thick, and resting on
the partially decomposed surface of the underlying sandstone
and slate rocks. It is of a brownish-<U+017F>awn colour generally;
but the parts that are quite free from admixture of peat are
much lighter, and indeed undistinguishable in colour from the
carbonate of manganese artificially prepared. On being dried
carefully, it is found not to be quite amorphous, but to consist
of nodules of a purer packed in a mass of less pure material:
but these nodules are so friable and soft, that few of them now
remain in the specimens that have been deposited in our mu
SeumS.

was found to be—

    The carbonate of manganese is known to be one of the
 rarest forms in which that metal occurs; and so far as I am
aware, it has been hitherto found only in a compact and cry
stallized form.    The condition of the substance now described
may therefore possibly be quite new to science; but certainly
it has not been found constituting a kind of marly deposit
spread extensively under bog, nor is it known at all as an Irish
mineral.
    It is highly probable that the study of the action to which
this material is subjected under its native condition, may
throw some light on the theory of the impregnating and ce
menting of rocks by the peroxide, and indeed perhaps to the
mode of generation of the native earthy peroxides of manga
nese. I shall however not at present enter on that question,
but merely indicate to philosophical geologists the fact of this
mineral certainly influencing, by its chemical actions, the
rocky masses with which it is associated.

VI. On the Great Symmetrical Barometric Wave, November
   1847, and other important undulations. By William Rad
   CLIFF BIRT *.
IN     the engraving illustrating this article (p. 45), fig. 2 indi
     cates the form of the great symmetrical wave of November,
as it passed London in the present autumn. It is placed under
the great wave of November 1846, fig. 1, for the purpose of
exhibiting the points of similarity and difference. The most
casual glance of the eye will detect a considerable similarity
with a much greater range in 1847; also a larger development
of the individual waves.
   In 1846 the wave commenced on the 2nd, culminated on
the 9th, and terminated on the 17th.
   In 1847 the wave commenced on the 8th, culminated on the
14th, and terminated on the 21st.
   Previous to offering some remarks on the last return of the
great symmetrical wave, it will be desirable to solicit the
attention of the reader to the type of the barometric oscillations
during the middle portion of November, as ascertained in
                  * Communicated by the Author.

               Barometric Wave, November 1847.                  39
1845*; viz. “that during fourteen days in November, more
or less equally disposed about the middle of the month, the
oscillations of the barometer exhibit a remarkably symmetrical
character; that is to say, the fall succeeding the transit of the
maximum or highest reading is to a great extent similar to
the preceding rise. This rise and fall is not continuous or
unbroken; in three out of four of the occasions on which it has
been observed, it has been found to consist of five distinct ele
vations. * *** At the setting in of the great November wave
the barometer is generally low, sometimes below twenty-nine
inches.    This depression is succeeded by two well-marked
undulations, varying from one to two days in duration. The
central undulation, which also forms the apex of the great
wave, is of larger extent, occupying from three to five days;
when this has passed, two smaller undulations corresponding
to those at the commencement of the wave, make their appear
ance, and at the close of the last the wave terminates.”        On
the last two returns, the great wave presented features that
require the preceding type to be somewhat modified. The
symmetrical character on both occasions was distinct, but the
crown or central apex was not the highest. In 1846, the wave
on the posterior slope, which is bisected by the last vertical
line in the engraving, was the highest at the northern and north
western stations; and on the last return the subordinate waves on
both the anterior and posterior slopes were higher than the cen
tral. With this exception, there appears to be nothing to mili
tate against the general accuracy of the type as above expressed.
It appears that on all occasions on which the writer has ob
served the great symmetrical wave, it has been completely
separated from all the preceding and succeeding barometric
movements,      an individuality has been attributed to it in con
sequence of this separation; and the movements between the
epochs marking its commencement and termination have more
or less been referable to the foregoing type. On most occa
sions the barometric movements preceding the great wave have
occurred at a considerable altitude, while those succeeding it
have been observed at lower altitudes.
   The individuality of the great symmetrical wave consists
more in the character of the barometric movements than either
in the form, as given by the curve, or the absolute measurement
of the atmospheric pressure, as observed by means of the ba
rometer.     Both the curve and the altitude of the mercurial
column vary very considerably, while the symmetrical cha
racter is much more constant.         This consists (in most cases)
in the initial and terminal minima being very distinct, and the
inflexions of the curve as the barometer approaches its terminal
                  * Phil. Mag. S. 3, vol. xxix. p. 357.

40         Mr. W. R. Birt on the Great Symmetrical
minimum, being to a great extent similar to those marking
the barometric rise to the central apex. From this it follows
that great difficulty must exist in the observation of the wave.
If, for instance, any particular curve is expected to return,
the observer in most cases will be disappointed; he will also
meet with disappointment if he expects that on certain days
the barometer will attain certain altitudes. The surest way
is to prepare a paper of engraved squares, and for a few days
before the expected return of the wave, to project the altitudes
of the barometer in a curve. While this is going on, uncer
tainty will often attach to the proceeding until the wave is just
approaching its termination, when the symmetry will become
apparent, provided the observer is situated near the locality
of greatest symmetry. Should he be removed even a short
distance in some directions from the area or line of greatest
symmetry, the curve will not be fully referable to the foregoing
type: one portion may be thrown higher than another, with
which at the point of greatest symmetry it is of equal altitude.
It is very desirable to mark out distinctly the localities of these
departures from symmetry, and to determine the directions in
which the greatest earcursions take place; especially as another
important feature of the wave appears to be intimately con
nected with them, viz. the barometric range from the lowest
minimum to the highest maximum, which increases in some
directions very considerably. In order therefore to observe
the wave satisfactorily, and to be certain of its return, three
features require to be fully apprehended:—the symmetrical
character of the curve, as expressed in the foregoing type, with
the modification alluded to; the departure from this symmetry
in certain localities, which may be noticed in barometric move
ments, evidently referable, by the nature of the curve and the
period elapsing between the initial and terminal minima, to
the great wave; and the barometric range during this period,
which will be found to vary in certain directions.
    The reader will readily see from this enunciation of phae
nomena appertaining to the great symmetrical barometric
 wave, that the phases of the wave, as exhibited at any given
locality, bear a considerable analogy to certain phaenomena
 presented during a solar eclipse. The line of terrestrial sur
face on which the barometric wave presents the most perfect
 symmetry, corresponds to the line of country on, which the
 eclipse is central; and the spot at which the wave is observed
 to be most strongly developed, may be regarded as correspond
 ing to the spot at which the sun is eclipsed centrally on the
 meridian. This line of greatest symmetry, referring to the
 barometric wave, extends a considerable distance over central
 Europe; on each side the symmetry is departed from, some

                Barometric Wave, November 1847.                          41
points, as we have before observed, being thrown higher than
others with which they were on a level. This displacement
presents very regular gradations, and may be considered as
corresponding to the deviations from totality or annularity
observed during the progress of a solar eclipse at stations
removed from the line at which it is central.            The further the
observer is situated from the central line, the smaller the eclipse,
and the greater the deviation either from totality or annularity.
In like manner, the further the observer is removed from the
line of greatest symmetry of the barometric wave, the greater
will be the deviations from symmetry in the curve representing
the observations. The analogy just noticed not only holds
good for one eclipse and one barometric wave, but as the same
eclipse presents at the same stations different phases on the
occasions of its successive returns, sometimes appearing only
as a slight obscuration of the solar disc, at others as a great
and central eclipse, so the barometric wave presents a different
phase on each of its returns; the curve representing the ob
servations during its transit exhibits a different form, the sym
metrical arrangement of its parts constituting its distinguishing
characteristic *. From the assemblage of curves representing
the great symmetrical wave on its successive returns, the lines
of greatest symmetry appertaining to each return may be de
termined, and from these the mean line of greatest symmetry
may be traced over Europe. It will be more difficult to trace
in connexion with this line mean lines of deviation on each
side, owing to the erratic character of the subordinate waves
forming the in<U+017F>terions of the symmetrical curve; but this may
be done with great ease on the occasion of each successive
return, provided there are a sufficient number of stations of
observation judiciously placed over the surface of Europe,
from which such a chart may be constructed. In the present
instance we may take the two apices of the 10th and 18th. It
is highly probable that at some station to the south-east of
London both attained the same altitude: this station would be
at least near to, if it was not, the station of greatest symmetry.
The departure from symmetry would not only be indicated,
but the numerical value of it given by the depression of one
apex below the other. Thus at London this value is '051;
 but at Weston in Somersetshire it is 161, and at Halifax in
 Yorkshire it appears to be 250; and there is very little doubt
 that it will be found to increase, especially towards the north
 west. When these values of deviation from symmetry are
 determined year after year, and combined so as to obtain the

    My attention has been called by Mr. Chalmers of Weston
super-Mare, Somersetshire, to whom I am indebted for the
readings in the fourth column of the foregoing table, –to the
similarity existing between the great wave of 1798 and 1847
at London. The observations in 1798 were made by Luke
Howard, Esq. A chart of the barometric movements during
the entire year, illustrates an article on the influence of the sun
and moon on the barometer, published in the Philosophical
Magazine for 1800. In this chart the movements during No
vember are seen to be greatly in accordance with the type as
expressed above. Fig. 3 in the engraving, illustrating this
article, is the projection of these movements on a similar scale
to the curves of 1846 and 1847. The similarity between the
curves of 1847 and 1798 is very considerable. The vertical
lines passing through the principal points of these curves
clearly indicate that the epochs of these points in 1798 and
 1847, especially the two interior minima and the two exterior
maxima, differed from each other but an hour or two : in this
respect the resemblance is very close. The horizontal lines
are intended to show the deviation from symmetry, supposing
the two interior minima, being at the same altitude, to repre
sent perfect symmetry. [The equal altitudes of the two exterior
maxima is a much better general expression of this element.]
The highest horizontal line in fig. 1, just touching the second
interior minimum, indicates a reading of 30.299; the lowest

horizontal line in this figure just touches the first interior
minimum value 30-198, diff. "101. The same lines in fig. 2
are respectively 30, 115 and 30.062, diff -053, and in fig. 3
29.650 and 29'600, diff. '050: it is likely the true difference
was less. The above numbers relative to fig. 3 are those
taken from the curve of 1798.          It is to be remarked that the
second interior mininium in that year was the lowest. The
principal difference between the curves of 1798 and 1847
consists in the greater elevation of the central portion of the
curve of 1798. The curve of 1846 appears to exhibit the
greatest deviation from symmetry.
   The preceding remarks refer more particularly to the phase
presented by the curve in any given locality, and also to the
deviations in certain directions from a well-recognised type,
embodying the essential characteristics of the curve during a
definite period; and although this period is variable within
certain limits, yet the similarity of the curves (such similarity
consisting, as before noticed, in a peculiarity of character, by
which the individuality of the curve is readily recognised)
appears to be confirmatory of the idea suggested by the ob
servations of 1845, namely, that we have obtained the type of
the barometric oscillations during themiddle portion of November.
The occurrence of the curve in the year 1798, its appearance
at Dublin in twelve out of seventeen years’ observations be
tween 1829 and 1845, together with the regularity of its return
at London from 1841 to 1847, must certainly place this matter
beyond a mere hope, as expressed in 1845, and lead to the
conviction that a careful study of these curves will enable us
to make out some of their laws.          At all events, the attentive
meteorological observer has already been so far successful as
to recognise the last in its earliest stage, confirming, to a cer
tain extent, the view of Sir John Herschel, expressed in his
 Report on Meteorological Reductions*, 1843. “And it would
be no small meteorological discovery, if, by the study of the
character and progress of barometrical fluctuations, we could
 either make out any law of the greater ones which would
enable us even roughly to predict them, or any peculiarity in
their physiognomy by which we could recognise them in their
earlier stages, as by this we might possibly be led to the pre
diction of great storms.”
    This remark of Sir John's clearly indicates the two direc
tions in which this interesting study is to be prosecuted,—the
characters of the barometric fluctuations and also their pro
gress.    The reader will find each of these branches amplified

in my Report on Atmospheric Waves, presented to the British
Association in 1846*. “First, the determination of the phases
of the larger undulations, with the smaller secondary waves
superposed on their slopes, forming the types of the various
seasons of the year; and second, the absolute extent of each
atmospheric wave in space, the direction of its crest, its am
plitude in miles, the altitude of its crest above, and the depres
sion of its troughs below the surface of general repose of the
atmosphere, the place of its formation, the manner in which
it is propagated, the precise direction and extent of its motion,
the force with which it is translated from place to place, and
the locality of its final extinction.”
    In addition to the determination of the type of the middle
portion of November, now generally known as the great sym
metrical barometric wave of November, we are, I apprehend,
on the eve of ascertaining the type for November during its
whole extent.      I have now before me a chart of the barometric
movements at Halifax during the last November; and if I
mistake not, the characters of the entire oscillations closely
agree with those of preceding Novembers. The annual de
pression on or about the 28th f is most distinctly marked; and
the opposite character, that of a high barometer at the com
mencement of the month, is as distinct. 1842 presented us
with an elevated mercurial column at the commencement of
 November: the same order of things occurred in 1845 and
 1846; and there is a high probability that the movements
preceding the great wave occur at a much greater altitude
than those succeeding it. Figs. 4 and 5 are curves of the
annual depression on or about the 28th, as it passed London
in 1847 and 1798.            In 1798 the epoch was a day earlier.
 The horizontal line in fig. 4 represents an altitude of 30.000,
 in fig. 5 its value is 29'500. It is worthy of remark that this
depression in 1847 was succeeded by an enormous wave,
 which passed its maximum on the night between the 1st
and 2nd of December, value 30-397.             This maximum forms
the December boundary of the depression of the 28th, see
fig. 4. Upon the passage of this maximum the barometer
commenced falling rapidly, and continued thus falling, with
one or two interruptions, until early on the morning of
the 7th, when at 5:35 A.M. the reading of the barometer at
London was 28:573. Thus the depressions of the 28th of
November and the 7th of December form the anterior and
posterior troughs of this immense wave, its altitude from the

 46          Mr. W. R. Birt on the Great Symmetrical
 posterior trough to the apex being 1824 inch”. The depres
 sion of the 7th of December appears to have been an extra
ordinary depression, somewhat of the character of the depres
sions on December 25, 1810, and 1821. (See Phil. Mag.
vol. xxx. p. 18.) The vast magnitude of this wave, its ampli
tude in time, stretching over nine days, fifteen hours and twenty
minutes, during the whole of which the barometer was rapidly
changing, the acuminated character of its troughs and crest,
connected with the unusual epoch of its posterior trough, will
render it a most interesting subject for investigation. The
phase, as exhibited at London, is so well-marked, that every
deviation from it in other localities can be readily ascertained,
the depression of the December minimum below that of No
vember clearly and distinctly assigned, and, I apprehend, with
such precision, that a chart of deviation from symmetry—
regarding perfect symmetry as indicated by the equal altitudes
of the two minima—easily constructed, and the rate of pro
gress and direction of motion correctly deduced from the
epochs of maximum and minima.               I am not aware that an
instance has fallen under my notice so suitable for carrying on
the inquiry with success, as the wave which transited on the
1st of December 1847.
    In taking up the investigation of this wave with an especial
view to the second branch of the inquiry, as noticed above, it
must be borne in mind that the curve of the barometric move
ments from November 28 to December 7 is not likely to exhibit
a section of an atmospheric wave, properly so called. It has
already been determined that “the barometric curve, including
a complete rise and fall at any one station, is not the curve
resulting from the transit of any one wave; it does not repre
sent the form of any reality in nature; but it does represent,
and is an exponent of, the effects resulting from the contem
poraneous transits of waves, or systems of wavest.” The first
step is to ascertain the absolute difference of pressure existing
between any two or more stations f. For this purpose all the
observations must be corrected and reduced to the level of the
sea, and then the slopes of the individual waves will become
apparent, and the directions of the crests and troughs deter
mined. From such an investigation, some notion may be
   * The true altitude of this wave, as determined from the Greenwich
observations, appears to have been 1855 inch ; the epoch of the minimum
of the 7th was 2.35 A.M., value 28 381; and the amplitude rather less than
here stated.

formed of the vast extent these waves generally cover. The
transference of the points or lines of maxima and minima, as
existing in space and as determined by this mode of discussion,
will give the directions in which the waves are moving, and also
the rate of their progress. A new field of view opens upon the
mind in thus studying barometric phaenomena. The types
forming the first branch of the inquiry become inlets to the
knowledge of movements of vast extent, and of realities, which
although unseen by us, produce the most terrific commotions
in the atmosphere. The wave of which we have been speaking
has not passed over the United Kingdom, nor has it swept the
shores of sea-girt Britain, without leaving melancholy traces
of its progress. Could we ascend in our inquiries from the con
templation of the rotatory storm, as determined by Redfield and
Reid, to the production of such storm by the crossing of two
large long waves, as suggested by Sir John Herschel in his
Report on Meteorological Reductions, from which we have
already quoted, an important step would be gained. Sir John
states”, “There is certainly one point of view in which some of
the phaenomena of revolving gales would seem capable of ex
planation * * **, and in which they would become traced up,
not to “funnel-shaped revolving depressions’ in the nature of
water-spouts, but simply to the crossing of two large long
waves running in different directions. The way in which a
rotary movement in an ellipse or circle, or in some other partly
oval and partly rectilineal figure, may result from the combi
nation of two rectilineal movements of advance and recess,
will easily be understood by the analogy of the circular and
elliptic polarization of light, where rectilinear movements of .
the aetherial molecules are conceived to be similarly combined.
Some features in such storms are strongly in harinony with
this view; viz. the fact, that in them the direction of the wind
at a given locality never makes more than one rotation, and
not always that; and that in the central line of the storm’s
progress, there is a simple and sudden reversal of direction.
On the other hand, it must not be concealed that some features
militate against it; for instance, the fact that such gales are
stated always to “revolve” in one direction; whereas on this
view of their origin, the changes of wind ought to be in oppo
site directions, on opposite sides of the medial line.”
    In an article which the writer communicated to Mr. Lowe
of Highfield House near Nottingham, and which is inserted
 in that gentleman's work on Atmospheric Phaenomena, an
 attempt has been made to exhibit the connexion, which there
   * Reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
1843, p. 100.

 48         Mr. W. R. Birt on the Great Symmetrical
is great reason to believe exists, between the atmospheric wave
and the rotatory gale: the direction of the wind in both cases
is the same. With respect to the atmospheric wave, it is shown
in my Third Report”, “ that the direction of the aérial current
on the anterior slope (the barometer rising) is at right angles
to the axis of translation directed towards the left-hand; while
on the posterior slope (the barometer falling) it is the reverse,
still at right angles to the axis of translation, but directed
towards the right-hand.” In the article alluded to, it is shown
that the same holds good in the case of the revolving storm.
As the first half of the storm approaches, the wind rushes by
the observer towards the right-hand with a falling barometer;
as the second half of the storm passes off, the direction of the
wind is reversed,—it rushes past towards the left-hand with a
rising barometer. The great point, however, is to establish
the existence of a rotatory storm in connexion with the cross
ing of two large waves. To this there appears at present a con
siderable drawback, on account of the immense size of the
waves, and the great dearth of observations in certain localities
and directions, especially on the surface of the ocean, which
prevents the clear apprehension of the waves in the complete
totality of their existence. This might be obviated to a great
extent by the establishment of observations at all civil, military
and naval stations, and on board all Her Majesty's vessels,
government steamers, merchants' ships, &c.; and if these ob
servations were collected and preserved in an office appointed
for their reception, where they might undergo a searching and
rigorous discussion, our knowledge of these movements would
speedily be greatly increased, and their connexion or non
connexion with the rotary gale finally determined. It appears
from a letter addressed by Prof. Loomis to Colonel Sabine,
and inserted in a late Number of this Magazine, that an ex
tensive system of meteorological observations is likely to be
set on foot in the United States, provided the co-operation of
the British Government can be obtained. “What I propose,”
says the Professor, “is that at every government station a re
gister should be kept for a period of one, two, or three years.”
Should this plan be carried out for Canada, it would greatly
contribute to the complete solution of any problem that might
be suggested, at once to make the system general, and include
every portion of the terrestrial surface subject to the authority
of the British Government, and obtain observations from every
portion of the oceanic surface accessible to our vessels. Under
these circumstances, any results obtained from the American

observations would receive considerable elucidation from ob
servations made on the Atlantic, the West Indies, and the
 western shores of Europe.
   I cannot close these remarks without referring to the pre
servation of H.M.S. Vernon, last July, in consequence of a
knowledge of the law of storms, by which she was enabled to
avoid a typhoon while sailing in the China seas. In the Illus
trated News of November 20th, a letter with a diagram is in
serted, exhibiting the altered course of the ship to allow the
typhoon to pass. In introducing the subject, the writer ob
serves, “that among the many things unseen by which we are
surrounded, high winds are subjected to fixed laws, affecting
their motions and durations, and directed in their courses by
the same unerring hand that regulates in wisdom the more
visible things of creation.” A note is also added, which we
give entire. [“The “circular theory of storms’ is strongly
recommended to the notice of sailors; and they will find much
assistance also from daily observations of the barometer, and of
the dry- and wet-bulb thermometer. We will take this oppor
tunity of recommending meteorologists more fully to investi
gate the subject of the theory of storms. The writer of this
has been in a locality where the air has been in a calm state,
while at the same time (as he has learned from letters addressed
to him) a gale of wind has been blowing around him, the di
rection of the wind in some places being due east, in others
due west, and blowing from different points at other places at
the same time.”—J. G.] In the above extracts we find the
results of a practical application of the knowledge derived
from the investigation of such subjects as we have been treat
ing of; and if Sir John Herschel's suggestion is correct, that
the circular storm results from the crossing of two large atmo
spheric waves, then not only is it desirable that meteorologists
should more fully investigate the theory of storms, but they
should extend their inquiries, and look beyond the storm to
those vast movements which sweep over the entire continent
of Europe, stretching from its extreme south-western to its
extreme northern point, and follow them as they majestically
roll over the surfaces of our oceans and continents, and
endeavour to detect in the points of their intersections the
gyrative tornados which every spring and autumn visit our
coasts, and spread devastation and death wherever their
destructive influence is felt. A knowledge of the laws of
atmospheric waves must greatly contribute to our knowledge
of the circular storm.

 Jerrard) is here shown to be connected with an important
 department of analytical geometry. It is capable of being
 performed with extraordinary facility—at least in one sense.
    Let
                w”-- Alu"+ A*--Agu’-- A4u + As=0
 be the general equation of the fifth degree. Also let

and represent the transformed equation in v by
                v'-- Bºw"+ B.U.’-- Bºv”-- Biv -- Bº-0;
then this last equation may be put under the form

we shall have transformed the given equation in u into the
following:

         Mr. Cockle on Equations of the Fifth Degree.           51
   Since these conditions are equations involving three unde
termined quantities a, y and x, they may with propriety be
denoted by
                           f(x, y, z)=0,   . . . . . . (2)
and
                          V(x,y, z)=0 . . . . . . (3.)
respectively; and, since two dimensions of a, y, z appear in
(2.), and three in (3.), the former condition will in general
represent a surface of the second, and the latter a surface of
the third order.
   I have in this work (S. 3. vol. xxviii. pp. 132, 133) already
adverted to my own process for reducing equations of the fifth
degree to a trinomial form. With what facility such reduc
tion may be performed, at least so far as the decomposition of
(2.) into linear factors is concerned, will be seen on referring
to my papers on analytical geometry in the last and in the
current volume of the Mechanics' Magazine.             -
   It would not be difficult to show that when (2.) represents
a hyperbolic paraboloid, a hyperboloid of one sheet, a cone,
a cylinder, a pair of planes, a single plane, or a single straight
line, then (2.) and (3.) can be satisfied simultaneously by real
values of ar, y, and z. In this case C, and C, will be real.
   When (2.) represents a hyperboloid of two sheets, an ellip
tic paraboloid, an ellipsoid, a point, or an unreal surface, (2.)
and (3.) cannot be so satisfied, and C, and Cs will be in
general both unreal.
   Should C, and C, or either of them, prove to be unreal
under the above assumption for v, it might be a question
whether both those quantities would not take real values under
some other assumption, such as
                     v=au"+yu°4-zu?--u”;
but I am very strongly of opinion that they would not, and I
am inclined to think that the reality of C, and Cs depends
upon the nature of the roots of the given equation in u. [There
is perhaps some analogy between the question before us and
that of the irreducible case in cubic equations.] If this be
the correct view, no change of process can affect the final re
sult; and we may apply, not only to Mr. Jerrard's, but to the
above, and to every possible method of effecting this transfor
mation, the remark of Sir W. R. Hamilton, that the coeffi
cients of the transformed equation will often be unreal when
those of the given one are real.
   II. This appears to be the proper place for explaining an
error into which I fell at page 132 of a previous volume of this
work (vol. xxviii. just cited).  E. there omitted to notice that

without making the l’s vanish, we have the condition
                               n–2 > 1,
or n=4 at least; and Y may be of such a form as to render
it necessary that n be not less than 5, which is the case in the
transformation above considered. As to this, see page 395 of
the last-mentioned volume, where I have pointed out the error
here discussed, but not in such a manner as to make the fore
going explanation superfluous.
    III. As connected with, and by way of concluding, this
part of the subject, let
                                   w/

 Now let                      w=x(D)
be a solution of (4.), then
                               D=x(w)
 will also be a solution: by combining these solutions we ob
 tain the functional equation
                   2.”(w)=w, or x*(D)=D;
 and the same result might be obtained from any trinomial
 equation of the fifth degree—as I have already noticed (vol.
 xxviii. p. 133, note).
    IV. At pages 190, 191 of the same (28th) volume of the
 present work, there occur errors resembling those at pages

         Mr. Cockle on Equations of the Fifth Degree.             53
132, 133, and which may be corrected in a similar manner.
For this purpose let

is only true for a = n, that is to say, for the root a...   But the
two quantities l' and l' may be taken so as to render this rela

the roots. Let this other value be n-1, then (5) will hold for
the root an-i, and we have
                                 1,–1=0;  -
so that it becomes necessary in the group (2) to write la–2 in
stead of 1,–1, and consequently to change (a.) into

of the additional difficulty occasioned by the occurrence of
critical functions) be solved by means of the processes under
our consideration, although those processes enable us to effect
certain transformations of equations of degrees higher than the
fifth (vol. xxviii. p. 395).

    Postscript.—I venture to hope that the time is now ap
proaching when we may expect a discussion of the physico
mathematical problem connected with the Spheroidal Condi

of making an attempt, however humble, at its solution; and
I would add that the enunciation of it, contained in a letter
(signed S.X.) which I addressed to Mr. Taylor from Great
Oakley some two years since, and which will be found at
pp. 568,569 of vol. xxvii. of this work, may be advantageously

VIII. On the Analysis of Hop-Ash.           By HENRY WATTs,
   B.A., Assistant in the Laboratory of University College,
   London.*
THE hops, the ash of which          forms the subject of the fol
      lowing analysis, were of the variety called “the Grape.”
They were grown last year at Hawkhurst in Kent, on a good
soil, being a stiff clay loam resting on the Hastings sand.
The produce was 12 cwt. per acre, which is rather above the
average produce of the district, the quantity being ascertained
after the hops had been taken from the kiln, cooled and
bagged.
   The hops in this state lost 11, per cent. by drying at 212°.
    1000 grs. of the hops in the same state burnt in an earthen
crucible yielded in four experiments, 62, 65, 67 and 64 grs.
of ash. The mean of these is 64:5; hence the quantity of
ash is about 6% per cent.
   The appearance of the ash was highly ferruginous.
                       Qualitative Analysis.
    A portion of the ash was exhausted with water, and the
soluble and insoluble portions separately examined.
    The soluble portion of the ash was found by the usual re
agents to contain carbonic, sulphuric, phosphoric and silicic
acids and chlorime. The bases were potash and a little soda.
    The insoluble portion, in like manner, was found to con
tain lime, magnesia, alumina and peroxide of iron, in combi
nation with carbonic and phosphoric acids, together with a
considerable quantity of siliceous sandy matter insoluble in
acids, and a little unburnt charcoal. This after ignition was
further examined by fusion with carbonate of soda, and found
to consist of silica, with traces of alumina, oxide of iron and
lime. . The presence of phosphate of alumina being unex
 pected, great pains were taken in this part of the analysis to
 place the matter beyond question.                    -
                       Quantitative Analysis.
         A. Proportions of soluble and insoluble matter.
    1. 100 grs. of the ash (recently ignited) were boiled in
water. The insoluble portion was collected on a weighed fil
ter and thoroughly washed.
       Insoluble matter dried at 300° weighed 64.72 grs.
       Therefore soluble matter            ...   35'28 ...

            Mr. Watts on the Analysis of Hop-Ash.            55
   2. 50 grs. of ash treated in the same manner gave—
           Insoluble matter=31.87 =63-74 per cent.
           Soluble matter   = 18°13 =36'26      ...
   3. These results differ by about 1 per cent.; the difference
probably arises from the slow decomposition of an alkaline
silicate by continued digestion in hot water.
   Taking the mean of the two results, we have—
          Matter insoluble in water=64'23 per cent.
             ...  soluble      ...    =35'77    ...
                  B. Matter soluble in water.
   I. Acids and Chlorine.—l. Alkaline liquid from 100 grs. of
ash (A. 1) concentrated by evaporation to the bulk of 1000
water grain-measures, then divided into four equal portions.
   2. First portion decomposed by sulphuric acid in flask-ap
paratus gave 0.54 gr. of carbonic acid=2-16 per cent.
   3. Second portion treated with chloride of barium and ni
tric acid gave 6:03 grs. of sulphate of baryta: therefore 2.07
grs. of sulphuric acid=8-28 per cent.
   4. Third portion treated with nitrate of silver and nitric
acid gave 2.29 grs. of chloride of silver: therefore 0.564 gr.
of chlorine = 2.26 per cent.
   5. Fourth portion mixed with solution of pernitrate of iron
made by dissolving 3.68 grs. of good iron wire (harpsichord
wire) in nitric acid, and therefore containing 5-26 grs. of per
oxide of iron. The liquid being then treated with excess of
ammonia, the precipitate washed, dried and ignited, was found
to weigh 5'47 grs.; and deducting 5-26 grs. of peroxide of iron,
there remains 0.21 gr. of phosphoric acid, or 0.84 per cent.
   II. Silica and Alkalies.—1. Alkaline liquid from 50 grs. of
ash (A. 2) acidulated with hydrochloric acid and evaporated
to dryness; residue digested in dilute hydrochloric acid, silica
collected on filter, washed, dried and ignited, weighed 1-22
gr. =2'44 per cent.
   2. Filtered solution treated with baryta-water to separate
sulphuric and phosphoric acids; excess of baryta removed by
carbonate of ammonia; filtered liquid evaporated to dryness,
and ammoniacal salts driven off by ignition; the residue con
sisting of chlorides of fixed alkalies, weighed 16 grs. =32 per
Cent.
   3. 2.25 grs. of these mixed chlorides dissolved in water and
treated in the usual manner with 3} times their weight of
sodio-chloride of platinum, gave 7.06 grs. of chloride of pla
tinum and potassium, corresponding to 2:157 grs. of chloride
of potassium. Now 2.25 : 32 :: 2:157 : 30-68; we have

to dryness to render silica perfectly insoluble; residue di

sisting of silica and charcoal, collected on weighed filter,
washed and dried at 300°.

therefore Charcoal               .  .  . .  .     282 ...
    II. Earthy Phosphates.—1. Filtered solution (C. I.) treated
with excess of ammonia yielded a precipitate which being
washed, dried and ignited, gave of earthy phosphates 27-26
    S.
    2. Phosphates, after ignition, dissolved in hot hydrochloric
 acid and reprecipitated by ammonia; precipitate digested in
 warm acetic acid to dissolve phosphates of lime and magnesia;
 the insoluble portion consisting of phosphates of iron and alu
mina weighed 8-25 grs.
    3. Phosphates of iron and alumina redissolved in hot hy
 drochloric acid; solution boiled with excess of caustic potash,
undissolved portion collected on filter, washed, dried and
 ignited, gave
             Weight of phosphate of iron . = 4.57 grs.
             Therefore phosphate of alumina = 3-68 ...
                                                   8'25 ...
     4. Alkaline solution (C. II. 3) boiled with sal-ammoniac,
 gave a precipitate of phosphate of alumina, which weighed
 only 1.8 gr. instead of 368; but the liquid filtered from this
 precipitate gave, when treated by Berthier’s process, a quan
 tity of phosphoric acid weighing 1.91 gr., which, added to
  1-80 gr., gives 371 grs. for the quantity of phosphate of
 alumina, differing by only 0.03 gr. from 3-68 grs. We may
  infer from this that the quantity of phosphoric acid in com
  bination with alumina is about 2.5 per cent.
     5. To determine the quantity of phosphoric acid in com
  bination with oxide of iron, the 4.57 grs. of phosphate of iron
  (C. II. 3) were redissolved in hot hydrochloric acid, and the
  solution treated with ammonia and sulphuret of ammonium :

             Mr. Watts on the Analysis of Hop-Ash.            57
the sulphuret of iron, after washing, was oxidized by nitric
acid and the oxide of iron precipitated by ammonia. The
result was
              Oxide of iron . . . . 2.71 grs.
therefore     Phosphoric acid . . . 1.86 ...
                                           4'57 ...
   6. Acetic acid solution (C.II. 2) containing the phosphates
of lime and magnesia treated with oxalate of ammonia; oxa
late of lime washed, dried and ignited, gave 1423 grs. of car
bonate of lime=7-97 grs. of lime.
   7. Liquid filtered from lime, treated with excess of am
monia, gave
  Pyrophosphate of magnesia 4:37–      {{#. º*          •   -
                                                          acid.
   8. The quantity of phosphoric acid in combination with
 lime was determined by difference; thus
         Total quantity of earthy phosphates = 27-26 grs.
         Phosphates of iron and alumina 8.25 grs.
         Phosphate of magnesia . . . 4:37 ...
         Lime .    .  .  .  .  .   . .  .  797 ...
         Making together . . . . . —                20:59 ...
         Therefore phosphoric acid .                 6-67 ...
    This is very nearly the quantity required to form the tri
 basic phosphate; for the combining number of lime being
 28, and that of phosphoric acid 71°38, we have
                     84 : 71°38 :: 7.97:6-77,
 which result differs by 0.1 from 6:67.
   The quantity of phosphate of lime is 7.97+6.67 – 14:64.
    9. If we reckon as above (C. II. 4) the quantity of phos
 phoric acid in the phosphate of alumina at 2.5 per cent., we
 have for the total quantity of phosphoric acid in the insoluble
 part of the ash 6.67 +2.77-1-1-86+2'50– 13.80. Adding to
 this the quantity contained in the soluble portion (B.I. 5),
 viz. 0.84, the total amount of phosphoric acid will be 14:64
 per cent.
    III. Carbonates of Lime and Magnesia.-1. Liquid filtered
 from precipitated phosphates (C.II. 1), boiled with oxalate
 of ammonia, precipitate washed, dried and ignited, gave car
 bonate of lime 11.04 grs., containing 6'18 grs. of lime and
 4'86 grs. of carbonic acid.
    2. Filtrate containing magnesia evaporated to dryness;
 residue ignited to drive off ammoniacal salts and redissolved
 in hydrochloric acid. Solution mixed with carbonate of soda

58           Mr. Watts on the Analysis of Hop-Ash.
in excess, boiled briskly for half an hour and filtered; filtrate
evaporated quickly to dryness, residue digested in boiling
water, and undissolved portion added to precipitate on filter;
precipitate of carbonate of magnesia washed, dried and ig
nited, gave 374 grs. of magnesia.
   To determine the quantity of carbonic acid in combination
with this, we have 20.67 : 22 :: 3.74 : 3.99, this added to 3-74
grs. of magnesia, gives 7-73 grs. of carbonate of magnesia.
   3. From this it appears that the total quantity of carbonic
acid in combination with lime and magnesia is 4-864-399
 = 8.85 grs.                               -
   To verify this, the carbonic acid was determined directly
from the insoluble portion of 50 grs. of ash (A. 2). This
insoluble matter weighed 31.87 grs. or 63-74 per cent. Of
this, 14.27 grs. decomposed by hydrochloric acid in flask
apparatus, gave 2.07 grs. of carbonic acid. Now
                   14:27: 63-74 :: 2:07: 9:24.
This quantity differs by 0-39 from 8.85, the calculated quan
tity. The excess is probably due to the escape of a little
hydrochloric acid during the boiling of the liquid in the flask
apparatus. The estimation of the lime and magnesia is more
to be depended upon than that of the carbonic acid.
                            Summary.
   The phosphoric, carbonic and silicic acids exist both in the
soluble and insoluble portions of the ash.
   The total quantity of phosphoric acid has been already
estimated approximately at 14.64 per cent. (C. II. 9).
   The quantity of carbonic acid in the soluble portion is 2:16
 (B. I. 2), and in the insoluble 8.85 (C. III.3), making toge
ther 11:01 per cent.
   The quantity of silica in the soluble part is 2:44 (B. II. 1),
and in the insoluble part 15:44 (C.I.), making together 17-88
per cent.                                      -
   The total quantity of lime is 14-15 per cent., viz. 7-97

its due share of nourishment to supply the increasing demands
of the hop-garden: and further, that in this cultivation there is
no relief by alternating crops or fallows, unless the occasional
failures from blight and other causes may be so termed. The
quantity of alkali thus removed every year exceeds that of a
very heavy crop of grain, while the phosphoric acid amounts to
more than half that of the latter. It is probable also that the
quantities of phosphoric and sulphuric acids present in the
ash do not indicate the total quantities of sulphur and phos
phorus removed from the soil, inasmuch as portions of these
elements may exist in the plants as proteine-compounds.
IX. Experimental Researches on Figures of Equilibrium of
    a Liquid Mass withdrawn from the Action of Gravity:
    Second Series. ‘By M. PLATEAU+.
THE        theory of capillary action, as established by the
       labours of Laplace, Poisson, &c., is not limited to the ex
planation of the cause of the ascension or the depression
of liquids in narrow spaces, and the determination of the
laws which regulate this phaenomenon; it also permits, as is
 well known, of our arriving at the differential equation which
 represents the free surface of a liquid, in circumstances where
the form of that surface is influenced by molecular attraction,
as for example at the summit of the raised or depressed column
in a capillary tube, along the sides of a solid body in part
immersed, &c. But this equation cannot be integrated but
by approximation, so that it is impossible to determine strictly
 the forms of the surface in question. On the other hand, on
 account of the preponderating action of gravity, the influence
 of molecular attraction can only become observable on sur
faces, or portions of surfaces, which present but a small ex
 tent either in all directions or at least in one direction, such
 as the surface which terminates a capillary column, that of a
 liquid drop placed on a solid plane which it cannot moisten,
 the portion of the surface of a liquid raised along the sides of
 the vessel which contains it, &c. It would consequently be
 very difficult to verify by accurate admeasurements this im
 portant part of the theory; and it has hitherto remained
 almost without any other confirmation than that deduced
 from the simple aspect of the phaenomena.
    Now it will be remembered that in his preceding memoir
   * From an abstract by M. Quetelet, published in the Bulletin de l'Aca
 démie Royale de Belgique. The First Series of these interesting investiga
 tions appeared in the 13th Part of the Scientific Memoirs.

62       On Figures of Equilibrium of a Liquid Mass.
(Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, part xiii. p. 16), M. Plateau
described a simple process, by means of which he succeeded
in completely neutralizing the action of gravity upon a liquid
mass of considerable volume, at the same time leaving this
mass perfectly free to obey the molecular forces. If, therefore,
as in the case of ordinary capillary phaenomena, the attrac
tion of a solid system is interposed, the form which the free
surface of the mass will assume will be identically the same as
if the liquid had been in reality deprived of all gravity. But
then the equation relative to the surfaces of equilibrium is
reduced to a very simple form, which allows, in several cases,
of omitting the integration, and, on the other hand, nothing
any longer limits the extent which may be given to surfaces,
so that the results of experiment are susceptible of exact
admeasurements. We are thus able to submit the theory
to numerous and perfect verifications. This is one of the
objects which M. Plateau proposed to himself in his re
searches, starting from the second series now laid before the
Academy.                                           ---
   But his ingenious experiments, besides the support they
give to the theory of capillary action, have another kind of
interest, in so far as they exhibit the curious spectacle of
figures of equilibrium suitable to a liquid deprived of gravity;
the theoretical and experimental study of these figures forms
a second object of research. The equation representing
these figures shows at once that the sphere, the plane, and
the cylinder must be found among them ; now, the author
has shown, in his preceding memoir, that when the liquid
mass of his experiments is not adherent to any solid system,
it always assumes precisely the spherical form. With respect
to plane and cylindrical surfaces, as they are from their na
ture indefinitely extended, the first in all directions, and the
second in the direction of its axis, it is evident that they can
not be assumed by a finite and entirely free mass; but the
author obtains portions of them by causing the liquid mass to
adhere to suitable solid systems.
   The results at which he arrives on this subject lead him to
realize polyhedrons entirely liquid, with the exception of their
angles, which are formed of thin iron wires. He produces
the cylinder by attaching the liquid mass to two rings of iron
wire placed parallel one to the other.
   The observation of certain peculiar facts relative to these
liquid figures leads the author to several important conse
quences, among which we . mention the indication of a
mode of experiment which would perhaps allow of arriving at
the determination of a limit above which must be found the

           On the Ovidation of Cumol by Nitric Acid.            63
length of the radius of sensible activity of molecular at
traction.
   Lastly, the author deduces from a property of the liquid
cylinder the complete theory of the constitution of liquid veins
discharged through circular orifices, –a constitution so com
pletely investigated experimentally by Savart, the cause of
which, however, has remained without any satisfactory expla
nation. Although such a vein be formed of a liquid freely
submitted to the action of gravity, M. Plateau shows that we
may apply to it, somewhat modified, the considerations rela
tive to a liquid upon which this force does not act.
   The author announces, in conclusion, that in the following
series he shall direct his attention to other figures of equili
 brium of revolution than the sphere and the cylinder, and to
figures not included in that class for which the equation may
be interpreted in a strict manner.
X. On some of the Products of Ovidation of Cumol by Nitric
                 Acid.    By Mr. F. A. ABEL.”
FROM the investigations on the action of nitric acid upon
       organic bodies, one result, in reference to the manner in
which this acid acts, has been undoubtedly established. We
know that in most cases the carbon of the organic substance
remains untouched; that according to the degree of concen
tration of the acid a smaller or larger number of equivalents
of hydrogen are expelled, and that the remaining part of the
organic body combines with the remainder of the nitric acid.
Thus is produced that innumerable class of neutral com
pounds considered by some chemists to be combinations of
nitrous acid with organic oxides, and by others to be pro
 ducts of the substitution of hyponitric acid for hydrogen. It
is indifferent which of these views is adopted, the fact having
 been established by hundreds of experiments, and we are en
abled by analogy to predict with tolerable certainty the result
 of any new experiment.
   The case is quite different when the oxidation is not con
fined to the hydrogen, but is extended to the carbon. The
numerous experiments made on this subject do not as yet
 afford any general conclusion; we are far from being able to
 form an opinion, previous to experiment, of the nature of the
 product formed. This will be obvious if we examine the ac
tion of nitric acid on a class of bodies which are very nearly
related to each other, both by the manner in which they are
formed and in their general chemical behaviour. Benzol, to

   In the above two columns of combinations the number of
equivalents of carbon will be found the same as in the carbo
hydrogens. We have however succeeded with most of these
bodies, by the continued action of the acid upon them, or by
the observation of particular conditions, in oxidizing also a
portion of their carbon, bodies with acid properties being pro
duced which contain a smaller number of equivalents of car
bon than the carbo-hydrogens from which they were derived.
The composition of these acids does not however bear any
constant relation to the carbo-hydrogens, such as observed in
the above-mentioned products of substitution.
   By the continued action of nitric acid on naphthalol, naph
thalic acid, discovered by Laurent and Marignact, is pro
duced, the composition of which is expressed by the formula
                            2HO, Cig HMOs.
   The action of nitric acid on cinnamol (styrol) has been
studied by Drs. Hofmann and Blythf. They have shown
that cinnamol may in this manner be converted into benzoic
acid.
   The products obtained by the action of nitric acid on toluol
have been studied by Devilles. He found that the two
above-mentioned products of substitution were easily formed.
He moreover believes to have converted toluol, by a long
treatment with oxidizing agents, into benzoic acid; he is
however in doubt about the result of his experiment, as he
could not always succeed in the transformation, and his me
thod of preparing toluol did not exclude the possibility of its
containing benzoic aether in admixture. If benzoic acid can
in reality be obtained from toluol, we have here an instance

        Products of Owidation of Cumol by Nitric Acid.       65
of the formation of an acid without the original number of
equivalents of carbon in the carbo-hydrogen being diminished.
   In the paper lately read before this Society by Mr. Noad,
he has shown that cymol is converted by the continued ac
tion of dilute nitric acid into toluylic acid.
   It will be seen from these examples that we are unable to
determine anything beforehand regarding the nature of these
products of oxidation.      The manner in which nitric acid or
any other oxidizing agent acts is evidently closely connected
with the constitution of the body exposed to their influence.
Aided by the manner in which nitric acid acts on naphthalol,
Marignac has in fact founded a view of the constitution of
 this body. He considers the carbo-hydrogen in question to be
 a combination of two others, namely, CigH4 and C4H4=C20Hs,
naphthalic acid, Cig H4Os, being formed by the action of nitric
acid on the first, while the other is converted by the influence
 of the oxygen into water and oxalic acid or carbonic acid.
 By this view many of the reactions of naphthalol may be ex
plained in a very satisfactory manner. It is possible that
 similar views may be applied to the other carbo-hydrogens,
 by which their behaviour with oxidizing agents may be simi
larly explained; a great number of investigations are how
 ever required before we can arrive at any general result.
    The following experiments, which I have instituted at the
 suggestion and under the direction of Dr. Hofmann, may, I
 hope, be considered as a slight contribution to this subject.
    It is known that when cumol is treated with concentrated
 nitric acid it yields the usual products of substitution of the
 carbo-hydrogens. Gerhardt and Cahours have observed fur
 ther, that by the continuous action of dilute nitric acid on
 cumol a crystalline acid is produced”. This acid has not,
 however, been more closely investigated. According to the ex
 periments on toluol, cinnamol and cymol before mentioned,
 this acid might be of three different kinds, according to the
 analogy of cumol with any one of these carbo-hydrogens.
 If the number of equivalents of carbon were to remain the
 same as in toluol, the acid obtained might be HO, Cls Ho Oa,
 until now unknown (differing from toluylic or cuminic acid
 in containing C, H2, more or less). Should two equivalents
 of carbon be eliminated, as is the case with cinnamol, the
 formation of toluylic acid might then be expected; and lastly,
 should cumol be analogous to cymol, that is, should it lose
 four equivalents of carbon, the acid must then be benzoic acid.
    In the preparation of cumol I proceeded in the manner
 described by its discoverers, Gerhardt and Cahours. Pure

66                  Mr. Abel on some of the
cuminic acid was distilled with four times its weight of caustic
lime in a copper retort placed in a deep sand-bath, the tem
perature of which was gradually raised to a red heat. The
distillate obtained was colourless, possessing however an
empyreumatic odour, which it did not lose on being rectified
over hydrate of potash to free it from any cuminic acid that
might have come over with it. I afterwards found that this
peculiar odour was immediately removed on distilling the oil
with a concentrated solution of chromic acid, which leaves
the cumol of its agreeable aromatic smell without affecting its
composition. This is a method that might perhaps prove
useful in many cases where the peculiar odour of a carbo
hydrogen is disguised by the presence of a small quantity of
some foreign substance.
    When dried over chloride of calcium this body possessed
exactly the same properties as described by Gerhardt and
Cahours. Its boiling-point was found by them to be 144°C.;
a later experiment of Gerhardt gave 153° as the boiling-point.
The cumol that I prepared boiled at 148°C. Its analysis
gave me the following results:—
    0-2029 grn. burned with oxide of copper gave 0.6725 grm.

    On boiling cumol with concentrated nitric acid it is quickly
 converted into a heavy oil, which is the analogue to nitro
 benzol. If the boiling is continued this oil disappears, and
 is gradually converted into a yellow crystalline mass, soluble
 in ammonia with the exception of a slight fixed residue (dini
 trocumol). The ammoniacal solution gives with hydrochloric
 acid a white precipitate, difficultly soluble in cold water, but
 more easily so in hot water, from which it crystallizes on
 cooling. These crystals are generally somewhat coloured;
 recrystallization after treatment with animal charcoal removes
  this colouring matter.
     Several combustions of the acid dried at 100° C. showed
  me that my substance must be a mixture. I therefore di

  several days, and obtained a crystalline body similar to the

   On addition of nitrate of silver to the ammoniacal salt of
this acid a white precipitate was formed, sparingly soluble in
hot water, from which it crystallized on cooling. I had not suf
ficient substance to recrystallize the salt, and could therefore
only purify it by washing.
   Its analysis gave me the following result:—
   0-1657 grim. of substance left, on being burnt, 0.0650 grim.,
or 39:24 per cent. of silver; which agrees sufficiently well
with the composition of nitrobenzoate of silver.

   In order to be perfectly certain, the small quantity remain
ing of the silver salt was submitted to distillation. There
sublimed a portion of the acid, mixed with a few drops of an
aromatic oil. The product of the distillation was therefore
submitted to Dr. Hofmann’s process for detecting nitroben
zol ; it was dissolved in a mixture of alcohol and sulphuric
acid, and reduced by means of a piece of metallic zinc. After
the disengagement of hydrogen had ceased, the liquid was
neutralized with potash and agitated with aether.         A few
drops of the aetherial solution gave, on evaporation with hy
pochloride of lime, the beautiful violet colour characterizing
aniline.                                                   -
   These experiments were sufficient to identify nitrobenzoic
acid, and it seemed more than probable that the excess of
carbonic acid obtained in the first analysis arose from the
presence of benzoic acid.           -      -

   I therefore distilled a fresh quantity of cumol with nitric
acid, and recollecting the difficulty Mr. Noad experienced in
the preparation of toluylic acid, I employed my acid so dilute
that even on boiling the mixture no disengagement of red
fumes was visible. Having continued the distillation for four
or five days the cumol was converted into a crystalline mass,
which was strained off from the mother-liquor and recrystal
lized from water. The properties of this acid distinguished
it immediately from nitrobenzoic acid; it was much more
soluble in cold and hot water, and might be easily recognised
as benzoic acid. Not having sufficient substance for a com
bustion, I converted the acid into an ammoniacal salt, and
precipitated this with nitrate of silver. A white flocculent
precipitate was obtained, much more easily soluble in water
than nitrobenzoate of silver. On cooling, beautiful crystals
separated, having all the properties of benzoate of silver.
   The analysis of this salt gave me the following results:—

silver, which numbers correspond with the formula AgO, Cia

   These results were sufficiently near, considering the small
amount of substance employed.
   From these experiments we see that cumol on being boiled
continuously with nitric acid is converted into benzoic and
nitrobenzoic acids.    The oxidation of cumol is therefore ana
logous to that of cymol.

 having however continued the distillation for about a week I
 could not obtain an acid from benzol. On employing highly
diluted acid, the benzol was gradually converted into nitro
benzol.
   Neither benzol nor nitrobenzol is attacked by pure chro
mic acid, or the oxidizing mixture of bichromate of potash and
sulphuric acid. Results quite as unsatisfactory as these were
obtained on boiling a solution of hyposulphobenzolic acid
with chromic acid or peroxide of manganese.

     HESE two sets of works, though as opposite in their manner as
      if they had been written for the sake of contrast, are yet so far
related in respect to their subject as to be properly analysed under
the same heading. The object of Mr. Potts is to develop the pure
principles of the ancient geometry; that of Mr. Gaskin to display the
powers of the modern to the greatest advantage. Each too has been
eminently successful in his undertaking; and has shown the most
admirable mastery over his respective subject. We are indeed glad
to see this; as for many years the elementary productions of the
Cambridge press had been gradually diminishing in value, originality,
and adaptation to educational purposes.         We shall give a brief
account of them in the order of their appearance, beginning with
Mr. Potts's Euclid and Appendix.
   The Elements of Euclid, it may be supposed, cannot differ mate
rially in one edition from another; especially when, as is the case with
most of them as well as this, the text of Simson is professedly adopted.
This is true in the main : but it is not true in respect to the busi
mess of actual instruction, as every tutor too well knows. In using
the older editions of Simson nothing is so embarrassing to a stu
dent or so troublesome to the tutor, as the parcelling out the syllo
gisms (or rather, generally, the enthymemes) of which a long de
monstration is composed. Many tutors had recourse to marking them
in pencil in the pupils' copies of the book. Then again came the
separation of each syllogism into its separate members.          All this
created not only intolerable labour for the tutor, but disgust in the

70                 Notices respecting New Books.
student's feelings, and confusion in his comprehension and remem
brance of the argument. One attempt to remedy this inconvenience
was made by Mr. Williamson in his “Symbolical Euclid,” which
was in a great degree successful as far as this particular class of dif
ficulties was concerned : but on the other hand it was attended with
incalculable injury, by removing from geometry that distinctness of
conception, both as regards fundamental ideas and the nature of geo
Imetrical demonstration, which has from time immemorial been the
peculiar charm and value of this science. Mr. Potts, however, has
literally maintained the very text of Simson and secured the very
spirit of Euclid's geometry, by means which are simply mechanical.
It consists in printing the syllogism in a separate paragraph, and the
members of it in separate subdivisions, each, for the most part, occu
pying a single line. The divisions of a proposition are therefore seen
at once without requiring an instant's thought. Were this the
only advantage of Mr. Potts's edition, the great convenience which
it affords in tuition would give it a claim to become the geometrical
text-book of England. This, however, is not its only merit.
   Prefixed to the work is an elaborate history of geometry, too
elaborate in respect to the early geometry, perhaps, and too sketchy
in respect to the modern. In its general character it resembles the
prefaces of Bonnycastle and Butler, but is in many parts much more
amplified than either. We would recommend the author to recast
this in a second edition—to omit some of the details respecting
 mediaeval geometry, and to give an ample analysis of the researches
of the continental geometers of the last half-century. This part of the
 work, indeed, satisfies us less than any other; although it is not
without considerable merit.
    The “notes” appended to each book of Euclid in succession (and
a few additional ones in the “Appendix ") are partly critical as re
gards turns and expressions in the original text of Euclid, but prin
cipally geometrical as regards difficulties of conception or imperfec
tions of demonstration. They bespeak an acute mind and a judi
cious teacher; and they will be of very great service to the solitary
student and careful thinker.
    Then follows a dissertation on the “Ancient Geometrical Analysis,”
somewhat incomplete it is true; the subject is, however, resumed in
the “Appendix,” and treated with a fulness and perspicuity that is
very unusual (perhaps unprecedented) in treatises even professedly
composed on the subject—such as those of Lawson and Leslie. This,
with the judiciously chosen illustrations of the method, cannot fail,
we think, in reviving amongst Cambridge men a taste for that most
interesting department of the Greek geometry; and, if not amongst
 the older members of the University, yet amongst its coming race
 of men, from the facility and ease with which Mr. Potts has put it in
their power to master both the method and its application, this sub
ject will regain something of the respect which was paid to it in the
bygone brightest days of geometry.
    In the “Appendix" is inserted a short tract on the “Theory of
Transversals”—a subject almost totally unknown in this country.

                    Notices respecting New Books.                       71
Indeed Mr. Potts tells us that there is only one single work pub
lished in England where it is fully discussed, or even mentioned at
all; and we believe the first use even of the term in any English book
was made in this Magazine in 1826 by the author to whom Mr.
Potts refers, in a paper on Pascal's Mystic Hexagram.
   We come in the last place to a series of “Geometrical Exercises,”
above a thousand in number. These are collected eaclusively from
the Cambridge University papers—either those given in the Senate
House or in the different Colleges during the present century.
Opinions will be divided as to the wisdom shown by Mr. Potts in
confining himself to those sources from which to draw his “problems”
—as it is the somewhat fanciful practice of the University to deno
minate all propositions whatever. We shall offer no opinion on
this question; but assume that Mr. Potts had reasons satisfactory.
to his own mind for this act of deference to his University prede
cessors.   At all events we have here a vast mass of “Exercises" of
all degrees of difficulty, from the most simple to the most trans
cendent; and certainly a great number of them are as remarkable for
their elegance as for their difficulty,
   The practice of “problem-solving” is much and very properly in
sisted on in the Cambridge course of reading. Possibly the study of
problems which have been set in former years may be the best means
of preparing the men to solve those which may be set hereafter. It
may be under such a supposition that Mr. Potts so limited his grounds
of selection. After all, as the Euclid is for the most part confined to
the “Freshman's year,” these exercises would have far transcended
the powers of the men without occasional, indeed frequent, sugges
 tions from a tutor.   Many of them would embarrass even an expert
 geometer, if placed before him suddenly in the course of his tutorial
duties—and some of them, under the same circumstances, the ablest
geometers of the present century. To obviate this objection, Mr.
 Potts has published in his Appendix, a series of “Hints” more or
less full as the occasion seemed to demand.        To use the language
 of a respected cotemporary, in which we fully concur, we should
 describe them thus:—“In some cases references only are made to
the proposition on which a solution depends; in others we have a
 step or two of the process indicated; in one case the analysis is briefly
 given to find the construction or demonstration; in another case the
 reverse of this. Occasionally, though seldom, the entire process is
 given as a model; but most commonly, just so much is suggested as
 will enable a student of average ability to complete the whole solu
 tion—in short just so much (and no more) assistance is afforded as
 would, and must be, afforded by a tutor to his pupil.     Mr. Potts ap
 pears to us to have hit the ‘golden mean’ of geometrical tutorship.”
    In order to render his work more extensively useful, Mr. Potts has
 printed a smaller edition for the use of schools, containing the first six
 books of Euclid with the principal notes on each, and a selection from
 the Exercises sufficient for all the purposes of school-education.
 Being printed on the same arrangement as the larger edition, and
 published at a price lower, we believe, than any other edition of
 Euclid, it cannot fail to meet the wants of a large class of schools in

 72                  Notices respecting New Books.
 this country at the present day. It is used, we understand, in all
 our great Grammar Schools, in the Royal Military Academy, and
 many other public institutions, as well as in a large number of pri
 vate schools.
    The works of Mr. Gaskin all tend to show the power of what is
 vulgarly in modern times called “analysis” to deal with geometrical
 propositions. As far as his books can give any insight into his
 thoughts, it would appear to be his aim to supersede the Greek geo
 metry.    This may arise however from the circumstance of the other
 ground being already occupied by Mr. Potts, and his honourable un
 willingness to interfere with the objects of his collaborateur; and we
 are the more disposed to think so from some speculations in his
 “Third Appendix to the Solutions of Geometrical Problems,” which
 prove him to possess a considerable share of geometrical power as
 well as a more than usual share of algebraical.      Whatever view be
 taken of this, we can most cordially award him our praise for the
 masterly manner in which he has applied algebra to many of the
 problems in both his volumes; and in cases too where he had great
 difficulties to contend against from the unsuitability of his instrument
 for its intended operation.      It is a remarkable circumstance that
 those problems which are most easily resolved by pure geometry give
 rise to the greatest difficulty and complexity by every method of al
 gebraical treatment; and vice versd. An authority of no mean weight
 has indeed asserted that in such cases “the fault is not in the analysis,
 but in the analyst:” but we may say with the same propriety on the
 other side, that “the fault is not in the geometry, but the geometer.”
 Be this as it may, in the present state of geometry and algebra, we
 believe our position will not be generally disputed. Mr. Gaskin,
 then, has imposed upon himself many artificial difficulties; whilst on
 the other hand he has mastered them more completely than we be
lieve any one of his University cotemporaries could have done—more
 completely, it is certain, than they had ever before been mastered.
There are, indeed, isolated exceptions, but these are few; whilst the
great address and ability displayed in the majority of the solutions
place Mr. Gaskin amongst the most successful and effective writers
on the application of Algebra to Geometry of our age and country.
   Mr. Gaskin's selection of the “problems” given in the “College
Papers of St. John's" (containing the “Trigonometrical Problems
from 1829 to 1846,” and the “Geometrical Problems from 1830 to
 1846”) is apparently founded on an assumed superiority of the papers
given in that College over those given in any other. Upon this point
we have no means of judging : but we know that the papers of St.
John's are much sought after by the undergraduates (especially on the
more elementary subjects), upon which to exercise themselves. Mr.
Gaskin's choice is, therefore, in all probability a judicious one; and
as it is a University question rather than a public one, Mr. Gaskin
is himself the better judge in such a case. The idea under which
the solutions are constructed is well expressed in the preface to the
Trigonometrical papers:– “The time allowed for the solution of each
paper being limited to about three hours, the author has adopted the
method which each example most naturally suggested, in preference to

                     Notices respecting New Books.                      73
the employment of analytical artifices by which many of the results
might have been obtained more concisely. In every case he has endea
voured to point out the form in which the student would be expected
to present the solution to the examiner.” The geometrical papers are
also evidently solved on the same principle; and we feel bound to
say that under such conditions, a better set of solutions could not
have been produced.        They are everywhere marked by a perfect
knowledge of the broad principles of the science, and by an address in
the management of hissymbols, which is almost peculiar to Mr. Gaskin.
We are not offering any opinion as to whether Mr. Gaskin's plan be the
best that could have been adopted; but we merely affirm that, having
selected a plan, he has fulfilled his objects with consummate ability.
   The gem of Mr. Gaskin's two volumes, however, in the eyes of a
mathematician, will be the three “appendices” to the geometrical
problems. The first and third of these are upon a problem which
has received much attention both from English and foreign geome
ters, in one form or other:—“In a given conic section to inscribe a
polygon all whose sides (produced if necessary) shall pass through
given points.” Much as this problem has been discussed (for a pretty
complete list of these discussions, we must refer to Mr. Potts’s “Ap
pendix,” p. 98), we believe that Mr. Gaskin has not been anticipated
in his method by any one whatever; and certainly of all the attempts
to solve this difficult problem by algebraic methods, his process is
the most direct and elegant.        We are glad to see such models of in
vestigation laid before the men; and especially by an author whose
name carries that weight in the University which his does.
   To the second “Appendix” we must award less praise. It is
mainly composed of a discussion of the equation of the second degree
between r and y. It is complete, but complex and cumbrous: and
is is inferior in all respects but completeness, to many others that we
could easily point out; whilst even in respect to its one good quality,
it is not superior to several of them. We have not room, however,
to particularise.
   The remaining part of this Appendix is devoted to the deduction of
a considerable number of properties of the conic sections, references
for which are made to different papers set either in the Senate House
or in the various Colleges. In these solutions a mixed method is
pursued. Certain cardinal propositions are established by coordinate
methods; and from these, by geometrical considerations, the others
are deduced. Great difference of opinion exists among geometers as
to the propriety of this mode of investigation; and we shall not offer
ourselves either as dictators or umpires on the question.      It is suffi
cient to say, that granting these cardinal properties (as Pascal's Hex
agram, for instance) to have been established in a manner to satisfy
any given geometer, he will find the deductions from them to have
been effected with great brevity, clearness and elegance.
   On the whole, then, we cannot but congratulate the University
on the appearance of the works of Messrs. Potts and Gaskin; and
we trust they will be speedily followed by others as valuable, either
by those authors themselves, or by other men possessing an equal
amount of learning and soundness of judgement.

          PHOSPHATE OF IRON, MANGANESE AND SODA,
                         BY M. A. DAMOUR.
This       mineral was recently found among the pegmatites of the
       environs of Chanteloub, near Limoges, by M. Mathieu, a
mineral-dealer.
   When viewed in mass, its colour is clove-brown; its fracture
lamellar and shining ; and in some places, which appear altered, it is
chatoyant like diallage. It possesses three rectangular cleavages,
which leads to the conclusion that the mineral crystallizes in right
rectangular prisms. This mineral scratches fluor spar, and is scratched
by a steel point; its density is 3:468. When heated by the blow
pipe on platina, it melts into a non-magnetic globule. With fluxes
it gives the reactions of manganese, and gives water when heated in
the tube. Hydrochloric acid dissolves it readily, a little chlorine
being evolved.
   A qualitative analysis showed that the mineral is composed essen
tially of phosphoric acid, peroxide of iron, and oxide of manganese
and soda, combined with a small quantity of water.

 ANALYSIS OF COLUMBITE FROM THE FNVIRONS OF LIMOGES.
                          BY M. A. DAMOUR,
   This mineral species, which has hitherto been found in a few places
only, has been met with in a quarry near Chanteloub. The speci
men, below described, was confounded with specimens of wolfram
and triplite, which M. Mathieu had collected.                 Its colour, hardness
and great density, induced M. Damour to believe that it contained
columbic acid. It occurs in the form of nuclei imbedded in yellow
ish-white felspar. It is of a tarnished bluish-black colour on the
surface; the fresh fracture is shining and glossy; its powder is
black, approaching gray.      It scratches glass, and its density is 7-651.
It does not fuse by the blowpipe; but when heated on charcoal with
tartrate of potash, it yields globules of tin. Acids do not act upon
it. Analysis gave—

   ON THE ACIDS OF SULPHUR.                   BY MM. FOR DOS AND GELIS.
    All the chlorides of sulphur yield, with the aqueous solution of
sulphurous acid, the same compounds. The principal product of
this reaction is a new oxygenated compound of sulphur, in which
five equivalents of sulphur are combined with an equal number of
equivalents of oxygen, and form a molecule which saturates only one
equivalent of base, and which is consequently represented by the
formula. Sº O3, MO.
   This acid differs from all the acids of sulphur hitherto known.      It
is not to be confounded either with that to which M, Wackenroder
has assigned the same formula, without having analysed it, the for
mation of which he observed during the reaction of hydrosulphuric
acid on the aqueous solution of sulphurous acid; for M. Wackenroder
 states positively, in his memoir, that the barytic salt which he ob
tained is soluble in alcohol and in aether, and is not precipitable from
its solution in water by them, whereas it is by these very means that
MM. Fordos and Gelis isolate their acid.
    The new acid S5 Oº, MO is the isomeric of hyposulphurous acid
 Sº O2, MO. Both have the same composition in 100 parts, but they
 differ completely in all their characters. Mineral chemistry does
 not present any case of isomerism comparable to that of these two
 acids. To discover analogous cases, the compounds of carbon must
 be referred to ; and this fact supports the approximation, which M.
 Berzelius was the first to establish, between the composition of the
 acids of sulphur recently discovered, and that of the compounds of
 organic chemistry.
    The authors divide all the acids of sulphur into two perfectly
 distinct classes; in one the sulphur remains invariable, and the
 quantity of oxygen increases; in the other, the number of equiva
 lents of oxygen remaining five, the sulphur varies as the numbers
 2, 3, 4 and 5. The acid now particularly described is the last of
 this class.
    The name of sulphuric series is given to the first : it includes all
 the acids anciently known; and the name of thionic series, from 6eiov,
 sulphur, is given to the four acids more recently discovered. They
 are distinguished from each other by prefixing to the generic name
 the Greek particles which represent the numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5.
     Thus we have the following acids:—
     Dithionic Sº O’, hyposulphuric acid of Gay-Lussac and Welter.

 76           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    Trithionic Sº O*, sulphhyposulphuric acid of Langlois.
   Tetrathionic S"O", bisulphated hyposulphuric acid, discovered by
 Fordos and Gelis in 1842.
    Pentathionic Sº O*, the acid which is the subject of the present
 memoir.
    The pentathionic acid in the free state greatly resembles the other
 acids of the series. The solution is not rendered turbid by acids; it
 does not absorb iodine, and it forms soluble salts with the alkaline
 and earthy oxides. These characters prevent this acid from being
 confounded with hyposulphurous acid. The pentathionate of barytes
 was most particularly examined; it may be obtained combined with
 one equivalent of alcohol or two equivalents of water. Its formula
 in the state of hydrate is S. Oº, BaO, 2HO ; the hydrate is very
 alterable; the alcoholic compound keeps better.
    The spontaneous decomposition of the pentathionate of barytes is
 extremely curious; it may, by losing sulphur, become successively
 tetrathionate and then trithionate.
                            Sº Oº-S* O'4-S;
                            S’ O’-S3 O3 + S2.
 Sometimes the deposit of sulphur is accompanied with sulphate of
barytes, and in this case the solution acquires the smell of sulphu
rous acid. These products, which are formed in larger quantity as
the temperature is higher, are the results of the ultimate decompo
sition of the trithionate,
                    S3 Os, BaO-SO3, BaO +SO2+S.
   These decompositions, which give rise to many products, and
which continue during the whole time of the preparation, render the
procuring of the pentathionic acid extremely difficult, and serve to
explain all the various results which the reaction of the chlorides of
sulphur may occasion in the aqueous solution of sulphurous acid.—

      ON SOME PROPERTIES OF CARBON.            BY M. LAZOWSKI,
   The properties of carbon are numerous; they have been partly
studied, but every day produces new facts: when it is in a state of
ignition, it possesses some very remarkable properties.
    When a piece of ignited charcoal, which is very clean and free
from ash, is immersed into a solution of a metallic salt, it reduces
the metallic salt which is contained in it, and the metal itself is de
posited with all its natural brilliancy on the piece of charcoal. Thus
the salts of tin, copper, platina, palladium, mercury, silver and gold,
&c. furnish most brilliant deposits.
   M. Lazowski has remarked, he says, that when the salts are too
acid or too much concentrated, no effect is produced.       The dilute
solutions of the salts of copper often yield, by covering the charcoal,
the most varied shades of colour, from the finest azure blue to that of
metallic copper. The parts of the charcoal upon which certain me
tals are deposited in preference, are the extremities; whilst other
metals cover equally all the surface of the reducing body; at other
times, and this occurs with the protochloride of tin, the metal ap

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                77
pears in very brilliant crystals, disseminated on the periphery of the
charcoal.—Journ. de Chim. Méd., Decembre 1847.
     DETECTION OF FREE SULPHURIC ACID ADDED TO WINES.
    The detection of a small proportion of sulphuric acid added to red
wines, cannot be effected by means of barytic salts, for all wines
contain greater or smaller quantities of the sulphates of potash and
lime.                                                     *
    M. Lassaigne states that in an examination undertaken by him
and MM. Ossian Henri and Bayard, they found that it was not pos
sible to separate, by the action of pure sulphuric aether, four or five
thousandths of sulphuric acid added to red wine, and consequently
that this method did not always answer in proving the existence of
this acid in the free state.
    After many attempts, the authors ascertained a simple reaction,
 which allows of determining the presence of this acid, even when it
 exists in wines, in the proportion of a thousandth and a half.
    When a piece of paper which has been touched with pure wine is
 dried at a gentle heat, the spotted portion is unaltered; whereas
 paper which has been moistened with wine, to which a very small
 quantity of sulphuric acid has been added, reddens, and becomes
 brittle and friable between the fingers when slightly rubbed, before
 the white paper becomes at all coloured.
    Pure wine to which nothing has been added, leaves by sponta
 neous evaporation a violet-blue spot; whereas wine to which a very
 small quantity of sulphuric acid has been added (two to three thou
 sandths), gives by drying a rose-coloured spot.
     On examining into the sensibility of this simple process, the
 authors found that they were able to detect by its means one thou
 sandth 3 of sulphuric acid in red wine.
    The paper most proper for the experiment is common glazed
 paper, containing starch or fecula. This kind of paper is well-known
 in commerce; and it is easy to discover it by the blue colour which it
 assumes when moistened with an aqueous solution of iodine.—Ibid.
  ON THE COMPOSITION OF URANO-TANTALITE AND COLUMBITE.
     According to a notice published in the Comptes Rendus Mensuels
  de l'Académie de Berlin, Avril 1847, p. 131, by M. Henri Rose, the
  yttéro-ilménite of M. Hermann is merely the urano-tantalite described
  by M. Gustave Rose. M. Henri Rose has satisfied himself of their
  identity, by means of some specimens of yttéro-ilménite which had
  been sent to him ; his new experiments confirm his first results; and
  he has found it impossible to extract any ilmenic acid from the mineral
  in question, which he considers to be merely niobic acid, mixed with
  a certain quantity of tungstic acid.                * -
     As the urano-tantalite (the yttéro-ilménite of M. Hermann) con
  tains no columbium, M. Henri Rose proposes to give it a new name,
  that of Samarskite, in honour of M. Samarski, Director of the Mines
  of Siberia.
     This mineral contains a little yttria and protoxide of manganese

78            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
besides niobic and tungstic acids, oxide of uranium and protoxide of
11. On.
     Many of the specimens of samarskite are mixed with columbite,
the crystalline form of which is such as it has been described by M.
Hermann.
     The columbite of Siberia has been examined by M. Th. Bromeis:
the acid which it contains is niobic acid nearly pure, with mere traces
 of pelopic and tungstic acids.-Journ. de Ch. et de Phys., Nov. 1847.
         ON THE FOSSIL VEGETATION OF ANTHRACITE COAL.
     Mr. J. E. Teschemacher, at the recent meeting of the American
Association of Geologists and Naturalists, read a paper on this sub
ject, confining his observations to the remains of vegetation found
in the body of the coal, apart from that in the accompanying shales.
The principal points of the memoir were, that the remains of the
larger forms of the coal epoch, as well as of the smaller plants, were
abundant in the coal, contrary to the usual opinion. Specimens
were exhibited from the interior of the coal, showing the external
and internal parts of plants—the vessels, the leaves, the seeds, &c.
     Since the meeting, Mr. Teschemacher has continued his investi
gations, and has communicated in a letter to one of the editors the
following results:—
     1st. What I considered as vessels were said to be mere marks of
sliding of the coal. Prof. Bailey prepared a specimen of this by his
method, and told me that if I found vessels there, my proposition was
correct. Examined by Agassiz and myself, with his large Oberhauser,
 it turns out to be nothing but a mass of perforated vessels, as clear
 and distinct as if they were recent. M. Agassiz observed, “One
 moment suffices to remove every doubt on the subject.”
     2nd. What I considered as fossil seeds were said to be mere pea
 cock-eye coal; the dark carbonaceous centres of these seeds, which
 I held to be carbonized cellular matter, was thought to be a mere
 mistake and the seeds imaginary. I have since discovered them
 with distinct and clear apparently spinous appendages. M. Agassiz
 thinks the seed a Samara, and I have found sufficient quantity to
 pick out the carbonaceous matter from the interior with a fine needle
 —decarbonize it in a clean platina crucible over a spirit-lamp, with
 every possible precaution to prevent any foreign substance mixing
 there with.   On examining this with the Oberhauser, 700 diameters,
 M. Agassiz showed to Dr. Gould and myself the cells as clear and
 plain as possible; it is a mass of cellular matter, as I stated. You
 may of course imagine the extreme tenuity of the parietes of cells
 of seeds when decarbonized, and the difficulty of those less experi
 enced than M. Agassiz in the microscope in managing the subject—-
 he feels quite convinced of their being fossil seeds. The nature of the
 genus of plants must require further examination.
     3rd. The smooth glossy surfaces, which I considered the external
 parts of large plants rendered smooth by intense pressure, were said
 to be nothing more than slickens ides. My position here is proved
much more easily than in the other cases, by specimens passing gra
dually from the smoother through different degrees of protuberance

                        Meteorological Observations.                                      79
(all still smooth and polished), until we arrive at the full form of the
Lepidodendron. Nay more, I have found the parallel lines (channels)
which are on the slickens ides, also on the perfectly-formed Lepido
dendra. The correctness of my views here I could prove to the
most sceptical.
    The discoveries still to be made on this subject are numerous and
important; and I doubt not that the investigation of the coal itself
will soon solve the doubts hitherto existing in the comparison of the
coal fossils with recent plants.
    I will merely add, that I have found quite distinctly the impression
of the cellular cuticle of some of these plants, which of course can
not be seen in an impression on shale, the grains of the sedimentary
matter being as large as the surface of the cells; but on the pasty
mass of coal the impression is perfect.—Silliman's Journal, Nov. 1847.

  XIII. On Shooting Stars. By Sir J. W. LUBBock, Bart.*
 AS     I am not aware that any attempts have as yet been
       made to explain the cause of the sudden disappearance
 of shooting stars, I venture to offer the following remarks.
    A minute brilliant spot of light is seen to traverse a portion
 of the heavens with great rapidity, it then disappears, often
very suddenly.
    Three hypotheses may be used to account for this most
curious phaenomenon.
    1. The body shines by its own light, and then explodes
like a sky-rocket, breaking into minute fragments too small
to be any longer visible to the naked eye.
    2. Such a body having shone by its own light, suddenly
ceases to be luminous.
    “The falling stars, and other fiery meteors which are fre
quently seen at a considerable height in the atmosphere, and
which have received different names according to the variety
of their figure and size, arise from the fermentation of the
effluvia of acid and alkaline bodies which float in the atmo
sphere. When the more subtile parts of the effluvia are burnt
away, the viscous and earthy parts become too heavy for the
air to support, and by their gravity fall to the earth.”—Keith's
Use of the Globes. According to Sir Humphry Davy, in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1817, “the luminous ap
pearances of shooting stars and meteors cannot be owing to
any inflammation of elastic fluids, but must depend upon the
ignition of solid bodies.”
    3. The body shines by the reflected light of the sun, and
   * Communicated by the Author.
   I do not here pretend to treat of such a meteor as that I described in
the Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxx. p. 4; see also vol. xxxi. p. 368. The
phaenomena which it presented were very different from those usually pre
sented by shooting stars, and may have arisen from its meeting with the re
sistance of the earth's atmosphere.

ceases to be visible by its passing into the earth's shadow, or,
in other words, is eclipsed.
   Upon the two former suppositions, the fact of the star's
disappearance conveys to us no knowledge of its position or
of its distance from the earth; and all that can be said is, that
if it be a satellite of the earth, the great rapidity of its motion
involves the necessity of its being at no great distance from
the earth's surface,—much nearer than the moon; while the
resistance it would encounter in traversing the air would be
so great, that it is probably without the limits of our atmo
sphere.           -
    But although the two first suppositions leave us without
instruction as to the orbit or position in space of the body in
motion, the case is far different on the third hypothesis; for
knowing the time when and the place in the heavens where
the star disappeared, the elements of the geometry of three
dimensions furnish the means of determining the exact di
stance of the body from the place of the spectator or from the
centre of the earth.      Nor is this observation difficult; for if
seen on a starlight night, by attending to the configuration of
the neighbouring stars, a close approximation may be found
 to the place of disappearance, which, in the event of such
bodies existing, will be most valuable in the interval which
 must probably elapse before any orbits will have been deter
 mined with sufficient precision to enable us to anticipate their
arrival, and to make preparations for obtaining more accurate
data.
    I propose to consider the third hypothesis.

Moreover, as the cone limiting the earth's shadow envelopes
the spectator after the sun has set on all sides, wherever the

    The azimuth of the body reckoned from the meridian, or
the angle SZP, must be found by adding to a the azimuth
of the sun at the time of observation.          If we consider the
spherical triangle ZPS as seen from the centre of the earth,
the angle SZP is the same as the azimuth of the body at the
place of the observer; ZS the zenith distance is given by the

    By help of these equations, and the distance of the body
 from the centre of the earth, the position of the body in
 space is known. If, therefore, all the observations of the dis
appearance of meteors on any given night were examined,
 they might be discussed in two ways; either upon the hypo
 thesis of their accompanying the earth in its orbit as satellites,
 or upon the hypothesis of their moving round the sun, by
 changing the origin of co-ordinates to the sun's centre.
    A body just skimming the earth's surface would revolve
 round the earth in 1%. 26m.     This, therefore, is a lower limit;

   We cannot however determine the quantity 3A from the
angular motion, as seen by the spectator.
   If fortunately the disappearance be observed by two spec
tators on the same night at different times, we should then
obtain all the elements of its orbit.     For as the satellite moves
in a plane passing through the earth’s centre, the equation to
the plane of its orbit referred to the same coordinates as before is
       Ap cos a sing+ Besin & sing+C{p cos; +R}=0,
where A, B, C are constants, which express the cosines of
the inclination of the plane of the orbit to the planes y2, wº,
and ay.
   If we possessed another complete observation,
      Ap'cos a sing!-- Bo'sin a sin º' --C(p) cos; +R}=0,
such equations would determine completely the position of the
orbit in space, and two points in the orbit. Hence 8x would
be known, and a(1–e”). The two places would also furnish
e and ºr, the longitude of the perihelion. After the interval of
days or weeks, the orbit of a satellite might have become
materially altered by disturbances, but not in a few minutes,
separating independent observations by spectators at different
points of the earth's surface.
   The perturbations of satellites may be very considerable,
and hence their motions, as seen from any place on the earth's
surface, may be very irregular; for while the mass of Jupiter,
the planet which produces the greatest perturbations in the
solar system, is only about rºot<U+017F> of that of the sun, the pri
mary, the moon, which produces the perturbations of satellites,
is probably at least ºn that of the earth or fourteen times
greater. It will be recollected also that the magnitude of the
perturbations depends upon the mass of the disturbing body,
and scarcely at all upon that of the disturbed body, when mi
nute. The deviation of the figure of the earth from that of a
sphere may also have a considerable effect, and even perhaps
the irregularities of its surface and the unequal density of its
substance. These circumstances, taken together, may account
for the great irregularity of their appearance, even if their
orbits are nearly circular. If their orbits are eccentric, we
have another cause of irregularity, to which may also contri
bute that their period is not nearly the aliquot part of a day.
Their numbers may be considerable, even allowing for the

86              Sir J. W. Lubbock on Shooting Stars.
shortness of their periodic times, for shooting stars are seen so
frequently that they scarcely excite attention or even a passing
remark. The question of their origin seems to have excited
 more controversy than any other; but for the solution of this
 difficulty, I apprehend we possess no data which do not apply
 equally to the moon and to the other bodies of the solar system.
    The motion of the shooting stars is so rapid, that, supposing
 them to shine by the reflected light of the sun, their relative
 position to that of the sun may change considerably, even
 during the short time in which they are visible, and therefore
 not only they may become larger and more brilliant because
 their distance from the spectator is diminished, but also be
 cause the visible portion of their illuminated disc is increased.
  Or, on the other hand, their distance from the spectator in
 creasing, and the visible portion of their illuminated disc de
  creasing, they may cease to be perceptible to the naked eye
  without being eclipsed. But in this case it seems probable that
  their disappearance would not be so sudden; and it is therefore
  desirable that the observershould particularly notice and record
  whether the shooting star disappears suddenly or otherwise.
     If ºx! is the angular velocity in a circle at the same distance
  r from the centre of the earth,
                          8x'= Wºr-38t

  This is greatest in the same orbit when r is least; r is least
  when r=a(1-e); therefore 8x is greatest when
                           8x= M1 He 8x';
  e cannot exceed unity, therefore 8x cannot exceed w I-Fe 8x.
     If ºx" is the angular motion of the moon in 8t, and if r is the
  distance of the centre of the moon from the centre of the earth,
                               Šx'=  r:# 8X".

            r’=237000 ra 4000 (in miles), 8x"='55" (sex.).
   This gives 250" for the angular motion of a satellite in a second
   of time, as seen from the centre of the earth, and moving at
   a distance of 4000 miles from the centre. Suppose the satellite
   to be about 100 miles from the spectator, and to be so situated
   that the angular velocity, as seen by the spectator, is inversely
   as this distance compared with the former distance, the appa
   rent angular velocity would be 170 per second of time, or

              Sir J. W. Lubbock on Shooting Stars.               87
170° per minute. This is equivalent to a velocity of about five
miles per second; according to M. Quetelet, their observed
velocity is, on the average, about twenty miles per second.

considered as a satellite of the earth,

   If the body move in a circle 8x=8X, if &t=1", this gives
8x'=  Boston; (in degrees, p being in miles), the number
between brackets being a logarithm. If p = 100, this gives ºx!
about 10°, and the velocity about eighteen miles per second,
agreeing with the observed velocity.
   The angular velocity in this case, as seen by the spectator,
would depend partly upon the motion of the earth in its orbit,
and upon its direction relatively to that of the other moving body.
    Perhaps it may be found upon investigation, that some
shooting stars belong to one class and some to the other. The
periods of satellites would necessarily be so short, that the
appearances might be satisfied by a small number of such
bodies, because their apparitions would recur so frequently.
 But if the shooting stars are bodies revolving in space, the
same body would be seen so seldom, that the conclusion seems
in that case unavoidable, that the number of such bodies must
 be very great. Experience leads to the conclusion, that,
 under favourable circumstances, there is scarcely a night in
 which several are not visible. Nor is there any reason à priori
 for supposing that such bodies abound more in orbits nearly
 intersecting the orbit of the earth than in any other part of
 the planetary system. It seems natural to suppose, that, coming
 so very near the earth, the attraction of the earth would in
 some cases overcome the attraction of the sun, and cause the
 body to revolve in future as a satellite.     If we adopt the fol
 lowing data,
    Distance of the sum = 95,000,000 miles,
    Distance of the moving body from the centre of the earth
 = 4000 miles,

88     Mr. Claudet on different Properties of Solar Radiation
   The interesting calculations of M. Petitº, Director of the
Observatory of Toulouse, not only render probable the exist
ence of small satellites, but tend to establish the identity of a
body revolving round the earth in about 3 hours 20 minutes.
   I have endeavoured in this paper to point out the import
ance of marking the exact time and place of disappearance;
for although if the place is found at any point of the path by two
different observers, theoretically the parallax could be ascer
tained, in practice this method is beset with great difficulties.
    It seems to me that the splitting of the falling stars, like a
rocket and the trains of light, a phaenomenon often witnessed,
might, if other circumstances were favourable to the explana
tion, be accounted for by supposing the star to graze the sur
face of the shadow before absolute immersion.
    Close to the earth's surface, the linear distance traversed in
the penumbra must be small; but at greater distances this
will increase, and perhaps render the disappearance less sud
den. If the distance comes out large, it will of course be ne
cessary to recalculate it, supposing the surface of the shadow
to be conical and not cylindrical.

   or preventing a deposit of Mercury on Silver Plates coated
   with Iodine, or its compounds with Bromine or Chlorine,

   Atmosphere.       By A. CLAUDET, Esq. Communicated by Sir

Fº:           the commencement of photography it has been
      known that the red, orange, and yellow rays exert but a
very feeble photogenic influence on the Daguerreotype plate.
The experiments of several philosophers, especially those of
Sir J. Herschel on photogenic papers, published in February
1840, prove that this action is more particularly confined to
the most refrangible part of the prismatic spectrum, commen
cing from the space found covered by the blue rays and ex
tending to the extremity of the violet, and sometimes even
beyond it.
   In 1839, Sir J. Herschel observed that the red rays exer
cised on several photogenic papers an antagonistic action to
the photogenic rays, modifying their effect. Contrary to this,
in 1841, M. Ed. Becquerel presented to the Paris Academy
of Sciences a memoir, in which he announced that the red,

            modified by Coloured Glass Media, &c.            89
orange, and yellow rays were endowed with the property of
continuing the action commenced by the photogenic rays;
these latter he called exciting rays; to the first he gave the
name of continuing rays.
   M. Ed. Becquerel made his experiments on photogenic
papers, and added that he had observed the same effects on
the iodized silver plate.
   Dr. Draper of New York published in the Philosophical
Magazine for November 1842, some remarks on a class of
rays which he supposed to exist in the light of the brilliant
sun of Virginia, and which had the property, when separated,
of entirely suspending the action of the diffused light from the
sky; these antagonistic rays extended from the blue to the
extremity of the red, and appeared to be almost as active in
preventing the decomposition of the iodide of silver as the
blue rays were in producing it.
   In January 1845 a memoir was read by me at the Society
of Arts, London, in a part of which I recommended opticians
to construct object-glasses in which they should particularly
correct the chromatic aberration of the long photogenic space
of the solar spectrum, even at the cost of the achromatism of
the less refrangible rays. This, however, had been already
indicated, without my being aware of it at the time, by Sir J.
Herschel; but I added that the greater separation of the
visual and photogenic focus which might result from such a
combination, according to the quality of the glass employed,
would be an advantage, by dispersing, at the focus or on the
plate, beyond the photogenic lines, the red, orange or yellow
rays; for the reason, that if they were brought to the same
point they would tend to neutralize and destroy the effect of
the photogenic rays.
   In October 1846, M. Lerebours announced to the Paris
Academy of Sciences that the red rays prevented the action
of the photogenic rays; this announcement induced Messrs.
Foucault and Fizeau to publish immediately similar results,
which they had previously consigned to the Academy in a
sealed memoir, bearing date May 1846.
   These communications of Messrs. Lerebours, Foucault and
Fizeau, led Dr. Draper to write a letter, published in the
Philosophical Magazine of February last, repeating his obser
vations on the spectrum of Virginia, adding several other
analogous facts confirming the theory of a protecting and even
destroying action exercised by the least refrangible rays. Dr.
Draper, in the same letter, said that the rays which protect the
plate from ordinary photogenic action are themselves capable,
when isolated, of producing a peculiar photogenic effect.

90    Mr. Claudet on different Properties of Solar Radiation
   Soon after the publication of M. Ed. Becquerel's memoir,
M. Gaudin made some analogous researches on the Daguer
reotype plate; and he succeeded in developing an image as
perfect as that produced by mercury, by submitting the plate,
when taken from the camera obscura, to the action of light
alone under a yellow glass, and without any subsequent ex
posure to mercury.
   This curious discovery gave some hope that, from the sup
posed continuing action of the red and yellow glasses, by
submitting the plate alternately, or simultaneously, to the
action of the mercury and of these glasses, an accelerated de
velopment of the image would result; but all the researches
made to arrive at this point have been fruitless; and, until the
present time, the labours of Messrs. Becquerel and Gaudin
have received no satisfactory explanation or useful application.
   My own experiments, which are the object of this memoir,
seem to prove that M. Ed. Becquerel was mistaken as regards
the Daguerreotype plate, in so far as he attributed to the red,
orange, and yellow glasses a continuing action of the effect of
the photogenic rays.
   In the Daguerreotype, when we speak of the photogenic
effect, we cannot understand any other than that which gives
to the surface an affinity for mercurial vapour.
   In the case of photogenic papers, it is true that the red,
orange, and yellow rays render the parts previously affected
by the photogenic rays black or of a darker colour. It is the
same with the Daguerreotype plate, which after it has been
feebly impressed, darkens rapidly to a violet colour under the
radiation of a red or yellow giass. This is the only continuing
effect I have observed, and this effect is not continuing in a
Daguerreotype sense, it has no relation to the property of
attracting the mercurial vapour; on the contrary, it will be
seen from the experiments which I am about to describe, that
the radiations of red, orange and yellow glasses entirely destroy
this property. There exists then a certain analogy between
the action of the red, orange and yellow glasses upon the pho
togenic papers and the Daguerreotype plate; and this conti
nuing action is probably due to the distinct photogenic action
possessed by these rays, as I am able to prove by facts of a
very positive nature.
   These two photogenic actions result from two different
principles, nevertheless producing similar effects, as to the
colour obtained, on the iodide, bromide or chloride of silver,
whether it be found isolated, as is the case on the photogenic
paper, or it be found in the presence of metallic silver, as
happens upon the Daguerreotype plate; but they produce

             modified by Coloured Glass Media, &c.               91
quite an opposite effect upon the silver plate, whatever may
be the colour previously given to the surface by these two ra
diations, endowing it with a property, the one of attracting,
the other of repelling the mercurial vapours. We must take
care not to confound these two results; we can conceive two
different actions giving the same colour to the iodide of silver,
and we can also conceive that these two actions may be en
dowed with contrary properties as regards the fixation of mer
 curial vapour.
     The facts pointed out by M. Gaudin are the results of an
 action which does not belong to the Daguerreotype, since they
 are manifested without the aid of mercury; for we must not
 lose sight of the fact, that the production of the Daguerreotype
 image is due only to the affinity for mercury of the parts pre
 viously affected by the photogenic rays. It does not then
 follow from the production of an image without mercury, by
 crystallization or some peculiar arrangement of the molecules,
 that the red, orange and yellow rays exert a continuing action
 analogous to that which determines the fixation of mercurial
 vapour.                                  -
     The experiments of Sir J. Herschel, of Dr. Draper, of M.
 Lerebours, and of Messrs. Foucault and Fizeau, to prove the
 protective and destructive action of the red rays, were made
 with the prism.
     These philosophers have thus operated with the isolated
  rays in all their natural purity, and after them it would have
  been useless to seek to confirm or to contradict experiments
  so ably conducted and so conclusive.
     Sir J. Herschel, in a memoir published in the Philosophical
  Magazine for February 1842, approves only of experiments
  made by means of the prism, as they are less subject to error
  from the foreign rays, which the coloured glasses never en
  tirely exclude, This observation is perfectly just in theory,
  but in practice, in the particular case of the photogenic power
  of different rays and of their different actions, it will be found
  that these phaenomena can be studied with greater facility by
  using coloured glasses, and that the feeble quantity of foreign
  rays which they admit, far from interfering with the deductions
  of the experimenter, serve only to confirm and to render them
  more conclusive. We shall presently see that these foreign
  rays are completely neutralized in this class of experiments,
  and it would have been unfortunate not to have added these
  tests to those of the solar spectrum, since by the aid of coloured
  glasses I have been enabled, not only to confirm certain pro
   perties of the pure spectrum, but also to discover some others
  which had escaped my predecessors.

92    Mr. Claudet on different Properties of Solar Radiation
   Having examined with a prism the light transmitted through
the glasses used in these experiments, I found that the red
absorbs two-thirds of the prismatic spectrum, from the space
covered by the green to the extremity of the violet, leaving
the red, orange, and a little yellow, followed by a very slight
trace of green. The orange glass gave more yellow, the green
being more decided. The light yellow glass intercepted the
half of the spectrum; the red was less intense than in the
preceding; the yellow occupied two-thirds of its total length,
and the green became very distinct; but as far as my sight
allowed me to judge, I could not discover any portion of blue
in either case: certainly in the spectrum of the red glass there
was not the least trace of it.
   I will now detail the series of observations I have made
upon light transmitted through certain media—the vapours of
the atmosphere, and red, orange, and yellow glasses. These
experiments have brought forth some results which will I hope
contribute to lay the foundation of a more complete theory of
the photographic phaenomena.
   Having noticed, one densely foggy day, that the disc of the
sun was of a deep red colour, I directed my apparatus towards
it. After ten seconds of exposure I put the prepared plate in
the mercury box, and I obtained a round image perfectly
black. The sun had produced no photogenic effect. In an
other experiment I left the plate operating for twenty minutes.
The sun had passed over a certain space of the plate, and
there resulted an image seven or eight times the sun's dia
meter in length; it was black throughout, so that it was evi
dent, wherever the red disc of the sun had passed, not only
was there a want of photogenic action, but the red rays had
destroyed the effect produced previous to the sun's passage.
I repeated these experiments during several days successively,
operating with a sun of different tints of red and yellow.
These different tints produced nearly the same effect: where
ever the sun had passed there existed a black band.
   I then operated in a different manner: not content with the
slow motion of the sun, I moved the camera obscura from
right to left, and vice versá, lowering it each time by means of
a screw. In this manner the sun passed rapidly over five or
six zones of the plate. Its passage was marked by long black
bands of the diameter of the sun, whilst the intervals were
white. It was then evident that the red and yellow rays, which
alone were capable of piercing the fog, had destroyed the
action produced by the little photogenic light which came
from the zenith.
   I then operated with coloured glasses. After exposing a

             modified by Coloured Glass Media, &c.             93
plate covered with a piece of black lace to daylight, I covered
one half, and submitted the other to the radiation of a red
glass : the mercury developed an image of the lace on the
part which had been acted on only by the white light; the
other, which had afterwards received the action of the red
rays, remained black. The red glass had destroyed the pho
togenic effect in the same manner as it had been done by the
red light of the sun.
    I made the same experiment with orange and yellow glasses,
and obtained analogous results, but in different times.
    Then, having exposed a plate to daylight, I subsequently
covered it with a piece of black lace, and exposed it again
under a red glass: this produced a negative image. The red
had destroyed the effect of the white light in the intervals of
the lace, the threads of which preventing the action of the red
glass, produced a white image upon a black ground. In
operating in this manner upon one-half of the plate, exposing
the other half covered only by the same lace to the light of
the day, I obtained by the first a negative, and by the second
a positive image. The orange and yellow glasses give the
same result, paying regard to the difference of time in their
respective actions.
    All these experiments prove what has been already observed
by others before me, but in a different manner, that the red,
 orange, and yellow rays destroy the effect of the photogenic
 light, whether these rays be produced by the prism or by the
 action of coloured media; but, I believe, it has not been ob
 served by any one before me, that after the destruction of the
 photogenic effect the plate is perfectly restored to its former
 sensitiveness to white light.
    After exposing a plate to daylight, and then submitting it
 to the destructive action of red, orange or yellow rays, it will
 be found again sensitive to the same white light.
    I have obtained plates which present an equal and uniform
 image, although the one-half had been exposed to light, and
 then restored by the red, orange, or yellow glass, while the
 other half had received only the single and final radiation.
  We may then expose a plate to light, destroy this effect by the
  action of red or yellow glass, which renders it again sensitive;
  then expose it again to light, destroy this second effect by the
  same coloured glass, and so on for many times, without
 changing the properties of the surface; so that if we stop after
 any of the exposures to white light, the plate will receive
 mercury; but if we stop after any of the exposures to red,
 orange or yellow light, we shall obtain no fixation of mercurial
 vapour.

94    Mr. Claudet on different Properties of Solar Radiation
    Having exposed a plate to the two actions alternately, first,
once upon one zone, twice upon another, and so on until the
last zone had been exposed and destroyed six times, I covered
the plate with a piece of black lace or an engraving, finally
exposing the whole to white light; the result was an equal
deposit of mercury upon the whole surface of the plate. The
impression of the lace or engraving seemed to be the result of
a single exposition to light, as would have been the case with
a normal plate; therefore the action of the red, orange, or
yellow glass upon a plate previously affected by light, produces
the same effect as a fresh exposure to the vapours of iodine or
bromine, when we wish to restore the plate to its first sensi
tiveness.
    This restoring property of the coloured glasses may be of
great use in the Daguerreotype manipulation. Instead of
preparing the plates in the dark, it may be done with impunity
 in the open light. To give sensitiveness, we have only to place
the plate for some minutes under a red glass before putting it
 in the camera obscura.     The frame or box used to hold the
 plate, if furnished with a red glass at the bottom, will serve
 for this restoration. I have obtained in this manner images
 equal in effect to those produced on plates prepared in the
 dark.
    This possibility of preparing plates in open day offers a
 great advantage to those who wish to take views or pictures
 abroad, and who cannot conveniently obtain a dark room.
 Again, in the case of a plate which has been left too long in
 the camera obscura, or accidentally exposed to the light, instead
 of rejecting it, we can restore its sensitiveness by placing it
 under a red glass. There is still another useful application
 of this property: if after one or two minutes' exposure to the
 mercury we perceive the image is too rapidly developing, or
 presenting signs of solarization, which a practised eye disco
 vers before it is too much advanced, we have only to stop this
 accumulation of mercury by exposing the plate for a few
 seconds to the red light, and again place it in the mercury
 box, to complete the modifications, which give the image all
 its tones and the most favourable tint. In truth, we may com
 plete all the operations of the Daguerreotype in the open air,
 in the middle of a field if necessary. We can introduce the
 plate into the mercury box, in the same manner that we did
 in the camera obscura, by means of the same frame and red
 glass, which also serves to protect it when we take it from the
 mercury to rapidly view its development. I say rapidly, for
 if we expose it too long to the red light, the photogenic effect
 will be neutralized. We shall presently see that the time

              modified by Coloured Glass Media, &c.               95
required to observe the state of the image is not sufficient to
affect its affinity for mercury, if it be found requisite to replace
it in the mercury box. The exposure under red glass neces
sary to destroy the effect produced by white light, must be a
hundred times longer than has been the exposure to white
light, that of the orange glass fifty times, and that of the yel
low glass only ten times; thus a plate exposed to white light
for a second will be restored to its former sensitiveness in ten
seconds by the yellow glass, in fifty by the orange, and in a
hundred by the red. As soon as the sensitiveness of the plate
affected by white light is restored by the coloured glasses, it
may be affected again by the photogenic light. It is not even
necessary that the restoration should be complete; at each
degree of restoration the plate is capable of receiving an accu
mulation of photogenic effect. If the red rays have not acted
 more than fifty times longer than the daylight, only half of the
 effect will be destroyed; if twenty-five times longer, one-fourth;
 and so on in proportion.
    Besides the destructive action of the red, orange and yellow
 glasses, these same radiations are endowed with a photogenic
 power, that is to say, they have, like the blue and violet rays,
 the power of causing the fixation of mercurial vapour. There
 fore these radiations are endowed with two contrary actions;
 the one destructive of the effect of the photogenic light, and
 the other analogous to the effect of this light.
    If the red, orange, and yellow radiations of the prism had
 not also the power of operating photogenically, it might be
 supposed that this action of the coloured glasses was due to
 some of the most refrangible rays transmitted by these coloured
 media. But this cannot be; for if the photogenic action of
 the red, orange, and yellow rays were the same as that of the
 more refrangible rays, it could never develope itself under the
 destructive action which the same glasses carry with them.
    But there is yet more; each ray of the spectrum has its
 own photogenic action, and they are in this respect indepen
 dent of each other, and of a different kind; so that the one
 cannot continue the effect commenced by the other, whether
 it be for the production or for the destruction of the photo
 genic effect. I would again observe, whenever I speak of a
 photogenic effect, I mean that which gives to the Daguerreo
 type plate the property of attracting the vapours of mercury.
    If we expose a plate covered by an engraving to the red
 light 5000 times longer than is required to produce an effect
 by white light, we obtain by the fixation of mercury a feeble
 image, the lights of which are of a gray tone. I could never
 go beyond this feeble image, which appeared to be the maxi

96 Mr. Claudet on different Properties of Solar Radiation
mum of effect for the red glass. It is impossible to attribute
this effect to some feeble quantity of rays, properly called
photogenic, passing through the coloured glasses, for we have
seen that the blue and violet rays cannot operate under the
destructive action of the red rays; this fact proves then evi
dently, that if the red radiation has a photogenic effect, it
cannot be due to the same principle which produces the pho
togenic effect of the rays situated at the other extremity of the
spectrum. The yellow glass has also a peculiar photogenic
action of its own, it is a hundred times slower than that of
white light, whilst its destructive action is not more than ten
times as slow. We can obtain by the photogenic action of
the yellow glass an image almost identical, as to force and
colour, with an image produced by daylight; with this differ
ence, that the excess of action does not give the blue solari
zation which we observe upon plates strongly affected by day
light.
  *†e different nature of the photogenic action of red, orange,
and yellow glasses, from that of the daylight, is also proved
by the fact, that the photogenic action produced by these co
loured glasses cannot be destroyed by their own reversing
action, although the red will destroy the photogenic action of
fºllow,
 ight.
             and both of these will destroy the action of day
  *... double property of producing and destroying a pho
togenic effect is manifested upon a specimen which offers on
one-half of the plate a negative image, and upon the other half
a positive image, produced at the same time by the same
radiation. The length of time necessary to operate with the
red glass has not allowed me to obtain a good impression, but
I have succeeded perfectly with the yellow glass. The expe
riment is especially beautiful, and has been thus made :-
   I exposed one-half of the plate to daylight for one second,
keeping the other half in the dark. The entire plate was then
covered with an engraving and exposed under a light yellow
glass during ten seconds for the part previously affected by
white light, and during a hundred seconds for that which had
been kept in the dark. The yellow glass destroyed on the
first half the effect of the daylight wherever the plate was not
protected by the black lines of the engraving, and the parts
only which under these lines had been protected from the
destructive action, received the mercury, producing a negative
image; while the same radiation of the yellow glass had ope
rated photogenically upon the other half, developing a positive
image by the fixation of mercury upon the parts correspond
ing to the lights of the engraving.

              modified by Coloured Glass Media, &c.           97
    Having exposed a plate with an engraving under the red
glass for sixty minutes, I replaced the red by a yellow glass,
without the engraving; after exposing the half of this plate
for five minutes under this yellow glass, the other half being
kept in the dark, the mercury produced a negative image on
the half exposed to yellow light, while the other gave no trace
of either positive or negative action. This result can only be
explained in the following manner:—
    First. That sixty seconds had not sufficed for the apparent
action of the red upon the half not exposed to the following
radiation of the yellow glass.
    Secondly. That nevertheless there had been the commence
ment of an action upon which the yellow glass had to exercise
its destructive action.
    Thirdly. That while the yellow glass was occupied in de
stroying the photogenic action of the red glass, restoring the
surface to its primitive state, it was exercising a photogenic
action upon the parts protected by the engraving from the red
rays, and in five minutes this photogenic action of the yellow
 glass had produced a negative image by operating upon the
 shadows of the drawing.
    It results from the experiments I have described, that the
 solar radiation, when modified by coloured media, is in the
 Daguerreotype process endowed with several different photo
genic actions, corresponding with various rays of the spec
 trum.
    The various photogenic actions of the modified solar radia
 tion have distinct characters; each of these modifications is
 endowed with a photogenic power peculiar to itself, and which
 gives an affinity for mercurial vapour to the Daguerreotype
 plate. These various actions are so different, that we cannot
 mix them artificially to assist each other, as they are antago
 nistic. The effect commenced by the blue rays is destroyed
 by the red and yellow; that which was produced by the red
 is destroyed by the yellow; the effect of the yellow rays is
 destroyed by the red; and the effect of the two latter is de
 stroyed by the blue; each radiation destroys the effect of the
 others. Thus it appears that each radiation changes the state
 of the surface, and each change produces the sensitiveness to
 mercurial vapour when it does not exist, and destroys this
 sensitiveness when it does exist.
    The alternate change of the state of the plate by these
 various radiations seems to prove that the chemical compound
 remains always the same under these different influences;
 that there is no separation or disengagement of the constituent
 elements.

    If the blue radiation or white light liberates iodine or bro
mine, these elements would evaporate or combine with the
silver surface immediately beneath.        If we take the first idea,
how comes it that the red radiation re-establishes the com
pound in its primitive proportions; and, in the second case,
how does it happen that these rays are capable of decomposing
the surface beneath, liberating the iodine or bromine, and then
combining them again with the upper surface? It is impos
sible to admit that the red radiation is endowed at the same
time with the property of separating and the property of re
uniting the same elements. We must then attribute it to a
particular force—electricity perhaps, which might accompany
each radiation, and which, under the influence of the one,
 would act positively, and negatively under the other, without
changing the chemical compound. In one case this influence
would give the affinity for mercury, and in the other destroy it.
    At all events, we must look for another explanation of the
 phaenomenon than the one which has hitherto been received,
 viz. the decomposition of the iodide of silver by the action of
 light. It is true that light decomposes iodide of silver, form
 ing a subiodide, but this seems to require a longer time than
 that during which the surface is endowed with the property
of attracting the vapours of mercury. In fact, the last pro
 perty is communicated nearly instantaneously, which is not the
case for the decomposition of the iodide by the action of light.

of Maclaurin in a particular case, were universally followed.

And, from the process by which the coefficients have here
been deduced, it is plain that Taylor's development of log
(a + a) is got from this by simply changing the places of a an
w; and that the one development is always convertible into
the other, by thus interchanging the two terms of the binomial
under F. There is therefore no necessity for considering (1.)
and (2.) as distinct theorems: nor is it correct to do so, since
they are both comprehended under the same form; for which
ever be the term according to whose powers the development
is to proceed, the coefficients are always to be derived from
the function after that term is made zero. Hence, calling either
term, indifferently, t, and denoting the differential coefficients
derived, as here explained, by Dr. D., &c., the following
theorem comprehends both (1.) and (2.):
                                   #2        #3
                 y=D,4-D,t-D.; + D32.3            + &c.
Even when the function is not that of a binomial, but of a
simple monomial, as a , loga, &c., still it will be advisable, in

h=0; for we shall thus always be led to true developments,
and thence to the cases in which the sought developments are
impossible, these being indicated by the hypothesis of h =0
causing the coefficients to become infinite. And it is obvious,
from the method above described, that the coefficients of the
development of F(a + h) are just as readily obtained as those
derived from F(w) in the usual way.
    In thus recommending that a be replaced by a +h, when
the development of F(r) is required in powers of r, it will be
observed, from what is said above, that it is merely proposed
 to deduce Do, D, D, &c. from F (h). If these are infinite
 when h = 0, the inference will be, that, with finite coefficients,
 the development is impossible. Butif we leave h undetermined,
 and put, in the series, a -h for w, we shall then get the deve
 lopment of F(a), with finite coefficients, in powers of a -h;
 and as h is arbitrary, we may thus approach as near to the
 proposed development as we please. And although for the
 purposes of actual numerical computation, the coefficients
 would become more and more unmanageable, from their in
 creasing magnitude, as h approaches to zero, yet even in this
 extreme case—in which the coefficients actually become infi
 nite—the development, regarded as the last of the series of
 developments here spoken of, will still be analytically true.

  XVI. On the Production of Light by Chemical Action. By
     John WILLIAM DRAPER, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in
     the University of New York”.
  THE        production of light and heat by the combustion of
        various bodies is, of all chemical processes, that which
  ministers most to the comfort and well-being of man. By it
  the rigour of winter is moderated, and night made almost as
  available for our purposes as the day.
     One would suppose that, of a phaenomenon on which so
  much of our personal and social happiness depends, and which
  must have been daily witnessed by every man that has ever
  lived, all the particulars ought to have been long ago known.
  Among scientific men its importance has been universally re
  cognized. The early theories of chemistry, such as those of
  Stahl and Lavoisier, are essentially theories of combustion.
     It is nevertheless remarkable how little positive knowledge
  we still possess on this subject. Some chemists believe that

the light emitted by flames is due to electric discharges;
others, regarding light and heat as material bodies, which can
be incorporated or united with ponderable substances, suppose
that they are disengaged as chemical changes go on. In this
confusion of opinions, a multitude of interesting and hitherto
unanswered questions present themselves. It is known that
different substances when burning emit lights of different co
lours: thus sulphur and carbonic oxide burn blue, wax yellow,
and cyanogen lilac. What are the chemical conditions that
determine these singular differences? How is it that, by
changing the circumstances of combustion, we can vary the
nature of the light? We turn aside the flame of a candle by
means of a blowpipe, and a neat blue cone appears; why does
it shine with a blue light?
   Such inquiries might be multiplied without end; but a little
consideration shows that their various answers depend on the
determination of a much more general problem; viz. can any
connewion be traced between the chemical conditions under which
a body burns, and the nature of the light it emits? It is to the
discussion of that problem that this memoir is devoted.
    Sir H. Davy has already furnished us with two important
circumstances in relation to the nature of flame:–1st. All
common flames are incandescent shells, the interior of which
is dark; 2nd, the relative quantity of light emitted depends
on the temporary disengagement of solid particles.
   It is only by a very general examination of the light arising
from various solids, vapours and gases, when burning, that
we can expect to obtain data for a true theory of combustion.
This is what I shall endeavour to furnish on the present oc
casion.
   As was foreseen by all the older chemists, the true theory
of combustion, whatever it may prove to be, must necessarily
be one of the fundamental theories of chemistry. It must in
clude the nature of all chemical changes whatsoever. The sub
ject is therefore not alone interesting in a popular sense, but
 of great importance in its scientific connexions.
 I. Prismatic analysis of the flames of various vapours and
   gases; proving that they yield all the colours of the spectrum.
    I commenced this investigation of the nature of flame, and
 of combustion generally, by an optical examination of various
 bodies in the act of burning. Some authors have asserted
 that certain flames yield monochromatic lights. It is necessary
 to verify this assertion if true, or set it aside if false.
    The instrumental arrangement which I have employed is as
 follows:—The rays of the flame, of which the examination is to

102
      -
              Prof. Draper on the Production of Light
be made, pass through a horizontal slit ºth of an inch wide
and one inch long in a metallic screen, and are received at a
distance of six or eight feet on a flint-glass prism, the axis of
which is parallel to the slit. After passing the prism they
enter a small telescope, which has a divided micrometer, and
also parallel wires in its eye-piece. Through this telescope the
resulting spectrum is viewed.
    If it be the flame of a lamp of any kind that is to be ex
amined, by using a moveable stand we are able to raise or
lower it, and thus analyse different horizontal elements in its
lower, its middle, or its upper part at pleasure. If, instead of
a horizontal, we wish to examine a vertical element of the flame,
the slit and the prism must of course be set vertically. The
former mode possesses great advantages, as will be presently
pointed out. It is to be understood, in all cases, that the eye
piece of the telescope is adjusted to give a sharp image of the
slit, and the prism is at its angle of minimum deviation.
    By this arrangement I have examined a great number of
different flames; as those of oil, alcohol, solution of boracic
acid and nitrate of strontian in alcohol, phosphorus, sulphur,
carbonic oxide, hydrogen, cyanogen, arseniuretted hydrogen,
&c. Among these it will be noticed different colours occur.
Oil gives a yellow flame, alcohol a pale blue, boracic acid
green, strontian red, phosphorus yellowish-white, sulphur and
carbonic oxide blue, hydrogen pale yellow, cyanogen lilac,
arseniuretted hydrogen white, &c.
    Notwithstanding this diversity of colour, all these flames, as
well as many others I have tried, yield the same result: every
prismatic colour is found in them. Even in those cases where
the flame is very faint, as in alcohol and hydrogen gas, not
only may red, yellow, green, blue, and violet light be traced,
but even bright Fraunhoferian lines of different colours.
    This observation holds good for those flames reputed to be
monochromatic; for example, alcohol burnt from a wick im
bued with common salt. It is not alone a yellow light which
is evolved; the other colours plainly, though more faintly,
appear.
    All flames, no matter what their primitive colours may be,
evolve all the prismatic rays. Their special tints arise from
 the preponderance of one class of rays over another; thus in
 cyanogen the reds predominate, and in sulphur the blues.
    The production of light, in the case of flames, is thus proved
 to be a very complex phaenomenon. The chemical conditions
 under which their burning takes place are likewise very com
 plex. The combustible vapour is surrounded on all sides by
 atmospheric air: diffusion occurs, and rapid currents are
                                                             *

                        by Chemical Action.                     103
established by the high temperature. Such circumstances
complicate the result; and it is only by observing the burning
of an elementary solid, in which most of these disturbances
are cut off, that we can hope to effect a proper resolution of
the problem.
II. Prismatic analysis of the light of an elementary solid burn
    ing at different temperatures ; proving that as the tempera
    ture rises the more refrangible rays appear.
    I took from the fire a mass of anthracite coal, the fuel or
dinarily used in domestic oeconomy in New York, and which
from its compactness, the intense heat it evolves, and other
properties, appears to be well-fitted for such investigations as
 the present. This coal was placed on a support, so as to pre
 sent a plane surface to the slit in the metal screen. The rays
coming from it and passing the slit were received on a flint
glass prism, and viewed through the telescope.
    When the coal was first taken from the fire, and was burn
ing very intensely, on looking through the telescope I saw all
the coloured rays of the spectrum in their proper order.          I
had previously passed through the slit a beam of sunlight re
flected from a mirror, that I might have a standard spectrum
with fixed lines. Now when the coal was burning at its utmost
vigour, the spectrum it gave did not seem to me to differ either
as respects length or the distribution of its colours from the
spectrum of sunlight; but as the combustion declined, and
the coal burnt less brightly, I saw that its spectrum was be
coming less and less, the shortening taking place at the more
refrangible extremity, one ray after another disappearing in
due succession.      First the violet became extinct, then the
indigo, then the blue, then the green, until at last the red,
with an ash-gray light occupying the place of the yellow was
alone visible, and presently this also went out.
   From numerous experiments of this sort, I conclude that
there is a connerion between the refrangibility of the light which
a burning body yields, and the intensity of the chemical action
going on ; and that the refrangibility always increases as the
chemical action increases. It may perhaps be objected by some,
that, in the form of experiment here introduced, two totally
different things are confounded; and that the burning coal
not only gives forth its rays as a combustible body, strictly
speaking, but also as an incandescent mass.
   To avoid this objection as far as possible, and also to
reach a much higher temperature than could have been other
wise obtained, I threw a stream of oxygen gas on that portion
of the anthracite which was opposite the slit; but my expec

104.         Prof. Draper on the Production of Light
tations were disappointed; for instead of the combustion being
increased, the coal was actually extinguished by the jet play
ing on it. I therefore replaced the anthracite with a flat piece
of well-burnt charcoal, kindled at the part opposite the slit,
and throwing a stream of oxygen on this part, the combustion
was greatly increased; and through the telescope I saw a spec
trum rivalling that of the sunbeams in brilliancy, all the co
lours, from the extreme red to the extreme violet, being present.
   Now on shutting off the supply of oxygen the combustion
of course declined; and whilst this was going on, I looked
through the telescope and saw the violet, the indigo, the blue,
the green, &c. fade away in succession. By merely turning
the stopcock, through which the oxygen came, I could re
establish the original colours or witness their decline. And
it was very interesting to see with what unerring regularity,
as the chemical action became more intense, the more refran
gible colours were developed; and how, as it declined, they
disappeared in due succession; the final tint being red, and
that ash-gray in the position of the yellow, which I have de
scribed in my former memoir. (Phil. Mag. May 1847, p. 349.)
   In the form of experiment here made the combustion is of
course merely superficial; and the rays come from the char
coal, not as an incandescent, but as a burning body.
III. Of the constitution of flames ; proving that they consist of
       a series of concentric and differently coloured shells.
   I regard the foregoing experiments as affording the means
of explanation of the much more complicated phaenomena of
flames; and proceed to inquire whether the principle I have just
brought forward, of the co-ordinate increase of refrangibility
and chemical action, will hold good, premising the experiments
now to be detailed with the following considerations.
   All common flames, as is well-known, consist of a thin
shell of ignited matter, the interior being dark, the combustion
taking effect on those points only which are in contact with
the air.    From the circumstances under which the air is usu
ally supplied, this ignited shell cannot be a mere mathematical
superficies, but must have a sensible thickness. If we imagine
it to consist of a series of strata, it is obvious that the phaeno
mena of combustion are different for each. The outer stratum
is in absolute contact with the air, and there the combustion
is most perfect; but by reason of the rapid diffusion of gases
into one another, currents, and other such causes, the atmo
spheric air must necessarily pervade the burning shell to a
certain depth; and in the successive strata, as we advance
inwards, the activity of the burning must decline. On the
                           ---

                        by Chemical Action.                   105
exterior stratum oxygen is in excess, at the interior the com
bustible vapour, and between these limits there must be an
admixture of the two, which differs at different depths. Ad
mitting the results of the foregoing experiments with anthra
cite coal and charcoal to be true, viz. that as combustion is
more active rays of a higher degree of refrangibility are
 evolved, it follows that each point of the superficies of every
flame, no matter what the combustible may be, must yield all the
colours of the spectrum, the violet coming from the outer strata,
 the yellow from the intermediate, and the red from those
 within. If we could isolate an elementary horizontal section
 of a flame, it should exhibit the appearance of a rainbow-ring;
 and when those compound rays are received on the face of a
 prism, the constituent colours are parted out, by reason of
 their different refrangibility, and the eye thus made sensible
 of their actual existence.
     When thus, by the aid of a prism, we analyse the light that
 comes from any portion of the superficies of a flame, we in
 effect dissect out in a convenient manner, and arrange together
 side by side, rays that have come from different strata of the
 burning shell. These, without the prism, would have pursued
  the same normal path, and produced a commixed effect on
  the eye, but with it are separated transversely, and each be
  comes perceptible.
     It might be supposed that, in the familiar instance of an
  oil-lamp, if we put any check on the supply of the air and
  thereby check the intensity of combustion, we ought to have
  the flame emitting rays of light, the refrangibility of which
  becomes less and less, and which, from their being quite white,
  should pass through different shades of orange, and end in a
  dull red. But the compound nature of the burning vapour
  interferes with that result; for when a certain point is gained,
  the hydrogen for the most part alone burns, the carbon being
  set free as smoke, and such a flame cannot support itself in
  strict accordance with the principle given.
      We must then search for other conditions under which car
  bon is found which are free from this difficulty. Two at once
  present themselves; they are carbonic oxide and cyanogen
  gas. In the former the carbon is already united with half the
   quantity of oxygen required for maximum oxidation, its com
   plete combustion can therefore be carried on with a limited
   supply of atmospheric air; in the latter the carbon is united
   with nitrogen, which during combustion is set free, and inter
   feres with the process by cutting off the more complete access
   of the atmosphere.
      In place of the burning coal of the former experiments I

        106          Prof. Draper on the Production of Light
       substituted a jet-pipe, through which the various gases might
        be made to pass, and the rays emitted by their flames enter the
       telescope after passing through the slit and prism. In this
       arrangement the slit should be horizontal and not vertical.
        So far from its being immaterial which of the two positions is
       selected, very great advantages arise from the former. If the
       slit be vertical, the prism it is true will separate the constituent
       colours from one another, but it fails to show their relative
       position. If it be horizontal, the relative positions of the dif
       ferent colours can be demonstrated; and it can be proved that
       a horizontal section of a flame is in reality, as has been already
       remarked, a coloured ring, the red being the innermost colour
       and the violet outside; for if this is the order in which the
       colours occur, the red ring must necessarily have a less dia
       meter than the green, and the green than the violet; and
       when the prism, set in a horizontal position, separates those
       colours from each other, the sides of the resulting spectrum
       ought not to be parallel but inclined to one another, the
       breadth being least in the red, and increasing as we pass to
       the violet end. This increasing breadth proves that the con
       stituent coloured shells of the flame envelope each other, the
       violet being outermost and therefore broadest. This valuable
       indication would be wholly lost if the slit was vertical.
          This being understood, I may illustrate the facts now to be
       brought forward by an example of the prismatic analysis of a
       horizontal element of the flame of a spirit-lamp; it being un
       derstood that the prism is at its angle of minimum deviation,
       and the spectrum seen through the telescope. All the pris
       matic colours in their proper order are visible, the sides of the
       spectrum not being parallel, the inclination being quite rapid
       toward the red extremity, the rays of which come from the
       interior of the flame where the diameter is less.         Mere in
       spection is sufficient to show the rapid approach of the red
       sides to each other; and I satisfied myself that, even in the
       more refrangible regions, there is the same want of parallelism,
       by rotating the telescope on its vertical axis, so that the vertical
       wires in its eye-piece might coincide with first one and then
       the other side of the spectrum. It will be understood that I
       took the proper precaution not to be deceived by a partial
      want of achromaticity in the telescope, which might have led
      to a mistake.
          But, further, the yellow space of such a spirit-flame spec
_--~~
      trum is crossed by a bright fixed line,—Sir David Brewster’s
      monochromatic ray. It is a beautiful example of the principles
      just pointed out in this method of horizontal analysis, being
      of much greater width than the rest of the spectrum, and re

                           by Chemical Action.                                 107
calling to the imagination the appearance of Saturn's ring
when nearly closed and seen through a telescope of moderate
power. This ray, from its superior breadth, must neces
sarily come from that pale tawny light which invests the
bright part of the flame. This, which is readily seen when
the flame is large, envelopes the middle and upper parts, but
cannot so easily be detected low down. It is to be attri
buted to the carbonic acid and steam that have risen at a high
temperature in the burning shell, and are escaping at a degree
above that of incandescence into the air, and are mingled with
oxygen diffusing from the air into them. A similar tawny
cloak surrounds the upper part of the flame of a candle; it
answers to the oxidizing flame of the blowpipe, and yields
Brewster's monochromatic yellow light.

                  Fig. 2.     Air in the interior of a flame.

108         Prof. Draper on the Production of Light
represents the spectrum of carbonic oxide burning in the air.
It begins in the red region short of the fixed line C, and termi
nates between the lines G and H. It yields therefore rays of
every colour; and this is in accordance with the principles I
have laid down; but when the relative quantity and force of the
rays are estimated, in comparison with the sunlight spectrum,
the red and orange are deficient, and the more refrangible
colours predominate, and indeed it is the excess of these that
gives the flame its characteristic blue tint. This agrees with
what has been observed as to anthracite and charcoal; for
with carbonic oxide a very limited supply of oxygen can bring
about the maximum chemical action, and therefore liberate in
abundance rays of maximum refrangibility.
    This condition of things is inverted in the case of cyanogen
gas. It is the nature of its flame to be enveloped, as it were,
in a sheet of nitrogen arising from its own burning; and this
necessarily impedes the access of air, and checks the intensity
of the chemical change; a check which is at once betokened
by the emission of a predominant number of rays of low re
frangibility, or of a red colour.
    But there is a striking difference in the chemical conditions
under which carbonic oxide and cyanogen burn. In the case
 of the former the whole gas is combustible, in the latter the
 carbon alone; and we have in reality introduced an incom
 bustible element into the flame; for as the carbon burns, the
 incombustible nitrogen is set free. It occurred to me, in se
 lecting this gas for experiment, that this condition should im
 press a physical characteristic on the flame. I thought it was
 not impossible that dark lines in its spectrum might be the
 result; because there must be a peculiar arrangement of the
 burning strata, which together make up the shell of the flame,
 every two atoms of carbon setting free one of nitrogen. I did
 not know until subsequently that this flame had already been
 examined by Mr. Faraday. Having therefore confined some
 cyanogen, made from the cyanide of mercury, in a glass gas
 holder, which was filled with a saturated solution of common
 salt, I burnt it from the jet-pipe, and found that what I had
 surmised was actually the fact. There was a spectrum so
 beautiful, that it is impossible to describe it by words or depict
 it in colours. It was crossed throughout its extent by black
 lines, separating it into well-marked divisions. I could plainly
 count four great red rays of definite refrangibility, followed
 by one orange, one yellow, and seven green; whilst in the
 more refrangible spaces were two extensive groups of black
 lines, recalling somewhat from their position, but greatly ex
 ceeding in extent, Fraunhofer's lines marked G and H in the

                      by Chemical Action.                      109
sun rays. I shall return to the consideration of this spectrum
and to the nature of fixed lines presently; here only making
the remark, that the burning of cyanogen, both as respects
the colour of the light and the occurrence of fixed lines, is a
direct consequence of the principle I am establishing.
    The unassisted eye detects two well-marked regions in the
cyanogen flame; a greenish-gray stratum on the outside,
and a lilac-coloured nucleus within. Decomposed by the
prism, a horizontal element of this flame shows that the exte
rior shell contains all the prismatic colours, except perhaps
the yellow ; but the green, the blue, and the violet greatly
predominate. The interior lilac flame is the source of the
 bright spectrum with fixed lines just described.
W. Continuation of the same principle in the case where com
  bustion is carried on in ovygen gas instead of atmospheric air.
    If the principle that high refrangibility is connected with
 intense chemical action be true, it must hold good when the
 nature of the atmosphere in which the burning is carried for
 ward is changed. If instead of being the common air it is
 oxygen gas, we ought to be able to foresee the result. Car
 bonic oxide, when made to burn in that gas, should not change
 its tint; because if the air can carry on the process to its
 maximum effect, oxygen can do no more. But the result
 should be just the reverse with cyanogen, which, if made to
 burn in oxygen, should be capable of emitting rays of higher
 refrangibility.
     Foreseeing this result, I proceeded to submit the two gases .
 to the test of experiment, and first arranged the carbonic oxide
  that its spectrum might be examined in the telescope as already
 described; then causing a clean bell-jar full of oxygen to be
  inverted over it, the flame diminished somewhat in size, emit
  ted a slight crackling sound, but retained its colour unchanged.
  Its spectrum appeared precisely the same, both as respects
  extent and the distribution of colour, whether the burning
  took place in oxygen gas or in the atmospheric air.
     If cyanogen be made to burn in oxygen, we should expect
  that it would lose to a great extent its characteristic lilac tint,
  and enmit a whiter light. It was therefore very interesting to
  find, that the moment the flame was immersed in oxygen it
  lost much of its pinkish colour, and became of a dazzling
  brilliancy: and on examination through the telescope, though
  all the colours had increased in brightness, the most remark
  able effect took place among the extreme refrangible rays,
   Far out of the limits of the ordinary spectrum, a ray of great

 1 10        Prof. Draper on the Production of Light
purity and force was developed, as represented in fig. 1,No. 5.
Its colour is violet.
    I have made similar experiments on many other flames
besides those here mentioned. It is not necessary to relate
them in detail, for they give the same results. In every in
stance of combustion in the air, when the flame is bright
enough, all the colours are visible; and when the combustion
takes place in oxygen, they are increased in intensity. With
hydrogen gas and alcohol, the light is so feeble that the eye
cannot catch the terminal rays; but as soon as the combustion
is made in oxygen, the red and the violet both appear, the
latter however predominating. Several of these spectra, both
in air and oxygen, are represented in fig. 1. In No. 9, the
letters mg and ml indicate a maximum of green and of blue
light in the form of bright lines.
    It does not require the use of a prism to satisfy oneself of
the change of tint that flames exhibit when the chemical action
increases. In reality it is only necessary to contrast the colour
of the light emitted in air and oxygen gas. In the latter case
rays of a higher refrangibility uniformly arise.
    On the evidence furnished by the foregoing experiments, I
regard all flames as consisting of a shell of ignited matter in.
which combustion is going on with different degrees of rapidity
at different depths, being most rapid at the exterior where
there is a more perfect contact with the atmosphere, and
diminishing inwards. In a horizontal section, the interior
space, consisting of unburnt vapour, is black; this is sur
rounded by a ring where the combustion is incipient, and
from which red light issues; then follow orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, and violet circles in succession, the production
of each of these tints being dependent on the rapidity with
which chemical action is going forward, that is, on the amount
of oxygen present; the tints gradually shading off into one
another, and forming, as I have already said, a circular rainbow.
An eye placed on the exterior of such a flame, sees all the
colours conjointly, and from their general mixture arises the
predominant tint.
    An examination of the flame of a candle vertically confirms
this conclusion; for the red projects on the top of the flame,
and the blue towards the bottom.
    From this, which may be regarded as the normal flame, the
flame of cyanogen differs. It must consist of as many con
centric shells as the prism separates it into regions of definite
refrangibility. The interior part is therefore divided into four
red layers, followed by one of orange, one of yellow, seven of
green, &c. There are two great inactive spaces towards the

                       by Chemical Action.                     1 11
outside of the flame, corresponding to the two great groups of
fixed lines. Perhaps through all these inactive parts the in
combustible nitrogen chiefly escapes.
VI. Effects of the introduction of air into the interior of a
   flame, producing the destruction of the red and orange strata,
   and converting them into violet.
    It now becomes a curious subject of inquiry to determine
what must take place when an ordinary flame is disturbed
by the introduction of air into its interior. When a blow
pipe jet is thrown through the flame of an oil-lamp, the sharp
blue cone which forms, indicates, on the principles here set
forth, that the combustion is much more active.        But if the
colours of a common flame come from different depths, the
red being the innermost, it is clear that the introduction of a
jet of air by a blowpipe should make the combustion rapid
where before it was slowest, and the less refrangible colours
ought to be destroyed. A prismatic analysis should exhibit
the spectrum of a blowpipe flame without any red or orange.
    In this examination no slit is required, as in the former ex
periments, for the cone itself when at a distance of six or eight
feet is narrow enough for the purpose: it yields a very ex
traordinary spectrum. As was anticipated, I found that all
 the red rays were gone, and not a vestige of either them or
the orange could be seen. But the spectrum was divided into
 five well-marked regions, separated from one another by in
 active spaces; in short, I saw five distinct images of the blue
 cone, one yellow, two greens, one blue, and one violet. In fig. 1,
 No. 10, this result is represented.
    This experiment may be verified without a telescope. On
 looking through a prism set horizontally at its angle of mini
 mum deviation, at the blowpipe cone some six or eight feet
 distant, there will be seen a spectrum of that part of the flame
 which does not join in the production of the blue cone. It
 contains of course all the prismatic colours. But projecting
 from this are five coloured images of the cone; one yellow, two
 greens, one blue, and one violet. They are entirely distinct
 from one another, and are parted by dark spaces, fig. 2. (p. 107.)
     Such is the effect of introducing air into the interior of a
 flame and destroying those strata that yield the red and orange
 colours. The effect of a blowpipe is to produce a double stra
 tum of blue light, one being external, the other internal; also
 two strata of green, one again external, the other internal;
 and the escaping products of combustion, steam and carbonic
 acid, mingled with atmospheric air, constitute the oxidizing
 flame which envelopes the blue cone and emits Brewster's

1 12         Prof. Draper on the Production of Light
monochromatic yellow light. That the yellow light comes
from this flame is proved by the greater length of its image.
VII. Physical cause of the production of light by chemical action.
   Do not the various facts here brought forward prove that
all chemical combinations are attended by a rapid vibratory
motion of the parts of the combining bodies, which vibrations
become more frequent as the chemical action is more intense?
   The burning particles which constitute the inner shell of a
flame are executing about four hundred billions of vibrations
in one second; those in the middle about six hundred billions,
and those on the exterior, in contact with the air, about eight
hundred billions in the same time. The quality of the emitted
light, as respects its colour, depending on the frequency with
which those vibrations are accomplished, increases in refran
gibility as the violence of the chemical action becomes greater.
   The parts of all material bodies are in a state of incessant
vibration: that which we call temperature depends on the fre
quency and amplitude of those vibrations conjointly. If by
any process, as by chemical agencies, we increase that fre
quency to between four and eight hundred billions of vibra
tions in one second, ignition or combustion results. In the
case of the former of these numbers the temperature is 977°F.
At this temperature or epoch the waves propagated in the
aether impress the organ of vision with a red-light. This also
is the temperature of the innermost shell of a flame. If the
frequency of vibration still increases, the temperature corre
spondingly rises, and the light successively becomes orange,
yellow, green, blue, &c., and this condition obtains in the suc
cessive strata of a flame as we pass from its interior to its ex
terior superficies.
   The general principle at which I thus arrive, as the final
result of this experimental investigation, viz. that there is a
connexion between the vehemence with which chemical affinity
is satisfied and the refrangibility of the resulting light, assumes
the position of a simple consequence of the undulatory theory.
Is it not very natural, if all chemical changes are attended by
vibratory motions in the particles of the bodies engaged, that
those vibrations should increase in frequency as the action
becomes more violent? But an increased frequency of vibra
tion is the same thing as an increased refrangibility.
    I think that in this manner the theory of ethereal undula
tions is on the point of including many of those fundamental
facts in chemistry which until now have been believed to be
adverse to it, or at all events as standing apart from it. I re
call the admirable remark which Mr. Whewell has made, in
his History of the Inductive Sciences, how this theory, like

                                by Chemical Action.                   J 13
that of universal gravitation, has exhibited all the aspect of a
great physical fact, advancing to the explanation of things that
seemed to have no necessary connexion with it, and converting
what at first sight was regarded as contradictory into the firm
est arguments for its truth.
      VIII. On the physical cause of Fraunhofer’s dark lines.
    Although I have extended this memoir to so great a length,
I have omitted many facts which have been made the subject
of experiment. I cannot however conclude without offering
some remarks on the artificial production and cause of Fraun
hofer's fixed lines.
    It has already been related how I was led to expect the
production of these lines in the flame of cyanogen, from con
sidering the circumstances under which its combustion takes
place. Returning to this phaenomenon, I shall here point out
a very remarkable numerical relation existing among the fixed
lines of the solar spectrum.
    The following table contains Fraunhofer's determination
of the wave-lengths corresponding to the seven great fixed
 lines of the spectrum, which are designated by the capital
letters of the alphabet from B to H. I have added the wave
length of A from my own experiments.

    lines of the solar spectrum, the Paris inch being supposed to
    be divided into one hundred millions of equal parts.

far too striking to be merely accidental.          Moreover, it must
not be forgotten that the observed numbers, as determined by
Fraunhofer, are wholly independent of any hypothesis.
   If the relation of whole numbers was rigorously true, the
numbers in the foregoing table would stand as follows: 119,
238, 476, 714, 833, 1071, 1190.
   The wave-length of the most luminous portion of the spec
trum, the centre of the yellow space, is 2060 parts. If we
take this as an optical centre, it will be found that the great
lines are situated symmetrically in relation to it. E and D
are equidistant above and below it; the same observation
applies to G and B, and also to H and A. The only de
parture from this symmetry is in the case of F, which is not
symmetrical with C. It will be understood that I am here
speaking of one of those spectra which are formed when a gra
ting or ruled surface is used. In this the colours are arranged
side by side, according to their wave-lengths; the centre of
the spectrum, which is its most luminous portion, is occupied
by the centre of the yellow space, and the light terminates at
equal distances in the violet and red.
   Do not these observations lead us to conclude, that the
cause, whatever it may be, that produces these fixed lines is
periodic in its action?
   What that cause in reality is, we have not now facts suffi
cient to determine. I would not affirm that the disengage
ment of incombustible matter by a flame will always give rise
to dark lines. But this is very clear; that in all those cases,
as cyanogen, alcoholic solutions of nitrate of strontian, of bo
racic acid, &c., in which these lines are developed, incombus
tible matter is uniformly disengaged.

XVII. An Account of the Method of Vanishing              Groups.     By
   JAMES CockLE, Esq., M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge ;
   Barrister-at-Law, of the Middle Temple".
IN a paper On certain Algebraic Functions just published
      in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, I
have given a more detailed and connected view than I had
previously done of the analysis which I have, since writing
that paper, proposed to term the Method of Vanishing Groups.
I have employed this analysis, perhaps not altogether without
success, in the theory of equations and in analytical geometry;
and I indulge a hope that the following little account of the
  * Communicated by Dr. Nathaniel Lister, late Physician to St. Thomas's
Hospital, &c.

        Mr. Cockle on the Method of Vanishing Groups. 115
 manner in which, to the best of my recollection, the method
 occurred to my mind, may, as well as the subsequent portion
 of this article, prove to be not entirely uninteresting to some
 of the readers of the present Journal.
    I was engaged upon the subject of the transformation of the
 general equation of the fifth degree into another of the same
 degree, in which the second, third, and fourth terms should
 be wanting. This transformation had already been effected
 by the peculiar processes of Mr. Jerrard; but another method
 of arriving at it had occurred to me, suggested as follows.
    In analytical geometry of two dimensions, when we desire
 to ascertain whether or not a given equation of the second.
 degree between two variable quantities a and y represents a
 system of (in general) two straight lines, our object may be
 attained thus: multiply the given equation by four times the
 coefficient of wº; add to and subtract from the equation, as it
 will now stand, the square of the coefficient of a in the equation
 as it originally stood; the right-hand side of the equation
 being supposed zero, the left will then consist of the square
 of a linear function of a and y, together with a quadratic
 function of y only; now if four times the coefficient of y” in
 this quadratic function be multiplied into the part free from
3y, and this product be found to equal the square of the coeffi
cient of y in the quadratic function, that function is a square,
 and the given equation represents two straight lines, if the
latter square be negative (or one only if the quadratic func
tion disappears in the first instance, or a point if both the
squares be positive).
    This part of my studies at the University of Cambridge
flashed across my mind in connexion with the problem re
specting the equation of the fifth degree. The problem in
question requires the solution of a linear, a quadratic, and a
cubic equation; or rather, in the point of view from which I
 was considering it, of a quadratic and a cubic only. I now
 saw that there might exist a quadratic equation between two
unknown quantities, which yet should involve us in no eleva
tion of degree when one of those quantities was, by means of
such quadratic, eliminated from another equation involving
them. This favourable case of the quadratic occurs when
that equation consists, or may be reduced to the form, of one
or two squares, which, or one of which at least, involve both
the unknown quantities.
    Now whenever the quadratic function of y vanishes, or is a
perfect square, the given quadratic is of one of the forms just
alluded to. In the latter case, which alone attracted my at
tention, the last-mentioned   *  2
                                        may be exhibited as the

sum or difference of two squares, one of which will involve
two, and the other one, of the undetermined quantities. And
this sum or difference may be decomposed into linear factors,
by equating one of which to zero we might eliminate a or y
from any other given equation involving those quantities. No
elevation of degree would ensue from such elimination. I
reflected on this in considering the quadratic, which presented
itself in the question of the before-mentioned transformation
of the equation of the fifth degree.
    But—how to impress this form on that quadratic? to render
the quadratic function of y a square? And here Mr. Jerrard's
indeterminate method afforded me a useful suggestion—the
answer was obvious. If we can render the system of given
equations indeterminate, and so introduce an undetermined
 quantity into the coefficient of y and into the term free from
y in the quadratic function of that quantity which remains
after we have obtained a square by adding to and subtracting
from the given quadratic (multiplied by four times the coeffi
 cient of ar) the square of the original coefficient of w—then by
 the aid of this undetermined quantity, can we not reduce the
 given quadratic to the required form, and so avoid elevation of
 degree in eliminating x or y between it and any other given
 equation? On trying this method I found it succeed. The
 result, which bears traces of the manner in which I obtained
 it, will be found at page 114 (art. 3) of the first volume of the
 Mathematician, although the notation used in this paper is
 different from that employed there. I have however here
 given the notation in which the idea is most likely to have
 suggested itself to my mind, and in which, if my memory
 serves me aright, it actually suggested itself.
     Had I to discuss the same problem again, I should pro
 bably employ a homogeneous function of four undetermined
 quantities, and, by successive operations of the same kind as
 those which I have indicated at page 267 of the current num
 ber of the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, re
 duce it to a sum of four squares, and then make the sum of
  the first and second equal zero, as also that of the third and
 fourth. The fundamental principle of the whole method, ac
 cording to the view which I now take of it, is, for homoge
  neous functions of the second degree, this reduction by a uni
  form process to squares as many in number as the undeter
  mined quantities.
     Investigations of very different classes may yet present fea
  tures of resemblance in their results, their principles, or their
  processes.    And wherever such resemblance exists, be it in
  result, principle or process, it can never, in a philosophic

       Mr. Cockle on the Method of Vanishing Groups.           117
point of view, be valueless to indicate its traces. Regarded in
this light, it is the solution of a quadratic by the ordinary
process of completing the square that affords a first glimpse
of the general process of the reduction of a general quadratic
function of any number of variables to the form of a sum of
squares. For, disregarding, as for this purpose we should do
throughout, the signs of the squares, and considering as an
algebraic square every numerical quantity, the usual solution
of a quadratic is effected by reducing a certain quadratic func
tion to the form of a sum of two algebraic squares.
   Starting then from the solution of the quadratic as its cradle,
we next see the same process occurring in analytical geometry
of two dimensions, and availing us in inquiring into the con
ditions requisite in order that a given function of the second
degree, and of two variable quantities, may be susceptible of
reduction to the form of a sum of two algebraic squares (in
which case the function represents a straight line or lines, or
a point). In the present instance, by continuing the process
with which we commence, we might reduce the given function
to the form of a sum of three algebraic squares, the is algebraic
square" last arrived at being obtained by subtracting the
square of half the coefficient of y in the quadratic function of
that quantity alluded to in the third paragraph of this paper,
from that part of the function which is free from y. As I
have already stated, it was by combining a suggestion derived
from the process of ascertaining the reducibility of a quadratic
function of two variables to the sum of two squares, with an
idea suggested by a contemplation of the indeterminate me
thods of Mr. Jerrard, that I devised the method of vanishing
groups; and I take this opportunity of mentioning, with be
fitting sentiments, that it was my friend Dr. Nathaniel Lister
of St. Thomas’s Hospital, who, some tenM. since, first
directed my attention to Mr. Jerrard's Mathematical Re
searches, and induced me to undertake their perusal,—a pur
suit to which I applied myself ardently during my second
term's residence at Cambridge. The necessity, however, or
at least the propriety, of devoting myself to other sciences and
branches of science, prevented me from giving my exclusive
attention to the theory of equations, ever a favourite study
with me; but in the spring of 1844 I arrived at the method
which forms the subject of this article, and it was published
in the Mathematician for July of that year. It is different
from a process which I gave in a preceding volume (xxvi.) of
this Journal, and to which I have elsewhere(Mechanics’ Maga
zine, vol. xlvi.) given the name of the “method of symmetric
products;” but I have employed it in this Magazine (see vols.
xxvii. et seq.).

 118     Mr. Cockle on the Method of Vanishing Groups.
    It was the opinion of an illustrious analyst, now no more,
that the actual solution of the quadratic equation in general
algebraical symbols contributed, in a greater degree than the
 solution of the cubic and of the biquadratic, to the advance
 ment of algebra as a science (Murphy, Theory of Equations,
 page 1). And we may regard such solution under an aspect which
 did not meet the view of that great writer,-we may regard it
 as containing the germ of a process which enables us to
 exhibit far more general functions than those involved in the
 quadratic in the form of sums of powers, and which, combined
 with the indeterminate method when occasion requires, is ca
 pable of most extensive application in analysis. But it must
 never be forgotten that it was in the solution of a cubic that
 this indeterminate method—this great device of making a de
 terminate problem algebraically indeterminate, and so solving
 it—was probably first elicited : and this circumstance ought
 to influence us materially in estimating the rank which the first
 discoverer of the solution of cubic equations is entitled to hold
 in scientific history. I consider the method of vanishing
 groups, when applied to the theory of equations, as the com
 bination (accompanied by full developments) of the principle
 involved in the solution of the cubic with the process employed
 in that of the quadratic. Suggested, as it were, by a question
 in analytical geometry of two dimensions, that method admits
 of application in the analytical geometry of three dimensions;
 and I have in fact so applied it in my Chapters on Analytical
 Geometry, now in course of publication in the Mechanics’
 Magazine. Its processes would evidently be capable of a similar
 extension to an analytical geometry of n dimensions, had we
 any knowledge of an entity possessed of more than three dimen
 sions. Were such things within the bounds of our faculties,
 there would be functions of their dimensions, linear ones for
instance, which would bear an analogy to the corresponding
ones of the three-dimensioned entity space (and the one
 dimensioned entity time), and which would by this method be
discussed in a manner similar, or at all events but slightly dif
ferent from, that of space (or time).
   In conclusion, I may mention a point in which our results
so closely resemble those deduced in another department of
science, as to have suggested to me the name “Diophantic *
as one which would be appropriate to our processes. I mean,
that as in the liophantine algebra we seek to form an equa
tion, of which, if one side be zero the other shall consist of
powers (squares, cubes, &c.) of numerical quantities connected
by the signs plus and minus, so in our analysis the object is
in general to obtain an equation, of which, one side being
zero, the other shall consist of powers of algebraical quantities

(numerical or not) similarly connected. I say in general,
because perhaps the preferable view of the problem, which is
the object of our method, is to consider it as that of reducing
certain algebraic functions, whether they be supposed equal
to zero or not, to the form of a sum of algebraic powers.
    Should it be thought that in the present article I have dwelt
at unnecessary length on certain points, I should urge by way
of apology, that before it can be fairly estimated all knowledge
must be systematized. And I would add, that all knowledge
is probably capable of being so dealt with, to an extent of
which we can as yet form no idea.

THE geological period during which the caves of England
        formed the residences of wild beasts and cemeteries for
the bones of their victims as well as themselves, is a subject of
great interest, and can be best, if not exclusively ascertained,
by comparing their animal remains with those of sedimentary
deposits.
    If a cabinet collection of cave specimens be contrasted with
one of the Pleistocene freshwater formations, so great will
appear the excess in the former, of small animals allied to, or
identical with, those of our own times, that a date even more
modern than “Pleistocene” might reasonably be given them.
With a view of making a more just comparison, the following
table has been constructed, showing the living and extinct
animals common to both, and peculiar to each.

120         Dr. R. P. Cotton's Observations on the
    Thus of forty-two distinct Mammalia, twenty are found in
both positions, seventeen are limited to the caverns, and five
are found exclusively in freshwater strata.
    From a mere survey of such a table, conclusions as to the
relative age of the two series would be inaccurate; and it be
comes necessary to consider the various circumstances under
which each may have arisen, and the influence which the
habitats of the various animals may have exercised upon the
position of their remains.
    The valley of the Thames, in many places so abundant in
animal remains that a metropolitan churchyard could hardly
boast of a greater collection of bones, presents some peculiari
ties worthy of attention, and bearing closely upon the point.
The bones are in general in a good state of preservation, and
often make up nearly the entire skeleton; but occasionally
some fragments are met with, not resulting from original vio
lence when deposited (as they are often surrounded by the
most delicate freshwater shells) or careless removal, but appa
rently broken before carried to their place of interment. The
frequency of animal remains appears to be just in proportion
to their size, the small bones of large mammalia being much
more uncommon than the larger ones, and the young of such
animals as the Mammoth, Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus
being rarely met with, whilst all indications of the smaller
genera so common in caverns are altogether absent. I have
collected from these Pleistocene beds, chiefly at Ilford, remains
of the following animals:—Mammoth, Rhinoceros, Ox, Auroch,
Horse, Irish Elk, Deer, Bear, Sheep, Pig and Bird; but the
first four only can be called abundant, and of these the Mam
moth and Rhinoceros are at least ten times more frequent than
the other two—the rest are but seldom met with.        The Bear
is the only representative of Carnivora, and of it only one
specimen has been found; and the only evidence of a Bird
consists of an ulna, of which more will be said hereafter.
    Upon looking at such a collection, it is impossible to sup
pose that it can represent the whole creation of any geological
period, or that such a mass of Mammalia can have been with
out an ample number of destroyers; for although the Tiger
and Hyaena have been found in deposits of the same age, they
are rare, and bear a very insignificant proportion to the Her
bivora.
    The bone-caverns reveal a set of circumstances exactly the
opposite of the above. In these, several genera of Carnivora
are abundantly preserved; and the bones with which they are
associated belong either to a class of smaller animals or the
young of the larger ones, and a collection of these remains
equally fail in presenting us with representatives of an entire

                Geological Age of Bone-Caverns.              121
race. But if the two be united, an intelligible system is esta
blished—the young Mammoth and Rhinoceros meeting with
their parents—Herbivora and Carnivora mixing for the first
time perhaps in undreaded society, form a natural series of
animals of all habits and sizes.
   All this may appear but a coincidence, unless it can be
shown why there should have been this separation in the po
sition of their remains; but the habits of the various animals
will yield the explanation.
   Upon the approach of natural death or any catastrophe, the
wary and active Carnivora would generally retire to, and die
in, their dens; whilst the larger Herbivora would be more
likely to leave their bones upon the plains, to be subsequently
swept away and entombed by natural operations. But it was
not by any sudden or violent action that the great accumula
tion of remains in either position took place. For ages Tigers
and Hyaenas did their office, and thousands became their vic
tims. Animals of all sizes were exposed to their attacks; but
the smaller ones, and the younger and weaker individuals of
the larger class, were their most common prey; and it would
rarely happen that such died a natural death, or if they did,
their bones would seldom fail to become the property of
 Hyaenas, hence they are almost exclusively found in caverns;
but the larger and more formidable Mammoth and Rhinoceros
must have less frequently met with violent death; or when
this did occur, their bulk and weight would be against their
finding their way into the dens of Hyaenas, and their skele
tons, more or less mutilated, would be left to be swept away
and interred in fluvialile deposits, where they are now so
abundantly found. The broken bones to which I have alluded
may have had such an origin; they exhibit no teeth marks,
but otherwise, in appearance, would bear out such an idea.
 Of six bones of Birds found by Dr. Buckland at Kirkdale,
the ulna occurred four times, which led him to the ingenious
observation that the strong quill-feathers attached to that bone
 may have prevented it being devoured. It is singular that the
same bone should be the only one preserved at Ilford; espe
cially as a row of strong tubercles proves it to have belonged
to some powerful bird of flight, consequently with a strong set
of wing-feathers; and if a similar explanation of its preserva
tion be admitted, it affords additional strength to such an in
ference.
   The accumulation in caverns may in reality have occupied
more than one geological period; and long after the last
hyaena ceased to exist, have been added to by the Wolf and
 Fox, to whose operations may be attributed the introduction

 122    Observations on the Geological Age of Bone-Caverns.
 of such animals as the Hare and Rabbit; whilst the Bat,
 Mouse, and Vole may have been at some other time not un
 willing tenants of the same caves. But even assigning to all
 the same antiquity, for reasons given above, it is not surprising
 that these should be found only in caverns. The Equus pli
 cidens and Strongyloceros, perhaps the only animals whose
 sole existence in caverns is difficult to account for, may yet
 find their representatives in sedimentary deposits: the latter
 is so uncommon that but one specimen has been met with, and
 that in Kent's Hole, and at Ilford remains of gigantic deer,
 too fragmentary to declare their affinities, are frequently
found.
    The remains peculiar to freshwater strata are such as might
be expected to appear there. The Monkey would be an un
likely prey to Tigers and Hyaenas; and the Water-Mole,
Castor and gigantic Trogontherium, from their amphibious
and wary habits, would rarely become the prey of land Car
nivora; and if preserved at all, would mix with deposits con
tinually going on from the element in which the greater part
of their lives was passed. The occurrence of Rhinoceros lep
torhinus exclusively in these formations does not appear so
remarkable, when it is recollected that the genus itself is com
paratively rare in caverns; and some peculiarity may have
existed in this species, rendering it less liable than the other
to become the prey of carnivorous contemporaries; and it is
well-known that several living species, differing less from each
other than the extinct ones did, have very different habits.
    It must not be forgotten, that future discoveries may con
siderably alter inferences derived from our present knowledge
on this subject. It is impossible to predict what may hereafter
be revealed by chance or the labours of the geologist; and
each year brings with it an increase to the number of fossil
mammalia. But as the matter remains at present, there is
nothing against the possibility, whilst many things tend to
make it highly probable, that animals from the newer tertiary
deposits were the contemporaries of those found in caverns;
and that whilst the Mammoth and Rhinoceros, from their
powers of defence, enjoyed a comparative immunity from
attack, and left their bones in the slowly-forming aqueous
strata, their younger and weaker associates frequently became
victims to the appetites of fierce Carnivora, and were finally
carried to the dens of Hyaenas.

XIX. On the Preparation of absolute Alcohol, and the Com
   position of “Proof-Spirit.”      By Mr. Joseph DRINK
    wATER.     (Communicated by Professor Graham.)*
THE following        experiments were undertaken, principally,
       with a view to determine the relative proportions of an
hydrous alcohol and water in revenue proof-spirit, for which
purpose it was necessary to procure alcohol in its absolute or
pure state.
    The processes employed were as follows:—
    Carbonate of potash was exposed to a red heat to deprive
it of water, and when sufficiently cool was pulverized, and
added to ordinary alcohol of specific gravity 850 at 60°F.
till it ceased to dissolve any more; the whole was then al
lowed to digest twenty-four hours, being frequently agitated,
when the alcohol was carefully poured off.
    As much fresh-burnt quicklime as was considered sufficient
when powdered to absorb the whole of the alcohol, was in
troduced into a retort, and the alcohol added to it; after digest
ing forty-eight hours, it was slowly distilled in a water-bath
at a temperature of about 180° F.
    The alcohol thus obtained was carefully redistilled, and its
 specific gravity at 60°F. was found in two experiments to
be 7946 and ‘7947; agreeing very nearly with the determi
nation of Rudberg, which has been adopted by Gay-Lussac
and others, viz. '7947 at 59°F.
    It may be proper to state that the specific gravity was
taken with a stoppered bottle, which was always counter
poised by another empty bottle of the same glass and form,
placed in the opposite pan of the balance; the capacity of
the weighing bottle at 60°F, was exactly 1000-01 grains of
distilled water; and it was found on trial that this bottle
could be repeatedly filled with the same liquid with no greater
variation than one or two hundredths of a grain.
   The temperature of the room in which these experiments
were made was always brought to 60° F.; and the thermo
meter used was a standard instrument by Newman, and ex
tremely sensitive (being graduated to one-tenth of a degree);
on being plunged into the weighing bottle filled with alcohol
it displaced about 4} grains of that fluid ; this portion was
replaced from the stock quantity (brought at the time to the
proper temperature) by means of a pipette.
   With a view however to discover whether it were possible
by means of lime to abstract any more water from the alcohol,
the retort was again filled with fresh-burned and pulverized
   ; communiº by the Chemical Society; having been read June 21,
1847.

124           Mr. Drinkwater on the Preparation of
quicklime and the same alcohol mixed with it; the mixture
was then allowed to digest a whole week at the ordinary tem
perature of the laboratory, about 60°F. After this time the
alcohol was distilled off as before, but was redistilled very
slowly, at first at the rate of about one drop in ten seconds
(heat of water-bath 165°F.); this was continued till about
one-twentieth of the whole had distilled over, the object being
to allow any minute quantity of water which the alcohol
might still retain to evaporate or diffuse itself into the atmo
sphere of absolute alcohol above it; the redistillation was
then continued rapidly, the heat of the bath being increased
to 180° F. till about one-twentieth more had passed over;
the receiver was then changed and the remaining part slowly
distilled off.
   The specific gravity of this alcohol taken twice was 7944
at 60°F. As a further test of its purity it was divided into
two equal parts; one part was again digested on quicklime,
and the other on sulphate of copper deprived of water by
heat, the method of operation being as follows:—
   1st. Some lumps of fresh-burnt quicklime were heated to
a red heat, and in that state quickly pulverized and intro
duced into the tin boiler of a small still, which was partly
immersed in water to prevent the melting of the solder.
   This vessel was completely filled with quicklime, and was
kept corked till sufficiently cool, when the alcohol was added,
but it being comparatively small in quantity the lime ap
peared perfectly dry; the vessel was then securely corked.
   2nd. A quantity of sulphate of copper was exposed to a
red heat till completely deprived of water; it was then quickly
pulverized and introduced into a small tin boiler, and when
cold the alcohol (which was insufficient to cover it) was added,
and the vessel closely corked.
   These vessels with their contents were kept at the ordi
nary temperature of the laboratory (about 60°F) for four
days; they were then partly immersed in a water-bath, and
kept at a temperature of about 150°F, for forty-eight hours,
after which the alcohol was distilled and redistilled with all the
precautions before-mentioned; the temperature of the water
bath on the redistillation never exceeded 172° F., and the
first tenth part was put aside in each case as possibly impure.
   The specific gravities of the alcohol thus obtained were as
under:—
                     Alcohol distilled from      Alcohol di
                        desiccated sulphate      stilled from
                             of copper.          quicklime.

absolute Alcohol, and the Composition of “Proof-Spirit.” 125
    From these experiments it would appear that sulphate of
copper, when deprived of water, is not so effective as quick
lime in removing the last traces of water from alcohol.
    It was observed, however, that in general the specific gra
vity of the alcohol gradually increased, probably from its hy
grometric property, by which it absorbed a minute quantity
of moisture from the air on being transferred from one bottle
to another; and thinking consequently that a small quantity
of moisture might have been abstracted from the atmosphere
during the distillation (which was conducted in the usual
way), and the specific gravity thus slightly increased, I con
sidered it desirable to make another experiment in which this
source of error should be guarded against, by conducting the
distillation as much as possible out of contact with the ex
ternal air, and proceeded as follows.
    The different portions of alcohol before obtained were
mixed together, when the specific gravity was found to be
‘7947; this alcohol was again digested at a temperature of
about 150°F. for fourteen days with quicklime, previously
heated to redness, as in the former experiment; it was then
 slowly distilled out of contact with the external atmosphere
by means of a tube which passed from the condenser through
 a cork into the bottle in which it was to remain (the tempe
rature of the water-bath was 175° F.), and the first tenth
 part was put aside as possibly containing a minute quantity of
water; the remainder was then distilled off at 178° to 180° F.
    This alcohol was quickly transferred to a dry retort and
redistilled in a similar way (heat of water-bath 172°F.); the
 first tenth part was put aside, and the remainder kept as
 being pure anhydrous alcohol, or as free from water as it is
 possible to obtain it by this process. The specific gravity was
 taken the next day with all the precautions before mentioned,
 the alcohol being also kept during the time of transference
 as much as possible out of contact with humid air, when the
 results of four trials were as follow :—
     Temperature of room 60°F.       Barometer 29,810.

                             Mean   .  ‘793811
     A portion of this alcohol was subsequently digested with
 quicklime for three months, it was then distilled, and its
  specific gravity was found to be exactly the same as before.
     We may therefore conclude with considerable certainty

  126         Mr. Drinkwater on the Preparation of
 that the number 179381 expresses the specific gravity of ab
 solute alcohol at 60°F., within a very close degree of ap
 proximation.
    My attention was next directed to the best method of de
 termining the relative proportions of absolute alcohol and
 water which exist in legal or revenue proof-spirit.
    There is some ambiguity in the wording of the act of
 parliament 58 Geo. III. c. 28, which defines proof-spirit to
 be “such as shall at the temperature of fifty-one degrees by
 Fahrenheit's thermometer weigh exactly twelve-thirteenth
 parts of an equal measure of distilled water,” but the tempe
 rature of the water is not stated: there is no doubt however
 that the temperature of 51°F. was intended to apply to the
 water as well as to the spirit; therefore taking water at 51°F.
 as unity, the specific gravity of proof-spirit at that tempera
 ture will be ‘92308; or raising the temperature of both to
 60° F., the specific gravity will be 91984—the expansions
 being calculated from Gilpin’s Tables *.
    It was found by a few preliminary experiments that the
 specific gravity 91984 would lie between a mixture of 49
 absolute alcohol + 51 water, and a mixture of 49% absolute
 alcohol -- 50% water, all by weight. Mixtures were therefore
 made in these proportions in an apparatus procured for the
purpose, consisting of two light flasks each capable of con
taining about 2200 grains of water. The alcohol and water
were weighed separately in these flasks with the greatest
care; after which the flasks were joined without mixing the
liquids, the neck of one being ground into the neck of the
other for that purpose; the liquids were then thoroughly
mixed by transferring them alternately from one flask to the
other.   The flasks were disconnected when the mixed con
tents became cool, which were then transferred to a clean
and dry well-stoppered bottle, and further secured by tying
a piece of caoutchouc over the stopper.
   It may also be proper to mention, that when placed in the
balance, these flasks were always counterpoised by other
empty flasks of the same material, and of very nearly equal
size and shape; and to prevent loss from evaporation, a ground
glass cap was placed over the mouth of each flask as soon as
the exact weight was obtained. The errors of observation
could not, I believe, in any case exceed one-hundredth of a
grain, as the balance used in these experiments was one of
Robinson’s best instruments, which was previously adjusted
by Newman expressly for the purpose; it was turned with
its greatest load by less than one-hundredth of a grain.

in the proportion of 49% grs. alcohol + 50% grs. water.
    After twenty-four hours, the bottles having been frequently
shaken, the specific gravities of both mixtures were taken,
with all the precautions detailed in the experiments on ab
solute alcohol: and in order to observe if the full condensa
tion was gradual and required time for its completion, the
mixtures were allowed to stand, with occasional agitation, for
a further period of twenty-four hours, when the liquids were
again weighed. The results were as follows:—
At 24 hours, temperature of room 60° F., barometer 29.630.

    It thus appears that both liquids attained a fixed specific
gravity within the first twenty-four hours.
    If we now express the preceding results by measure, and
make the proportion of alcohol a constant quantity in the two
mixtures, we have—

    Dividing the difference of the quantities of water by the
difference of specific gravity, we get 015437, the mean quan
tity of water corresponding to each unit of difference in the
specific gravities. But the difference between the specific
gravity of proof-spirit and '91930, one of the observed specific
gravities, is 54; therefore we have 54 x 015437 = '8336, the
quantity of water to be added to the spirit of that specific

   It is remarkable that Dr. A. Steel * arrived at almost the
same composition for proof-spirit, namely, 49.2 and 50-8,
partly by experiment and partly by calculation.
   The table of M. Lowitz, showing the quantity of alcohol
in spirits of different specific gravities (which is to be found
in most chemical works published in this country), also agrees
with these experiments at this particular point, although from
some experiments which I have had occasion to make, I have
found that at other points this table is incorrect; and as it is
frequently consulted by chemists, it was considered desirable
to make a few mixtures of pure alcohol and water, from which
to calculate a more correct table for estimating the quantity
of alcohol in mixtures containing not more than 10 per cent.
of that liquid.
   Eleven mixtures were therefore made, containing exactly
#, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 per cent. by weight of abso
lute alcohol. These mixtures were made in the same appa
ratus, and with all the precautions described in the former ex
periments. They were allowed to stand at least 24 hours with
occasional agitation before the specific gravities were taken,
and several of them were again taken after a period of 48
and 72 hours, without any sensible variation.
   The particulars are set forth in the following table:—

XX. . Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
   December 31, 1847. By JAMEs GLAISHER, Esq., of the
   Itoyal Observatory, Greenwich *.
THE quarterly meteorological returns for the past quarter,
       furnished to the Registrar-General, have been obtained
from twenty-eight different places in England and one in
 Ireland. Upon every subject of investigation in these reports,
and with almost every gentleman from whom they have been
received, I have been in frequent correspondence; I know
therefore, in most cases, the character of the instruments, and
the circumstances under which the observations have been
made.
   Every return has been examined by myself, and each result
checked by comparison with others made in neighbouring
places; and in every case where suspicion seemed to rest, I
have immediately had the observations examined; and in all
cases where the numbers did not stand this examination, they
have not been printed.
   The whole of the observations were then reduced to mean
places and discussed by myself, and the results form a body of
meteorological facts of which I can speak with much confi
dence.    In the course of their reduction, the character of the
period over which the observations extend came forcibly under
my notice; and I found it to be one remarkable in many re
spects, and such as would interest many of the readers of the
Philosophical Magazine, who would not otherwise see the
account in the Registrar. General's report itself; and its publi
cation in the Philosophical Magazine will have the effect of
bringing these valuable reports to the notice of persons inter
ested in meteorology.
   The daily temperatures of the air, evaporation and dew
point, during the whole quarter, with the exceptions of the
period between Nov. 17 and Nov. 21, and between Dec. 20
and Dec. 31, have been above the average for the season, and
at times these departures have been very great.
   It perhaps may tend to clearness if I speak of each subject
of investigation separately.
   The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich—
   For the month of October was 52°-9, which is 4°1, 7°5,
4°-9, 3°4, 2°7, and 2°4 above that in the years 1841 to 1846
respectively. The high temperature in this month is very
remarkable.                                      -
   For the month of November was 46°-9, which is 4°:2, 4°. 1,
8°1, 2°9, 1°1, and 0°9 above that of the years 1841 to 1846
respectively.                                  -
                   * Communicated by the Author.

           Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather.          131
    For the month of December was 42°8, which is 2°.3 above
 that of 1841, 2°-2 below that of 1842, 19.1 below that of 1843,
 9°8 above that of 1844, 1° 1 above that of 1845, and 9°.9 above
 that of 1846; or it is 3°3 above that of the average for these
 six years.
    The mean value for the quarter was 47°5; that for 1841
 was 44°0; for 1842 was 44°4; for 1843 was 45°-2; for 1844
 was 42°2; for 1845 was 45°-9; and for 1846 was 43°. 1; so
 that the excess for this quarter above the corresponding quar
 ter in the six preceding years are 3’-5, 3°1, 2°3, 5°3, 1°-6,
 and 4°4 respectively; or it is 3°4 above the average for these
six years. This difference is very large indeed, considering
that it extends over so long a period of time as one-fourth
part of a year.
    The mean temperature of evaporation at Greenwich—
   For the month of October was 50°-9, which is 3°-6 above
that for the preceding six years.
   For the month of November was 45°-6, which is 2°-6 above
that for the preceding six years.
   For the month of December was 41°-6, which is 3°.3 above
that for the preceding six years.
   The mean value for the quarter was 46°.0, which is 3°2
above that for the six preceding years.
   The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich—
   For the month of October was 49°1, which is 4°-0, 6°7,
4°4, 3°1, 2°-6, and 19.9 above that for the years 1841 to 1846
respectively; or it is 3°7 above the average for these years.
   For the month of November was 44°1, which is 4°-3, 3°-7,
3° 2, 2°2, 19.3, and 19.0 above that for the years 1841 to 1846
respectively; or it is 2°-6 above the average for these years.
   For the month of December was 39°8, which is 4 -6 above
that for 1841, 3°4 below that for 1842, 2°-2 below that for
1843, 9°-8 above that for 1844, 2°2 above that for 1845, and
10°4 above that for 1846; or it is 3°6 above the average for
these years.
   The mean value for the quarter was 44°3, which is 3°3
above that for the six preceding years.
   The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the quar
ter was 3-2 grains, which is 0.4 grain above that for the pre
ceding six years.
   The additional weight of water required to saturate a cubic
foot of air was 0.4 grain; the average for the preceding six
years was 0.3 grain.
   The mean degree of humidity of the atmosphere for the quarter
was 0-900, which is the same as that for the six preceding years.
   The mean elastic force of vapour for the quarter was 0.310
                        -       K 2

132          Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
inch, which is 0.030 inch above that for the average of the six
preceding years.
    The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich for the
quarter was 29.829 inches, which is 0 1 11 inch above that for
the six preceding years.
    The average weight of a cubic foot of air under the average
temperature, humidity and pressure, was 540 grains; the
average for the six preceding years was 543 grains.
    The rain fallen at Greenwich within the quarter was six
inches in depth; this quantity is two inches less than the
average for the six preceding years. The total amount of
 rain fallen in the year 1847 was 17-6 inches, which is nearly
eight inches less than the average amount for the six preceding
   earS.
     The temperature of the Thames water was 48°2 by day, and
 47°6 by night. The water on an average was nearly of the
 same temperature as the air.
     The horizontal movement of the air was about 950 miles
 weekly, being somewhat less than the average amount.
     The highest and lowest readings of the thermometer in air at
 the height of four feet above the ground, and protected as
 much as possible from the effects of radiation and rain, were
 73°-2 and 24°5.
     The average daily range of the readings of thermometers
 in air at the height of four feet was 11°7, which is 3°-8 greater
 than the average range from the six preceding years.
     In October the reading of the thermometer on grass was at
 or below 32° on five nights, and the lowest reading was 26°5.
 In November it was below 32° on thirteen nights, and the low
 est reading was 18°. In December it was below 32° on six
  teen nights, and the lowest reading was 19° 3. The periods
  of time, however, during which these readings have continued
  have been very short, owing to the very cloudy state of the
  sky during the nights. The amount of heat radiated from the
  earth at night during the past quarter has been very small
  indeed.
      The mean amount of cloud during the quarter was such as
  to cover upon the average a little more than three-fourths of
  the whole sky. The month of December was more clouded
  than any month since January 1845.
      It is a fact well worthy of notice, that from the beginning
  of this quarter till the 20th of December, the electricity of the
  atmosphere was almost always in a neutral state; so that no
  signs of electricity whatever were shown for several days
   together by any of the electrical instruments. During this
  period, I myself several times minutely examined the whole

         during the Quarter ending December 31, 1847.         133
of the electrical apparatus, and found it to be in a satisfactory
state at all times. On the above day, and on every day after
wards till the end of the quarter, active electricity was shown.
   The approximate mean monthly temperatures for other
places besides Greenwich were found to differ but little in each
month from those at Greenwich. In the comparison between
places situated at different elevations, there is one leading dif
ference in respect to temperature which we must expect to find,
viz. that at the places of a higher level, a lower mean tempe
rature, and a greater range of temperature take place, than at
places situated at a lower level. These conditions are very
clearly shown in the tables.
   The monthly mean temperatures of those places in Cornwall
and Devonshire in each of these three months were somewhat
above those at other places. At Exeter, however, the differ
ence in this respect from those in other counties is small; in
fact the weather at this place during the past quarter more
nearly resembled that of places out of these counties, than that
of places situated within them.
   The remarkable cold period referred to above, which hap
pened between November 17 and November 21, between
periods of so different temperatures, deserves particular notice.
As far as I can infer from the meteorological returns from the
country, it seems to have been general. Snow to a consider
able depth fell within this period in Suffolk; but it is not no
ticed as having fallen elsewhere. The particulars of the
changes of temperatures in the months of November and De
cember I have detailed in the Registrar-General's weekly re
ports in December. I may here remark, however, that du
ring these two months the usual diurnal rise and fall of the
temperatures of the air and of the dew-point very frequently
did not take place; and they were often reversed; a nocturnal
rising temperature and a daily falling temperature were of fre
quent occurrence.
   From the circumstance of these anomalous changes of tem
peratures, as might be expected, the usual diurnal difference
in the readings of the barometer did not take place. The
readings at times constantly increased for several days together,
and then decreased for several days together. In December,
on the seventh day, at 3 A.M., the remarkably low reading of
28'383 inches took place at Greenwich; and this low reading
was general over the country; but it first took place at north
ern places and then at southern. Thus the minimum occurred
at Durham on December 6, at 6 P.M., and it was 27-89 inches;
at Stonyhurst during the evening, and it was 27.841 inches;
at Liverpool at 10h P.M., and it was 28-184 inches; at Cam
bridge on December 7, at 1' 10" A.M., and it was 28.382

134         Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
inches; and at Greenwich on December 7 at 3" A.M., and it was,
as stated above, 28.383 inches. A reading so low as this is
of rare occurrence. The previous instances at Greenwich are
as follows:–In 1783, on March 6, the reading was 28:12
inches; in 1809, on December 17, the reading was 28:20
inches; in 1821, on December 25, the reading was 27-89 inch
es; in 1824, on November 23, the reading was 28-37 inches;
and in 1843, on January 13, the reading was 28°10 inches.
    During the quarter there were eight exhibitions of the aurora
borealis, which occurred on the following days:—Oct. 15, 23
and 24; Nov. 1, 2, 19; Dec. 2 and 19. That on Oct. 24 was one
of the finest I have seen.     (See the Philosophical Magazine
for November, and the Athenaeum for November.)           At every
one of these times the magnets were much disturbed. The
magnetic disturbance connected with the aurora of October 24
exhibited a greater amount of consecutive disturbance than
had been before experienced at Greenwich since the establish
ment of the magnetic observatory in 1840. (See the Philoso
phical Magazine for January 1848; and a forthcoming account
of the aurora seen in Cambridge, by Mr. Morgan, of the Cam
bridge Observatory.)
    From the preceding remarks, it will be seen that the weather
during the past quarter has been very unusual indeed. I have
searched all meteorological records at my command, which
have been made in the previous fifty years, and I have failed
to find any season of similar character. In the year 1806 the
average temperature for the last quarter of the year was 50°l
 (see Philosophical Transactions for that year); and this result
nearly agrees with that found by Luke Howard, Esq. (see his
 Climate of London), which was 50°3; but although this value
 is greater than that of the past three months, yet lam inclined
to think that the temperature of this period in 1806 did not
 really exceed that of 1847, as at this time all mean tempera
tures depended solely on uncompared self-registering thermo
 meters; and it is found that even with good self-registering
 thermometers, a subtractive correction is always required to
 deduce from them the true mean for the month. The only
 October in this century whose temperature seems really to
 have exceeded that of the past October, is that of 1811; so
that whether we compare the weather of the past quarter by
 longer or shorter periods with that of similar periods in past
 years, it has evidently been of a very remarkable character,
 and of rare occurrence.

136         Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather.
   From the numbers in the first column it appears that the
volume of dry air was very nearly the same at all parts of the
country. The mean of all the results in the first column is
29:640 inches, and this may be considered as the pressure of
dry air for England during the quarter ending December 31,
1847.
   From the numbers in the second column we find, for the
quarter ending December 31, 1847, that the mean tempera
ture of the air for the counties of Cornwall and Devonshire
was 48°-9, and for the remaining counties, excepting those
north of latitude 54°, was 45°7, and that the mean tempera
ture of Durham and Newcastle was 44°8.
   The average daily range of the temperature of the air in
Cornwall and Devonshire was 8°6; at Brighton and Liver
pool was 6°4, and the mean value for all other places was
10°-5. The greatest mean daily ranges took place at Hart
well, Cambridge, Latimer Rectory, Uckfield, &c., and the
least occurred at Brighton, Liverpool, Torquay, Truro, Nor
wich, &c.
   The highest reading during the quarter was at Greenwich,
which was 73°2, and the lowest was at Beckington, which
was 14°. The extreme range of temperature in England
during the quarter was therefore 59°2.
    The average quarterly range of the thermometer-readings
in Cornwall and Devonshire was 35°7; at Brighton and
Liverpool was 33°6; at those places situated between the
latitudes of 51° and 52}", was 44°7; and between the latitudes
of 524° and 55° was 36°. The ranges at those places situated
at a high elevation, were in all cases much greater than at
those places situated in the same parallel of latitude but at a
lower elevation.
    The mean direction of the wind for all places was S.W.,
except at Brighton, where it was N.E.
    From the numbers in the ninth column it would seem that
 the distribution of cloud has been nearly the same at all parts
 of the country, and such as to cover three-fourths of the whole
 skv.
   *he fall of rain has been the largest in Cornwall and De
 vonshire; the average amount for the quarter was 16 inches;
 and it has fallen on a greater number of days in those coun
 ties than in any others; the average number was 54, but this
 number was exceeded by 7 at Truro. At Torquay the num
 ber was 43 only. At Walworth the fall seems to have been the
 least in amount, but this value is not confirmed by those at
 neighbouring places; the next in order is Cambridge, Lewis
 ham, Saffron Walden, Greenwich, Uckfield, Cardington and

    Mr. H. E. Strickland on the Geology of Asia Minor. 137
Norwich. [The construction of the several gauges is di<U+017F>
ferent, and many of them have not been tested either by
weighing the collected water, or by accurately measuring the
vessels in which it is received. At Walworth Crosley's self
registering gauge is used, which, after being in use a short
time, does not truly register the fall, and it should not be de
pended upon solely in any case.]
   Columns 12 to 16 contain the mean hygrometrical results,
and they are nearly identical at most places; at Beckington,
however, the air seems to have been very nearly in a state of
saturation during these three months, if the instruments be
good by which the observations were made ; they have not
however been compared with standards. The degree of hu
midity in the Vale of Aylesbury is greater than that due to
its latitude, and this seems to be decided, as the results at
three different stations agree very well together.
   Those results from the station in Ireland, depending on the
temperature of the air, the direction and strength of the wind,
and the amount of clouds, agree with those in England at
the same latitude, but those depending on humidity of the air,
and on the amount of rain, exhibit an excess over those in
England.

XXI. On the present state of knowledge of the Geology of
        Asia Minor. By H. E. STRICKLAND, F.G.S."
 IN the last Number of the Journal of the Geological Society,
      part 2, p. 74, is a letter from M. von Tchihatcheff, ex
tracted from Leonhard and Bronn's Neues Jahrbuch, 1847.         I
rejoice to find from it that this gentleman is about to undertake
a systematic geological survey of Asia Minor, a country which,
from the magnificent scale on which its secondary and tertiary
rocks are displayed, and the wonderful diversity of its volcanic
phaenomena, is probably inferior to none of equal area in
geological interest. Our knowledge of the geology of Asia
 Minor is, in truth, comparatively limited, and we may there
fore look for results of the highest value from M. Tchihat
cheff's researches. But although much remains to be done
by the geologist in Asia Minor, yet we are not wholly without
information on this subject; and as it might be inferred from
M. Tchihatcheff’s silence as to the labours of others that such
was the case, I have thought it desirable to give a brief sum
mary of the progress that has already been made in this branch
of inquiry.

 138 Mr. H. E. Strickland on the Geology of Asia Minor.
   The existence of a tertiary marine formation on the shores
of the Dardanelles was made known nearly half a century ago
by Olivier, a scientific zoologist, who recognised in this plio
cene deposit many existing species of Mediterranean shells,
the names of which he has enumerated.
   The slaty rocks of the Thracian Bosphorus, flanked by
volcanic rocks on the north and by tertiary beds on the south
west, have long been known. The occurrence of fossils in
the former rocks was noticed by Fontanier (Voyages en Orient).
In 1886 Mr. W. J. Hamilton and myself proved, by means of
these fossils, that the formation was Silurian; and in a paper
by myself in the Transactions of the Geological Society, vol. v.,
On the Geology of the Thracian Bosphorus, the district be
tween the sea of Marmora and the Euxine is described in
some detail. In the following year the same region was ex
plored by M. de Verneuil, whose researches (published in the
Bull. Soc. Géol. de France) entirely confirm those which we
had previously made.
   The vicinity of Smyrna was geologically explored by Mr.
Hamilton and myself during the winter of 1835–36, and the
results are given in my memoir on that district (Geol. Trans.,
vol. v.). In this paper will be found the first attempt at a
classification of the geological formations of Asia Minor.
   This classification is further carried out in a joint memoir
which we published in the Geol. Trans. vol. vi., On the Geo
logy of the western part of Asia Minor, in which we described
the southern shores of the sea of Marmora, the valleys of the
Macestus, the Rhyndacus, the Hermus, the Cayster and the
Meander, besides giving short notices of Erythrae, Boodroom,

here described is unquestionably the Catacecaumene, the vol

   After my return to England Mr. Hamilton penetrated to
Armenia, and returned through the interior of Asia Minor to
Smyrna, during the whole of which lengthened journey he
kept careful notes of all the geological phaenomena which came
in his way. These facts will be found duly recorded in his
work entitled “Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Arme
nia, with some Account of their Antiquities and Geology.”
The same journey supplied him with the materials for his
memoir in the Geol. Trans., On the Geology of part of Asia
Minor between the Salt Lake of Kodj-hissar, and Caesarea of
Cappadocia, with a description of Mount Argaeus. . The
latter mountain was ascended by Mr. Hamilton, and its height
ascertained by the barometer.

   The geological survey of the neighbourhood of Smyrna was
extended westward along both shores of the Gulf, and over
the peninsula of Karabournou, by Lieut. Spratt, and the fos
sils which he collected have been described by Prof. E. Forbes
(Journ. Geol. Soc., vol. i. p. 156).
   The same gentlemen have given a short notice of the geo
logy of lycia in the Journ. Geol. Soc., vol. ii. p. 8; and in
theirjoint “Travels in Lycia” their observations are to be found
in greater detail, and are embodied in the beautiful map of
Lycia which accompanies the work.

stricts of the Eastern Taurus in Journ. Geol. Soc., vol. i. p. 330.
    And lastly, Dr. Daubeny, in his work on Volcanos just
 published, has devoted an entire chapter to the volcanic phae
 nomena of Asia Minor.
    Besides these more elaborate treatises, a variety of scattered
 hints and notices on Anatolian geology may be collected from
 the works of Fontanier, Andreossy, Beaufort, Texier, Ains
 worth, Fellows, and others.        From these multifarious sources
 I commenced three or four years ago to construct for my own
 use a general geological map of Asia Minor. Of course it is
 a very fragmentary production; and the numerous blank
 spaces in it show how much we have yet to learn as to the
 geology of that country.
    I trust however that I have now shown that the geology of
 Asia Minor is not so completely untrodden a field as M.
 Tchihatcheff's letter would seem to imply ; and having thus
 briefly vindicated the labours of others, I shall look forward
 with lively interest to the valuable additions to our knowledge
 which we may expect from that traveller's researches.

 “A BSTRACT of a Thirteenth Series of Tide Researches.” By
        Dr. Whewell.
    The first part of this paper, “On the Tides of the Pacific,” forms a
 sequel to former papers by the same author, especially to his first
 memoir on this subject, printed by the Royal Society in 1833
 (‘Essay towards a first approximation to a map of Cotidal Lines’),
 and to the Siath Series published in 1836 (‘Results of an extended
 series of Tide Observations made on the coasts of England and

140                          Royal Society.
America in June 1835').       Among the results obtained in the latter
paper, it appeared that all the “cotidal lines” which have been most
exactly traced, meet the coast at a very acute angle; and for that
and for other reasons stated in other memoirs, the drawing of cotidal
lines across wide oceans is a very precarious process. In addition
to this consideration, the scantiness of our materials has hitherto
made it impossible to trace the tides of the Pacific in a connected
form; and the absence of lunar tides in the central parts of that
ocean (as at Tahiti) makes it difficult to represent the course of the
tides by means of cotidal lines at all. We are thus led to consider
in what other way the course of the tides over wide spaces may be
represented: and it is stated by the author, that either a stationary
undulation, or a rotatory undulation, of the central parts of an ocean,
with a border of cotidal lines proceeding outwards from the central
undulation into bays and arms of the sea, would represent, in a great
measure, the tidal phenomena of the Atlantic and Pacific, as far as
they are known.     The rotatory undulation here spoken of need not
be understood to be a rotatory motion of the water, but a geometrical
rotation of the cotidal line, such as takes place in the German Ocean;
the tide in the central part (that is, the rise and fall of the surface)
vanishing, as was shown by the observations of Capt. Hewett, though
the tidal currents at that point alternate regularly. Such a move
ment of the cotidal line may perhaps represent the phenomena of the
North Pacific.
   The author has collected materials for a Tide Map of the Pacific
from various navigators;–Cook, Flinders, King, Captains FitzRoy,
Sir E. Belcher, Sir James Ross, Stokes, Killet, and others of our
own countrymen; Malaspina, Freycinet, Du Petit-Thouars, Wrangel
and Admiral Lütke, and other Spanish, French and Russian navi
gators. The result of these appears to be, that on the eastern coast
of the Pacific, the tide comes from the west; arrives first at the coast
near Acapulco and Nicoya, and is later and later both to the north
and to the south of this point; passing to the eastward round Cape
Horn, as observed by King, and to the northward along the coast
of North America, and then to the westward along the Aleutian
Isles, and so to Kamtschatka, as stated by Admiral Lütke.
   The tides in the centre of the Pacific are too small and anomalous
to allow us to trace the connection among them. At Tahiti, accord
ing to the observations of Sir Edward Belcher, the solar and lunar
tides appear to be equal.
   The tides have been traced along the coasts of New Zealand and
Australia by Cook, Flinders, and other succeeding navigators. They
come from the east; and the cotidal lines which mark their pro
gress appear to have a north and south range, except when deflected
by passing round promontories and the like.        When we pass, west
ward from the eastern coast of Australia, the cotidal lines are too
much broken and complicated by the intervention of islands, to be
traced with our present materials of knowledge.
   The second part of the memoir, “On the Diurnal Inequality,” treats
of the difference of the two tides of the same day, which has also

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                   14, 1
been discussed in former memoirs by the author, and its laws so
fully made out, that this inequality has been introduced into the
tide tables for Liverpool and for Plymouth. This inequality depends
mainly on the moon's declination. In England it is small: it is very
marked on the coasts of Spain, Portugal and North America, as was
shown by the observations of 1836: but in the North Pacific and
in the Indian seas, it reaches an enormous amount, and shows itself
with curious differences.     In many places in those seas, the diurnal
inequality is much larger than the differences of spring and neap
tides, and is so large as utterly to confound the usual modes of
estimating the “establishment” of a place.
    This inequality affects the tides of various parts on the coast of
Australia to a very great amount, and with very remarkable differ
ences. It is seen at Adelaide on the south, and Port Essington on
the north coast; and at each place it produces a difference of several
feet between every two successive tides, when it is at its maximum :
but this difference affects mainly the high waters at Adelaide and the
low waters at Port Essington*. Also on the west coast of Australia,
near Swan River, the diurnal inequality appears with another pecu
liarity, affecting the times of high water rather than the heights.
 These differences, the author remarks, show that the diurnal wave
 travels separately from the semidiurnal wave; but our materials do
 not at present enable us to analyse the compound tide into these
 two waves, and to trace the course of each.
    The author observes, in conclusion, that our knowledge of the tides
 is not likely to be completed, nor even much advanced, by tide ob
 servations made by navigators and surveyors voyaging with other
 main objects. The later observations of the Pacific, though made
 with great industry, have added little to the knowledge derived from
 Cook, Flinders and King, because they were not geographically con
 nected with each other: and the great discrepancies of the obser
 vations at the same place show how little correctness the mean of
 them, or the result, however obtained, can pretend to.
    The results of the recent observations, with which the author has
 been furnished by various navigators and by the Hydrographer's
 Office, have been obtained by throwing the observations into curves,
 according to methods formerly used and described by the author.
 This labour has been carefully performed by Mr. D. Ross of the
 Hydrographer's Office.

 point in the interior of a continuous solid mass in a state of con
 straint, the resultant pressure or tension on this plane will vary with
 the angular position of the plane, and its direction will not, as in
 fluid masses, be generally perpendicular to the plane. There are,
 however, three angular positions in which the direction of the pres
 sure does coincide with a perpendicular to the plane. These are
 called principal directions, and are at right angles to each other; the
 corresponding pressures are called principal pressures. In these par
 ticular positions of the plane there will be no tangential action upon
 it; but generally the whole pressure or tension may be resolved into
 two parts, of which one is normal and the other tangential. In cer
 tain positions of the plane these forces assume their maximum or
 minimum values. The normal action is a maximum, when a per
 pendicular to the plane coincides with one of the three principal
 directions; and a minimum, when it coincides with another, the
 third of those directions, not corresponding either to a maximum or
 minimum value. These conclusions have been established by Poisson,
 Cauchy and others. In this paper the author has investigated the
 positions of the small plane, when the tangential force upon it is a
 maximum. There are two of these positions perpendicular to each
 other, in each of which the plane passes through that principal di
rection which does not correspond to either the maximum or mini
 mum value of the normal force, and bisects the corresponding right
angle between the other two principal directions—those of the maxi
mum and minimum normal forces. Having established the relative
positions of the planes of greatest normal and of greatest tangential
action, the author proceeds to examine how far the evidence afforded
by the distorted forms of organic remains may justify the conclusion
that these forces have had an influence in determining the position
of the planes of cleavage in the rocks containing those remains.
    Conceive one stratified bed placed on another, and acted on by
forces tending to give the upper a small sliding motion along the
surface of the lower one. A considerable tangential force will be
called into action between the beds; and if any object be placed
between them, its lower part will be pushed in one direction by the
action of the lower bed, while its upper part will be equally pushed
in the opposite direction by the action of the upper bed, and thus
the object will be twisted from its original form.    For example, sup
pose the object be an equilateral shell lying between the two beds,
with the plane of junction of the two valves parallel to the surfaces
of the beds, and suppose the median line of either valve to be per
pendicular to the direction in which the one bed tends to move along
the other. The shell in its distorted form will no longer be equila
teral; one half of each shell will be crumpled into a smaller space,
while the other half will be extended into greater breadth; so that
if there be longitudinal folds on the valve, those on the former half
will be pressed together, and those on the latter will be dilated into
greater breadth. An exactly similar effect will be produced on both
shells; but the compressed half of one will be opposite to the dilated
half of the other.

                    Cambridge Philosophical Society.                  143
     Again, suppose the beds to be acted on by forces tending to com
  press them equally in a direction parallel to their surfaces. The shell
  will then be compressed in the same direction, so that, generally, the
  ratio of the length to the breadth of the shell will be altered, but
  without that twisting which will characterize the distorted form in
  the former case. In the case of this paragraph, the direction of
  compression will coincide with what has been above termed a prin
  cipal direction, and it will also be that of marimum normal pressure.
  In the previous case, the common surface of the two beds will be the
  plane of marimum tangential action.
     If, then, in any stratified mass, we observe the organic remains to
  be regularly distorted, and twisted from their original forms, as above
  described, we may conclude that the planes of stratification have
  nearly coincided with those of marimum tangential action; but if, on
  the contrary, the distortion consists only in compression of the shells
  in a given direction along the surface of the bed where they are
  found, we may conclude that the direction of marimum normal pres
  sure has nearly coincided with this direction of compression, and was
  consequently parallel to the planes of stratification.    The masses in
  which distorted remains have been found, are generally those which
  have been much disturbed. The disturbing forces are those to which
  the distortions are to be referred ; and it may be remarked, that in
  such cases the directions of maximum and minimum pressure at any
  point would probably lie in a plane perpendicular to the strike of the
  elevated beds, and that consequently the planes of maximum tan
  gential action, which bisect the angles between those directions,
  will have approximately the same strike as the beds themselves.
      The bearing of these conclusions on the question of laminated
  structure is easily seen. Suppose the planes of lamination are ob
  served to be nearly coincident with those of stratification, and that
  the distortion of the organic remains consists in their being twisted
  from their primitive forms.      Then, if the position of the planes of
  lamination has been due to the internal pressures to which the mass
  has been subjected, it is to tangential action, and not to direct pres
  sure, that the effect is attributable. Again, if the planes of lamina
  tion have nearly the same strike as the beds, and are inclined to them
  at an angle of about 45°, while the organic remains have been dis
  torted only by direct compression, the planes of lamination must in this
  case also have coincided with those of maximum tangential action,
  and we shall have the same conclusion as in the former case.       The
  direction of compression of the organic forms ought, according to
  this view, to be perpendicular to the intersections of the planes of
  lamination and those of stratification.                         -
     Mr. Sharpe, in a paper recently published in the Journal of the
  Geological Society, has stated nearly all the evidence hitherto col
  lected on this subject; and it appears that the organic bodies are
  most twisted from their original forms in those cases in which the
  planes of lamination coincide most nearly with those of stratification,
  and that they have generally suffered most direct compression without
  twisting in those cases in which the planes of lamination are inclined

to those of stratification at an angle of 40° or 50°. We must
therefore conclude, according to the last paragraph, that the planes
of lamination approximately coincide with those which were formerly
the planes of greatest tangential action.
   The author does not regard this mechanical action as the probable
primary cause of the laminated structure, but rather as a secondary
cause, which may have had its influence in determining the positions
of the planes of lamination. He trusts that further evidence will be
collected on the subject.

and Malabar Point flagstaff, S. 88° 55' W. : these two are points in
the trigonometrical survey; but I have not the survey data, with the

passed until near the end of the eclipse. Shortly before the annular
 phase, a faint ray or brush of light was seen issuing from the sun's
 northern cusp, which soon after extended in both directions as a
 tangent to the sun's limb : nothing of the kind was visible at the
 other cusp; possibly it arose from a passing film of vapour.
    “When the annulus was about forming, the first thing noticed
 was the light running rapidly round on the south side, leaving a
 break of considerable extent, which seemed to arise from a projecting
 table-land in the moon.      This was soon withdrawn, and at the same
 instant a kind of ligament, or stalk, of about 1' in breadth, was seen
 attaching the moon's limb to that of the sun, which was now quite

 fectly well-defined except in this point. The ligament lasted for 3"
 or 4°, perhaps more, elongating as the moon advanced, and was at
 length suddenly retracted into her circumference, the end appearing
 broken or toothed. At the breaking of the annulus the phaenomenon
 was different; the moon's limb continued to approach that of the
 sum, till, when very close, a portion of the former, about 30° in ex
 tent, suddenly flowed over in dark lines, with bright spaces between,
 which almost immediately vanished, the whole appearance not last
 ing above 2". The first appearance was like that shown in plate 1,
 fig. 10 of the Society's Memoirs, vol. x., and the last more resembled
 figs. 1 and 3 of the same plate, but the lines were more numerous
 though they could not be counted. The telescope used was a 3%
 foot by Dollond, with a power of 40.
    “Not being in good health, I was unable to make any further
observations of importance, except that the temperature of the air
fell during the eclipse from 87° to 84°5, and rose again to 85°-5 at
the termination; and that, while the annulus lasted, the sun's rays
had scarcely a perceptible effect on the thermometer.
    “The time of the retraction of the ligament was noted as that of
the formation of the annulus; and the time when the lines began to
run across as the time of the end of the same. No light could be
seen round the moon's limb when off the sun, either before or after
the annulus.”
    Beads in Annular Eclipses. By the Rev. Professor Baden Powell.
    The author considers the fact of the existence of the phaenomenon
in question as sufficiently well-established, notwithstanding the
equally admitted discrepancies in the accounts given of the appear
ance of the beads by different observers.     Observers differ as to such
points as the stationary or fluctuating character of the beads and the
degree of their changes into threads; and they have sometimes been
seen by one observer and not by another when the circumstances
have been in some degree different. These discrepancies the author
thinks due in some cases to the different coloured glasses employed,
and in others to the loss of light, as, for example, when the images
are projected on a screen. He thinks Mr. Caldecott's explanation
of the tremulousness of the beads (as being due to atmospheric mi
rage) unsatisfactory, and is rather inclined with Mr. Airy to attribute
it, in part, to the rapid decrease of the intensity of the sun's light
near the borders.
    The author considers the whole of the phaenomena that have been
observed to be due to two causes, viz. to the rapid decrease of light
at the sun's edge, and to the acknowledged law of irradiation, that
it increases with the increase of the intensity of the light.
    This being allowed, he imagines that “any small opening or notch
on the moon's edge will give rise to an enlarged image or patch of
light by irradiation; and that this will be much greater as the part
occasioning it is further advanced on the sun's disc ;” thus the for
mation of beads is accounted for, and their elongation.
    “Again, when the junction is broken, the same causes will account

146                  Royal Astronomical Society.
for the widening of the separation, and that in a greater degree towards
the sides which are more remote from the circumference.”
    The author then proceeds to illustrate his explanation by means
of diagrams applying to the different phases of the phaenomenon ;
 and he considers the principles laid down in explanation to possess
 the character of a vera causa, though they may not suffice to ex
 plain all the phaenomena.
    Differences in the appearances of the beads as described by differ
 ent observers must also be expected, both from the preceding theory,
 and from the circumstance that there are differences in the power
 and aperture of the telescopes employed. The author hopes shortly
 to be able to offer to the Society some contributions towards the
 better elucidation of this subject.
     It is perhaps questionable whether the same principles will afford
 an explanation of certain apparently analogous phaenomena observed
 in the transits of Venus; but, in general, the adherence of the planet
 to the limb of the sun by a neck at the point of junction, and the
 protuberance of the disc towards the same part of the separation,
  are appearances which agree sufficiently with the cause above as
  signed.
     In a note appended to Professor Powell's paper, he alludes to the
  observations of the eclipse of October 9 of the present year, in which
  small beads were observed, with waving in the limb, but without
  increase or elongations of the shadows into threads, or any other
  change. In the case of M. Schaub's observations, the complemen
  tary combination employed might, by the loss of light, have destroyed
  any effects of irradiation. Also, as the ring formed was very thin,
  the difference of the intensities of the sun's light for the breadth of
  the band would be very small; and thus the causes above referred to
  might not act to a perceptible extent: the whole of the phaenomena
  might be simply accounted for, as M. Mauvais observes, by the mere
  consideration of the irregularities of the moon's limb as it just
  touched that of the sun.
      Results deduced from the Occultations of Stars and Planets by
  the Moon, observed at Cambridge Observatory from 1830 to 1835.
   By the Astronomer Royal.
      These occultations were reduced at the time in the most complete
   manner which was then practicable. A very approximate place of
   the star having been assumed, the apparent place of the point of the
   moon's limb at which the occultation took place was known, and by
   the application of the proper correction for parallax, the geocentric
   place of the same point for the instant of occultation was also known.
   The geocentric place of the moon's centre was computed for the in
   stant of occultation, according to the lunar tables. From the sphe
   rical coordinates of these two points, their distance was computed,
   which ought to be equal to the tabular semidiameter of the moon.
   Any discordance must arise from some of the following sources:—
   an error in the assumed R.A. or N.P.D. of the star, an error in the
   tabular R.A. or N.P.D. of the moon, an error in her parallax or semi
   diameter, or in the time of observation. The effects of errors of all these

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                   147
kinds (except that of the moon’s semidiameter) upon the computed
distance between the moon's centre and the point on her limb, were
calculated and expressed symbolically; and finally, the computed
distance, with the addition of these symbolical terms, was made ab
solutely equal to the tabular diameter, with the addition of a sym
bolical term ; thus the final equation contains one numerical term
derived from the observation, and seven symbolical terms. This is
essentially the simplest and most complete result which can be de
rived from the observation of an occultation; and if the numerical
values of any one of the symbols shall become known, such symbols
may, by numerical substitution, be removed from the equation.
    The equations, in the form just described, are published in the
various volumes of the Cambridge Observations from 1830 to 1835.
    The form can now be simplified for the following reasons:—
    1st. The stars have been carefully determined, hence the symbols
for their errors in R.A. and N.P.D. can be got rid of in all cases.
 The same may be said, with few exceptions, of the places of the
 occulted planets.
  N2nd. Mr. Henderson's investigation of the value of the horizontal
 parallax of the moon (Mem. Roy. Ast. Soc., vol. x.) enables us to
 remove the corresponding symbol.
     3rd. An error had been committed in the computation of the sym
 bolical factor respecting the correction to be made to the time of
 observation. The change in the place of the moon's centre had been
 correctly computed; but the change in the correction for parallax,
 consequent on a change in the hour angle depending on a correction
 for time, had been omitted. The equations are now cleared of this fault.
     To facilitate the application of the results to lunar theories, the
 form of the equations has been changed; and they now depend on
  errors of longitude and ecliptic north polar distance, and not on
  errors of R.A. and N.P.D.
     It was not thought advisable to introduce into the equations the
  numerical correction of the moon's semidiameter, as deduced from
  transit and circle observations, as it would be hazardous to assume
  that this semidiameter is necessarily the same as the semidiameter of
  the opake body behind which the occultations occur.
      To the year 1833 inclusive, the lunar elements are computed from
  the Berliner Jahrbuch: for 1834 and 1835, they are derived from
  the Nautical Almanac. The computations have been partly made
  by Mr. Glaisher, partly by Mr. H. Breen, Jun. ; and the Astronomer
  Royal places great reliance on the accuracy of the results.
      The memoir is divided into three sections.
      Sect. I. Places of the occulted stars adopted for computation.
      Sect. II. Correction of the assumed value of horizontal parallax,
  and correction of the factor of the error of time, depending on the
   change of parallax during the error of time.
      Sect. III. Transformation of the final equations, from the form
   depending on errors, of the moon's place in R.A. and N.P.D. to a
   form depending on errors of the moon’s place in longitude and eclip
   tic north polar distance; and exhibition of the final results.

   Letter from the Rev. W. R. Dawes.
   “On the first of the last month, while tracing the southern limits
of the great nebula in Orion, my attention was attracted by the ap
pearance of the star which stands on the point of the proboscis major.
With my 84-foot equatoreal, power 195, the star was distinctly se
parated into two, whose magnitudes were carefully estimated to be
the eighth and ninth. I have since searched in vain for any notice
of the duplicity of this star; yet it must have come under the eye
of every observer who has scrutinized the ramifications of this most
extraordinary of the nebulae. In the map of the regions and stars
of the nebulae, presented by Sir John Herschel to the Astronomical
Society in 1826, and contained in vol. ii. of the Memoirs, this star
is inserted and denominated A.       The same designation is given to
it in the catalogue of the stars in the nebula given by Sir John in
page 28 of his Results of Astronomical Observations made at the
Cape, in which it stands as No. 135. It is there called 6.7 magni
tude, which is far brighter than it appears in this latitude : yet its
 identity is unquestionable. Though one of the most conspicuous
 stars in that part of the nebula, and inserted with perfect accuracy,
 from micrometrical observations in the beautiful plate in Sir John's
volume of Results, yet no intimation is given of its being double.
 Neither does it appear in the catalogue of double stars, observed
 with the 20-foot reflector. It seems scarcely probable, that if, ten
 years ago, it presented its present appearance, it should not have
 been recognized under the power of the 20-foot reflector, and within
 30° of the zenith. This would perhaps be more extraordinary than
that it should have escaped detection by Mr. Cooper with his gigantic
refractor, or by Dr. Lamont with the large telescope of 11} inches
 aperture at the Royal Observatory at Munich (whose observations of
 the nebula are specially referred to by Sir John Herschel), or by
 Struve at Dorpat, or finally by De Vico at Rome, who seems to have
 paid great attention to this object, and in whose picture the star in
 question appears as of the eighth magnitude, which is also assigned
 to it by Lalande, in whose catalogue it stands as No. 10567. The
 unavoidable inference would seem to be, that the star must have
 emerged from a single state within the last ten years. But if its
 change has been so rapid, it is surprising that it was never observed
 to be double previously to its closing, either by Struve in his sweeps
 for double stars, or by the scrutinizing eye of Sir W. Herschel, who
 brought some of the largest and most perfect of telescopes to bear
 upon it. If, on the other hand, the star has always been as distinctly
 double as it is now, then it would be difficult to say what amount of
 non-observation may be received as conclusive evidence of non-ex
 istence. The object is, at any rate, one of peculiar interest; and I
 would earnestly request attention to it by such observers as possess
instruments competent to its satisfactory measurement.            Its mean
place for 1848.0 is R.A. 5h 28m 27°; N.P.D. 95° 43' 47".”

 Map, Hora xix. published in 1840–(R. W. R.)

        ANALYSIS OF A HYDRATED SILICATE OF ALUMINA.
                  BY MM. DAMOUR AND SALVETAT.
This mineral is found in the environs of Montmorillon (Vienne).
      It occurs in cavities in a brownish argil ; it is very soft and sa
ponaceous to the feel, perfectly amorphous, and may be readily broken
down between the fingers; its colour is bright rose-red. Without
possessing the plastic properties of clay, it very readily diffuses
through water; it is infusible by the blowpipe; it is also infusible in
the high temperature of a porcelain furnace, but assumes the white
ness and appearance of biscuit, and is hard enough to scratch glass.
   When heated in a tube, it yields much water, loses its rose colour,
and becomes grayish-white; from 60°F. and upwards it loses water
gradually, and when heated to 212°, it still obstinately retains 0.1512
of combined water. With microcosmic salt it partially dissolves,
and leaves a bulky skeleton of silica; solution of caustic soda sepa
rates from it a small portion of gelatinous silica.
   Hydrochloric acid partially attacks it, without producing the
slightest effervescence, and dissolves some lime, magnesia, potash,
alumina, oxide of iron, and traces of manganese; the greater part of
the mineral remains insoluble, and retains its rose colour.      If, after
this treatment with acid, the insoluble portion be boiled in a so
lution of caustic soda, a considerable quantity of silica is dissolved;
the insoluble portion being again treated with hydrochloric acid, it
is completely decomposed; the silica separates in a flocculent state,
and the solution contains the rest of the alumina.
   Sulphuric acid, when heated till it begins to vaporize, completely
decomposes the mineral, within about one-hundredth; on pouring
water on the substance thus acted upon, the alkali and the other
bases are dissolved, and pure silica is deposited. The solution, se
parated from the silica, gives with ammonia a precipitate coloured
with a little oxide of iron; the solution, separated from the alumina,
is rendered turbid by oxalate of ammonia, and phosphate of soda
afterwards produces an appreciable degree of turbidness.
   Examination showed that the mineral contained no sulphuric acid;
and the various tests indicated that the mineral is essentially com
posed of silica, alumina and water, and also contained small quanti
ties of lime, magnesia, potash, oxide of iron, and manganese ; the
peculiar rose colour appeared to be owing to combustible matter.
   The different analyses of this mineral were performed by various
processes; and in all of them at least one gramme was used.
   A. The mineral was fused with four times its weight of very dry
carbonate of soda; the residue was treated with water and hydro
chloric acid; the silica was separated by evaporation twice to dry
ness; heated to redness and weighed, it was totally soluble in a
solution of caustic soda.
   The solution, separated from the silica, was precipitated by am
monia, and suffered to remain at rest during twenty-four hours. The

150           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
deposit of alumina and peroxide of iron was redissolved on the filter
by dilute hydrochloric acid.
   The solution was supersaturated with soda, which redissolved the
alumina, and left the peroxide of iron with a small quantity of lime
and magnesia, which the alumina had taken down with it. These
matters were redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the oxide of iron
precipitated by ammonia, the filtered liquor being added to that
which contained the greater part of the lime and magnesia.
   The alkaline solution of alumina was decomposed by hydrochloric
acid, and this last separated by hydrosulphate of ammonia; the per
oxide of iron was dried and weighed; it dissolved totally in boiling
hydrochloric acid.
   Lastly, the lime and magnesia were successively precipitated by
oxalate and phosphate of ammonia; the ammoniaco-magnesian
phosphate was washed with slightly ammoniacal water.
   B. The decomposition of the mineral by means of hydrofluoric
acid, admitted readily of ascertaining the quantity of alkalies which
it contained. The operation was performed in a platina crucible,
and the solution evaporated to dryness with sulphuric acid ; the
residue was treated with water, the solution was filtered, the oxide
of iron and alumina separated by ammonia, and the lime then thrown
down by oxalate of ammonia.                                 -
   The liquor filtered after the separation of the lime was evaporated
to dryness, and the residue, heated to redness, consisted of alkaline
sulphates, mixed with sulphate of magnesia; the sulphates were
dissolved in water and precipitated by acetate of barytes; the solu
tion was filtered, evaporated to dryness, and calcined to decompose
the acetates and convert them into carbonates; these were treated
with water; the alkaline carbonates dissolved, and the magnesia
remained insoluble with the carbonate of barytes.
   The alkaline carbonates were converted into chlorides and weighed,
the potash precipitated by chloride of platina. The magnesia was
 separated by sulphuric acid from the carbonate of barytes, with which
it was mixed, and estimated in the state of sulphate.
    C. The employment of excess of boiling sulphuric acid and eva
 poration to dryness, is a very simple method of analysing minerals of
 this description. The substance decomposed by this method was
 treated with water; the deposit separated by filtration, and which
 consisted of silica, readily dissolved in excess of caustic soda, except
 a minute quantity of sand, which did not amount to more than 0-0140
 of the weight of the substance submitted to analysis. The alkaline
 liquid, saturated by an acid, gave pure silica, which was separated by
 the usual processes, after the evaporation to dryness had been twice
 repeated.
    The mean of four analyses performed by M. Salvetat (I.), and of
 three by M. Damour (II.), gave the following results:—

   ON THE ACTION OF CHLORINE ON BENZOATE OF POTASH.
                             BY M. SAINT-EWRE.
   When a continuous current of chlorine is passed into a solution
of benzoate of potash rendered strongly alkaline, there is produced,
after the lapse of some time, an abundant disengagement of carbonic
acid; and chloride of potassium is also formed.                 The character of
this reaction is, then, a combustion of a part of the carbon of the
benzoic acid, and consequently a substance must be formed, the
molecule of which is more simple. Analysis fully confirms this con
clusion.   The new substance is an acid which is precipitated in the
state of a potash salt; this salt purified, and then decomposed by
sulphuric acid, yields the acid in question; this last, in its turn,
after purification by several crystallizations, constitutes a volatile
substance fusible at 176° to 181°F.              Its analysis by the salt of silver
yielded numbers which indicated the formula C24 H19 Cl* O*.
   Subtracting the chlorine and going back to the primary substance,
it will be seen that it differs from the hydrate of phenyle of M. Lau
rent only by the fixation of two molecules of oxygen, and it is well
known that this is the relation of an acid to aldehyde which corre
sponds to it. The author therefore proposes provisionally to call the
new substance monochloruretted phenylic acid. If we had phenylic acid
C*H*O4, the hydrocarburet formed at a high temperature in presence
of the caustic alkalies, would be necessarily phenylen C20H12. This
last, in its turn, treated with fuming nitric acid, would yield the
                                  I
nitrogenous body C20        (§o).           Lastly, this dissolved in ammo
niated alcohol, and submitted to the action of a current of sulphu
retted hydrogen, as happily suggested by M. Zinin, ought to yield,
by the fixation of hydrogen, the body Cºo Hº N*, that is to say,
nicotina.
    This is exactly what happens in the present case; except that
 instead of having the preceding bodies, a parallel series is obtained,
 in which one equivalent of chlorime is substituted for one equivalent
 of hydrogen.
    The author has successively obtained the substances represented

152           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.

and lastly Ceo Hº Cl* N°, which is merely chlorinated nicotina, or per
haps a polymeric of this alkaloid.
   The author states, that cinnamic acid, and even margaric acid,
have already given him results comparable to the preceding.         Su
beric acid, under the same circumstances, gives rise to two new
bodies, one of which is liquid and the other solid.
   M. Saint-Evre states that he is now engaged in submitting to the
same kind of reaction the anisic, cinnamic, nitrobenzoic, and hip
puric acids.-Compie. Rendus, Decembre 13, 1847.
ACTION OF CHLORINE ON CYANIDE OF MERCURY. BY J. BOUIS.
   When bottles of chlorine are exposed to the solar rays with a
saturated and boiling solution of cyanide of mercury, there are pro
duced, after a certain time, some drops which fall to the bottom of
the water, in the form of a heavy yellow oil. The chlorine is
absorbed with rapidity, and it must be supplied till the colour ceases
to disappear. During the reaction there are formed chloride of mer
cury, hydrochloric acid, and hydrochlorate of ammonia, which remain
dissolved in the water; chloride of cyanogen, nitrogen, and carbonic
acid are disengaged.
   M. Jules Bouis has examined this reaction. The yellow oil A
which is produced has an extremely strong and irritating odour, and
occasions a great flow of tears. It is more dense than water, and
insoluble in it; but it is decomposed by it, and acquires an acid re
action.    It is soluble in aether and in alcohol.   Whether moist or
dry, it deposits after a long time crystals of sesquichloride of carbon
C*C16. It explodes when heated.
   This very changeable substance gave by analysis, carbon 10:47 to
10.92; nitrogen 8'34 to 8:43; chlorine 78.49 to 78-89. M. Bouis
deduces from these results the formula [Cº N* Cl*], which requires
carbon 11-6 ; nitrogen 8.9; chlorine 79.5.
   It is to be observed that the coincidence is not perfect; according
to this formula, there would even be a loss of 2 per cent. on the sum
of the elements obtained by experiment. But it is to be remembered
that the substance is very difficult to operate with, and a nearer ap
proximation is perhaps impossible. M. Bouis does not say whether
he collected any water by the combustion of this substance; and M.
Gerhardt observes, that the formula C3 Nº HCl would require, car
bon 11-4; nitrogen 8.9; hydrogen 0°3; chlorine 79°4.
   When this compound is exposed to the action of a moderate heat
it boils, gives out nitrogen mixed with carbonic acid, and there di
stils a colourless liquid B, which, on standing, deposits crystals of
sesquichloride of carbon C* C19.
   This new liquid is colourless, limpid, heavier than water, and has
a strong irritating odour. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              153
alcohol, and more so in aether.    It boils at about 185° F.; but this
point is not fixed, and rises gradually. M. Bouis found this liquid,
cleared as much as possible from chloride of carbon, to consist of,
carbon 12'36—11'57–12:35; chlorine 81:80—80'42–81-63; ni
trogen 4:9–5. 1. M. Bouis deduces the formula [C10 Nº Cl**], which
appears to M. Gerhardt to be rather complicated.
   Lastly, when nitric acid is added to the liquid A, and the mixture
is slightly heated, it boils and emits torrents of gas, which cause the
apparatus to fly to pieces. Nitrogen and carbonic acid are disengaged,
and much nitrous vapour is formed, mixed with yellowish vapours of
a very strong odour. Distillation gives sesquichloride of carbon
C*C1", and also a very volatile colourless liquid C, the odour of which
is more irritating than that of the preceding products. M. Bouis
found in the liquid C, carbon 10:26—10.9; chlorine 75-86—75-74;
nitrogen 8'21–7.85. He represents these numbers by the formula
 [C*N* Clº Oºl, which require carbon 10.9; nitrogen 75-5; oxygen
4:9.
   M. Gerhardt observes that, supposing hydrogen to exist in this
compound, the formula would be C3 Nº H Cl? O ; carbon 109; hy.
drogen 0:2; nitrogen 8 l; chlorine 75'5.
   M. Gerhardt remarks that the preceding formulae are not deducible
in a simple manner from the composition of cyanides and water;
the substance B appears to be specially inadmissible. M. Bouis sup
poses sesquichloride of carbon to pre-exist in these compounds, and
sets out from this hypothesis to explain the formation of it.—Journ.
de Pharm. et de Ch., Octobre 1847.
                        FRIGORIFIC MIXTURE.
   It is stated by M. B. F. Jourdan, that when a mixture is made of
equal weights of commercial hydrochloric acid and finely-powdered
sulphate of zinc, the cold produced sinks the thermometer from 50°
to 20° F.—Ibid. Janvier 1848.
     - RESEARCHES ON PHOSPHORUS.             BY M. P. THENARD,
   The author states that in the last researches which he presented
to the Academy, he announced that by passing hydrochlorate of me
thylene over phosphuret of calcium at a high temperature, five differ
ent products were obtained, all of which were new, and all phos
phorized, and which vaporized and condensed in receivers, three in
a solid state and two liquid; that the three solid products, entirely
formed of phosphorus, hydrogen and carbon, were especially worthy
of particular attention; that one of them is a powerful alkali, the
properties and probable composition of which he had described; and
that the most remarkable of the three, which is spontaneously in
flammable, and has an odour analogous to that of cacodyl, is converted,
under the influence of acids, into a certain quantity of the two others.
   The author also added, that if it were true that the alkali was
 represented in its composition by 1 equivalent of phosphorus, 9 of

154.             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
hydrogen, and 6 of carbon, PH"C", it was probable that the two
other liquids were represented, one by 1 equivalent of phosphorus, 6
of hydrogen and 4 of carbon, PH" C*, and the other by 2 equiva
lents of phosphorus, 3 of hydrogen and 2 of carbon, Pº Hº C*; that
is to say, that the three compounds of phosphorus and hydrogen,
PH, PH", PH3, combine, the first with one equivalent of methylene,
the second with 2, and the third with 3.
   M. Thenard states, that being desirous of submitting his views to
the test of experiment, he prepared, not without danger, the new
products which he wished to examine.                   -
   The analysis of the new alkali was frequently repeated, as also of
the inodorous and non-alkaline matter, into one of which the spon
taneously inflammable substance is transformed : the formula of the
first is PH*, 3C*H*, and of the second P’ H, C*H*. After having thus
verified his first conjectures, the author was occupied exclusively with
the spontaneously inflammable liquid. The examination was beset
with difficulties, owing to the disagreeable qualities of the compound,
and its unstable and inflammable nature.
   The formula of this compound was found to be PHP, 20° Hº. Its
properties are, that it is a transparent liquid, colourless and slightly
viscid, insoluble in water, and has an excessively disagreeable odour;
it boils at about 482°F. When exposed to the air it inflames spon
taneously; but when kept in a bottle into which air is gradually
introduced, it absorbs oxygen slowly, and is converted into a beau
tiful, very acid crystalline product.
    With hydrochloric acid gas it exhibits the most important phae
nomena.      It forms at first a solid monohydrochlorate, which is cry
stallized and very permanent, and afterwards passes to the state of
bihydrochlorate, which is liquid and of slight stability; and if the
action of the acid continues, it is uniformly transformed into hydro
chlorate of the alkali PH' 3C*H*, and into a yellow substance
 P2 H C2 H2.
    The monohydrochlorate when put into water at 32°F. dissolves
without alteration; but if the temperature be gradually raised, it
 decomposes at the same time as the water, so as to give rise to a
 new acid, which the alkali produces by oxidizement, and to a new
 gas which gradually combines with its volume of oxygen, and pro
 duces a liquid of strongly marked acid properties; and it also absorbs
 either one or two volumes of hydrochloric acid gas, and forms fine
 crystals, from which water instantly disengages the new gas.
    M. Thenard concludes from his experiments,
    1. That phosphorus combines with hydrogen and carbon in several
 proportions.
    2. That the three phosphurets of hydrogen at present known
 unite,
    The solid phosphuret Pº H with one equivalent of methylene;
    The liquid phosphuret PH* with two equivalents of methylene;
    The gaseous phosphuret PH8 with three equivalents of methylene:
 that is to say, with as many equivalents of methylene as there are of
 hydrogen in the phosphurets.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             155
   3. That the first of these three new compounds is solid, yellow,
inodorous, insipid, insoluble in water, and inert, at least at common
temperatures; that the second is liquid, extremely noxious, spon
taneously inflammable, and susceptible of forming a new acid when
gradually exposed to oxygen; that the third is alkaline, non-inflam
mable, and susceptible, like the preceding, of absorbing oxygen gas,
and giving rise to a totally different acid.
   4. That the spontaneously inflammable compound may be con
verted into the two others under the influence of a great excess of
acid; but in the state of monohydrochlorate it is decomposed by the
action of water and of heat, producing a new gas PHº C*H*, or pro
bably PHC H2 H2.
   5. That this same compound is analogous to cacodyl; and confirms
by this analogy the natural relations which exist between arsenic and
phosphorus.
   The author concludes with the following considerations:—
   Is it not probable that, with other hydrochlorates of carburetted
hydrogen and phosphuret of calcium, a series of products would be
obtained analogous to those which are yielded by hydrochlorate of
methylene?
   May we not hope that the arseniurets of hydrogen will produce
similar combinations; and is it going too far to presume that it will
probably be the same with nitruret of hydrogen :
   There would thus be formed a great number of new compounds
which ought to be assimilated to organic compounds, and of which
theory now indicates the composition and properties.
   It is even probable that phosphorusoccurs in cerebral matter, the
nerves, &c., in which it has been discovered in this state of com"
bination; but the phosphuret of hydrogen in them must be com
bined with much carburetted hydrogen.
   The author has already procured a new series of products resulting
from the reaction of hydrochloric aether, or hydrochlorate of ethyle
and phosphuret of calcium : they are such, that the series which
they constitute is to that which the author has described, as alcohol

    M. Descloizeaux states that in the month of July 1846, he found
 in the cavities of an amygdaloidal trap which forms the bay of
 Dyrefiord, on the western coast of Iceland, some small translucent
 colourless crystals, which scratched glass readily, were fragile, and
 of sp. gr. 2.201.
    These crystals are very closely aggregated together, and, grouped
in the mammillary form or that of cock,s-combs, analogous to some
 varieties of prehnite, have as their primary form a right rhombic
prism of 111° 15', in which one of the sides of the base is to the
 height as 537 to 786.
                                                                       .**

   The prevailing form consists of the faces bº placed on the edges
of the base of the prism, of the base and of the modification g’
parallel to the small diagonal of this base.
   The inclinations of the faces are as follow :—
               bº on the face m of the prism.... 147°30'

   The low specific gravity of the sinall crystals from Dyrefiord, their
crystalline form, and the analyses which M. Damour has published
in the ninth volume of the Annales des Mines, show that they agree
perfectly with the species long since separated from harmotome by
MM. Gmelin and Nepel, and since by M. Köhler, under the name
of harmotome with a base of lime, or harmotome of Marburg.
    The crystals of this mineral, which are met with in the ancient
volcanic rocks of Annerode near Giessen, of Stempel near Marburg,
and Habichtswald near Cassel, possess, besides the 'faces stated to
belong to the Iceland variety, a modification also placed on the edges
of the base of the primary form, and the crystallographical sign is b}.
    This modification, which is not known in common harmotome, the
primary and prevailing forms of which are almost identical with those
of lime harmotome, makes with the base of the prism an angle of
 138°54', and with the face b an angle of 163° 35'.
    The great external resemblance of the Marburg mineral and the
small crystals of Capo di Bove near Rome, and Aci-Reale in Sicily,
long since described by M. Lévy under the name of phillipsite, in
duced M. Köhler to suppose that these two substances constituted
only one species; but the recent analyses of phillipsite, published
by M. Marignac in the 14th volume of the Annales de Chimie et de
Physique, demonstrate that this arrangement cannot take place.
    The Iceland and Marburg minerals form therefore a distinct spe
 cies, inasmuch as they possess a peculiar form and composition; M.
Descloizeaux proposes the name of Christianite for this mineral.—

 ON    THE    IDENTITY     OF    METACETONIC                 AND  BUTYRO-ACETIC
    ACIDs–PROPIONIC ACID.                BY MM. DUMAs, MALAGUTI AND
    F. LEBLANC.
    M. Gottlieb obtained some years since a new acid by oxidizing
 sugar by means of potash, which he called metacetonic acid, on the
 supposition of the possibility which the formulae indicated, and which
 experiment has confirmed, of obtaining it by subjecting metacetone to
 the action of oxidizing bodies. M. Redtenbacher has since found
 that glycerine, under the influence of ferments, also yields metace
 tomic acid; and he has since succeeded in separating considerable
 quantities of it from the product obtained by oxidizing oleic acid with
 mitric acid.
                                                                                ºl. A

 • The authors now cited have found this same acid as one of the re
sults of the destruction of hydrocyanic aether, by means of potash.
M. Noellner had also observed in the matters to which the fermenta
tion of tartrate of lime gave rise, a peculiar acid, resembling acetic
acid, which on this account he named pseudo-acetic acid. M. Nicklès
has submitted this acid to rigid experiments, which show that it
possesses the same composition as metacetonic acid; and some in
ferences induce him to suppose that it has a certain tendency to sepa
rate into butyric and acetic acid; hence the name of butyro-acetic
acid, by which he proposes to distinguish it. M. Nicklès insists in
his memoir on some facts which he regards as sufficient to constitute
an essential difference between his acid and metacetonic acid; he men
tions several properties which he thinks sufficient to separate them;
but these properties are evidently owing to the still imperfect history
of metacetonic acid. On comparing metacetonic acid extracted from
 metacetonate of potash, with that prepared by means of hydrocyanic
 aether and butyro-acetic acid derived from fermented tartrate of
 lime, the authors ascertained that they were identical, having the
 same composition expressed by Cº Hº O4; they have the same odour
 and appearance; they both crystallize at common temperatures in
laminae analogous to those which are yielded by acetic acid. They
 combine with water in all proportions, the compound floating in the
 form of an oily stratum on a solution of phosphoric acid or of chlo
 ride of calcium; they both boil at about 284°F. ; their salts act in
 the same manner; when distilled with arsenious acid they yield pro
 ducts which have the odour of alcarsine; the salts of silver which the
 two acids form, are identical both in appearance and in composition.
     M. de la Provostaye determined that the crystals of the metaceto
 nate and butyro-acetate of barytes were similar in form, and that all
  the angles which could be compared were identical.
     From the collection of facts now stated, the authors think they
 are entitled to conclude that metacetonic acid, pseudo-acetic acid,
 and butyro-acetic acid constitute the same and one only acid.
    This acid, they further remark, is the first which exhibits the fatty
 character, setting out from formic or acetic acid, towards the fatty
 acids properly so called; it is the first which separates from solution
 in the form of an oily stratum; it is the first which gives, with the
  alkalies, salts that are unctuous to the touch, similar to alkaline
  soaps.   These characters have induced the authors to give to this
  substance the name of propionic acid, a name which indicates its place
  in the series of fatty acids; it is the first of them.
     When one of the authors indicated, six years since, the existence
  of a group of acids having the general formula C*H" O*, he could
  cite only eight acids which were susceptible of being referred with cer
  tainty to this general formula; they were the formic, acetic, valeri
  anic, oenanthylic, lauric, myristic, ethalic and margaric. To reduce
  the butyric, caproic and capric acids to this general formula, it was
  requisite to admit a slight inaccuracy in the explanation of the gene
  rally correct analyses of M. Chevreul. Recent researches on these
  three acids have perfectly confirmed this supposition.

158            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   As however there must exist between margaric and formic acid:
fifteen intermediate acids, six remained to be discovered. These gaps
were almost entirely filled up by the metacetonic, caprylic, pelar
gonic, cocinic and benic acids, recently discovered by a more atten
tive study of fatty bodies. There may now be reckoned, including
anamirtic acid, eighteen acids forming a continuous series, in which
only a single term is wanting.
    It is proper to add that the unpublished researches of M. Brodie
prove that the general formula C" H" O*, far from stopping at mar
garic acid, includes a new acid, the composition of which is C*H*
O*, and even acids which reach still higher formulae. We are there
fore certain that there are, confining ourselves to the first among
them, eight fatty acids to discover between margaric acid and that
the formula of which has just been given, and that these acids will
be less fusible, more solid, and consequently more proper for certain
uses, as for example of giving light, even than margaric acid itself, pro
vided abundant sources of them should be discovered. It is therefore
a subject of the greatest interest to collect and to analyse with care
fatty matters of vegetable origin. Everything induces the belief that
by them the gaps will be occupied. We are however so little ad
vanced in knowledge respecting the fatty matters which exist in in
sects, that it would not be surprising if an attentive study of their
materials should furnish some of the terms which sooner or later may
 enrich the series by completing it.
    Everything induces the hope that the twenty-six acids which we
 are entitled to nominate are not the only ones, and nothing autho
rises us to foretell to what point the simple formula C*H" O' will
extend or where its application may stop.–Comptes Rendus, No
vembre 29, 1847.
      ON THE COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF NICOTINA.
    M. Barral finds that nicotina consists of—
             40 eqs. of carbon. . . . . . . . =240      74-07
             28 eqs. of hydrogen .... = 28                8'64
              4 eqs, of azote . . . . . . . . = 56       17:29
                                                3.24.  100 : 00
    Nicotina combines with water in all proportions, and is also hy
 grometric. In an atmosphere saturated with the vapour of water,
 100 parts are capable of absorbing 177 parts of water in three
 weeks, and this it loses completely in an atmosphere dried by potash.
    When nicotina is thus hydrated it becomes entirely a crystalline
 mass, when exposed to a refrigerating mixture of salt and ice. It
 is unquestionably owing to the presence of water in nicotina, that
 M.M. Posselt and Reimann have stated that this alkali may be soli
 dified: this does not occur with anhydrous nicotina.
    Chlorine acts energetically on nicotina. When a few drops of it
 are let fall into a bottle of chlorine, the combination may be so vivid
 as to emit light; hydrochloric acid is disengaged, and a liquor of a

blood-red colour is obtained. If the bottle be then exposed to the
action of light for some days, the liquor is decolorized; and if the
external air is below 46°F. it crystallizes in long needles, which
disappear when the temperature rises. The product when treated
with alcohol is decomposed, and a whitish deposit is formed which
may be separated by the filter, and being dissolved in alcohol, cry
stals are obtained by spontaneous evaporation.                                    The filtered water
is strongly acid; and when concentrated by a gentle heat it becomes
of a brownish-red colour.           Phosphorus is insoluble in nicotina, but
sulphur dissolves in it. At 212°F. 100 of nicotina dissolve 10:58
of sulphur, the greater part of which is deposited in small needles
 on cooling ; the nicotina becomes of a deep brown tint.—Ann. de

 XXIV. On the Distinctness of Vision produced in certain cases
    by the use of the Polarizing Apparatus in Microscopes. By
    Sir DAVID BREwsTER, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S. and V.P.R.S.
    Edin.”
 HAYNº.            lately had occasion to examine some very mi
        nute crystals, and also some animal and vegetable fibres
that possessed the doubly-refracting structure, I was surprised
to find that, by the use of the polarizing apparatus, I could
eliminate two kinds of indistinctness which affect the vision of
microscopic objects. The interposition of a Nicol's prism, or
of an analysing rhomb of calcareous spar, however skilfully
formed, between the eye and the object, has always been con
sidered as deteriorating the microscope, and the observer is
justified in removing it in ordinary cases when he wishes to
obtain the most perfect definition which his instrument can
give. When the object, however, has a doubly-refracting
structure of the slightest kind, so as to act upon polarized
light, the polarizing apparatus is of vast service in developing
its form and structure, not merely its doubly refracting struc
ture, but that form and structure which it exhibits in common
light.
  9. order to illustrate this use of the polarizing apparatus,
let us take the seed of the Collomea grandiflora, which, when
steeped in water, throws out hundreds of spiral fibres like
corkscrews, with the spires sometimes elongated by pressure
into waving lines, and sometimes compressed almost into con
tact f. If we now place these spirals between two plates of
glass and in castor-oil which has nearly the same refractive
power as the fibres, we shall obtain a tolerably distinct view

   + This elongation and compression of the spirals was, produced by
pressing the spirals out of the seed when steeped in castor oil.

162        Sir D. Brewster on the Distinctness of Vision
of them without the polarizing apparatus; but we shall find
it very difficult, if not utterly impracticable, to trace the fibres
through their circumvolutions and obtain a satisfactory defi
nition of them. This difficulty arises from the diffraction of
light; the rays which pass the edges of the fibres interfering
not only with one another, but with the rays which pass
through the fibres, and producing great indistinctness of vision.
    If we now expose the spiral fibres to polarized light, and apply
the analysing rhomb, we shall see them beautifully delineated
on a dark ground in the light which they depolarize and trans
mit. Spirals which were imperfectly seen before will be seen
distinctly now; and the minute points or duplications of the
fibre which mark each spire, when the whole is drawn out
nearly into a straight line, will be beautifully defined, though
they were entirely invisible in common light. By turning
round the analysing rhomb and making the field of view alter
nately dark and luminous, we shall be able to compare the two
modes of vision which I have described.
    The cause of the superior definition thus obtained it is not
difficult to discover. I have elsewhere shown that the imper
fect definition obtained by microscopes arises from the diffrac
tion of light; and I have pointed out the method of illumina
ting microscopic objects so as to reduce the diffraction to a
minimum, if not to remove it. In the present case, however,
the diffraction is entirely removed. As no light whatever passes
by the edges of the fibres, there can be no interference, and
consequently no diffraction and no fringes, and therefore the
fibre must be seen with the most perfect definition.
    In making these observations, I discovered another advan
tage arising from the employment of polarized light. In many
cases we cannot use a second plate of glass between the object
and the object-glass of the microscope, so as to have the object
placed in a stratum of fluid with parallel sides: we are there
fore obliged to allow the rays from the object to suffer refrac
tion through the irregular surface of the fluid in which it lies.
There are cases, too, where the object is imbedded in a re
fracting medium, upon which we can neither grind, if it is
solid, nor obtain, when it is fluid, a flat surface. The irregu
 larities therefore of surface around the object to be viewed,
refract the transmitted light in such a manner as always to
 injure vision, and often to obliterate the object altogether.
 By using polarized light we get rid entirely of this irregularly
refracted light, with the exception of that minute portion which
corresponds with the surface directly interposed between the
object and the object-glass. In order to witness this effect,
we have only to place some of the spirals of the Collomea on

             produced by the Polarizing Microscope.          163
a plate of glass and cover them with a thin film of castor-oil,
which of course cannot be made parallel. By viewing them
in the polarizing apparatus, and making the field of view alter
nately dark and luminous, we shall see the superior distinctness
of vision which is obtained by the use of polarized light. In
getting rid of the second plate of glass we get rid of its im
perfections, both of surface and of substance, and we get rid
also of the spherical aberration which it introduces, and for
the removal of which we are obliged, when using high powers,
to make an adjustment in the object-glass.
   The preceding observations are of course applicable only
to those microscopic objects which depolarize light; but there
is scarcely an animal or a vegetable fibre which does not pos
sess this property. The minutest hair of the smallest animal
which I have been able to procure depolarizes light; and if a
case should occur where the depolarizing structure exists, and
could be rendered visible by doubling the thickness of the
fibre, we might obtain this effect by making the polarized light
pass twice through the fibre by reflexion, and thus exhibit
itself luminously on a dark ground.
    When microscopic objects have no action upon polarized
light, we can only remove the indistinctness produced from dif
fraction by such an illumination as will cause the light to di
 verge from the object as if it were self-luminous. The method
 of doing this was first described in the Edinburgh Journal of
 Science, and afterwards more fully in my Treatise on the Mi
 croscope; but as this method has been confounded with Dr.
 Wollaston’s + method of illuminating microscopic objects by
 a celebrated optician, M. Chevalier of Paris, I shall embrace
 the present opportunity of showing that the two methods have
 no resemblance whatever.
    In proposing a method of illuminating microscopic objects,
 Dr. Wollaston’s object was to get rid of the superfluous light
 which gave indistinctness to microscopic vision, and not to
 remove the evils arising from diffraction. He never even
 mentions diffraction, or any other cause but that of superfluous
 light, as the origin of imperfect vision, arising from the usual
 modes of illumination.       He was, indeed, not aware that the
 diffraction of the light used for illuminating objects was the
 evil to be corrected; and he has accordingly neither corrected
 it by his method, nor attempted to correct it. “In the illu
 mination of microscopic objects,” he says, “whatever light is
 collected and brought to the eye beyond that which is fully com
 manded by the object-glasses, tends rather to impede than assist
 distinct vision. My endeavour has been, to collect as much
                 * Philosophical Transactions, 1829, p. 9.

of the admitted light as can be done by simple means, to a
focus in the same place as the object to be examined. For
this purpose I have used with success a plane mirror to direct
the light, and a plano-conver lens to collect it.” In describing
the apparatus itself, he enjoins that this “plano-convex lens,
or one properly crossed, so as to have the least aberration,
should be about three-quarters of an inch focus, having its plane
side next the object to be viewed; and at the bottom is a cir
cular perforation A, of about three-tenths of an inch in diame
ter, for limiting the light reflected from the plane mirror, and
which is to be brought to a focus at a, giving a neat image of the
perforation A at the distance of about eight-tenths of an inch
from the lens ET (the plano-convex lens) and in the same
plane as the object which is to be examined. * * * * The
lens ET, or the perforation A, should have an adjustment by
which the distance between them may be varied, and the image
of the perforation be thus brought into the same plane with the
object to be examined.” < * * “For the perfect performance
 of this microscope,” Dr. Wollaston adds, “it is necessary that
 the axes of the lenses and the centre of the perforation should
 be in the same right line. This may be known by the image of
 the perforation being illuminated throughout its whole extent,
and having its whole circumference equally well-defined. For
 illumination at night, a common bull's-eye lanthorn may be used
with great advantage.”
    In the APPENDIx to this paper, Dr. Wollaston gives the
following directions for the adjustment of his illuminating lens.
 “The position of the lens may be varied so as to bring the
 image” of the perforation into the same plane with the object to
 be viewed. * * * * Supposing the plano-convex lens (the
 illuminating lens) to be placed at its proper distance from the
 stage, the image of the perforation may be readily brought into
 the same plane with the object, by fixing temporarily a small
 wire across the perforation with a bit of wax, viewing any ob
ject placed upon a piece of glass upon the stage of the micro
 scope, and varying the distance of the perforation from the
 lens by screwing its tube until the image of the wire is seen
 distinctly at the same time with the object upon the piece of glass.”
     From these extracts we do not say it is manifest, but we say
 it is demonstrable, that Dr. Wollaston was not in the least
 degree acquainted with the method which I subsequently pub
 lished, of illuminating microscopic objects, and which is now in

 universal use. The object of that method is to remove the indi
 stinctness produced by diffraction, by converging the illumina
 ting rays upon the object, so that they may again radiate from
 the object as if it were self-luminous. This effect can only be
 obtained by furnishing the microscope with an illuminating
 apparatus as perfect as its magnifying apparatus. In Dr.
 Wollaston's method there is no convergency of the rays upon
 the object. The rays do not diverge from the margin of the aper
 ture, but from the source of light; and even if Dr.Wollaston
 had directed that the illuminating rays should be converged
 accurately to foci coincident with the points of the object to
 be viewed, a lens three-quarters of an inch in focal length was
 quite useless for any such purpose. To try to make light
 radiate from an object seen in a microscope with any reason
 able magnifying power by means of such a lens, would be as
 absurd as to attempt to see the satellites of Saturn through an
 opera-glass; but it would be still more absurd to make such
 an attempt by an optical arrangement, under which the object
 is illuminated by rays which diverge from a great or an infinite
 distance, while the object itself is in the conjugate focus of a
 perforation within two or three inches of the lens !
    Dr. Wollaston was too sagacious an observer, and had too
 much knowledge of optics to make any such proposition. His
 apparatus accomplishes perfectly the purposes which he con
 templated; and it is no error of his, but only an error of his
 commentators, that we have now been endeavouring to correct.

, XXV. On the Use of Gutta Percha in Electrical Insulation.
     By Michael FARADAY, F.R.S., Foreign Associate of the
     Academy of Sciences, &c.
                                                 Royal Institution,
        MY DEAR PHILLIPs,                          Feb. 9, 1848.
  I   HAVE lately found gutta percha very useful in electrical
        experiments; and therefore, that others may take advan
  tage of its properties if they have occasion or are so inclined,
  give you this notice for insertion in the Philosophical Maga
  zine. Its use depends upon the high insulating power which
  it possesses under ordinary conditions, and the manner in
  which it keeps this power in states of the atmosphere which
  make the surface of glass a good conductor. All gutta percha
  is not however equally good as it comes from the manufac
  turer's hands; but it does not seem difficult to bring it into

166        Prof. Faraday on the Use of Gutta Percha
the best state: I will describe the qualities of a proper speci
men, and refer to the differences afterwards. A good piece of
gutta percha will insulate as well as an equal piece of shell-lac,
whether it be in the form of sheet, or rod, or filament; but
being tough and flexible when cold, as well as soft when hot,
it will serve better than shell-lac in many cases where the
brittleness of the latter is an inconvenience.     Thus it makes
very good handles for carriers of electricity in experiments on
induction, not being liable to fracture: in the form of thin
band or string it makes an excellent insulating suspender:
a piece of it in sheet makes a most convenient insulating basis
for anything placed on it. It forms excellent insulating plugs
for the stems of gold-leaf electrometers when they pass through
sheltering tubes, and larger plugs supply good insulating feet
for extemporary electrical arrangements : cylinders of it half
an inch or more in diameter have great stiffness, and form ex
cellent insulating pillars. In these and in many other ways
its power as an insulator may be useful.
    Because of its good insulation it is also an excellent sub
stance for the excitement of negative electricity. It is hardly
possible to take one of the soles sold by the shoemakers out
of paper or into the hand, without exciting it to such a de
gree as to open the leaves of an electrometer one or more
inches; or if it be unelectrified, the slightest passage over the
hand or face, the clothes, or almost any other substance gives
 it an electric state. Some of the gutta percha is sold in very
 thin sheets, resembling in general appearance oiled silk; and
if a strip of this be drawn through the fingers, it is so electric
 as to adhere to the hand or attract pieces of paper. The ap
 pearance is such as to suggest the making a thicker sheet of
 the substance into a plate electrical machine for the production
 of negative electricity.
    Then as to inductive action through the substance, a sheet
 of it is soon converted into an excellent electrophorus; or it
 may be coated and used in place of a Leyden jar; or in any
 of the many other forms of apparatus dependent on inductive
 action.
    I have said that all gutta percha is not in this good elec
 trical condition. With respect to that which is not so (and
 which has constituted about one-half of that which, being ob
 tained at the shops, has passed through my hands), it has either
 discharged an electrometer as a piece of paper or wood would
 do, or it has made it collapse greatly by touching, yet has on
 its removal been followed by a full opening of the leaves again :
 the latter effect I have been able to trace and refer to a con
 ducting portion within the mass covered by a thin external

                      in Electrical Insulation. .             167
non-conducting coat. When a piece which insulates well is
cut, the surface exposed has a resinous lustre and a compact
character that is very distinctive; whilst that which conducts
has not the same degree of lustre, appears less translucent,
and has more the aspect of a turbid solution solidified. I
believe both moist steam-heat, and water-baths are used in
its preparation for commerce; and the difference of specimens
depends probably upon the manner in which these are applied,
and followed by the after process of rolling between hot cy
linders. However, if a portion of that which conducts be
warmed in a current of hot air, as over the glass of a low gas
flame, and be stretched, doubled up, and kneaded for some
time between the fingers, as if with the intention of dissipating
the moisture within, it becomes as good an insulator as the
best.
   I have soaked a good piece in water for an hour; and on
taking it out, wiping it, and exposing it to the air for a minute
or two, found it insulate as well as ever.     Another piece was
soaked for four days and then wiped and tried: at first it was
found lowered in insulating power; but after twelve hours' ex
posure to air under common circumstances it was as good as
ever.    I have not found that a week's exposure in a warm air
cupboard of a piece that did not insulate made it much better:
a film on the outside became non-conducting; but if two fresh
surfaces were exposed by cutting, and these were brought into
contact with the electrometer and the finger, the inside por
tion was still found to conduct.
   If the gutta percha in either the good or the bad condition
(as to electrical service) be submitted to a gradually increasing
temperature, at about 350° or 380°, it gives off a considerable
proportion of water; being then cooled, the substance which
remains has the general properties of gutta percha, and insu
lates well. The original gum is probably complicated, being
a mixture of several things; and whether the water has existed
in the substance as a hydrate, or is the result of a deeper
change of one part or another of the gum, I am not prepared
to say. All I desire in this note is to make known its use in
the arrangement of extemporary or permanent electrical ap
paratus for the advantage of working philosophers, both juve
mile and adult.       -

XXVI. On the Course of a Ray of Light from a Celestial Body
    to the Earth's Surface, according to the Hypothesis of Undu
   lations.   By the Rev. J. CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.A.S., Plumian
   Professor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge*.
THE question I am about to consider arises out of the
        explanation of the aberration of light which I gave in
the course of a discussion in the pages of this Journal, of
which Professor Powell has given an account in vol. xxix.
p. 425, and vol. xxx. p. 93. That explanation was based on the
fact, that the measured direction of a body not partaking of the
earth's motion is necessarily referred to the direction of a body
partaking of the earth's motion. From this principle, combined
with the known velocity of the earth, and the velocity of light
deduced from observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites,
not only does aberration result (Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 321,
and vol. xxviii. p. 91), but the calculated amount agrees also
as closely as possible with that ascertained by astronomical
measurement (Phil. Mag., vol. xxviii. p. 394). There is there
fore no residual phaenomenon to be accounted for. The ex
planation requires no consideration of the way in which the
eye is acted upon by light, it rests on no hypothesis whatever,
being a strict deduction from facts, it remains the same whether
we adopt the emission theory of light or the undulatory,
whether there be aether or no aether, whether the aether be in
motion or at rest. I make this statement, lest it should be
supposed that the aberration of light depends for its explana
tion in any degree upon the answer to the theoretical question
I now proceed to consider. The truth of the undulatory
theory of light depends very materially upon it.
   The aberration of light being accounted for in the manner
referred to above, it follows as a necessary consequence, that
the course of light from a celestial object to the eye of the
spectator is rectilinear. This is easily conceivable on the
emission theory of light; but is the fact consistent with the
undulatory theory? The aetherial medium must be put in mo
tion, first, by the earth's rotation about its axis, next by its
motion in its orbit, and lastly, by the motion in space which
it partakes of in common with the other bodies of the solar
system. Is it probable that through the aether thus disturbed
a wave can be propagated in a rectilinear course? It has, in
fact, been proved by Mr. Stokes (Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 9),
that the normal to the front of the wave will be bent through
a certain small angle in a certain direction, inclining towards
that in which the earth is moving; and if nothing further

 On the Course of a Ray of Light from a Celestial Body. 169
could be said on the subject, a curvilinear motion of light
would result, and thus the undulatory theory would be found
to be inconsistent with fact. I have, however, shown(Phil. Mag.,
vol. xxvii. p. 323–326, and again in Phil. Mag., vol. xxviii. p. 92),
that in consequence of the motion of translation of the wave
caused by the motion of the aether, the direction of propaga
tion in space of a given point of the wave deviates from the
normal to the front by exactly the above-mentioned angle,
and in exactly the opposite direction. It follows that the pro
pagation in space is rectilinear; and thus the transmission of
light through the perturbed aether, without suffering aberra
tion from the motion of the aether, is accounted for on the
hypothesis of undulations. Mr. Stokes has acquiesced in this
view (Phil. Mag., vol. xxix. p. 8), and there is consequently no
longer any point in dispute between us.
   The above solution of the proposed question rests however
on an assumption. The resolved parts of the motion of the
aether at any point a y z caused by the earth's motion being
u, v, w in the directions of the axes of co-ordinates, it is as
sumed that uda +vdy--wdz is an exact differential. Is this
assumption allowable 2 Does it not restrict too much the kind
of motion P , This is the only point relating to this subject
which remains to be cleared up. , Mr. Stokes has given it
consideration in the communication last quoted. The follow
ing solution of the difficulty, derived very simply from known
hydrodynamical equations, occurred to me very recently; and
it is mainly for the purpose of bringing it under the notice of
mathematicians that I have returned to this subject. Let the
pressure at any point a y z at the time t be a*(1 +s), s being
a small quantity whose powers above the first are neglected.

it is clear that no part of the velocity can be constantly the

                XXVII. Note on Shooting Stars.
                 By Sir J. W. LUBBock, Bart.*
I WISH here to correct an oversight in p. 85 of the last
      Number, where it is implied that the same shooting star
may be observed to disappear at different instants of time by
different observers. It is obvious that if the moving body
cease to shine by reason of its entering the shadow of the
earth, this event is entirely irrespective of the position of the
observer; and therefore if it should be observed by more than
one person, such observations will furnish the parallax, and
may determine whether this mode of accounting for the dis
appearance of the star is correct or not.       If it has been at
tempted to determine the difference of terrestrial longitude by
such observations, probably the materials exist somewhere by
which the accuracy of the hypothesis can at once be tested.
It may possibly however be again observed on the same night,
either by the same or different observers, after an entire revo
lution.
   It has been the subject of speculation whether such bodies
can owe their origin to violent action at the moon’s surface.
But observers are, I believe, agreed that the surface of the
moon offers no evidence of great agitation. The indentations
of the surface remain unchanged, and no phaenomena have, I

believe, been seen which indicate the existence of volcanos,
which might discharge small bodies with great force, and thus
give rise to satellites of the earth.
    The case is widely different as regards the sun. Changes
of enormous magnitude are continually witnessed on its sur
face, which indicate the action of forces agitating the mass
probably in a state of fluidity. Recently I have observed spots
which were even visible to the naked eye, and of which, on
the following and succeeding days, not a trace could be found
by a good telescope.
    If a body were thrown up from the sun's surface, it must,
omitting all consideration of the planets, describe an ellipse
having the centre of the sun in one of the foci ; and thus,
however great the force by which the body may be sup
posed to have been discharged, it must return to the sun,
and, impinging upon it, would not perform even one entire
revolution.       If however we consider the action of the other
planets, and especially of Jupiter, it seems by no means im
 possible that in returning, a body so discharged might clear
 the sun, and perform many complete revolutions round the
 primary, that is, it might become a comet (or shooting star).
 It would be interesting to ascertain how much the perihelion
 distance of such a body might be lengthened under given
 circumstances by the action of Jupiter; or whether, under
 any hypothesis of the configuration of the planets, the perihe
 lion distance of any known comet could be brought under
 :004647. Le Verrier suggests that some of the comets may
 have become fixed to our system and retained by the action
 of Jupiter; and that in consequence of the same action, they
 may again wander in space and cease to belong to this system *.
 But may not such bodies owe their origin to the same forces,
 of which the existence is indubitable, which operate on the
 surface at any rate of the sun's mass 2 and if so, it is by no
 means impossible that by calculating the perturbations of some
 comet for the past, especially one whose perihelion distance
 is small, it may be traced back to its origin, and the very year
 ascertained when it left the solar mass.
     The phaenomena of shooting stars may possibly throw light
 upon the question of the extent to which an atmosphere ex
 tends capable of affording any sensible resistance to the mo

tion of such bodies, and may thus afford an interesting illus
tration of the connexion which exists between different branches
of physical science. In my Treatise on the Heat of Vapours,
p. 43, I have given a table, showing, upon the hypothesis I
there adopted, the density and temperature for a given height
above the earth's surface. According to that hypothesis, at
a height of fifteen miles the temperature is 240°-6 F. below
zero, the density is 03573, and the atmosphere ceases alto
gether at a height of 22:35 miles. In the Comptes Rendus des
Séances de l'Académie des Sciences, tom. viii. p. 95, M. Biot
has verified a calculation of Lambert, who found from the
phaenomena of twilight the altitude of the atmosphere to be
about eighteen miles. The constitution of the higher regions
of the atmosphere, according to the hypothesis adopted by
Ivory, is very different, and extends to a much greater height.
See p. 3 of the Supplement to my Treatise on the Heat of
Vapours, where I have given a table showing the constitution
of the atmosphere according to Ivory. Such a table for the
constitution due to Laplace's hypothesis is still wanted.

  Forces—Light, Heat, Electricity and Magnetism. By

                       On Thermo-Electricity.
IT was discovered some years ago by Mr. Sturgeon, that
      thermo-electricity does not require more than one metal
for its development.
   In confirming this discovery, I have found that the current
was developed only by the more crystalline metals, bismuth,
antimony, iron, steel, zinc, &c., as will appear on inspecting
the accompanying table.
   I found also that each metal possessed its own distinctive
and peculiar amount of current, as indicated by the galvano
meter, and that always in the same direction: that when two
opposing metals were united in producing a thermo-current,
the minor current would be found to neutralize the opposing
current, precisely to the amount of its own powers, and with
as much exactitude as if it had been done by arithmetical
calculation.
   Thus iron alone gave 74° current. Conjoined with zinc 5°;
zinc alone 24° in the opposite direction.
   It was also discovered that a minor current conjoined to one

 174      Mr. J. Goodman's Researches into the Identity of
 of a more powerful nature, does not generally augment, but
rather diminish the amount of the latter*.
    I found that the uncrystalline metals, gold, silver, copper,
lead, &c., were unable to develope currents of any appreciable
amount (as seen also in the Table), although the heating pro
 cess was continued to a considerable degree of intensity. (See
 37, 38.)
    The experiments adduced show that these latter metals may
 be simply regarded as conducting media to thermo-electricity,
that they offer no specific resistance to the flow of current,
and may therefore be employed either in conjunction with
 electro-positive or electro-negative metals.
    The results thus arrived at resemble much those evinced
 by the experiments of Dr. Franklin and others on the tour
maline, in which ordinary electricity was developed by heat
alone, save that in this instance the electricity resembles the
 voltaic fluid, owing no doubt to the want of that complete in
sulation among the molecules of the metals which is afforded
 by the tourmaline.
    It is remarkable that no polar fluid, or electricity of any
kind, is ever developed without the employment of a crystal
line, insulating, or imperfectly conducting body; for in vol
taic arrangements the electrolyte is this non-conducting medium;
in the cases just cited, the tourmaline was the intermediate
polar body; in ordinary electricity, the glass cylinder is the
non-conducting body, or “electric;” and in thermo and me
chanical electricity (hereafter to be mentioned), the crystalline
metals, bismuth, iron, steel, antimony, zinc, &c., are found to
be the intervening polar structures, giving rise to these forms
of electric fluid.
    The same remarks hold good also with regard to the polar
condition and insulating properties (witnessed by the author)
of high-pressure steam in the generation of hydro-electric,
and to the polarizable quality of steel and iron in electro
magnetic, magneto-electric, and magnetic phaenomena.
    In contemplating the known electrical phaenomena which
occur by the contact of dissimilar metals, and the processes
of friction, pressure, fracture, vaporization, &c., and witnessing
the effects which heat thus produces upon bismuth, &c., I
devised the friction of this metal in a lathe, as a preparatory
experiment to some hereinafter contained, in hopes of being
able to manifest the continuous transmission of electricity from
   * It was found that the crystalline metals, bismuth and antimony, which
form the best combination for thermo-electric purposes, are naturally mu
tually reciprocal metals. Bismuth negative, 45°; antimony positive, cur
rent 224°; and yet conjoined, they only produced a current of 48°.
                                                                           <U+017F>

the one surface to the other, as evinced by a current passing
through the galvanometer from or towards the other extre
mities of the metals employed. This, to my mind, would
evince the origin of radiant heat, the result of friction, in the
mechanical processes, drilling, turning, filing, &c., and which
on its discovery I named “mechanical electricity.”
    In the printed report of the British Association for 1845,
which met at Cambridge, I find that M. Paul Erman of Berlin
presented a paper containing one or two experiments of a
somewhat similar nature to the Association, but of which I
was not aware until the publication of the report, and the
completion of many of my experiments.
    April 2, 1846, 1 made the following experiment: —
    Upon a mandril of copper a cylinder of bismuth was cast.
One end of the mandril was fixed in dry wood, and arranged
in a turning lathe; the other revolved against the point of the
“following up head stock,” as is usual : the surface of the
cylinder or disc was turned smooth, the mandril having been
previously soldered to the bismuth, so as to ensure full metallic
COmmunication.
    Instead of a metal rest a wood one was now used, and after
wards a small piece of wood placed under the ordinary rest;
 to insulate this and the tool from the other portion of the
lathe, was found to be all that is necessary in these experi
ments. A spring of brass wire was made to press firmly
against the turning mandril, so as to ensure metallic contact,
and its other extremity was in communication with the north
ern extremity of the galvanometer*.
    In the following experiments, the direction of the current
is simply stated as seen at the galvanometer, which will be
 found in all cases to be the reverse of what takes place be
tween the opposing metals. Thus, in the experiments in which
the zinc robs the copper, as seen at the galvanometer, the cur
 rent is progressing towards the copper (see 31, &c.); and yet
the actual transfer at the surfaces is from the copper to the
Zl in C.                  -
     Exp. 21. On applying the smooth surface of the end of a
 piece of thick rod copper to the turned surface of the cylinder,
 producing friction, a current was observed from the copper
 towards the bismuth. The rod copper was soldered to a wire
 in connexion with the southern extremity of the galvanometer.
     Exp. 22. By accident the rod copper was torn away, and I
    * The galvanometer in these experiments was not of the highest sensi
 bility. It consisted of forty-six turns of copper wire, the ºth of an inch
 in diameter. The needle was single, and had therefore a northern ten
 dency to counteract.

 176 Mr. J. Goodman's Researches into the Identity of
 applied merely the extremity of the connecting wire against
 the revolving cylinder. The galvanometer was deflected many
 degrees, and considerably more than by the friction with the
larger surface. A large surface appeared to induce compler
results, and to destroy elementary or simple indications.
    Exp. 23. By means of a set-screw I connected the galva
 nometer S wire to a turning-tool, and slightly turning or sha
 ving off ribbons of bismuth, a considerable current was indi
 cated from the tool towards the bismuth. This experiment
 with the bismuth disc and steel tool was afterwards repeated
 by steam power, current 40° to 45° constant, vibrated to 80°
 or 90° at first.
    Exp. 24. With a bismuth rod against the bismuth cylinder,
 a current of 4° and afterwards of 10° to 15° towards the cy
 linder was observed”.
    Exp. 25. . The bismuth disc and an antimony rod gave a
 current of 45° in the usual direction for bismuth, the anti
 mony robbing the bismuth. Antimony positive, bismuth ne
 gative.
    Exp. 26. Silver with bismuth 40°. The usual bismuth
 Current.
    Exp. 27. Gold with bismuth 35°. The usual bismuth cur
rent.
    Exp. 28. Lead with bismuth 27}*. The usual bismuth
current from the lead to the bismuth.
    Exp. 29. With an iron disc rotating under similar condi
tions, I obtained, by a turning-tool of steel, a current of 10°
from the iron towards the tool.
    I tested the galvanometer by a voltaic pair to see the direc
tion of the current, and found the direction as stated to cor
respond.
    I repeated afterwards the same experiment by steam power,
with a much larger cylinder of cast iron, apparently harder
 than before, and the needle vibrated from 15° to 30°, station
ary at 20°; the current in that instance, from the tool towards
the disc, tested by voltaic pair.
    Exp. 30. With a sinc disc and steel tool, at first no certain
indication of current. Repeated afterwards, with and without
steam power, current 3°, and afterwards 5%, constant, from
 the tool towards the zinc.
    Exp. 31. With the extremity of the copper connecting wire,
current 24° from the zinc towards the wire. Repeated with
steam power, 3° towards the copper.

 ments correspond with the phaenomena of electro-motion—zinc
 robbing copper.
    Exp. 32. With a bismuth rod against the zinc cylinder, a
 current of 12° was evinced from the zinc towards the bismuth.
    Exp. 33. With a piece of iron sharpened, current 4° to 5°
 from the iron towards the zinc, iron positive, zinc negative.
    Exp. 34. May 2. A copper disc rubbed by a rod of bismuth,
 current produced vibrating to 30°, stationary at 15° towards
 the bismuth from the copper.
   Exp. 35. A rod of zinc against the same copper, the edges
 of the disc being made sharp, 24° towards the copper, with a
good cutting edge, 4° constant; the zinc by this means being
 well cut. Repeated 4°. Zinc robbing copper, as in exp. 31.
    Exp. 36. A piece of iron made sharp with filing, when used
 with a large copper disc 3% inches in diameter, gave a current
 of 8° stationary, while the edge remained good and removed
shavings from the iron towards the copper, iron positive.
    Exp. 37. Employed a piece of rod copper in friction against
 the revolving copper disc, and not the least indication of cur
rent was observed.
    Exp. 38. Silver thus employed against the copper disc, gave
a slight current of 1° from the silver towards the disc.
    Exp. 39. With a steel tool, a constant current of 24° to
wards the copper.

tool, current 5° from the tool towards the brass.

   Exp. 41. By filing iron with a steel file, a current of 73° is
produced from the iron towards the file, and the two metallic
bodies become oppositely magnetic, as shown by the following
experiments.                     -
   The steel surface becomes positive and the iron negative,
which are electro-polar conditions.                       -
   It will be immediately seen, that not only does the friction
of a file upon a piece of soft iron induce two oppositely elec
trical conditions of surface, but that this electrical state is also
a truly magnetic condition, and offers an explanation how, or
in what manner the various mechanical operations, screw-tap
ping, drilling, filing, &c. evince magnetic phaenomena. An
attempt to establish the opinion of magnetism being a static
electro-polar condition, was by the author of this paper brought
forward, and published in the Report of the British Associa
tion for 1842, page 17.                                          -

178      Mr. J. Goodman's Researches into the Identity of
free from magnetic polarity, I proceeded to draw the file
several times over the surface of the wire, when, by bolding
them on each side the north pole of a suspended magnetic
needle, it was found that the wire attracted, and the file re
pelled, this pole with considerable force.
    Exp. A new file attracted both poles of a magnetic needle,
or was unmagnetic. A piece of iron wire slightly repelled the
pole. After rubbing the wire along its surface, and holding
the wire on one side of the north pole and the file on the other,
the needle was attracted by the wire and repelled by the <U+017F>ile.
    Exp. A new file attracted the north pole of a magnetic
needle 10°; a piece of iron wire repelled the same. After filing
the same and placing this pole of the needle between them,
the file repelled and the wire attracted the needle. This ex
periment was repeated with the same result.
    A thick file and a thick piece of soft iron did not produce
any change, the process not being sufficiently powerful to in
duce magnetic polarity in any considerable mass of metal+.
    Exp. Another file was neutral, rather attractive. The re
pulsive end of a piece of magnetic iron wire was employed.
 After filing briskly around the surface of its extremity, the file
repelled and the wire attracted the north pole.
    Exp. Took the opposite extremities of the file and wire;
 the wire repelled, the file attracted; but on rubbing them
 together, an instant change took place; the file repelled, and
the wire attracted the needle.
    Repeated with the same results. These operations were
performed when the metals pointed southward. It was dis
covered, however, that an opposite result took place when the
filing was performed towards the north. The file then at
 tracted, and the wire repelled the north pole; but the evinced
 trifling difference of affinity between iron and steel, as shown
 in (15.), may tend to produce this uncertainty, which subjects
 them to the government of the earth's polarity.
    Is the current induced by mechanical operations simply
 thermo-electric, or not?
    Exp. 42. Immersed the lower half of the bismuth cylinder
 in water at 55°. By turning it with a steel tool about one
 minute (the water revolving around the cylinder the whole
 period), a current was constantly maintained, at length from
 35° to 40°, fine turnings being produced.

heat from the whole process, being heated only to 57° or 2°*,
and the tool immersed in a like quantity of water, was found
to increase it only half a degree.
    Exp. 43. A conducting wire, made to press against the re
volving bismuth disc slightly, produced a current of 23° to 5°;
but on using a disconnected turning-tool to the same side and
near the wire, the current was still 24° to 5°; and yet the tool
could have induced a current of 30° or 40°.               On increasing
the pressure of the wire against the cylinder, current 6° to 9°;
on using the turning-tool as before, no increase of current
could be perceived; yet on applying a lighted taper at the
junction of the wire to the cylinder, current 35°.
    The turning-tool does not, therefore, augment the heat of
surface of the disc, so as by heat to produce a current of thermo
electricity.
    Exp. 44. Attached the two galvanometer wires to the piece
of bismuth used in the experiments for the production of
thermo-electricity, one at each end. Rubbed one extremity
ºf the bismuth with force against the revolving copper disc for
one minute, and yet no current was indicated, which would
have been the case, if the heat developed by friction in these
cases had been the source of development of the fluid; for
instantly on applying the same end to the flame of a spirit
lamp, the galvanometer began to deflect. Repeated the ex
periment with like results; and on removing the wire at the
 end of the bismuth next to the copper disc, and attaching it
 to the spring which connected the mandril with the galvano
 meter for mechanical electricity, a current was instantly pro
 duced by the same friction. Repeated, and with like resultsf.
    Exp. 45. Repeated a similar experiment with iron. The
 sharp iron of exp. 36 was attached to the two galvanometer
 wires, one at each end: on turning with its sharp extremity
 the copper disc for some time, which produced an instanta
 neous current in exp. 36, no deviation of the needle was at
 all observed; but by holding the same end of the iron for a
 few moments in the spirit flame, a constant deviation com
 menced, which gradually progressed to 74°.
     Repeated the experiment with like results: yet when the
 end adjoining the disc was disconnected and attached to the
 spring in contact with the mandril, i. e. the ordinary connevion
Jor mechanical electricity being made (as in 36), an instanta
    * Observe, the turnings alone which were made, would, as will be here
 after shown, heat the water nearly to this amount, and the tool would in
 this instance heat the water more than the disc; therefore the heat derived
 from the disc would be less than $9.
    t The metals here employed are the crystalline, which have been shown
  to be the only bodies evolving the phaenomena, copper being only a simple
  conducting body.         -

 180        Researches on Light, Heat, Electricity, &c.
 neous current of 8° (stationary) was the result. Thus it is seen,
 that with the same heat developed in each case, by the mecha
 nical arrangement, is given an immediate current, which heat
 will not give a current at all by the thermo-electric process, and
 it is therefore evident that thermo- and mechanical electricity
 are not derived from the same source.
    These experiments appear very decisive. The fact of the
 current invariably pursuing the course of that in electro-motion,
 or contact of dissimilar metals, in all cases where metals illus
 trative of this phaenomenon are employed, speaks in favour of
 the dissimilarity of the source of these two modifications.
    It is also to be remarked here, that if mechanical electricity
 were the result of the heat applied to the extremity of the
 metal, the friction of flat surfaces, which is known to produce
 much more heat than simply cutting or turning with a sharp
 edge, would produce the greatest deflection of the needle;
 but by this means it is found that none, or scarcely any cur
 rent is developed, even with a disc of bismuth. (See 22, 23.)
    Exp. 46. Is mechanical or thermo-electricity conductible
 by water? A rod of bismuth was arranged for thermo-elec
 tricity in this experiment, and the voltaic decomposition ap
 paratus was employed; it was discovered that the thermo
 electric current is utterly inconductible by water or acidulated
 water; the heat was carried on to fusion, but the galvanometer
did not deflect in any appreciable manner. It is also incon
ductible by a strong solution of sulphate of copper.
    Exp. 47. The thermo-electric current from bismuth passed
through a large piece of bismuth, deflecting the galvanometer
gradually up to 15°, by the steady heat of a spirit-lamp.
    Exp. 48. Mechanical electricity is not conducted at all by
solution of sulphate of copper.
    Exp. 49. And is also inconductible by acidulated water, in
the ordinary decomposition apparatus.
    Exp. 50. But is readily transmitted by an intervening piece
of bismuth of equal temperature.
                              Remarks.
    The direction of the current from every individual metal,
and from one metal relatively with another, is at all times in
variable, both in mechanical and thermo-electricity.
    The quantity of force circulating through the galvanometer,
and proceeding from any given metal or specific pair of me
tals, is constantly about the same in amount, proportional to
the intensity of the developing process, in both modifications.
Each metal evinces an amount of force comparatively propor
tional with that of every other metal employed, both in the
mechanical and in the thermo-electricity.

       AVING received from Dr. Joseph Reade one of his
         beautiful instruments called the Iriscope, and made
several experiments with it, I soon perceived that it might be
advantageously employed in various investigations in physical
optics. This instrument consists mainly of a plate of highly
polished black glass, having its surface smeared with a solution
of fine soap, and subsequently dried by rubbing it clean with a
piece of chamois leather. If we breathe upon the glass surface,
thus prepared, through a glass tube, the vapour is deposited
in brilliant coloured rings, the outermost of which is black,
while the innermost has various colours, or no colour at all,
in proportion to the quantity of vapour deposited. The co
lours in these rings, when seen by common light, correspond
with Newton's reflected rings, or those which have black centres,
the only difference being, that in the plate of vapour, which
is thickest in the middle, the rings in the iriscope have black
circumferencest. By using a large system of rings, or depo
siting the vapour in straight lines in the plane of incidence,
we can at once observe the phaenomena of the coloured rings

ton's rings in reference to polarized light was M. Arago, who
has given an account of his observations in a beautiful and
highly interesting memoir, in the third volume of the Mémoires
d’Arcueil, published in 1817. Without knowing what had
been done by M. Arago, Professor Airy entered upon the
same inquiry in 1881 and 1832; but the phaenomena which
he observed were the same as those which had been previously
discovered by M. Arago, with the exception of the modifica
tion of the rings when formed by a lens pressed against the
surface of a diamond.
    When Newton's rings are formed by a lens pressed against

   t These rings may be formed upon almost all transparent bodies with
more or less brilliancy, though I have found several substances, and occa
sionally pieces of glass, that will not absorb the soap. The rings are pro
duced upon natural as well as artificial surfaces, that is, upon transparent
surfaces produced by fusion or crystallization, as well as upon those polished
by art. The soap being gradually dissolved by the vapour, requires to be
frequently renewed. I find that other substances, particularly some of the
oils, produce the same effect as soap. The rings disappear quickly by eva
poration, and their brilliancy and purity of colour depend on the relative
temperature of the vapour and the glass.

 182 Sir D. Brewster on the Phaenomena of Thin Plates
 a surface of glass, M. Arago observed that they were black
 centred, as usual; and whether viewed with the eye or with
 a doubly refracting rhomb of Iceland spar, that the single or
 the double system of rings had the same colours and the same
 diameters, the rings being completely polarized at the polari
 zing angle of the glass.
    When the lens, however, was pressed against a metallic
 mirror, and examined with a doubly refracting rhomboid, two
 images perfectly similar appeared between a perpendicular
 incidence, and that of 55° or the polarizing angle of glass.
 One of the images disappeared entirely at this angle of 55°,
 when the principal section of the rhomboid was perpendicular
 or parallel to the plane of reflexion; but reappeared at greater
 incidences, with this remarkable peculiarity, that the colour
 of each of the rings which composed it was complementary to
 that of the corresponding rings in the image which had dis
 appeared.
    M. Arago likewise remarks that we may easily perceive with
 the eye, naked and without the assistance of any crystal, that
 at a certain angle near 55° the rings are-composed of two di
 stinct sets having unequal diameters, the rhomboid separating
 in a great measure the two sets of rings, because they are very
 unequally polarized. He likewise found that these phaeno
 mena were not produced when the rings were formed upon
native sulphur and diamond.                                         -
    “If the presence of a metallic mirror,” says M. Arago, “is
necessary for the production of the phaenomenon in question
when the rings are formed upon a plate of air, the case is
otherwise when the thin body has much more density, and is
in contact by one of its faces with another medium of sufficient
refractive power. Thus coal presents often in its cleavages
very bright colours, produced by an extremely thin substance,
and which are decomposed into two complementary images
when they are examined with a rhomboid under sufficiently
oblique incidences. The colours which are formed artificially
by the progress of evaporation, on thin films of alcohol or oil
of Sassafras, deposited upon coal or any other analogous sub
stance, give rise also to two images, dissimilar, and of opposite
tints#.”
    In order to investigate the phaenomena of the rings of va
pour in the iriscope, I illuminated them with light polarized
in an azimuth of 90°, or perpendicularly to the plane of inci
dence, and examined them by a magnifying glass, when the
centre of the rings was seen by light reflected at about 53°11',

 the polarizing angle of water. The effect, which was very
 striking, is shown in Plate II. fig. 1. The central part, AB,
 of the system of rings, CDEF, was without rings and colours
 of any kind: the upper half, CD, was part of a system of rings
 with white circumferences, and was formed by polarized light
 incident on the film at an angle greater than the polarizing
 angle of water; while the under half, EF, was part of a system
 of rings with black circumferences like those seen by common
 light, and was formed by polarized light incident on the film
 at an angle less than the polarizing angle of water.
    The absence of rings in the middle portion, AB, was of
 course owing to there being no light reflected from the first
 surface of the film with which that reflected from the second
 surface could interfere; and the reason of there being light
reflected from the second surface was, that the light reflected
from it was not incident at its polarizing angle.
    I have elsewhere shown”, that when a film of water is laid upon
glass whose refractive index is above 1508, there is no angle
of incidence upon the first surface of the film which will allow
the refracted ray to fall upon the glass at the polarizing angle;
and hence at every angle of incidence on the film, the refracted
light is reflected from the glass at angles less than the polarizing
angle of the united media, or less than an angle whose tangent
-            7),         -               e   -
is equal to ; " being the refractive index of the glass, and
m" that of the water. When the refractive index of the glass
is 1-508, the angle of incidence on the film must be 90° exactly,
in order that the refracted ray may fall upon the glass at the
   larizi              h               -       l to *
polarizing angle whose tangent is equal to .
   Now as the portion of the coloured rings at CD, fig. 1, is
formed by the interference of two pencils, CA, DEB, fig. 2,
one of which, CA, is reflected at an angle, PCA, above the
polarizing angle of water, and the other, EB, at an angle be
low or less than that angle; while the portion EF, fig. 1, is
formed by the interference of two pencils, which are both re
flected at angles below or less than that angle, we may suppose
that in the formation of the rings with a white circumference,
analogous to those with a white centre, there is a loss of half
an undulation, while that loss takes place in the interference
of common light, or of two pencils reflected on the same side
of the polarizing angle.                                      -
   When the rings are seen at angles between 0° of incidence
and 53° 11, the polarizing angle of water, they are black in

when they are seen at incidences between 53°11' and 90°,
they are white in the circumference, like the portion shown at
CD, fig. 1.
   If the rings of vapour are formed upon a polished surface
of fluor spar, additional phaenomena will be exhibited. At all
incidences, from 0° to about 78°, rings of the same character
will be seen as already described; but the ratio of the refrac
tive powers of water and fluor spar is such, that at an inci
dence of 78° 4' upon the surface of the vapour, the light inci
dent on the spar will be reflected at the polarizing angle of
the united media.    Thus if m = 1.437, the refractive index of
fluor spar, and m'<= 1°336, the refractive index of water, then
; = 1.0716, the refractive    index of the united media, or of
their separating surface. The polarizing angle for this sur
face will therefore be an angle whose tangent is 1.0756 or
47° 5', and the angle of incidence on the first surface of the
watery film corresponding to the angle of refraction 47° 5',
which is the angle of incidence on the second surface, is 78°4.
   At an incidence of 78° 4', therefore, the rings will disappear
altogether, as at 53°11', because the pencil incident on the
spar will not be reflected. At incidences greater than 78°4' the
system of rings with the black circumference will again appear
as at incidences below 53°11', and will be visible up to 90°
of incidence, the interfering pencils being now both reflected
at angles above the polarizing angle of the surfaces which
reflect them.
    This experiment with vapour and fluor spar I have not
 made; and it may be difficult to see the rings at such an
 oblique incidence. If the rings are formed by soap upon
plate glass, or by alcohol upon fluor spar, the second disap
 pearance of the rings may be seen:

greater than that of the body upon which it rests.

 The limits, therefore, between which the second disappearance
 of the rings can take place are 1:554, the index for quartz and
jlint glass, and 1.307, the index for ice. But though the
 range is very limited, it nevertheless includes a considerable
 variety of solid and fluid bodies. I have omitted the indices
 of Tabasheer, and the fluids produced by the compression of
 gaseous bodies, because, though their refractive powers are
 beneath 1307, they cannot be used in the present inquiry.

 186    Sir D. Brewster on the Phaenomena of Thin Plates
    When m and m' are thus related, the white-centred rings
 will just disappear when i = 90°, the light being then incident
on the second surface at its polarizing angle. But if we use
a film of still less refractive power in relation to the second
 body, the refracted rays will fall on the second surface at an
angle greater than the polarizing angle (i being still 90°), and
 consequently the black-centred rings will reappear, and there
 will be some angle of incidence I on the film, less than 90°,
at which the angle of refraction i<U+017F> will be equal to the polari
 zing angle of the second surface. This angle will be found
from the expression
            -            sin I = –".m'
                                   w/m3+m<U+017F>?’
 When m =m' no rings whatever will be formed, as no light is
reflected at the common surface; but if m=m' only for a par
ticular colour in the spectrum of each substance, and if these
 indices differ considerably for another colour, rings will be
formed in which that colour predominates, in which m > m',
 or m > m'. This takes place in a remarkable manner with
oil of cassia and flint glass, in which m =m' for the red rays,
but m > m for the blue rays. The consequence of this is, that
a quantity of blue light is reflected from the separating surface
of the oil and the glass; and hence if a sufficiently thin film
of oil of cassia is laid upon the glass, blue would greatly pre
dominate in the system of rings.
    Hitherto the azimuth of the polarized light has been 90°,
or perpendicular to the plane of reflexion. Let us now sup
pose that its azimuth is gradually changed from 90° to 0° by
the rotation of the polarizing surface or crystal.
    At all azimuths, from 90° to 0°, the rings with the black
circumference are seen, between the angles of 0° and 53°11',
and at the incidence of 53°11'.       But at incidences between
53°11' and 90°, in the case of the iriscope, very interesting
phaenomena appear. We shall first describe what takes place
at 56° 45', the polarizing angle of the black glass. At this
angle none of the polarized light is reflected when the azimuth
is 90°, and the rings with the white circumference are beauti
fully seen on the dark ground of the glass, which now reflects
no light. As the azimuth is changed to 87°, 88°, &c., the
black glass reflects a little light, and the two surfaces of the
film a little more light, the rings gradually become fainter
and fainter, till at an azimuth of about 79° 0' they disappear
exactly as they did at 53°11', and in the azimuth 90°. . When
this disappearance takes place, the light reflected from the glass
seems to be exactly equal to the light reflected from both sur

                   when exposed to Polarized Light.                    187
 faces of the film. At other angles of incidence the rings dis
 appeared at different azimuths, varying from 90° to about 45°,
 as the angle of incidence varied from 53°11' to 90°. I found
 it difficult, however, to measure these azimuths with any ac
 curacy, as the rings were not permanent; and I was there
 fore obliged to form the colours of thin plates upon highly
 refracting substances, such as diamond, chromate of lead, arti
Jicial realgar, and greenockite (the most refractive of all bodies),
 which had high polarizing angles. A solution of fine soap
 gave brilliant colours when dried, and in this way I obtained
 the following results with the surface of a very fine diamond.
 The index of refraction of the soap was 1.475, and that of the
 diamond 2:44, and their respective polarizing angles 55° 52',
 and 67° 43'.

  As the disappearance of the rings was not owing to the extinc
  tion of one of the interfering pencils, as at 55° 52', for a suffi
  cient quantity of polarized light was reflected from both sur
  faces of the film, there was reason to believe that it might

reflexion, then p" must be negative, or on the left-hand side
of that plane"; hence + p., -p" will be the mutual inclina
tions of the planes of polarization of the interfering pencils,

    That when two polarized pencils reflected from the surfaces
of a thin plate lying on a reflecting surface of a different refrac
tive power interfere, half an undulation is not lost, and white
centred rings are produced, provided the mutual inclination of
 their planes of polarization is greater than 90°; and that when
this inclination is less than 90°, half an undulation is lost, and
BLACK-centred rings are produced; when the inclination is
exactly 90°, the pencils do not interfere, and no rings are pro
 duced.
    At an incidence of 45° upon water and glass, where the
 signs of p and p" are the same, the maximum difference in the
 planes of polarization is 23°12', which takes place in azimuth
 70° 30'; and at an incidence of 10° the greatest difference is
 2° 16', which takes place at an azimuth of about 45°.
    In the case of soap and plate glass, where the black-centred
rings appear beyond the incidence of 71°45', the difference
of inclination in the planes of the two pencils is also less
than 90°.

190 Sir D. Brewster on the Phaenomena of Thin Plates
<U+017F>ect system of rings when the film had a greater refractive
power than the substance upon which it was laid; after many
ineffectual attempts to obtain such a system, I succeeded by
laying a very small portion of oil of laurel upon water placed
in a black vessel, or on the surface of diluted or real ink. The
rings thus produced are splendid beyond description, and ex
hibit the various phaenomena with singular beauty. As the
polarizing angle of the oil exceeds that of the water, the black
centred rings are seen at the polarizing angle of the water,
when the reflected light disappears. They continue to be
seen till we reach the polarizing angle of the oil, when the
rings disappear, and the white-centred ones commence, and
continue till we reach the incidence of 90°%.
   In forming thin films upon metallic surfaces, I employed
many of the metals, and found the phaenomena nearly the
same upon them all, and differing very little from those pro
duced upon transparent bodies. On a fine specimen of spe
cular iron ore, I found a system of rings ready-formed, with
three orders of colours. The azimuth of the polarized light
being inclined 90° to the plane of reflexion, the system of
rings disappeared wholly at an angle of incidence of 58° 36',
which is therefore the polarizing angle of the unknown sub
stance of which it was formed: consequently its index of re
fraction is about 1.638. Between this angle and 90° of inci
dence, the white. centred rings appeared; but at 72° 39', the
polarizing angle of the iron (which gives its refractive power
for the red rays 3:200), the rings were singularly fine, being
seen on a beautiful blue ground, produced by the disappear
ance of the red light, which is polarized at that angle. I now
measured the azimuth of the plane of polarization when the
rings disappeared, which was 59° 25', whereas by the formula
it is 57° 59'; a discrepancy not to be wondered at, when we
consider that the index of refraction for the red rays, viz.
3:200, was used, in place of that for the mean ray, which is
not known. The inclination of the planes of polarization of
the two interfering pencils, when calculated by the previous
formulae, is + 32° 7', and — 57°53'; so that these planes being
   * These thin plates of oil of laurel exhibit some curious phaenomena,
which I believe have not been noticed. If we wet with water, alcohol, or the
oil of laurel itself, the extremity of a short piece of wire, such as a large pin,
and hold the pin in the hand, so that its head may be above, and almost
touching the film, the film will recede in little waves of a circular shape, which
form a new system of coloured rings; and they become covered with the
vapour from the fluid on the head of the pin in such small particles that
they reflect no light, and the rings appear to be blacketed. By withdrawing
the pin, the film is restored to its former state. The same effect is produced
by heating the pin, or the fluid upon it, to promote evaporation.

inclined 90° to each other, as in the case of soap and diamond,
no interference takes place, and the rings disappear.
    In the fine specimens of oligist iron ore from Elba, I have
found crystals covered with the most beautiful coloured films,
both of uniform and variable thickness.             These films are not
acted upon by the ordinary acids, like the coloured films upon
steel, and appear, from their optical properties, to be of a
metallic nature. When they are exposed to a polarized ray,
 they exhibit generally the same phaenomena as the films
already described; but there is no angle of incidence at which
 the colours disappear, either in the azimuth of 90°, at the po
 larizing angle of the first surface of the film, or in those azi
 muths where the pencils, from the first and second surface,
 have their planes of polarization inclined 90° to each other.
 This, no doubt, arises from the high dispersive power of the
 film, in consequence of which the different homogeneous rays
 are polarized at angles considerably different from each other.
     The phaenomena of transparent films of low refractive power,
 when laid upon the polished surfaces of metals, and exposed
 to polarized light, are not very different from those which are
 exhibited when the film rests upon a transparent surface. I
 at first used a solution of soap, which produced pretty good
 tints on speculum metal; but at last I fell upon a method of
 laying down the most beautiful systems of coloured rings upon
  all surfaces of all forms, whether metallic, transparent or
  opake. For this purpose I used the oil of laurel, which, when
  placed upon the surface of water, expands into a film, which
  gives the finest system of coloured rings. Having laid the
  plate of polished metal in a small porous wooden tray, such
  as is used for holding minerals, I poured water into it, so as
  to cover the metallic surface to the depth of the fiftieth part
  of an inch. I then formed a film of the oil upon the water,
  immediately above the metallic surface. In a short time the
  absorption of the water by the porous tray allowed the film
  of oil to descend and rest upon the metallic surface*. When
  the adhering moisture was removed by evaporation, the film
  was extremely beautiful; and if protected from dust may be
  preserved for any length of time.
     Having laid a film of this kind upon speculum metal, I ob
  tained the following results. The coloured rings disappeared
  almost completely at 56°, the polarizing angle of the oil. The
  black-centred rings appeared at all angles less than 56°, and
  the white-centred rings at all angles above it. Both the sy
  stems of rings were exceedingly distinct at the greatest angles
    * The same effect is produced more slowly by evaporation; or the water
  may be sucked out of the tray by a tube, or run off by an aperture,

 of incidence, whereas on transparent surfaces of low refractive
 power, they can scarcely be seen at such angles. When the
 azimuth of the polarized ray varies from 90° to 0°, the rings
 disappear at different angles of incidence; or when the angles
of incidence vary, the rings disappear in different azimuths.
 I measured these azimuths when the polarized ray was inci
dent upon speculum metal, and obtained the following num

    In computing column third from the formula in p. 188, I
used 1.49 as the index of refraction of oil of laurel, and 4.01.1
as the index of refraction for speculum metal, as deduced from
my experiments on its elliptic polarization*.
    I have made similar experiments when the rings were
transferred to silver, whose elliptical polarization approaches
nearest to circular polarization; and to grain tin, which ap
pears to have the highest refractive power of any of the metals;
but I found it very difficult to ascertain with any accuracy the
azimuths in which the rings disappear.
    If we use common in place of polarized light in the prece
ding experiments, and analyse the reflected light by a rhomb
of calcareous spar, the very same phaenomena will be exhibited.
    When the films or thin plates are not laid upon the surfaces
of fluid or solid bodies, the phaenomena are of an entirely
different kind. At all angles of incidence, and in all azimuths,
the colours and character of the rings are the same, whether
we use common or polarized light. In obtaining this result
I stretched thin films of various oils, such as oil of laurel, oil
of cassia, oil of turpentine, and many others, across circular
apertures, and examined them in light polarized in different
azimuths. The rings of course vanished at the polarizing
angle of the oil, and the brilliancy of the colours varied with
the angles of azimuth and incidence, but the complementary
rings never appeared, the rings being always those with the
black centref.

   t The physical phaenomena exhibited in these attenuated films are very
remarkable. A current of fluid is projected from the margin and centre of
the ring of fluid across the fluid surface, resembling the top ofa pine apple.

The results in this Table, which may be considered as those of
hence arises an irregular system of coloured bands, with an incessant play
of varying tints, as if the fluid were animated. The bands of colour are
serrated with salient points, from which the fluid seems to shoot across the
film. In the oils of cinnamon, naphtha, spearmint, wormwood, rapeseed,
nutmegs, bergamot, savine, rosemary, &c., the phaenomena are peculiarly
beautiful. With poppy oil, the red and green tints of the 4th, 5th, and 6th
orders were also seen.

194 Sir D. Brewster on the Phaenomena of Thin Plates
observation*, exhibit at one glance the general phaenomena
at all angles of incidence and azimuth.
    The two interfering pencils are in every case reflected at
angles either both above or both below the polarizing angle,
and hence their planes of polarization are always on the same
side of the plane of reflexion and in the same quadrant, and
consequently they never can be at right angles to each other
so as to prevent interference. For the same reason the incli
nation of the planes never can exceed 90°, so as to produce
the complementary white-centred rings, in conformity with
the law previously given.
    If, for example, we compute the value of a in the preceding
formula at an incidence of 70°, we shall find it 66° 25', at
which azimuth the inclinations p and p" of the planes of polar
ization are 40° 47', and 49°53'; but though the sum of these
anglesis 90°, yet the real inclination of the planes is p"—p
 =9°6'.
    This property of parallel transparent films, of giving by
reflexion pencils polarized in planes at various inclinations,
 when the incident light is polarized in different azimuths,
enables us to obtain two pencils of polarized light, inclined at
any angle, varying from 0° to 21° 44' in glass, and to study
the phaenomena which such pencils exhibit, either in their
mutual action, or in their relations to other properties of light.
    But the phaenomena become more varied and interesting
when the second surface of the plate is inclined to the first.
In this way we may produce effects analogous to those pro
duced by a change in the refractive power of the second sur
face by contact with another refracting surface, and obtain
pencils inclined 90° to each other, and therefore exhibiting
the white-centred rings. The phaenomena will in this case
resemble those of a film of oil upon water.
    When the refractive index of a parallel film exceeds 1-508,
the ray is incident on the second surface at an angle less than
 the polarizing angle; but by inclining the second surface we
can make it fall upon it at a greater angle than the polarizing
angle. The phaenomena may be still more varied by inclining
 the surface of emergence to the surface of incidencet; but as
 it is not easy to obtain films with faces suitably inclined to
 each other, it is unnecessary to pursue this branch of the sub
ject any further.
    Such are the phaenomena of thin and thick plates when
 viewed by polarized light, or by common light subsequently
 analysed by a doubly refracting rhomb. But if we use polar
            * See Philosophical Transactions, 1830, pp. 74,138.
            # Ibid. p. 147, fig. 3.

                  when exposed to Polarized Light.              195
ized light, and subsequently analyse the light transmitted
through the thin plates, we shall obtain a series of very inter
esting and instructive phaenomena, analogous to those pro
duced by plates of doubly refracting crystals which exhibit the
polarized tints. . In both these cases, the film is interposed
between a polarizing plate and an analysing rhomb. If the
film is too thick to produce colours, it will depolarize the po
larized ray, in a manner analogous to that of a crystallized
plate, which is not thin     j        to give the polarized tints;
and if the film is sufficiently thin to produce uniform tints, a
coloured band or system of rings, with black or white centres.
Their action is    intº       to that of thin crystallized plates,
which either produce uniform tints like the laminae of sulphate
of lime, or uniaxal or biaxal systems of rings.
    It would be unprofitable to describe minutely the great
 variety of phaenomena which thin plates thus exhibit, as they
 vary with the refractive power of the fluid or solid upon which
 they are laid, so that I shall confine myself to the case in which
 a thin plate of oil of laurel rests on the surface of a specimen
 of artificial realgar. In common light, the colours of this film
 are very beautiful, but when examined in polarized light by
 an analysing rhomb, they are brilliant beyond description.
     1. When the azimuth of the polarized light is 90°, and the
 incidence of the polarized ray 56° 5', the polarizing angle of
 oil of laurel.
     When the film is viewed without the polarizing rhomb, no
 rings are seen, as there is no light reflected from the first
 surface of the film, and consequently no interference.
     When the film is viewed with the polarizing rhomb, having
 its principal section in the plane of incidence, no  º     appear,
 either in its ordinary or extraordinary image. But if the
 plane of polarization is less or more than 90°, by even a small
 quantity, then after the rhomb has been turned round nearly
  90° towards the right, a system of black-centred rings is seen
  for an instant, and these, after disappearing, are followed by
  a system of white-centred ones, the white-centred rings appear
  ing first if the rhomb is turned to the left. The same phae
  nomena are repeated in every quadrant of the circular motion
  of the rhomb.
     2. When the aximuth of the polarized light varies from 90°
  to 0°, the incidence, being 56° 5', as before.
      At 90° azimuth the phaenomena are as above described.
     At 674°. Rhomb 0°, no rings.
      Rhomb turning to the right, the white-centred rings appear,
  then vanish, when the azimuth of the rhomb is less than 67; ;
  then black-centred rings appear, which vanish at 180°; then

  then the black-centred, which continue to 360°.
      At 45°, 22}”. The very same phaenomena appear at these
  and other azimuths, the azimuths of the rhomb at which the
  rings disappear out of the plane of incidence being a little less
  than the azimuths of the polarized light.
      At 0°. The evanescence of the rings takes place when the
  azimuths of the rhomb are 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, the white
  centred rings appearing in the first and third, and the black
  centred ones in the second and fourth quadrant.
      3. Azimuth of polarized light 90°.
      Incidence of polarized light 68° 3', the polarizing angle of
  realgar.
     At this angle all the light reflected from the realgar has
  disappeared, excepting a dark bluish purple, in the middle of
  which is seen, without using the rhomb, a splendid system of
  richly-coloured rings, with a white centre. When the rhomb
 is applied as before, and performs a complete revolution, the
  white-centred rings are seen all round, disappearing at 90°
 and 270°.
     4. When the azimuth of the polarized light varies from 90°
 to 0°, the incidence being 68° 3', as before.
     At 90° azimuth, the phaenomena are as above described.
     At 80°, and all other azimuths, the white-centred rings are
 seen when the rhomb is at 0°; but they disappear at azimuths
 of the rhomb a little less than the azimuths of polarization,
 and are then succeeded by the black-centred rings.
     At 0° azimuth, the rings disappear when the rhomb is at
 0° and 180°, and are black-centred all round.
     Without using the rhomb, the rings always disappear at
 the azimuth w, at which the planes of polarization of the inter
 fering pencils are rectangular.
    At incidences above 68° 3', the phaenomena are of the same
 character. The rings are white-centred in 90° of azimuth, and
 when the rhomb is at 0°. They become very brilliant about
45°. Near 90° of rotation the rings vanish, and immediately
the black-centred system appears, which quickly vanishes,
and is succeeded by the white-centred system.
    5. Angles of incidence less than 56° 5'.
    In 90° of azimuth of the polarized ray, and the rhomb being
at 0°, the black-centred rings are seen, and continue to be
seen during a complete revolution of the rhomb. In all azi
muths, from 90° to 0°, the rings disappear by turning the
rhomb to the left, the arch diminishing from 90° to 0°; but in
azimuths of an intermediate magnitude, the disappearance of
the rings is followed by the appearance of the white-centred

                   when exposed to Polarized Light.            197
 system, which quickly disappears, and is succeeded by the
 black-centred system. This phaenomenon is seen best near 45°
 of azimuth.
    When the plates or films are too thick to give the coloured
 rings, the phaenomena of the differently polarized pencils may
 be finely seen by using coloured glasses, in which the pencils
 reflected from both surfaces may be observed. If the glass is
green, for example, the pencil or image of a small aperture or
luminous body will be green, while that reflected from the first
surface, though in reality colourless, will appear red, from the
physiological action of the green light upon the retina. Hence
the two differently polarized pencils will have different colours,
as if they were the tints of polarized light. If these coloured
glasses are laid upon, or cemented on one side to, metals or
highly refracting substances, the polarization of the coloured
pencils which they reflect will be modified according to the
principles already explained, and they will exhibit many inter
esting phaenomena, varying with the colours of the glasses, as
if the colours were produced by the absorption of polarized
light.
  sº order to convey a general idea of the different classes
of phaenomena described in the preceding paper, I have re
presented two of the most important in figs. 4 and 5.
    1. Glass and Water.—When a film of aqueous vapour is
laid upon glass whose index of refraction is 1-508, the rings
disappear at 53° 11", the polarizing angle of the water, and
also in the various azimuths where the two interfering pencils
are polarized in planes at right angles to each other. At all
azimuths greater than these, and at angles of incidence above
the polarizing angle, the white-centred rings appear; and at
all azimuths less than these, and at all incidences (except those
at which the white-centred rings are seen), the black-centred
rings appear.
   The following Table shows the values of w, or the azimuths
of disappearance of the rings, as computed from the formula
in p. 49:—

plane of incidence, having the different incidences marked
upon it from 90° to 53° 11', and if round a centre in AB pro
longed, where 0° of incidence falls, we describe the azimuthal
circle ZAZ, then the complements of the azimuths of the
polarized light being set off from the corresponding angles of
incidence on each side of AB, the curves ACB, ACB passing
through these points will show at what angles of incidénce
and azimuth the rings disappear, in consequence of the planes
of polarization of the two pencils being at these places rect
 angular
   At all incidences, and in all azimuths within the shaded
space ACBC, the white-centred rings are seen, and at all other
azimuths and incidences the black-centred rings are seen.
   2. Fluor Spar and Water.—I have taken this combination
as a specimen of the phaenomena which take place at some
incidences less than 90°, when the refracted ray falls on the
second surface of the film, at angles greater than its polarizing
angle. The following Table shows the values of w and their
complements:–

XXX.      Photographic phaenomena referring to the various Actions
    of the red and yellow Rays on Daguerreotype Plates when
    they have been affected by daylight. By A. CLAUDET, Esq.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
      AVING made on the 24th of October 1847, a commu
        nication to the Académie des Sciences of Paris similar
to that I sent on the 10th of June to the Royal Society, On
different Properties of Solar Radiation acting on Silver Plates
coated with Iodine, or its compounds with Bromine or Chlo
rine, a discussion ensued, in which Messrs. Ed. Becquerel and
 Gaudin (see Comptes Rendus, Oct. 31 and Nov. 2) controverted
the accuracy of some part of my experiments. I had stated
that the red and yellow glasses had the property, as well as
the pure red and yellow rays of the spectrum, of destroying
 the photogenic action produced by daylight on silver plates
 coated with iodine, or its compounds with bromine and chlo
 rine; Messrs. Ed. Becquerel and Gaudin asserted that the
 red and yellow glasses had not the property of destroying,
 but of continuing the action commenced by daylight on the
 simply iodized plate.
    As soon as I was apprised of the remarks made by Messrs.
 Becquerel and Gaudin, I repeated the experiments, and to
 my great surprise I found that the destructive action of the
 red and yellow glasses did not appear, on this trial, to extend
 to the simply iodized, but only to the bromo-iodized plate. I
 lost no time in communicating to the Académie des Sciences
 the result of these experiments; and at the meeting of the
 22nd of November my letter stating the apparent contradiction
 was read.
     This led me to continue the experiment, in order to exa
  mine the question more attentively, and fortunately enabled
  me to discover some new properties so interesting that I made
    * No reference is made in these figures to the phaenomena which are
 seen by using both polarized light and the analysing rhomb.

 200       Mr. A. Claudet on the Actions of the red and
 a new memoir on the subject, at the same time trying to ex
 plain the anomaly existing between Messrs. Ed. Becquerel
 and Gaudin's experiments and my own.
    As persons interested in these questions might only read
 my paper to the Royal Society, which you have inserted in
 full in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, I con
 sider it my duty to publish immediately what has passed be
 fore the Académie des Sciences in reference to my communi
 cation; and I shall be much obliged if you will allow me a
 place in your pages for the insertion of the following transla
 tion of my new memoir to the Académie des Sciences, which
 has been read at the meeting of the 20th of December. (See
 Comptes Rendus.)
                 I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
                              Your most obedient Servant,
                                                   A. CLAUDET.
    I have again examined my former experiments, and I find
 some specimens which show that red and yellow glasses have
 destroyed the effect of the photogenic light on plates simply
 iodized.   How can this fact be reconciled with Messrs. Ed.
 Becquerel and Gaudin's experiments, and those I had just
made in consequence of these philosophers’ observations? Had
 I made any mistake in the classification of my former speci
mens, or had I erred in my mode of operating? This might
be, and I feared such was the case, as I just obtained quite
different results. I then questioned my assistant, and he re
collected well that we had repeatedly experimented upon plates
simply iodized, and that we had then found that red and yel
low glasses did destroy the action of daylight, as well on
iodized plates as on those which had been submitted to the
compound vapour of iodine and bromine.
    I then recollected a curious fact mentioned by Dr. Draper
of New York (see Phil. Mag., Feb. 1847, pages 89 and 90),
which at the time of its publication I had found so inexplicable
that I did not pay much attention to it, and which I had
totally forgotten during the course of my experiments.
   Dr. Draper said, “Such are the facts I observed, and they
seem to have been reproduced by MM. Foucault and Fizeau;
but there are also others of a much more singular nature. In
these Virginia specimens the same portecting action reappears
beyond the violet.
   “The only impressions in which I have ever seen this pro
tecting action beyond the violet, are those made in Virginia in
1842; they were made in the month of July. Struck with

              yellow Rays on Daguerreotype Plates.             2O1
 this peculiarity, on my return to New York, the following
 August I made many attempts to obtain similar specimens,
 but in no instance could the extra-violet protecting action be
 traced, though the analogous action of the red, orange, yellow,
 green and blue, was perfectly given. Supposing, therefore,
 that the difference must be due either to impurities in the
 iodine or to differences in the method of conducting the ex
 periment, I tried it again and again in every possible way.
 To my surprise I soon found that the negative effect was gra
 dually disappearing; and on Sept. 29 it could no longer be
 traced, except at the highest part corresponding to the yellow
and green rays. In December it had become still more im.
 perfect, but on the 19th of the following March the red and
 orange rays had recovered their original protective power. It
 seemed, therefore, that in the early part of the year a protec
 tive action had made its appearance in the red ray, and about
 July extended over all the less refrangible regions, and as the
 year went on it had retreated upwards.
    “Are there then periodic changes in the nature of the sun's
 light?” &c.                                                       -
    From these experiments of Dr. Draper it would appear
that, according to the months of the year in which we operate,
the red and yellow rays either do or do not exercise a destruc
tive action. It must be remarked that Dr. Draper mentions
only iodized plates, that he always speaks of iodine alone, and
that he never alludes to bromine or chlorine, which were
hardly in use at the time of his experiments.
   Dr. Draper adds (page 91), “I further found that when
different rays are brought to act upon each other, the result
does not alone depend upon their intrinsic differences, but
also on their relative intensities. Thus the green and lower
half of the blue rays, when of a certain intensity, protect the
plate from the action of the daylight; but if of a less intensity,
they aid the daylight.
   “The red and orange rays, when of a certain intensity, in
crease the action of daylight on the plate; but if of a less in
tensity, they restrain it.”                                        -
   It would result from this last observation of Dr. Draper,
that when the red and orange rays are not endowed with the
destructive action, they, on the contrary, have the property
of continuing or assisting the action of daylight.
   Is it not then possible, that, like Dr. Draper, I may have
made my first experiments on the iodized plate during the
period when the red and yellow rays were endowed with their
destructive action, and that Messrs. Becquerel and Gaudin
may have made theirs when these rays had lost their destruc

202         Mr. A. Claudet on the Actions of the red and
tive and had acquired their continuing action, at a period cor
responding to the present?
   Having made my experiments with the greatest care, I
seize with satisfaction this manner of explaining phaenomena
apparently contradictory. It would indeed be curious and
interesting to find that neither myself nor the other experi
menters are in error, and that we differ only as regards con
ditions and circumstances, which, without our knowledge, have
exercised an influence upon our experiments. But there can
be no doubt as regards the iodized plate, when it has been
subsequently submitted to the vapour of bromine alone, or of
bromine and chlorine united. I have operated with these
substances during the various periods of the year, and I have
invariably found that the red, orange, and yellow glasses de
stroy the action of daylight*.
    This arises perhaps from the high degree of sensitiveness
 of all the coatings containing bromine. During the periods
 of the year when, by the intensity and purity of daylight, the
 simple iodide of silver has acquired the maximum of sensitive
 ness, it may be affected like the bromo-iodide, which, being
 about 100 times more sensitive, is always capable of receiving
 the destructive action of the less refrangible rays. Then it
 would appear that the destructive action of these rays require
 a highly sensitive coating to become manifest.
    This manner of viewing the question is corroborated by a
 curious phaenomenon, in other respects very interesting, and
 which I think has hitherto escaped the researches of photo
 graphers. I intended to treat this subject at some length in
 a separate paper, but I cannot do better than make use of this
 fact on the present occasion, and I shall therefore not defer its
 publication.
    There exists a coating of iodide of silver which is twenty
 five times more sensitive than the coating of Daguerre. Da
 guerre did not imagine that his process was susceptible of such
 a degree of sensitiveness. What an unexpected result at the
 time of his discovery ! It is to be regretted that it escaped
 the inventor of the Daguerreotype, and that it did not precede
   * I must here state, that considering the Daguerreotype plate as now
 exclusively prepared with bromine in addition to iodine, I have paid much
 more attention to this combination than to the original and now obsolete
 preparation of Daguerre containing only iodine; and I have had the op
 portunity of experimenting on plates prepared with iodine and bromine,
 and with iodine, bromine, and chlorine during a whole year, in all seasons;
 so that if there might exist any uncertainty as to the destructive effect of
 red and yellow glasses on silver plates simplyiodized, there can be no doubt
 as to the permanency of the destructive effect on the bromo-iodized plate
 with or without chlorine, in every season and in all circumstances.

the discovery of the accelerating action of bromine and chlo
rine, which we have found to be 100 times more sensitive+.
    When the plate is prepared with this coating of iodine, the
red and yellow glasses destroy the effect of daylight produced
on that coating, in the same manner as when the iodized plate
has been subsequently submitted to the vapour of bromine.
    There are, then, certainly some cases when the red and
yellow glasses are not endowed with the property of continuing
 the action commenced by daylight on the simply iodized plate,
but when they are endowed with the property of destroying
that action. This highly sensitive coating of iodine is ob
tained in the following manner:—
    When a plate of silver is submitted to the vapour of iodine,
 it assumes at first a yellow tint, and afterwards becomes suc
 cessively rose, red, violet, blue and blue-green; all these
 various tints constitute what I shall call the simple coating ;
 they are all sensitive nearly in the same degree.
     In continuing to iodize, a second coating is formed in a
 series of the same tints as the first. The plate becomes yellow
 a second time, and it passes successively through the rose, red,
 violet, blue, and blue-green tints: this second coating is
 twenty-five times more sensitive than the first. But the most
 sensitive point is about the rose tint.
    A third coating with the same tints can be obtained by a
longer exposure to the vapour of iodine; but it is less sensi
tive than the second; the surface of the silver begins to be
attacked by the strong action of the iodine ; and after the
 washing with hyposulphite it appears milky, which injures the
 purity of the image.
    If a silver plate be submitted to the vapour of iodine in such
 a manner as to give it gradually, by horizontal zones, all the
 tints of the first and second coatings, and in that state en
 tirely affected by daylight, then exposed only on one vertical
 half during a few minutes under a red glass, so that the action
 of the red glass be exercised only on one half of each zone of
 the various tints of the two coatings, the mercurial vapour
 affects the surface in such a manner, as to show that the red
 glass has destroyed the action of daylight on the second coating
 of iodine, and has continued the same action on the first.
 The red glass has brought back the half of the more sensitive
 coating to the same degree of effect produced on the less sen
 sitive, which has not received the action of the red glass. It
    * I made the discovery of the accelerating property of chlorine, bromine
 and iodine combined in certain proportions in May 1841, and I communi
 cated a paper on the subject to the Royal Society, which was read the
 10th of June following.

 204       Mr. A. Claudet on the Actions of the red and
 has therefore destroyed the action of daylight on the more
 sensitive coating, and has continued the effect commenced on
 the less sensitive, to the same degree of intensity as the part
 of the more sensitive coating which has not received the action
 of red glass; so that each half of the plate has an effect per
 fectly equal and identical, in every point, to that of the other
 half, but in an inverted manner.     A remarkable result is, that
 the horizontal zone, which is precisely in the middle of the
 plate, has the same intensity of photogenic effect in all its
 length. This proves that there has been neither destruction
 nor continuation on the space, where the coating by its thick
 ness had the mean state of sensitiveness.
    In putting aside the question of the influence of the various
 periods of the year on the destruction or continuation of the
 effect of daylight by the red and yellow rays, until we may
 have been able to verify the exactness of the facts mentioned
 by Dr. Draper, it is not possible to say in a general way that
 the red and yellow glasses are endowed with the property of
 continuing the effect of daylight on iodide of silver; for I
 have just proved that there are cases in which the contrary
 always takes place, according to the thickness of the coating of
 iodine.
    Since the vapours of the atmosphere as well as the coloured
 glasses render the action of light negative, in absorbing certain
 rays and allowing only certain others to pass, it would not be
 surprising that, from the simultaneous action of the vapours
 of the atmosphere and of the coloured glasses, some contra
 dictory effects might result; that when light has to pass through
 two different kinds of absorbing media, a certain effect could
 be produced; and that when the atmosphere is pure and free
 from all kinds of vapour, the absorption of coloured glass only
might produce an effect of quite an opposite nature.
    According to the position and density of the vapours of the
 atmosphere, all the points of the luminous space are not en
dowed with the same photogenic properties. So that in some
circumstances a plate, first exposed to the blue light of the
zenith, loses the property of receiving the mercurial vapour,
if it be exposed a second time to the horizontal light of the
south, when there exist some vapours, although not sufficiently
dense to render the sun decidedly yellow. I have obtained
specimens in which this curious result is manifest. One of
them exhibits a negative image. This effect was produced
by exposing a plate, first to the blue light of the zenith, and
afterwards, covered with an engraving or a piece of black lace,
to the light of the south.                 -                  -
   The possible simultaneous existence of two antagonistic

               yellow Rays on Daguerreotype Plates.                     205
lights reflected from the atmosphere explains those anomalies
which are so annoying to photographers; for example, those
circumstances under which it seems impossible to obtain any
image, whatever may be the length of exposure in the camera.
This difficulty is imputed to the preparation of the plates, the
 state of the accelerating solutions, &c.; and after all it only
 exists in the light. As much effect is often obtained in 30
 seconds as in 120 seconds, for it is possible to have obtained a
 first effect which has been afterwards destroyed; and that must
 inevitably be the case if, during the latter part of the exposure
 in the camera obscura, any clouds or vapours have suddenly
 rendered the light of the sun yellow; in this case the object
 which had first reflected white light, becoming capable of re
 flecting only yellow light, this last must destroy the effect pro
duced by the first.
    If the object reflects at the same time blue light from the
zenith and yellow light from the southern horizon, the two
 lights may be neutralized and destroy each other, so that no
 photogenic effect can be obtained. Sometimes, when the sky is
 cloudless, the space at the zenith is of a particularly deep blue
 colour; whereas the vapours produced by the heat of the sun
 make the sky appear slightly tinted with yellow, from the
horizon to a certain height. In those circumstances all pho
 tographers must have observed that the operation in the ca
 mera obscura is excessively slow.
    This may probably explain those dark specimens 4, which
 were so weak in effect, obtained some years ago on the Alps
 during clear and cloudless weather, by an operator sent to
 Italy by M. Lerebours to take Daguerreotype views. M.
 Lerebours' operator was an experienced photographer, and
he found, to his great surprise, that on the summit of the Alps
he could not obtain any effect in less than five or six times
what he considered to be the necessary exposure. He was
surrounded with snow, the sun was shining in all its brilliancy,
the sky was pure and cloudless, of a deep blue colour, whereas
the horizon was without doubt slightly tinted yellow, on ac
count of the vapours produced by the melting of the snow
and ice of the glaciers.                                          -
    Mr. Lerebours' operator was using at that time (in 1840)
plates only iodized; and this fact would confirm the neutrali
zation of the photogenic effect upon plates of iodide of silver,
by the less refrangible rays acting simultaneously with white
light, according to Dr. Draper's observations.
    It would be interesting if M. Lerebours could state the

    I shall not conclude this paper without expressing a wish
that M. Ed. Becquerel, M. Gaudin, Messrs. Foucault and
Fizeau, as well as Dr. Draper, will continue their researches,
and that we shall abstain from all discussion on this subject
until we have been able to verify the facts under all possible
circumstances. Time and only a few experiments will suffice
to settle the question. We are all animated with the wish of
arriving at the truth, and facts alone must now decide between
 us. Whatever may be the result, we all can individually
congratulate ourselves on having contributed by our separate
labours to the explanation of the phaenomena of photography,
and to the advancement of this new and interesting science.
XXXI. Observations on some remarkable Properties of Iodine,
    Phosphorus, Nitric Acid, &c. By M. Niépce DE SAINT
    VICTOR*.
                      On Iodine and its action.
 I    RELIEVE that I first discovered a property of iodine
        which we should least expect it to possess, viz. that of
being attracted by the black parts of an engraving, ma
nuscript, &c., leaving the white parts untouched. #. an
engraving is submitted to the vapour of iodine for about five
minutes at a temperature of from 60°to 70°F.; fifteen grammes
of iodine are required for each square decimeter (a longer
exposure is requisite at a lower temperature); this engraving               - }
is then laid upon paper “sized ” with starch, care being taken
to moisten it previously with water acidulated to I° with
 sulphuric acid. This is the only substance which as yet has
been found to give the impressions any degree of permanency:
 however, they ultimately disappear on exposure to the air and
 light; but by pasting them beneath a plate of glass, they may
 be preserved for a very long time. The proofs just after
 having been pressed with a ball of linen exhibit remarkably
distinct impressions, which on drying, however, become cloudy.
 But what is still more remarkable is, that several copies of the
   * Translated from the Anna'es de Chimie et de Physique for January 1848,
 having been communicated in two parts to the Académie des Sciences the
22nd of June 1846, and 11th of January 1847.

               remarkable Properties of Iodine, &c.          207
same engraving may be taken without subjecting it to the re
newed preparatory process, and the last impressions are always
the most distinct; for on leaving the   º           exposed for a
very considerable time to the vapour of the iodine, the white
parts ultimately become impregnated with it, if the paper has
been starched; but the dark parts always predominate, how
ever long the exposure may be continued.
    The engraving is in no way altered by the process, and it
may be copied an indefinite number of times.
    I have discovered a means of copying every kind of drawing
by the same process, whether made with printer's or common
 ink (provided gum does not enter into its composition), or with
 Indian ink or black-lead; in short, any kind of lined drawing
 may be copied, but they must be previously subjected to the
 following process: —they are first immersed for a few minutes
 in a weak solution of ammonia, then in water acidulated with
 sulphuric, nitric, or hydrochloric acid, and allowed to dry;
 they are then exposed to the vapour of iodine, and the process
 above described repeated. By this method, tracings of de
 signs may be produced which hitherto could not be done in
 any other way, even when they existed in the substance of the
 paper. Moreover, when there are two images, one on the
 face and the other on the back of the same sheet of paper,
 they can easily be copied separately.
    I have pointed out the necessity of the paper which is to
 receive the impression of an engraving being sized with starch,
 because the real colouring matter of the copy is the iodide of
 starch; it afterwards occurred to me to coat the surface of
 plates of porcelain, opaline glass, alabaster and ivory, with
 starch-paste, and then to act upon them in the same manner
 as I had acted upon the paper: the result, as I had anticipated,
 was incontestably superior, as compared with the impressions
 upon simple paper sized with starch. When the impression
 obtained by this process is perfectly dry, it is coated with
 picture-varnish; and when placed under glass, it acquires such
 stability, that I have preserved some of them for more than
 eight months without their undergoing any perceptible change.
     When I wish to copy an engraving, I prefer using opaline
 glass, behind which I paste a sheet of paper to render it less
 transparent: a reversed impression is obtained upon this plate;
 but in using a plate of common glass which is subsequently
 reversed, the proof appears non-inverted, and it is only requi
 site to place a sheet of paper behind it to make the impression
 more apparent. It may also be kept as a window-pane; but
 in this case the impression must be placed between two plates
 of glass, so as to preserve it from injury and secure its per

208           M. Niépce de Saint-Victor on some
manency. The latter application would be very advantageous
for the magic lantern.
   The impressions may be obtained of various colours, such
as blue, violet and red, according as the starch is more or less
boiled; in the former case it inclines to red.       A more or less
deep bistre colour is obtained by exposing the impression to
the vapour of ammonia; but it acquires its primitive colour
when varnished after this operation; consequently an impres
sion thus modified by ammonia cannot be varnished.
   I shall now speak of the impressions which may be obtained
upon different metals. Thus, by exposing an engraving to
the vapour of iodine (for a few minutes only, so as to avoid
impregnating the white parts), subsequently laying it (without
wetting) upon a plate of silver and then placing it in a press,
in five or six minutes we have a most faithful copy of the en
graving; on subsequently exposing this plate to the vapour
of mercury, we obtain an image resembling the Daguerreotype
in pressions.
   Copper is operated upon as we have just stated for silver,
and the plate is subsequently exposed to the action of the
vapour of solution of ammonia, which is gently heated to pro
duce a more copious disengagement; but care must be taken
not to expose the plate of copper until the first vapours have
escaped from the box, for this operation requires such an one
as is used for mercury. The same plate is subsequently
cleaned with water and a little tripoli. After this operation,
the image is developed and appears black like the preceding;
and moreover, the modification produced by the contact of
ammonia extends to such a depth in the plate, that it is not
obliterated until the metal itself is sensibly worn.
   The latter process will facilitate the labour of tool-engraving.
   The copying can also be effected on iron, lead, tin and
brass; but I know no means of fixing the impressions.
   I shall only enumerate here, from among the many and new
experiments which I have made on iodine, those the results
of which are certain. Thus, I oiled an engraving printed with
printer's ink (encre grasse), and when dry, exposed it to the
vapour of iodine. The impressions were analogous to the
preceding, except that they were less distinct. I subsequently
made some sketches upon a sheet of white paper (sized with
starch) with black crayon, common ink (without gum) and
lead; all were copied, and with still greater distinctness when
traced on paper prepared for oil-painting. I afterwards took
an oil-painting (unvarnished) and copied this also, with the
exception of certain colours composed of substances which do
not absorb the iodine. The same applies to coloured engravings.

              remarkable Properties of Iodine, &c.            209
This will be understood when I state, that an engraving exposed
to the vapour of mercuryor sulphur no longer takes the iodine;
the same occurs when it is immersed in nitrate of mercury
diluted with water, nitrate of silver, the sulphates of zinc,
copper, &c.; oxide of copper, minium, ultramarine, cinnabar,
orpiment, white lead, gelatine, albumen, and gum produce
the same effects. However, drawings made with these sub
stances may be copied, by subjecting them, with some modi
fications, to the preparation previously described. I may say
that I have not found any drawings which could not be copied,
except those made with the iodide of starch.
   I shall now speak of a second property which I have dis
covered in iodine, and which is quite independent of the former;
it is that of being attracted by designs in relief, and by all
bodies which present ridges, of whatever colour or composition.
Thus all embossed impressions on white paper are copied
perfectly.                                                       -
    The edges of a strip of glass or marble produce also an
impression. The same effects occur with other elastic fluids,
gases or vapours, as the fumes of phosphorus exposed to the
air, and the vapour of nitric acid. But iodine also exerts the
property of which I spoke at the commencement, as I obtained
the following results.
   I joined a piece of white wood to a piece of ebony; after
having glued them I planed them both, by which means I
obtained a perfectly flat black and white block: this was next
exposed to the vapour of iodine and then placed upon a plate
of copper; the black portion only was copied. I made similar
combinations with chalk and a black stone, white and black
silk, and always obtained the same results.
   All these phaenomena are manifested both in the most per
fect darkness as also in vacuo. I may repeat here, that if the
objects are exposed for too long a time to the vapour of the
iodine, the white portions ultimately become impregnated, but
the black parts are always strikingly distinct upon the plate
of metal.
   On making the same experiments with chlorine and bro
mine, the same results were obtained with the former as with
iodine ; but the impression is so indistinct, that it is requisite
to blow upon the metal to perceive it, or rather to expose the
plate of copper to the vapour of ammonia, and the plate of
silver to the vapour of mercury, to render it distinctly visible.
   The results with bromine were unsuccessful; all my expe
riments were made with either plates of silver or copper.
There is one experiment which I think worthy of mention, as
being of theoretical interest; it is this: after having put a
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 32. No. 214. March 1848.          P

 21 O           M. Niépce de Saint-Victor on some
 layer of starch-paste upon a Daguerreotype silver plate and
 upon one of copper, the impression of a drawing which I had
 thought to copy on the layer of starch became fixed upon the
 metal without leaving any sensible trace on the layer of starch.
 It was thus evident that the iodine had passed to the metal,
 in consequence of a superior affinity to that which it has for
 the starch.
                          On Phosphorus.
    I found that the product of the slow combustion of phos
 phorus exposed freely to the air possesses the same property
 as iodine, of being absorbed by the black parts of an engra
 ving or any kind of drawing, whatever may be the chemical
 nature of the black substance.
    Thus on exposing an engraving to the vapour of phosphorus
 burning slowly in the air, and subsequently laying it upon a
 plate of copper, placing it in a press for a few minutes and
 exposing it to the vapour of solution of ammonia, we obtain a
 perfectly distinct and thoroughly fixed impression. The im
 pression is quite invisible when the drawing is separated
 from the plate of copper, and it is absolutely necessary to have
 recourse to the ammonia to render it visible; just as, if we re
 quire to take it upon a plate of silver, this must be exposed
 to the vapour of mercury. I drew some black and white lines
 with oil-paints upon picture-canvas; on exposing them to
 the same vapour, the black portions only were copied on the
 metallic plate; that is to say, the black parts being impreg
nated with the vapour, and having been placed in contact with
 the copper, the vaporized substance acted upon the metal, and
 the white bands which did not contain any of it left the copper
 untouched. When this plate was exposed to the vapour of
 ammonia, the image became very distinct. However long an
 engraving may be exposed to the vapour of phosphorus, the
 black parts alone become impregnated with it; but when it
 has remained a considerable time, the impression becomes
 slightly visible upon the plate, as if figures had been drawn
 upon it with a piece of phosphorus; and on exposing it to
the vapour of ammonia, the impression appears as if in relief.
    A plate of silver or copper exposed to the same vapour re
produces by contact all kinds of drawings, and yields a posi
tive impression. It must be understood, that to render the
impressions visible they must be exposed to mercury or am

image upon a plate of copper or polished silver, upon which
it is pressed without any other preparation. This operation
is very readily effected, and will therefore be very useful to
the tool-engraver.
                          On Nitric Acid.
   With nitric acid I obtained the following results. On ex
posing an engraving (whatever may be the composition of the
black parts) to the vapour which is evolved by pure nitric
acid, afterwards laying it upon a plate of silver or copper, and
leaving it there for some minutes, we obtain a distinctly visible
negative in pression. The white parts are coated with a white
mist, the black are the pure copper.
   An oiled engraving, and figures drawn with charcoal or
  lack crayon upon white paper, yielded the same results. I
subsequently exposed a block made of white wood and ebony,
and found that the white band alone was copied.
   If an engraving is left exposed to the vapour of this acid
for a long time, the black parts are ultimately impregnated
like the white; and the plate of metal upon which the engra
ving has been applied is then covered with a uniform layer,
which presents no further trace of the drawing.
   An engraving will only serve to make one or at the most
two impressions; after this it must be left exposed to the air
for twenty-four hours before it can be again used, and fre
 uently it ceases to reproduce its image. We thus see that
the action is not characterized in the same manner as in the
case of iodine and phosphorus. This vapour is deposited
equally upon the parts in relief and upon the depressions:
thus an oil-painting and embossed impressions or stamps with
out ink are easily copied by this means. The same effects
occur with dry chloride of lime, but it requires to be gently
heated before exposing the engraving to the vapour which is
evolved from this substance, and which gives a negative im
pression, like nitric acid.

   On exposing the black and white feathers of birds (as those
from the wings of a magpie or the tail of the lapwing) to the
vapour of iodine, the black differed sensibly from the white;
and with the same feather I have made eight or ten impressions
upon copper, all of which presented a well-marked line of
demarcation between the black and the white parts. I after
wards immersed an engraving in tincture of iodine, and after
having produced several successive impressions upon starched

 212            M. Niépce de Saint-Victor on some
 paper, I ultimately obtained a positive and perfectly distinct
  impression, just as if I had used the vapour of iodine: the same
 occurs if the engraving be immersed in an aqueous solution
 of iodine.
     I must not omit to mention, that in copying an engraving
  all the black or coloured points which almost always exist in
  the substance of the paper are copied in the same manner as
  the lines of the engraving ; in such cases they must be removed
 by touching them with ammonia, or some other means.
     Before leaving the positive impressions to pass to the
 negative, I may state that I obtained the same results with
  iron pyrites as with the sulphuret of arsenic; the latter is how
 ever preferable on account of the facility of execution of the
 process, and because it leaves no mark upon the engraving.
 These impressions resist the action of nitric acid.
     I have also obtained a positive impression with the bichlo
 ride of mercury. If the design on the copper be exposed to
 the vapour of ammonia, it appears much more distinct, and
 is well-fixed.
     I shall now allude to the negative impressions which are
 obtained by means of substances possessing the power of being
 deposited upon the white parts of an engraving in preference
 to the black, as nitric acid.    The new results obtained were
 as follows:—I immersed printed characters in pure nitric acid
 (taking care to withdraw them immediately); I laid them upon
 a plate of copper, and on removing them after a certain time,
 found the characters in relief resembling a page of type.
     If an engraving is immersed in water acidulated with nitric
 acid, and allowed to dry until but little moisture is left, and
 is subsequently laid upon a metallic plate, we almost always
 obtain a very evident negative impression; and when this is
 not the case, simply blowing upon the plate is sufficient to
 make it visible.    A black and white feather treated in the
same way, also yielded an impression in which the white part
only was copied; a result the reverse of that obtained by im
 pressing upon the metal a feather after exposure to the vapour
of iodine. Hydrochloric acid produces almost the same effect
as nitric acid; but the latter is much preferable.
    I have already stated that chloride of lime (hypochlorite of
lime) produces a negative impression when an engraving is
exposed to the vapour evolved from it, an opposite result to
that obtained with chlorine. The impression is also negative
if we plunge an engraving into solution of chloride of lime,
whilst it is positive when immersed in pure chlorine. When
an engraving is placed in contact with chloride of lime dis
solved in water or the vapour which it exhales by its heat, on

subsequently laying it upon blue litmus paper, the white parts
of the engraving are copied in white; whilst if the engraving
is placed in contact with solution of chlorine or the vapour
which it exhales, the black parts are copied in red. But to
obtain these results, especially with chloride of lime, the tem
perature must be raised to about 104°F.          The same effects
are produced upon silver and copper.

   Although this essay is merely preliminary, I publish it in
its present state, not doubting that it will make rapid progress
in more practised hands than mine, and by those who will be
enabled to experiment under better circumstances than I have
been enabled to do.
   I shall point out the means which I have employed, and
which have yielded satisfactory although not perfect results:
as everything depends upon the preparation of the plate, I
shall describe the best method of preparing the starch.
   I take five grammes of starch, which are mixed first with
five grammes of water and afterwards diluted with ninety-five
grammes, and lastly thirty-five centigrammes of iodide of
potassium dissolved in five grammes of water. The whole is
placed upon the fire: when the starch is dissolved, it is allowed
to cool, next strained through linen, and then allowed to flow
upon the plates of glass, taking care to cover the entire surface
as equally as possible. After wiping them beneath, I place them
upon a perfectly horizontal plane, so as to dry them as quickly
as possible in the sun or by means of a stove, in order to obtain
a layer which is not fissured; that is to say, to prevent the glass
from being covered with circles in which the coating is thinner
than elsewhere (which are produced, in my opinion, by the
iodide of potassium). The starch should always be prepared
in a porcelain vessel, and the quantity, five grammes, which
has been mentioned, is sufficient to coat ten plates, of the size
known in commerce by the name d'un quart”. It is thus seen
that a large number of plates are easily prepared at once.
Moreover, bubbles of air must be excluded, as these would
make so many small holes in the impressions. The plate being
thus prepared, when we wish to proceed, it is merely requisite
to apply the aceto-nitrate to it, by means of a piece of paper
plunged several times into this compound; a second piece of
paper moistened with distilled water is subsequently laid upon
the plate. A second method consists in previously impreg
nating the layer of starch with distilled water, before     "...;
on the aceto-nitrate; in the latter case the image is muc
                     * Of about 4% inches by 3%.

214        On some remarkable Properties of Iodine, &c.
blacker, but the exposure to the light should be continued a
little longer than in the method first indicated. The plate is
afterwards placed in the camera obscura, and retained there
perhaps a little longer than when paper prepared by Blan
quart's process is used”. However, I have obtained very black
impressions in twenty or twenty-five seconds in the sun, and in
a minute in the shadet.
    The operation is then conducted as for the process on
paper, i. e. gallic acid is used to bring out the impression and
 bromide of potassium to fix it.
    This is the first process which I used; but having tried
albumen (white of egg), I obtained a remarkable superiority
in every respect, and I believe the preference must be given to
 the latter substance. The plates were prepared as follows:–
 I took the most transparent part of the white of egg<U+017F> (the
 liquid portion), in which I placed some iodide of potassium;
 then, having allowed it to flow upon the plates, I left it to dry
 at the ordinary temperature (if this was too high, the layer of
 albumen cracked).         When about to use it, the aceto-nitrate is
 applied by pouring it upon the plate, so as to cover the entire
 surface at once; but it is better to plunge it into this composi
 tion so as to obtain a perfectly uniform layer. The aceto
 nitrate renders the albumen insoluble in water, and makes
 it strongly adherent to the glass. With albumen, rather
 longer exposure to the light is required than when starch is
 used. The action of the gallic acid is also slower; but by
 way of compensation, we obtain remarkable distinctness and
 delicacy of the lines, and which, in my opinion, will some day
 º    brought to the perfection of an image upon a plate of
 Sll Ver.
     I tried gelatinous matters: they also yield very distinct im
 pressions (especially if filtered, which is essentially requisite
 for all substances), but they are too readily dissolved by water.
 If starch is employed, the finest should be chosen; my expe
 riments were made with that manufactured by Groult.
     By employing the means which have just been pointed out,
 negative impressions are obtained. I have not made any po
 sitive impressions; but I presume that they can be obtained
 as on paper, or by placing the substances in starch, and not in
 albumen, which it is not even necessary to immerse in the so
 lution of common salt. With the latter substance, the plate
 must be plunged into the silver-bath.

   On the Accelerating Process of Daguerreotype Operation. 215
   If the use of paper should continue to be preferred, I would
advise the coating of it with one or two layers of starch or
albumen, and then we should have the same distinctness of
the impression as in the proofs made with iodine; but I believe
that, with regard to photography, paper will never be equal
to a hard and polished body covered with a sensitive layer.
 I may add that very beautiful positive impressions may be
made upon opaline glass.
    May we not hope by this method to take impressions from
lithographic stones, even if the copied impression had to be
drawn in chalk, if it cannot be done with any other kind of
inking? I have obtained very beautiful impressions upon a
schist (hone-stone) coated with a layer of albumen. By this
means, engravers upon copper and wood will be able to obtain
impressions, which it will be very easy for them to work upon.
 XXXII. Question of Priority respecting the Discovery of
   the accelerating process in the Daguerreotype operation. By
   A. CLAUDET, Esq.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
I    HAVE lately heard that Mr. Goddard knew as far back as
      the year 1840 that bromide of iodine was more sensitive to
light than iodine alone in the Daguerreotype process; and that
a short letter merely mentioning the fact written by him was
inserted at the time in the Literary Gazette, 12th Dec., 1840.
   Having myself until now had all the honour of the discovery
of the accelerating properties of chlorine and bromine com
bined with iodine, I am happy to be the first to bring Mr.
Goddard’s claim before the public, who will have to bestow on
him the share of merit for what he has done prior to my com
munication to the Royal Society, which was read at the meet
ing of the 10th of June 1841. I have acted openly. After
having made my communication to the Royal Society, I made
the same to the Académie des Sciences the 22nd of the same
month, and my discoveries have been mentioned in all the
treatises on photography; and until now, neither Mr. God
dard nor any other person has yet contested publicly that I
was the first inventor of the accelerating process in the Da
guerreotype operation.
   It is strange that Mr. Goddard's letter should have been
unknown and unnoticed by all writers on photography either
English or foreign. If Mr. Goddard had found the means to
avail himself with certainty of the properties of bromide of

216                 Notices respecting New Books.
iodine, if he did not wish to make a secret of it, he should have
written at the time a full and explicit paper on the subject, and
published it through the medium of some scientific society or
journal. In question of priority, it is not enough to have stated
that we have made the discovery of a new agent; we must
prove it by enabling others to test it and to apply its properties.
    It must be observed that bromide of iodine is a compound
very little known in chemistry, that its real proportions have
not yet been accurately established, that it is excessively diffi
cult to form the mixture of the two elements in the proper
relation to each other, which gives the increase of sensitiveness
to the Daguerreotype plate, and that excess of one of the two
elements destroys that sensitiveness. Mr. Goddard should
have stated these proportions, and the mode of applying the
coating on the plate. Bromide of iodine alone is not sufficient
in the preparation of the Daguerreotype plate; its vapours
 must be applied when the plate has already been coated with
pure iodine. This was an important feature in my discovery,
 which rendered it at once most valuable to photographers.
    Nevertheless the name of Mr. Goddard should be honour
 ably mentioned in the history of the progress of photography;
 not only for the discovery to which I have just alluded, but
 also for having been one of the first in England who investi
 gated with zeal, enthusiasm, and scientific abilities, all the
 phaenomena connected with this admirable invention.
                   I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
                                   Your most obedient Servant,
   London, Feb. 23, 1848.                                 A. CLAUDET.
             XXXIII.- Notices respecting New Books.
 A Description of Active and Eatinct Volcanos, of Earthquakes, and of
    Thermal Springs, with remarks on the causes of these phanomena,
    the character of their respective products, and their influence on the
    past and present condition of the Globe. By C. DAUBENy, M.D.,
    F.R.S. Second Edition, greatly enlarged. London: Simpkin,
    Marshall and Co.
 THElº is no department of terrestrial physics (we speak not of
       astronomy) which gives us a more exalted view of the grandeur
 of Nature's operations, than the phaenomena of volcanos. The end
 less diversities of organic life, past and present, the marvels of che
 mistry, of optics, of crystallography, of acoustics, of electricity, and
 the other sensible properties of matter, captivate the observer by their
 beauty rather than by their sublimity. But in the volcano and its con
 comitants, the eruption, the lava-stream, the earthquake, the thermal
 spring, we are allowed a glimpse into the very workshop of Nature;

                   Notices respecting New Books.                    217
we behold Creative Power evolving and modifying the raw material,
which is afterwards to be invested with form and life, and the sense of
awe predominates over our admiration. Volcanic geology also differs
from all other branches of natural history, in not being limited to the
bounds of our terrestrial prison. We know nothing, and we never
can know anything in this life, of the zoology, or the botany, or the
mineralogy of other celestial bodies; but the forms and configurations
of our own satellite, and in some degree of the planets also, enable
us to study volcanic geology in other spheres, and thus to add to the
proofs, which gravitation supplies, of the uniformity of Nature's
laws.
    The occurrence in almost every region of the earth's surface of
volcanic products, ancient or modern, and their general uniformity
of character, prove how essentially they are connected with the in
ternal structure of the globe; while the minor variations in their
phaenomena afford an endless source of interest to the geologist, the
physical geographer, the mineralogist and the chemist. Innumerable
 observations of volcanic phaenomena have been made in recent times,
 and are widely scattered over the field of literature; but some resumé
 of the whole subject was required to generalize these erratic facts,
 to condense their substance, and to guide the more ardent student
 to the original sources of knowledge. Such an object is incidentally
 aimed at in most modern treatises on geology; but Dr. Daubeny
was, we believe, the first, in this country at least, to devote an espe
 cial work to the whole subject of volcanos. His treatise, published
 more than twenty years ago, has been long and deservedly esteemed;
but from the lapse of time, had fallen much in arrear of the present
 state of science. The work now before us, which he modestly terms
 a second edition, is so greatly extended, both in the amount of its
 information and in the maturity of its reasonings, that it might well
 have been designated by an original title.
    The first and largest portion of the work contains an admirable
 summary of the facts of volcanic geology, arranged according to the
 regions of the earth's surface where they occur. The wonderfully
 extensive diffusion of volcanic phaenomena, and the diversities which
 they exhibit in each district, render any other than a geographical
 arrangement of them almost impracticable. The many personal
 examinations which Dr. Daubeny has made of volcanic regions,
 and the length of time that his attention has been given to the sub
 ject, have enabled him to render the descriptive portion of his work
 very complete; and the many reflected lights which he has thrown
 upon it from historians and classic poets, make it interesting to other
  classes of readers besides geologists.   The chapters upon the vol
  canos of France, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor, and Syria, are particu
  larly instructive in this respect. The many authentic accounts of
  the activity of volcanic foci in historic times, now slumbering for
  awhile, now bursting forth in some unexpected locality, prove the
  vast extent of the fiery lake on which the lovely lands and seas of
  Southern Europe tranquilly float.
     In his chapter on Syria, Dr. Daubeny shows the great probability

218                  Notices respecting New Books.
that the destruction of the plain of Siddim was effected by a vol
canic eruption, which caused a subsidence of the valley of the Jordan,
and buried the guilty cities with its ashes. This is a most interest
ing question, and one which theologians and geologists should unite
to solve; but strange to say, the materials for its solution are still
very incomplete. Will not one of the many travellers, who annually
flock to the Holy Land in quest of excitement, make an accurate
levelling from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, give us a good
orographical and geological map of the region round it, or tell us
how far the submarine depression extends up the valley of the Jordan,
and whether this depressed area is wholly due to subsidence, or has
been subsequently extended by aqueous denudation ?
   We cannot attempt to follow Dr. Daubeny through the mass of
curious details and philosophic generalizations which he has collected
on the volcanos of all countries.      We will therefore proceed to the
second part of the work, which speaks of earthquakes and thermal
springs, as incidental phaenomena supposed to be connected with
volcanos.
   In treating of the unquestionable connexion which often subsists
between earthquakes and volcanic operations, Dr. Daubeny seems
too much disposed, we think, to consider this connexion as universal.
Geologists are apt to forget, what would otherwise be a truism, that
an earthquake is merely a quaking of the earth; they seem to infer
from the terrific accompaniments of these events, that the earthquake
itself is a vera causa, and speak, for instance, of the upheaval of land
being due to an earthquake, when in fact the earthquake is due to
the upheaval of the land. Now an earthquake ought to be simply
defined “a vibratory movement of part of the earth's surface;” and
in ascending towards its cause, we may attribute it immediately to a
sudden snapping asunder or rubbing together of two adjacent rocky
masses in the focus whence the vibration proceeds. This act of dis
ruption or of friction is the result of internal movements in the body
of the earth, and these movements are probably due to a plurality of
causes. Volcanic explosions no doubt form one of these causes;
but we will not venture to say that they form the chief, far less the
only source of these hypogene concussions. Giving volcanic erup
tions full credit for the sudden upheavals of land which they have
occasioned, we cannot go the length of attributing to their mechani
cal action the slow and gradual elevations and depressions which
unquestionably take place.
   These chronic changes of level are much more easily explained by
the contraction or expansion caused by a subterranean change of
temperature. And this may be due either to a cosmical change in
the temperature of the space through which the solar system moves,
or to a slow cooling of the earth's interior from radiation, or to su
perficial changes, such as the increase or diminution of ice, or of
forests, or of hot or cold marine currents, or to the convection of
caloric by thermal springs.    It is also, no doubt, often due (as in the
Puzzuoli case) to changes of temperature connected with volcanic
agency; but this is a very different operation from the mechanical

                            Royal Society.                          219
thrusts caused by igneous eruptions. Elevation by thermal expansion
is only due to volcanos, in the same sense that the rise of the mercury
in a thermometer, when placed on a hot lava-stream, is due to them.
   Another probable cause of earthquakes is the settling of parts of the
earth's crust from the long-continued action of gravitation. As in
a house with a bad foundation, the walls continue to settle and to
crack, long after the building has been finished, which crackings
 often startle the inmates by their sudden vibration and noise, so we
 may suppose that certain parts of the earth's surface may have a bad
foundation, either from cavities caused by diminution of temperature,
 or by the elevation of land in neighbouring districts, or from the
 yielding or compressible nature of the substratum. In such a case
 the surface-beds will slowly and imperceptibly subside, till from the
 increasing pressure they suddenly give way at some weak point, and
 this fracture causes an earthquake. Such a process of settling is no
 doubt one of the causes of those faults which are so common in all
 rocks, even when far removed from volcanic agencies.

 points contained in this important and valuable work.]

                           ROYAL SOCIETY.
                        [Continued from p. 141.]
               Anniversary Meeting, November 30, 1847.
      HE Marquis of Northampton in the Chair.
        The President delivered his Address to the Meeting, of which
 the following are extracts:—
       GENTLEMEN,
    Since our last Anniversary, your Council have been much occupied
 with anxious deliberation on many subjects of great importance to
 our Society: among these, the one that chiefly interests science is
 perhaps the question, how we may most completely secure the proofs
 of priority in the communication of scientific discovery.       For this
 purpose we have framed rules which I hope may be found sufficient
 for the attainment of our object.                      -
    During the last year, an important alteration has been made in
 our Statutes with reference to the election of new Fellows, as you
 must be well aware. This change was made with the approbation
 of a large majority of your Council. As I was one of those who
 entertained considerable doubts of its prudence and expediency, I
 cannot claim any praise if it prove advantageous to the Society, nor
 must I be considered responsible in case of its failure. Having been
 adopted, however, it appears to me that it ought not hastily to be
 either rescinded or modified; that it ought to have a fair trial, for
 the experience of many years can alone decide whether it be inju
 rious or beneficial.
    Many of you, Gentlemen, must be aware that a much more strin

220                        Royal Society.
gent regulation was at one time in contemplation, which would have
affected your privileges. Had not that proposition been abandoned,
I should have felt it my duty to urge strongly on the Council the
propriety of bringing the whole question before the Society at large,
and I have little doubt that that course would have been readily
adopted. As, however, the limitation of the number fifteen applies
alone to the number to be recommended by the Council, leaving to
you the power to elect more candidates, should you think fit to do
so, there seemed to me to be no necessity for calling you together
in a Special General Meeting.
   Having stated to you my doubts as to the expediency of the limi
tation of the number of Candidates recommended by the Council, it
is right to add that those doubts do not at all extend to the change
in the manner of our election.      I am convinced that considerable
advantage must accrue from its being attended with greater solem
nity, and from the participation of a larger number of our Fellows
in its exercise. This change has also the further recommendation,
that the reading of our papers will not be perpetually interrupted
by the circulation of the ballot-box.
   I now come to the most grateful part of my address—that of the
presentation of the Royal and Copley Medals. The two subjects
proposed for the former this year were the sciences of Chemistry
and Mathematics. As in the latter there was no paper coming
within the Royal regulations to which we could properly give the
medal, we were obliged by the same regulations to turn to the sub
jects of Physics and Geology. We have, in consequence, awarded
the Medal in Physics to Mr. Grove, for the paper which constituted
the subject of the Bakerian Lecture; and to Mr. Fownes, for papers
which, as Mr. Grove's, appear in the Philosophical Transactions.
   The Copley Medal was presented to Sir John Herschel for his
long, and arduous, and valuable labours in the service of astronomy
at a very distant part of our globe.
   Among the deceased Members are the following:—
   HUGH, THIRD DUKE of North UMBERLAND.
   NICHOLAs CARLISLE.
   WILLIAM DEALTRY, D.D.
   The Right Hon. SIR Edward HYDE East.
   Mr. MACVEY NAPIER was born in the year 1777, and descended
from an ancient family in the West of Scotland. After successful
studies in the two Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, he be
came a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet. His talents
would probably have led him to great success in the legal profes
sion, had not his taste for literary and philosophical pursuits led
him to other avocations. He was, however, the object of so much re
spect and regard, that he was at an early age elected by the Society to
the honourable office of their librarian; an office for which he seems
to have been admirably qualified. At a later period, they selected
him from many able competitors to deliver lectures on Conveyancing.
The University of Edinburgh subsequently evinced their sense of
the merits of these lectures by converting the lectureship into a

                              Royal Society.                       221
professorship, with a handsome endowment, and permitting Mr.
Napier to become the professor without ceasing to be librarian.
    In the year 1814, Mr. Napier edited the Supplement to the En
cyclopaedia Britannica, and at a later period, he superintended a new
edition of the same important work, and by so doing conferred a
great benefit on the science of his country and of the world.
    In the year 1830, Mr. Napier was appointed to the situation of
principal Clerk of Session, and resigned that of librarian to the
Writers to the Signet, having the year before succeeded Mr. Jeffery
as the editor of one of the most influential of those quarterly jour
nals whose publication is of the greatest importance to the literary
 and scientific interests of the country. He had been a contributor
 to the Edinburgh Review previously, and was therefore the better
 able to manage it with success. A memoir that has been published
 on his life, evidently written by one well-acquainted with his merits,
 remarks, “He was in all respects perfectly trustworthy : all secrets
 confided to him were sacred; and the most distinguished of his con
 tributors were farther ready to admit the value of his suggestions
 and the justice of his criticisms.”
    He continued to attend to the duties of his class at the Univer
 sity very nearly to the time of his death.
    He married young, and left a large family at his death, which
 happened in the 71st year of his age.
    During the latter years of his life his health had been declining;
 but his intellectual powers were unimpaired to the last. By those
 with whom he was intimate even a higher estimate of his talents
 is entertained than what is felt by those who merely look to the im
portant share that he took in literature and science as the editor
 of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and the Edinburgh Review. So
at least says the author of the memoir alluded to already. This
 seems difficult; but they alone can judge of the merits of his confi
 dential correspondence and his part in domestic society: it is per
 haps more important to say, that he was “a pious, an intelligent
 and an honest friend.” He became a Fellow of the Royal Society
 in the year 1817.
    The Rev. John HAILsTone was born on the 13th of December,
 1759, and received his early education at Beverley School in York
 shire. From thence he went to Cambridge, where he pursued his
 mathematical studies with so much success that he took the high
 degree of Second Wrangler at the examination in the year 1782.
 The same course of study was followed by him in after-life.
    In the year 1784, he became a Fellow of Trinity College, and in
 1788, he was appointed to the office of Woodwardian Professor of
 Mineralogy. After holding this Professorship for the long period of
 thirty years, he married and retired to the vicarage of Trump
 ington, near the University; a village interesting to the lover of
 literature as having been the residence of Anstey, the author of the
 Bath Guide, and at a subsequent period, of Mr. Hailstone's brother
professor, the celebrated traveller, Edward Daniel Clark.
    Here Mr. Hailstone died on the 9th of last June, at the very ad

 222                          Royal Society.
 vanced age of 87, retaining his faculties till the last. After his
 election to the Woodwardian Professorship he went to Germany to
 profit by the lectures of Werner. To Mr. Hailstone the University
 is indebted for additions to her collection of minerals and fossils.
 He published a syllabus of Lectures, but did not succeed in bringing
 together a class, as he received little or no encouragement from the
 heads of the University.       He published little : one paper in the
 Geological Transactions, and a few short notices in the Transactions
 of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. In politics he was a whig.
 He was a friend to education, as he showed by the endowment of
 a day-school, and the expenditure of several hundred pounds in im
 proving a parish school.
    The Rev. WILLIAM PEARson, LL.D.
    Professor MACCULLAGH was born in the year 1809. The place
 of his birth was the townland of Loughlindhuhussey, then pos
 sessed by his grandfather, a man of considerable acquirements, and
 a scholar of some pretensions. This place is in the parish of
 Upper Badoney, in the county of Tyrone, about ten miles from
 Strabane.
    Shortly after his birth, his father removed from the mountain farm
 he occupied to Strabane, principally that he might have the means
 of educating his son, it not being possible to do so in the secluded
 glen in which he lived. In Strabane he was, while very young,
 placed at the only respectable school at that time in the town. Here
 his genius soon displayed itself. After school hours he was almost
 constantly employed in solving mathematical problems; yet, it is
 remembered that when Euclid was first put into his hands he was
 dissatisfied with the task. He was only required to get the solution
of a problem by heart, like a copy of verses, and repeat it. There
 was no attempt made at explanation.         This did not suit the cha
racter of his mind, which even then could not rest until it thoroughly
understood the nature of everything that came before it.      For some
days he was restless, unhappy and puzzled, wandering about with
his Euclid in his hand.       In his perplexity he met a neighbour, a
working carpenter, a man of cleverness and talent, who, seeing the
boy evidently unhappy, was good enough to ask him what was the
matter. He immediately told his good-natured friend that he was
obliged to get by heart a set of strange words, the meaning of which
he wanted to understand; at the same time showing him the pro
position he was committing to memory for the next day's task. The
carpenter instantly sat down with the puzzled boy, and in a short
time showed him what a proof was. This was the way in which
Professor MacCullagh first learned to prove a proposition in Euclid.
He was afterwards, when commencing his classical studies, sent to
Lifford to the school of the Rev. John Graham, and subsequently to
that of the Rev. Thomas Rollestone. He entered Trinity College,
Dublin, as a pensioner in November 1824, being then in the fifteenth
year of his age.    In the following year, he became a candidate for
Sizarship, and was successful. Throughout his under-graduate
course he carried away every Honour both in Science and Classics.

  In 1827, he obtained a Scholarship, and in 1832, (the year when his
  Scholarship expired) he was elected a Fellow. In 1835, he became
  Professor of Mathematics, Dr. Sadleir (the present Provost) having
  resigned expressly to make way for him. In 1843, he was chosen to
  fill the Chair of Natural Philosophy, in the room of the present Dr.
  Lloyd, who, by becoming a Senior Fellow, was incapacitated from
  continuing to hold it. In 1830, his first paper on Refracted Light
  was read in the Royal Irish Academy, and shortly after he became a
. Member of it, and contributed largely to place it in that position
  which it now holds among the learned Societies of the world. In
   1838, he obtained the Conyngham Gold Medal from the Academy
  for his paper “On the Laws of Crystalline Reflexion and Refraction,”
  which was presented to him, with an Address (since printed in the
   Proceedings) respecting the then existing state of science in that
   department, by Sir Wm. Rowan Hamilton, who was at that time
   President of the Academy. In 1839, Professor MacCullagh may be
   regarded as having laid the foundation of the highly valuable Mu
   seum of Irish Antiquities, now in Dublin, by presenting to the Royal
   Irish Academy the celebrated Cross of Cong. In presenting the
   Cross to the Academy, Professor MacCullagh stated, that his mo
   tive for doing so was, by putting it in the possession of a public
   body, to save it from that shameful process of destruction to which
   everything venerable in Ireland had been exposed for centuries, and
   to contribute at the same time to the formation of a national col
   lection, the want of which, he had been told, was regarded by Sir
    Walter Scott as a disgrace to a country so abounding in valuable
    remains.    He afterwards assisted in enlarging the Museum, which
   he had thus (it may be said) commenced, by munificent subscrip
    tions.   His contributions to the Academy were not confined to sci
   entific subjects; they embraced matters of general literature, espe
   cially some connected with ancient Egyptian chronology. In 1842,
   he was awarded the Copley Medal for his investigations on the
    Theory of Light. Among the competitors were Bessel, Dumas, and
   Murchison. On this occasion he was much indebted to Dr. Lloyd's
   excellent report.
      In the following year, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,
   but was not a contributor to its Transactions. The reason frequently
   assigned by him for this was, that he felt bound to do as much as
   in him lay to raise and elevate the literary and scientific institutions
   of the country of his birth. This with him was ever a paramount
    object; and in connexion with that object, in the summer of the
    Present year, he resolved, at great inconvenience to himself, to make
    an effort to free the University with which he was so closely con
   nected from what he considered a disgrace, namely, its being repre
   sented in Parliament by men not educated within its walls. He
   Was influenced, too, by what he considered a public want, that the
   interests of science and literature should be represented in the
   Imperial Parliament.
       He was not successful; but his personal bearing throughout the
     contest was such as to secure to him the admiration and the good-will

 224                        Royal Society.
of all opponents as well as friends. This remarkable contest was,
as might be expected, commenced and carried on by Professor Mac
 Cullagh, without his ever accepting that pecuniary assistance which
 was frequently and warmly offered by others, but by him was grate
fully declined.
    About the middle of September, he commenced working at a sub
ject which he was anxious to free his mind from as soon as possible.
 The heading of the paper remains: it is, “A Theory of Total Re
 flexion of Light. By James MacCullagh, Fellow of Trinity College,
 Dublin. Read May 24th, 1841.”
    Confinement and over-work gradually produced disease, mental
 as well as bodily; and after a few days' illness, an end was put to
 his career on the night of the 24th of October, in the 38th year of
his age.
    As it is understood that there will be given at the stated Meeting
 of the Royal Irish Academy, in March next, a more lengthened
memoir of Professor MacCullagh's life than could conveniently be
offered to the Royal Society now, I have contented myself with the
 few facts and dates which have been thus rapidly stated; and as I
 am led to believe that there will be given to the public on the same
 occasion an accurate and detailed account of his scientific labours
and discoveries, which it has been found difficult (through want of
time) to put together in a satisfactory manner for our Meeting this
night, I will merely glance at some of the things done by him since
this Society awarded to him the Medal already mentioned, being
the highest honour in their power to bestow.         My information is
derived chiefly from gentlemen who have attended to and profited by
his official teaching in the University of Dublin, and who, having
since attained distinction and station in that University, speak now
with a natural enthusiasm of their lost preceptor and friend.
    Since Professor MacCullagh obtained the Copley Medal, in ad
dition to the different papers which he published in the Proceedings
and in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, he has given
seven courses of lectures in different branches of Natural Philosophy,
in his capacity of professor of that subject, having for about eight
years previously filled the Chair of Mathematics in a manner which
those alone can fully appreciate who know what was the state of
mathematical knowledge in the Dublin University previous to his
election and what it is now, and who can compare the state in which
he found it with that in which he left it. I allude to these Lectures,
because it was in the delivery of them, that is, in the conscientious
and due performance of the proper duties of his calling, that Pro
fessor MacCullagh is reported to have ever appeared to the greatest
advantage. It was there that he used to display the extensive in
formation, the elaborate research, and the vast acquired treasures of
his highly cultivated mind; and it was there that he most delighted
to turn to account the noble faculty of inventive genius with which
he was so eminently gifted, in improving, by means of it, every sub
ject he ever handled. There is no one capable of appreciating such
subjects, and who enjoyed the privilege of attending the courses

above referred to, but will admit, that during the several years of
his purely mathematical lectures, nothing could exceed the depth
or surpass the exquisite taste and elegance of all his original concep
tions, both in analysis and geometry. Nor will it be denied by any
who were so happy as to possess the opportunity of judging, that
during the last three years and a half in which he filled the Chair of
Natural Philosophy, his earnest endeavour was ever to instil sound
and accurate physical conceptions into the minds of his hearers, and
to array them, when stated in mathematical language, in all the
charms which arises from true taste and appropriate refinement.
   In his first course of Lectures—on the rotation of a solid body
round a fixed point—he completely solved the case of a body aban
doned to its own motions on receiving a primitive impulse in any
direction, and under the action of no external accelerating forces.
This problem he had finished several years before, and was preparing
it for publication, when he found that he had been just anticipated,
in many though not in all respects, by Poinsot, who published about
that time a very elegant little tract on the subject. During the same
course of Lectures he gave some interesting and original theorems
respecting the rotation of surfaces of revolution moving freely in
space, and acted on by any external accelerating forces, directed to
any number of fixed centres.
   In his course of Lectures on attractions, he gave some very beauti
ful theorems respecting the attraction of a body of any nature and
form on a point distant a long way in comparison of its own dimen
sions.    And he gave some most simple and elegant geometrical
methods for finding the attraction of an homogeneous ellipsoid on
any internal point. The subject of attractions seems indeed to have
been a favourite one with him; and he on several previous occasions
gave new and beautiful theorems in it, and in many important re
spects improved the existing theories, keeping always in advance of
the knowledge of the time. He delivered also courses of Lectures
on part of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia, and on Heat, Electricity
and Magnetism.
   I now come to Professor MacCullagh's great course of Lectures
on “The Dynamical Theory of Light,” which was on his part
(whatever other researches on that subject may have been elsewhere
made) the unaided creation of his own genius; and was founded
on one single and simple hypothesis, on which as a basis (to bor- .
row the language of Dr. Lloyd when speaking of Fresnel's beau
tiful theory of double refraction), he “has reared the noblest fabric
which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's
system of the Universe alone excepted.” If we now venture to say
that Professor MacCullagh ranks as a philosopher higher than Fres
nel in the region of Light (and if that be admitted, he will certainly
rank inferior to none on that subject), it is not thereby designed to
institute any comparison between labours so different in their na
ture as those of these two great men. Professor MacCullagh may
be regarded as standing to Fresnel in the same relation as Newton
to Kepler. Fresnel undoubtedly discovered all the elegant laws of

the propagation and double refraction of light in crystallized media,
as well as in ordinary, with some of those of total reflexion at the
bounding surfaces of ordinary media, but he did not account for
them on any correct mechanical principles; with respect to propa
gation, the very first principles from which he sets out are such as
cannot now be admitted; with respect to ordinary reflexion, he partly
accounted for them on correct principles, in the particular case of
ordinary media, which was the only one for which he had ever given
them. Professor MacCullagh, on the contrary, not only deduced
the known laws in all the three cases from mechanical principles of
a nature so simple and probable, that they cannot but bear con
viction of their truth to any mind reflecting on them, with anything
like the attention they deserve, but he also gave the general equa
tions of the propagation of light not only for all known media, but
also for all media which could ever be discovered or even conceived.
And with these he gave also the general conditions which must be
fulfilled at the common bounding surface of every two, not only
known, but conceivable media, and which in every case give all the
laws of reflexion and of refraction, whether ordinary or total.
   Thus did he deliver to his hearers and to posterity a perfect and
complete mechanical theory; that is to say, analytically complete :
so that any one who in future may attempt to discover in this re
gion of science, can only do so by treading in his steps, and adopt
ing his principles, but can never supersede them. In fact, he has
discovered and handed down the general principles which must hold
in all cases.   It remains for future investigators only to apply them.
He himself applied them to the two most general cases of propaga
tion, viz. of polarized waves of undiminishing intensity in a crystal
line medium, and of that peculiar species of propagated vibrations
which take place in the rarer medium in every case of total reflexion
 at the surface either of an ordinary or of a crystalline medium. In
the former case he arrived at all the laws of propagation in crystal
line media which were discovered by Fresnel, with one single varia
 tion, and that the very one on which he himself had long previously
 corrected Fresnel, viz. the vibrations of the aether, in place of coming
 out to be perpendicular to the plane of polarization, as Fresnel had
 supposed, came out on the contrary to be parallel to that plane, as
 MacCullagh himself had supposed.
    He was enabled by discoveries of his own, to deduce again in a far
 easier manner, all the beautiful geometrical laws of crystalline re
 flexion and refraction, which he had formerly laid before the Royal
 Irish Academy in 1837, and for which that body awarded him the
 honorary distinction of the Conyngham Medal, which I have before
 alluded to. And they fully confirmed the acute prophecy then made
 by his sagacious mind, on finding to his astonishment, that a law of
 reflexion depended for its existence on the existence of a law of pro
 pagation ; when he said that the law of vis viva which he had as
 sumed at the outset could not be a fundamental but rather a se
 condary law, and remarked that perhaps the next step in physical
 optics would be the deduction, as parts of one system, of all the laws

both of propagation and reflexion from some higher and more gene
ral law, containing them both as particular cases: anticipations
which were singled out for special attention, in the Address deli
vered by Sir W. Rowan Hamilton, on the occasion already referred
to. How little perhaps did Professor MacCullagh then know that
both of his own prophecies were destined to be so soon fulfilled,
and both by the powers of his own mighty and creative mind
    In the general case of total reflexion at the surface of a crystal,
he afterwards showed, by a most ingenious employment of imagi
nary quantities, that the refraction was still double, and never more
than double; and he showed that the directions of the refracted rays
remained always the same, whatever were the incidence, provided it
 gave total reflexion. Again, as he had done for the case of ordinary
reflexion by means of his beautiful theorem of the polar plane, so
in the case of total reflexion he determined the two directions of
 polarization, in a given incident plane polarized wave, which would
 give uniradial refracted rays, by means not of a polar plane, but of
 a polar cylinder, which he succeeded in showing was the analogous
 surface in the more difficult cases.
    In the particular case of total reflexion at the surface of an ordi
nary medium, the whole theory of total reflexion became exceedingly
 simple, and that case is left by him completed.        He showed that
 whatever were the incidence, the refracted wave was always perpen
 dicular to the intersection of the plane of incidence, and of the sur
 face of the crystal; he showed that the axes of the ellipse of vibra
 tion, projected on the plane of incidence, were parallel and perpen
 dicular to that line; he gave a beautiful construction, by means of
 an equilateral hyperbola touching with its vertex the section of the
 index sphere at the point where it intersects the same right line, for
 determining the velocity of the refracted wave, and the ratio of the
 axes of its elliptic vibrations corresponding to any given incidence;
 he determined at once the limiting angle of total reflexion : and,
 finally, he got out the two empirical formulae of Fresnel, for the ac
 celeration of the refracted phase over the incident, and the subse
 quent equal acceleration of the reflected phase over the refracted;
 the one for the case of the incident light polarized in the plane of
incidence, and the other for the same polarized in the perpendicular
plane.     For all cases, whether of propagation or of reflexion, ordi
nary or total, the whole theory, as he has left it, is analytically
complete : but the geometrical interpretations in the general case of
 total reflexion at the surface of a crystal present very great difficul
ties.    Many of these his acute intellect had with great labour sur
mounted; he had been working hard at the subject for the last four
weeks of his life, and with so much success, that he had actually
commenced a new paper for the Irish Transactions, embodying the
 results of his latest investigations. The heading of this paper, which
 I have already mentioned, remains in his own handwriting. It is
 believed that several of his manuscripts on other subjects are in the
 possession of his family, although it was not his custom to preserve
 many written papers.

228                         Royal Society.
   ALEXANDER BRONGNIART, the son of a distinguished architect,
was born at Paris in the year 1770. In early youth he derived his
love of science, not only from his father, but also from his father's
friends, Franklin, Lavoisier, and other eminent men of the day.
He received his earliest lessons in science at the Ecole des Mines,
and afterwards at the Ecole de Médecine.          At the age of twenty,
he came to England, and visited the mines of Derbyshire.             On
his return to his own country, he published a memoir on enamel
ling, which induced M. Berthollet, several years later, to recom
mend his appointment to the office of Director of the manufactory
of Sèvres.    At the time of the French Revolution, he had the mis
fortune to be suspected of the offence of favouring the escape of
M. Broussonet, and was thrown into prison. More fortunate however
than so many others who were arrested in that terrible time, he
escaped with his life, and, after his release, returned to Paris and be
came a Mining Engineer. He subsequently was appointed Professor
of Natural History at the Ecole Centrale des Quatre Nations; and in
the year 1800, commenced his superintendence of the manufactory
of porcelain at Sèvres, an office filled by him for the long period of
nearly half a century.                                -      r
    In the year 1807, appeared M. Brongniart's ‘Traité Elémentaire
de Minéralogie,” a work of great importance and merit.
    M. Brongniart did not confine his scientific researches to mine
ralogy.     Zoology also attracted his attention and profited by his
labours, and a community of pursuit brought him into close relation
with the illustrious Cuvier.
   In the year 1808, he revisited this country and studied its fresh
water formations, a study of great importance with reference to a
work published by him, in conjunction with M. Cuvier, after his
return to France, on the Geology of the Environs of Paris.
    In consequence of the great service he had rendered to science,
he was elected a member of the French Academy in the year 1815.
Two years later, he visited Switzerland, the Alps and Italy, where he
 extended his geological fame by fresh observations; and in 1822, he
 published the second and enlarged edition of his Geology of the
 neighbourhood of the capital of France.
    In the year 1824, he made a journey in Norway and Sweden, and
in the course of it studied the more early fossiliferous deposits, and
brought together the materials for a memoir on erratic blocks.
    Other geological questions occupied his thoughts, and among
 them were the interesting phaenomena of volcanos, and especially of
 Vesuvius.                                          -
    Such is a brief account of the scientific career of this zealous and
 active philosopher, as exhibited in the touching address delivered
 after his death by his friend M. Elie de Beaumont.      Science was not
 however his only, or perhaps his principal occupation, though it
 might be supposed that he had little leisure for any other. On the
 contrary, he diligently discharged for forty-seven years the duties of
 the director of a great national manufactory, and during the later
years of his life, he published two important works on the potter's

 art; an art which, dating from very early periods of human exist
 ence, so eminently unites the beautiful with the useful; an art
 assuming a very different appearance at Nola or Pekin, at Firenze
 or Dresden; an art which seems to mark out the kind as well as de
gree of civilization of the different nations in which it has flourished
 or declined.
   We should be mistaken, again, were we to imagine that natural
 science on the one hand and the care of the establishment of Sèvres
 on the other absorbed the whole thoughts and time of M. Brongniart.
 He took an active part in the affairs of the Institute, a zealous share
in the advancement of knowledge by scientific association, and a
lively interest in the pursuits of other inquirers after truth. He
was, says M. de Beaumont, “non seulement le savant éminent,
l'esprit supérieur, mais encore l’homme aimable, l'homme excellent,
l'honnéte homme, l’homme profondement dévoué aux plus nobles
 devoirs.”
   He became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in the year
 1815, and died at the advanced age of seventy-seven, admired, re
 spected, beloved and lamented. He has left behind him a son in
 heriting his love for science and devotion to its cause.

By James Newton Heale, Esq., Licentiate of the Royal College of
Physicians, and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.
Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
   The following abstract of this paper has been drawn up by the
author.
   The author endeavours to prove, by inductive reasoning and by
historical considerations of the earliest indication of vitality in the
egg, that motion of a fluid in a certain definite circle constitutes the
first link in the chain of causes by which vitality is perfected; that
all the other phenomena of living structure are supplementary and
superinduced upon this primary and indispensable condition; and that,
although it might be possible to maintain this primary circulation
under certain circumstances, even though all the other functions of
life were suspended or destroyed, they, on the contrary, cannot exist

230                         Royal Society.
independently of that circulation.    He shows it to be necessary to
circulation, that two fluids, or a fluid in two different states, should
communicate by two points or extremities with each other, and that
these extremities should present such a resistance to their mutual
connexion and commixion, that the transfer of conditions of each,
from one to the other, must take place, otherwise the uniformity of
both would speedily put an end to the process; and it is indicated
that the forces in operation in these two places would be reverse to
each other; in the one it would be from arterial to venous, and in
the other from venous to arterial.
    The blood-vessels containing the two kinds of blood are com
pared by the author to two bar-magnets placed side by side, the
pulmonary and systemic capillaries representing the armatures placed
 at their extremities; with this limitation, that as the changes in      •
 the blood take place only in the two opposed sets of capillaries,
 the force is necessarily generated only in them, and therefore the
 intermediate blood contained in the larger blood-vessels merely re
 presents conducting wires completing the circuit. The left side of
 the heart is viewed as being placed in the largest ampulla of the arte
 rial circulation, and the right side of the heart as being in the like
 position with respect to the venous current.
    The portal circulation is alluded to, in order to prove that a pro
 pelling force is not essential to produce circulation of blood. An
 account is given of numerous experiments on various animals, in
 which the ends of two similar wires (in some cases of copper and in
 others of platinum) were inserted; that of the one into a vein, and
 that of the other into an artery, the free ends of both wires being
 brought into connexion with a delicate galvanometer; and it was
 found that during life a galvanic current was indicated, passing along
 the artery and returning by the vein; that this current became more
 feeble in proportion as the vitality of the animal declined, and again
 more strong as the effect of the chloroform, which was administered
 for the purpose of preventing pain, subsided.
     The author also observed, that the strong action of a muscle (the
  sterno-mastoid) between the two blood-vessels tended to discharge
  the galvanic force as it was generated; and that when that muscle
  was divided, the galvanic force became much stronger. When the
  connexion of the current with the lungs was severed by a ligature
  placed on the vein between the insertion of the wire and the heart,
  the current was instantly reversed, passing up the vein and returning
  by the artery. The same reverse current was indicated when the
  wires were inserted into portions of the blood-vessels which had been
  isolated, each by two ligatures, placed the one above and the other
  below the insertion of the wires. A similar effect was also obtained,
  as long as the blood continued to coagulate, when the two kinds of
  blood were drawn from the blood-vessels into separate cups, and
  brought into connexion with the galvanometer; the blood in the cups
  being connected together by the ends of a piece of copper or of a
  strip of muscle dipping into each.
     Several experiments are related, tending to prove that the power

  which fluids, differing chemically from each other in however great
  a degree, were supposed to possess of acting chemically upon the
  copper wire, and thus generating currents, had been greatly exag
  gerated; and that much which had been attributed to this cause de
  served rather to be ascribed to the polar forces, which the fluids had
  a tendency to assume, being discharged through the copper as a
  conductor, since the same effect was produced when platinum was
  used, and in an appreciable degree even when no metal was in con
  tact with those artificial compounds, cotton moistened with water
  being only used to make the different connexions with the fluids.
     The author then traces the course of the blood in the foetus, show
  ing that the blood passes in it, throughout the body, in the direction
  wholly from artery to vein; the upper half constituting one segment,
  and the lower half of the body the other segment of the circle; and
  pointed out that, thus far, there was no antagonism of forces, and
  therefore no power of generating a galvanic current, which he indi
  cated was supplied by the smaller circle, through the placenta, join
  ing the larger circle at the vena cava, and leaving it at the hypo
  gastric arteries; the smaller circle inducing the current in the larger,
  in the same manner as the larger circle in the adult may be supposed
  to induce lesser secondary circles, as the hepatic, &c.
     The author then dilates on the importance of the galvanic current
  in physiological and pathological inquiry; pointing out the peculiar
  significance of the fact of the reverse current being established as
  soon as the direct current is impeded; the systemic capillaries being
  endowed with the power of generating a force exactly the reverse to
º
  that set up in the lungs; the rapidity of the circulation thus being,
  catteris paribus, the measure of the excess of the primary force over
  the resistance. He infers, that the galvanism found in the muscles
  owes its origin to the opposed condition of the blood in the capillary
  network which supplies each; the anastomoses of the arterial capil
  laries with each other increasing their galvanic surface, while their
  limited anastomoses with the veins supply the conditions necessary
  for the passive current. The office of conductors, for the active dis
   charge of the accumulated force, is assigned to the nerves of the
  voluntary muscles; the author believing that the circuit by which
   this is effected is, in them, prolonged up to and from the nervous
   centres; which centres are, in their turn, shown to be liberally sup
   plied with blood-vessels capable of influencing the galvanic equili
   brium. The accelerated respiration caused by increased muscular
   exertion is attributed to this cause.  It is inferred, that the involun
   tary muscles are provided with apparatus within themselves, adapted
   to regulate their periodical galvanic discharge. The mutual reaction
   of distant parts is attributed to the fact of the whole body being
   included in one galvanic circle, which cannot be disturbed in a part
   without the whole participating proportionally in the effects.

                 ON A REMARKABLE SOLAR SPOT,
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
     S I believe the perception of a solar spot by the naked eye is of
      very rare occurrence, and has even been doubted, I take the
liberty to state to you in corroboration of its truth, that I distinctly
observed a large obscuration or spot on the sun's disc with the naked
eye, appearing like a good-sized bean in shape and size, on Tuesday
last, January 25. The observation took place at 1" 30” P.M., the
sun's disc being of a blood-red colour at the time, owing to the in
tervention of a haze or fog, which enabled the eye steadily to gaze
on it. The obscured part, viewed with telescopic powers of 60 and
120, resolved itself into two large central spots, stretching in a direc
tion apparently parallel with the sun's equator, surrounded by a great
number of smaller spots, particularly on the north side. This mass
of maculae melted into the elliptical appearance seen by the naked eye.
   Perhaps in my ignorance I am overrating the rarity of this occur
rence; but as Herschel only once saw a similar spot with the naked
eye (in 1779), and I have not met with any recent accounts of such
observations, I have ventured to proffer my testimony to the truth
of the circumstance. Probably if the solar orb was more frequently
examined during a fog, more of these maculae might have been noticed.
Sunset or sunrise would also be favourable times for such observation.
                                                                         *
    The earliest account we have of the observation of solar spots (at
least in modern times) appears to be that given by Hakluyt, from
the log-book of a ship on the coast of Africa in December 1590, when
a spot appeared to the naked eye at sunset and sunrise, no doubt
owing to the denseness of the atmospheric strata diminishing the
sun's rays. The extract from the log is as follows:—“The 7th at
sunset we saw a great black spot on the sun; and on the 8th, both at
rising and setting, we saw the like, the spot appearing about the size
of a shilling.” This was before the telescopic discovery of maculae
by Galileo and others; and the spot so seen might have consisted
of a collection of spots like that now visible. Trusting that you will
excuse my addressing you for the reasons given,
                             I remain, Gentlemen,
                                          Your obedient Servant,
   Edinburgh, Jan. 27, 1848.                              W. PRINGLE.
    P.S. Perhaps I may be allowed to add, that a very striking aurora
borealis occurred here on the night of Sunday, January 16, about
twenty minutes from 10 P.M., which though not so playfully varied
in its motions or hues as that of the 24th of October, presented a very
imposing appearance from its mass and the intensity of its glare.
 It arose suddenly from the north-east, shooting rapidly up like a
 majestic pyramid of flame.    The redness resembled the reflexion of

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               233
a vast conflagration. The Great Bear appeared nearly in its centre,
occupying about half its diameter in that point, the apex reaching
to Capella, then culminating south of the zenith, round which it left
a red spot after receding towards its base. Several lighter columns
of red and orange shot up north of it. The whole gradually melted
into the usual milky haze, in about a quarter of an hour.
                                           18 Scotland Street, Edinburgh,
                                                    Feb. 9, 1848.
   Having obtained, since my last communication, corroborative tes
timony on the subject of the solar spot, I beg leave to transmit it to
you, by way of postscript. It was elicited by my having inserted
in an Edinburgh paper a paragraph stating the circumstance, and re
questing corroboration from any one who might have observed the
spot. I give it in the words of the editor :—
   “We have received several communications fully corroborating
the observations of our correspondent, published on Saturday. The
same phaenomenon was distinctly observed by John Wauchope, Esq.
of Edmonstone, who has kindly communicated to us particulars,
similar to those already noted.”—Edinburgh Evening Post, Feb. 2,
1848.
   The great point of interest and importance deducible from the
fact established, is the extraordinary enlargement of the solar spot,
thus rendering it distinctly and palpably visible to the unprotected
eye at the distance of ninety-five millions of miles. More than the
usual tremendous agencies must have been in force to have produced
so great an obscuration. Without a micrometrical observation it is,
of course, impossible to approximate to its exact dimensions; but if
the calculation be correct which assigns about 50,000 miles as the
minimum diameter required for a spot to be visible to the unaided
 eye, I should feel strongly inclined, from the space obviously occupied
by the obscuration on the solar disc, to consider it, at a rude guess,
to have been in diameter at least one-twelfth part that of the sun.
    This, however, I submit with necessary diffidence, leaving the
point to be determined by more experienced and more scientific
inquirers, some of whom may have observed the spot and measured
its dimensions. Placing these slight observations at your disposal,
                           I remain, Gentlemen,
                                      Your obedient Servant,
                                                           W. PRINGLE.
    ON THE PREPARATION AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF
                               ASPARAGIN.
   M. Piria, in order to obtain this substance, caused vetches to ve
getate in the dark, expressed the juice and evaporated it. As soon
as the liquor was near the boiling-point, an abundant deposit of co
agulated albumen was formed ; the filtered liquor was evaporated to
an almost syrupy consistence, and after standing twenty-four hours,

234          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
an abundant crystalline deposit was formed, possessing the aspect
and properties of asparagin.
   To purify these crystals they were washed with a little cold water,
then dissolved in boiling water, and on cooling, crystals were formed.
   To render these crystals perfectly white, they were again dissolved
and treated with animal charcoal, and were thus rendered extremely
fine. Forty pounds of vetches yielded about five and one-third avoir
dupois ounces of asparagin, and consequently this plant is the most
advantageous that can be employed.
   By analysis there were obtained—

   To determine whether growth without the presence of light was
réquisite to produce asparagin in vetches, some green plants were
treated in the same way; and M. Piria found, contrary to his ex
pectations, that they yielded as much asparagin as those which grew
in the dark.
   The seeds were found not to contain any asparagin, and the plants
were also examined at the commencement of flowering and during
fructification; in the former case an inappreciable trace only of as
paragin was obtained, and in the latter none whatever.
   M. Piria observes, that all the authors who have treated of aspa
ragin have regarded it either as an alkaloid, or as a neutral sub
stance, and no one as an acid. Notwithstanding the previous opi
nions on the subject, the author considers asparagin as an acid.       He
found that the expressed juice had an acid reaction, which became
stronger as it was evaporated, and that it acted upon the copper
vessel in which it was evaporated; and he found also that when as
paragin was heated with water and oxide of copper, that an azure
coloured solution was formed, which yielded a crystalline deposit of
the same colour. This compound is more readily and abundantly
formed by adding a hot concentrated solution of asparagin to one of
acetate of copper, also strong and hot.           If no immediate reaction
takes place after mixture, the liquid must be heated; and by this
there will be immediately formed a precipitate of a fine ultramarine
blue colour, and this continues to deposit during the cooling.
   This compound is nearly insoluble in cold water, but is slightly
soluble in hot, and very soluble in acids and in ammonia; when long
kept at 248°F. in a current of dry air, it loses no water; when more
strongly heated, it is decomposed with the disengagement of torrents
of ammoniacal gas. Its analysis indicated as its formula, C3H7 N° O°,
CuO.
   It follows from this, that asparagin dried at 212°F., C8H8 Nº Od
and considered as anhydrous, contains one equivalent of water capable

    To determine whether asparagin in combining with oxide of cop
per undergoes any change, a portion of the copper compound was
 decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen. The liquor from which the
 sulphuret of copper was deposited possessed a decidedly acid reaction;
when concentrated by a water-bath, the liquor deposited fine white
brilliant crystals of asparagin. The external characters of these were
 such as to remove all doubt. They were analysed, and found to be
 crystallized asparagin.
     It will then be observed that asparagin, in combining with oxide of
 copper, yields a saline compound, from which, by means of sulphuret
 ted hydrogen, asparagin possessing its usual characters may be sepa
 rated. Reckoning the copper to be in the state of oxide in this
 compound, it follows that dry asparagin contains one equivalent of
 hydrogen and one of oxygen more than combined asparagin. The
 formula of asparagin dried at 212°F. is then Cs H. Nº Oº, HO, and
 that of the salt of copper C*H" Nº O3, CuO.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys.,
 Fevrier 1848.                     -
                ON THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF ASPARAGIN.
     M. Piria having, as shown in the preceding notice, determined the
 formula of asparagin, proceeded to investigate the production of sub
 stances derived from it.
     Action of ferments.-A solution of asparagin when exposed under
  goes no change if it be pure; if, on the contrary, the crystals are
  coloured, the solution undergoes a kind of fermentation, giving rise
  to the following phaenomena.
     The liquid loses its acid reaction and becomes feebly alkaline. In
  this state it exhales the disagreeable smell of animal matter under
  going the putrid fermentation; the surface becomes covered with a
  white mucilaginous pellicle, which, examined by the microscope, is
  shown to contain numerous infusoria.        After a certain time the as
  paragin completely disappears, and succinate of ammonia is found in
  its place; or at any rate, a substance which, treated with acids, is
  decomposed into succinic acid and ammonia. In fact, if excess of
  hydrochloric acid be poured into the fermented liquor, and if it be
  evaporated by the water-bath, there remains a saline mass, which,
   treated with aether, separates into two portions, one of which is so
  luble and the other insoluble in it; the latter is entirely sal-ammo
   niac. The aethereal solution, properly evaporated, deposits an acid
   brown-coloured substance; this dissolved in water and saturated with
   ammonia, and decomposed by acetate of lead, gives a crystalline pre
   cipitate from which a white crystalline substance, possessing all the

 236               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
properties of succinic acid, may be separated by the action of sulphu
 retted hydrogen. This on analysis gave by—

   It appears, then, that impure asparagin dissolved in water and left
to itself for some time is totally converted into succinate of ammonia.
To explain this transformation, it is necessary only to compare the
two formulae—
        if from             C8H1° N2O8, succinate of ammonia,
        we subtract         C*H* Nº O', asparagin,
        there remains H+O2=2HO + H2.
   When then asparagin is converted into succinate of ammonia, it
assimilates two equivalents of water and two equivalents of hydrogen,
produced under the reductive influence of the putrefaction which
occurs in the liquid.
   This metamorphosis exhibits an important peculiarity, which has
not been observed hitherto in other transformations of organic mat
ter. The succinate of ammonia, which results from the reduction of
the asparagin, does not return to the state of asparagin under the
influence of oxidizing agents: thus it undergoes no alteration by the
most concentrated nitric acid or by chromic acid.
   M. Piria, to determine whether the nitrogenous bodies, which, by
fermentation, converted the asparagin into succinate of ammonia,
existed in the vetches themselves, added a quantity of the juice of
etiolated vetches to a moderately strong and very pure solution of
asparagin, and exposed the mixture to the air.            In a few days the
same phaenomena appeared as already described as occurring with
the impure asparagin. On examining the liquor at the expiration of
about a fortnight, a considerable quantity of perfectly white crystals
of succinic acid had separated.—Ann. de Ch. et Phys., Fevrier 1848.

   M. Robiquet examined the reaction of ammonia on chrysammic
acid. He states that at 212°F. the resulting compound is C39 Hº
N10 O23; M. Mulder did not obtain a similar result.                   The atomic
weight and oxygen of chrysammic acid do not agree with this for
mula: with l equivalent of hydrated chrysammic acid, that is to
say with C14 H4 N* O12, there is an elimination of H2O, and an ad
dition of N2 H6.
   M. Mulder has also stated that 100 parts of hydrated chrysammic

    The amide which is formed, and which the author calls chrysam
 mide, is then composed of C*H* Nº Oil.
    According to M. Robiquet, we have—
    Before the experiment, Cao Hs Nº O-0-5603:5;
    After the action of ammonia, C30 H12 N10 O25–5703.5.
    Then—
                          5603.5 : 1 12:48– 100 : a ;
                                      a = 2 Aq.
    And, on the other hand,
                          5603°5 : 5703.5 - 100 : a ;
                                        a = 102.
    It is then clear that C+ H+. Nº Otº loses HºO and gains Nº Hº,
and that the composition of chrysammide, which M. Robiquet calls
chrysammanic acid, is actually C14H4N2O"+Nº H+. Analysis con
firmed these results.

   Chrysammide combines with bases and exhibits many important
reactions, the examination of which is continued by M. Mulder.
   The chrysolepic acid of M. Schunck is merely nitropicric acid.
It is a substance the examination of which is very dangerous, on
account of the violence with which its compounds with bases ex
plode.
   The above-stated analyses of chrysammic acid associate this sub
stance to anilic, nitropicric and nitrophenic acids.

    An excess of ammonia decomposes chrysammic acid when heated
in the same manner as the fixed alkalies, and renders it brown.—

XXXVI. An Account of the Speculations of Thomas Wright
               of Durham. By Prof. DE MoRGAN”.
          ARAGO, in his account of William Herschel, pub
        * lished in the Paris Annuaire for 1842, recalled the
 attention of astronomers to the fact that some speculative
 researches into the constitution of the stellar universe had
 preceded those of his illustrious subject. He instances Wright,
 Kant and Lambert, from the second of whom he draws all his
 information as to the first. Professor Struve, in his recently
 published Etudes d’Astronomie Stellaire, St. Petersburg, 1847,
 8vo, again mentions Wright from Kant, and gives the titles
 of his works from Lalande. But neither Kant, Arago, nor
 Struve, had seen the work of Wright in question. I pro
 pose to give an account of it, as of a speculation which
 inust take a high rank among those daring and yet sober
 attempts at prediction of future results, which are, and ought
 to be, repaid upon success for the contempt with which
 they are always received on appearance. The author did
 not, as speculators sometimes do, attempt to discount his
fame, and to procure an endorsement of good names for a bill
of long date upon posterity. He published his work in a
quiet way, and left time to show what it was worth.
    The worki in question is entitled Theory of the Universe,
   * Communicated by the Author.                                       -

242 Prof. De Morgan's Account of the Speculations
 and was published in 1750, Kant, as appears by Professor
 Struve's statement, took his knowledge of it from the Ham
burgische Freie Urtheile of 1751, and wrote on the same sub
ject in his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Him
mels, Leipzig, 1755, 8vo. As far as I can see from Professor
 Struve's description of Kant's views, there is not in them any
extension of Wright's, except in two points, which I shall
notice in the proper place.
    Wright's work consists of nine letters to a friend, and in its
speculations is both astronomical and theological; the latter
term including not merely expression of devotional feeling,
but much actual conjecture on what astronomy may teach in
relation to the future state of mankind. Omitting this, I shall
proceed to register the purely astronomical doctrines of the
treatise, so far as they seem peculiar to Wright.
   I make one long extract from the seventh letter, which might
have been shortened, and the English of it made more clear
and more correct, with no loss to Wright's memory. But as
this passage is very important as evidence, and is unquestion
ably, out of the whole book, that which most nearly contains
the pith and marrow of the system, I have thought it best to
extract the whole of it.
   In the preface it is stated that the chief design is “an At
tempt towards solving the Phaenomena of the Via Lactea, and
in consequence of that Solution, the framing of a regular and
rational Theory of the known Universe, before unattempted
by any.” It is “. . . . entirely upon a new Plan, and the Begin
ning, as it were, of a new Science, before unattempted in any
Language, the Author having dug all his Ideas from the
Mines of Nature. ....” And further, “How the Author has
succeeded in this Point, is a Question of no great Conse
quence; he has certainly done his best; another, no Doubt,
will do better, and a third perhaps, by some more rational
Hypothesis, may perfect this Theory, and reduce the Whole
to infallible Demonstration : ....”
   The claim which Wright makes to originality will easily be
admitted; and his priority must remain uncontested until it
can be impugned upon evidence. At present, neither Arago
nor Struve have met with anything of the same kind anterior
to Wright.
   In the first letter Wright gives the opinions of preceding
authors. He states that his own system was first planned in
1734. I need not describe his very imperfect enumeration of
his predecessors. In 1732, Robert Wright, whom I ought to
mention to prevent his being confounded with the subject of
this notice, published his Newtonian lunar tables for the navy.

                of Thomas Wright of Durham.                  243
   The second letter is on probability and certainty, and,
though ingenious and sound, has nothing to the present pur
pose. It concludes with an account of celestial systems ante
rior to that of Copernicus.
   The third letter is on the planetary motions and structures.
It contains nothing peculiar to Wright, except a declaration
that he is strongly of opinion that the orbits of comets have
all their areas equal. This is not a happy conjecture. He
draws the notion from observing that the comets of 1680 and
1682, the most and least excentric of those whose orbits had
been calculated, have areas not very unequal, and such as a
supposition of moderate errors of observation might make
equal. The following sentence is of a better kind, be the latter
part worth what it may. “.... the Clouds are to us in effect
no other than as so many Moons, whereby we have our arti
ficial Day prolonged to us several Hours after the Sun is
set, and likewise produced as much sooner before he rises;
and were they to ascend by still stronger Power of Exhalation
to an Elevation, all round the Atmosphere, so as to form a
Sphere equal to four Times the Globe of the Earth, there
would then be no such Thing as real nocturnal Darkness to
any Part of the World.”
   The fourth letter continues his remarks on the nature of the
heavenly bodies. That the sun is a vast body of blazing mat
ter, he thinks will hardly admit of question: though he after
wards supposes it possible that the igneous matter may be only
an envelope. Aberration is spoken of with caution. “Mr.
Bradley, Astronomer-Royal, has, in a great measure, proved
that the Aberration of the Stars hitherto mistaken for a Pa
rallax, may arise from, and indeed seems to be no other than
the progressive Motion of Light, and Change of Place to the
Eye, arising from the Earth's annual Motion and Direction.”
His friend is recommended to procure an idea of the appear
ance of the sun to more distant planets than our own, by
means of concave glasses fitted to reduce the apparent dia
meter duly. The homogeneity of the stars with our sun, both
as to constitution and attendant bodies, is strongly insisted on
from analogy.
   The fifth letter first mentions the milky way, which he says
“.... still continues to be unaccounted for, and even in an
Age vain enough to boast Astronomy in its utmost Perfection.
What will you say, if I tell you, it is my belief we are so far
from the real Summit of the Science, that we scarce yet know
the Rudiments of what may be expected from it? This lumi
nous Circle has often engrossed my Thoughts, and of late has
taken up all my idle Hours;     *".
                                  2
                                    I am now in great Hopes I

244      Prof. De Morgan's Account of the Speculations
have not only at last found out the real Cause of it, but also
by the same Hypothesis, which solves this Appearance, shall
be able to demonstrate a much more rational Theory of the
Creation than hitherto has been any where advanced, and at
the same Time give you an entire new Idea of the Universe, or
infinite System of Things.” The milky way is then described,
and the opinions of the ancients upon it. A plate is given of
a portion near the foot of Antinous, as observed by Wright
himself with what he calls a very good reflector: the plan
 was formed “by a Combination of Triangles.” He after
 wards mentions his observing with a “one Foot reflecting
 Telescope.” Proceeding on the opinion of Democritus and
 others among the ancients, and on his own partial resolution of
 the galactic light, he pronounces the phaenomenon to arise from
 a congeries of small stars. He does not seem to be acquainted
 with the partial resolution made by Galileo: and in general,
 his reading in astronomy anterior to his own day seems to lie
 rather in classical or mediaeval authors, or their translators
 and compilers, than in those of the seventeenth century.
    Making the assumption that the stars shine by their own
 light, he proceeds thus: “Here it will not be amiss to observe,
 that it has been conjectured, and is strongly suspected, that a
 proper Number of Rays, meeting from different Directions,
 become Flame; and that hence it may prove not the Sun's real
 Body which we daily see, but only his inflamed Atmosphere.
 I begin to be of Opinion, and I think not without Reason, that
 the true Magnitude of the Sun is not near what the modern
 Astronomers have made it; and that it may not possibly be
 much above two Thirds of what it appears to us; ..... This,
 tho' I presume to call it at present only meer Hypothesis,
 will in a great measure account for the excessive Changes in
 the Constitution of our Air and Atmosphere, which we often
 find very unnatural to the Season; .... But all this will very
 naturally be accounted for by the Levity, or expanding Qua
 lity of the Sun's circumambient Flame, or Atmosphere; and
 hence, according to its various State, being more condensed,
 or rare, we may have Heat or Cold in the greatest Extream,
 and alternately so, in a perpetual Vicissitude.”               -
    Wright then proceeds to estimate the number of stars in
 the milky way, and to discuss the question of the distance of
 stars from our sun. Making the distance of one star from
 another at least about three thousand times that of the furthest
 planet from our sun, he argues that “.... as no sensible Dis
 order can be observed amongst the solar Planets, what Reason
 have we to suppose any can be occasioned amongst the Stars,
 or that a general Motion of these primary Luminaries round

                 of Thomas Wright of Durham.                          245
a common Center, should be any way irrational, or unna
tural?”
   The sixth letter is headed ‘ Of General Motion amongst
the Stars, the Plurality of Systems, and Innumerability of
Worlds.” That the stars are not promiscuously dispersed, he
argues from the phaenomenon of the milky way, supposed to
be resolvable into stars. He then proceeds to say, “If an
regular Order of the Stars then can be demonstrated that will
naturally prove this Phaenomenon to be no other than a cer
tain Effect arising from the Observer's Situation, I think you
must of course grant such a Solution at least rational, if not
the Truth; and this is what I propose by my new Theory.”
Afterwards he adds, “.... we may reasonably expect, that
the Via Lactea, which is a manifest Circle amongst the Stars,
conspicuous to every Eye, will prove at last the Whole [crea
tion] to be together a vast and glorious regular Production of
 Beings, .... and that all its Irregularities are only such as na
turally arise from our excentric View: To demonstrate which
absolutely and incontestibly, we shall only want this one Pos
tulata to be granted, viz. that all the Stars are, or may be in
Motion.” From thence, presuming the stars to have each its
attendant system, and arguing that the motion of each primary
itself is no more extraordinary than the motion about its axis
(which the sun has), he proceeds to discuss the evidence, as
it then existed, for apparent proper motion, and considers
such a phaenomenon established by various instances, and
particularly by Arcturus, from comparison with old observa
tions, after allowance for the varying obliquity of the ecliptic.
He then recommends close observation of the distances be
tween each two stars in a cluster, for detection of the proper
motions, and ends this letter with an engraving of the Pleiades,
laid down from his own observations.                            -
   The seventh letter gives the explanation of the phaeno
menon of the milky way, as now generally, received. The
following are the first words in which this explanation was ever
offered, as it turns out. “But of this I have said enough,
and think it is now more than Time to attempt the remaining
Part of my Theory.
   “When we reflect upon the various Aspects, and perpetual
Changes of the Planets, both with regard to their" heliocen
tric and geocentric Motion, we may readily imagine, that
nothing but a like excentric Position of the Stars could any
way produce such an apparently promiscuous Difference in
   * “Not to mention their several Conjunctions and Apulces to fixed Stars,
&c. see the State of the Heavens in 1662, December the first, when all the
 known Planets were in one Sign of the Zodiac, viz. Sagittarius.”

 246     Prof. De Morgan's Account of the Speculations
 such otherwise regular Bodies. And that in like manner, as
 the Planets would, if viewed from the Sun, there may be one
 Place in the Universe to which their Order and primary Mo
 tions must appear most regular and most beautiful. Such a
 Point, Imay presume,is not unnatural to be supposed, although
 hitherto we have not been able to produce any absolute Proof
 of it. See Plate XXV. This is the great Order of Nature,
 which I shall now endeavour to prove, and thereby solve the
 Phaenomena of the Via Lactea; and in order thereto, I want
 nothing to be granted but what may easily be allowed, namely,
 that the Milky Way is formed of an infinite Number of small
 Stars.
    “Let us imagine a vast infinite Gulph, or Medium, every
 Way extended like a Plane, and inclosed between two Sur
 faces, nearly even on both Sides, but of such a Depth or
 Thickness as to occupy a Space equal to the double Radius,
 or Diameter of the visible Creation, that is to take in one of
the smallest Stars each Way, from the middle Station, per
 pendicular to the Plane's Direction, and, as near as possible,
according to our Idea of their true Distance.
    “But to bring this Image a little lower, and as near as pos
sible level to every Capacity, I mean such as cannot conceive
this kind of continued Zodiac, let us suppose the whole Frame
of Nature in the Form of an artificial Horizon of a Globe, I
don’t mean to affirm that it really is so in Fact, but only state
the Question thus, to help your Imagination to conceive more
aptly what I would explain. Plate XXIII. will then repre
sent a just Section of it. Now in this Space let us imagine
all the Stars scattered promiscuously, but at such an adjusted
Distance from one another, as to fill up the whole Medium
with a kind of regular Irregularity of Objects. And next let
us consider what the Consequence would be to an Eye situated
near the Center Point, or any where about the middle Plane,
as at the point A. Is it not, think you, very evident, that the
Stars would there appear promiscuously dispersed on each
Side, and more and more inclining to Disorder, as the Ob
                    B                        F
           D        A           H
             E      C                -       G
server would advance his Station towards either Surface, and
nearer to B or C, but in the Direction of the general Plane
towards H or D, by the continual Approximation of the visual
Rays, crowding together as at H, betwixt the Limits D and

                 of Thomas Wright of Durham.                 247
G, they must infallibly terminate in the utmost Confusion?
If your Opticks fails you before you arrive at these external
Regions, only imagine how infinitely greater the Number of
Stars would be in those remote Parts, arising thus from their
continual crowding behind one another, as all other objects do
towards the Horizon Point of their Perspective, which ends
but with Infinity: Thus, all their Rays at last so near uniting,
must meeting in the Eye appear, as almost, in Contact, and
form a perfect Zone of Light; this I take to be the real Case,
and the true Nature of our Milky Way, and all the Irregu
larity we observe in it at the Earth, I judge to be intirely
owing to our Sun's Position in this great Firmament, and may
easily be solved by his Excentricity, and the Diversity of Mo
tion that may naturally be conceived amongst the stars them
selves, which may here and there, in different Parts of the
Heavens, occasion a cloudy Knot of Stars, as perhaps at E.
   “But now to apply this Hypothesis to our present Purpose,
and reconcile it to our Ideas of a circular Creation, and the
known Laws of orbicular Motion, so as to make the Beauty
and Harmony of the Whole consistent with the visible Order
of its Parts, our Reason must now have recourse to the Ana
logy of Things. It being once agreed, that the Stars are in
Motion, which, as I have endeavoured in my last Letter to shew
is not far from an undeniable Truth, we must next consider in
what Manner they move. First then, to suppose them to move
in right Lines, you know is contrary to all the Laws and Prin
ciples we at present know of; and since there are but two
 Ways that they can possibly move in any natural Order, that is
either in right Lines, or in Curves, this being one, it must of
course be the other, i. e. in an Orbit; and consequently, were
we able to view them from their middle Position, as from the
Eye seated in the Center of Plate XXV. we might expect to
find them separately moving in all manner of Directions round
a general Center, such as is there represented.     It only now
remains to show how a Number of Stars, so disposed in a cir
cular Manner round any given Center, may solve the Phae
momena before us. There are but two Ways possible to be
proposed by which it can be done, and one of which I think
is highly probable; but which of the two will meet your Ap
probation, I shall not venture to determine, only here inclosed
I intend to send you both. The first is in the Manner I have
above described, i. e. all moving the same Way, and not much
deviating from the same Plane, as the Planets in their helio
centric Motion do round the solar Body. In this Case the
Wrimary, secondary, and tertiary constituent Orbits, &c. fra
ming the Hypotheses, are represented in Plate XXII, and

248      Prof. De Morgan's Account of the Speculations
the Consequence of such a Theory arising from such a uni
versal Law of Motion in Plate XXIII. where B, D denotes
the local Motion of the Sun in the true Orbis Magnus, and
E, C that of the Earth in her proper secondary Orbit, which
of course is supposed, as is shown in the Figure to change its
sidereal Positions, in the same Manner as the Moon does
round the Earth, and consequently will occasion a kind of
Procession, or annual Variation in the Place of the Sun, not
unlike that of the Equinoxes, or Motion of all the Stars
together, from West to East round the Ecliptic Poles, and
probably may in some Degree be the Occasion of it. This
Angle is represented, but much magnified, by the lines F, C,
 G, and the Unnaturalness, or Absurdity of a right Line Mo
tion of the Sun by the Line I, H.
   “The second Method of solving this Phaenomena, is by a
spherical Order of the Stars, all moving with different Direc
tion round one common Center, as the Planets and Comets
together do round the Sun, but in a kind of Shell, or concave
 Orb. The former is easily conceived, from what has been
already said, and the latter is as easy to be understood, if you
have any Idea of the Segment of a Globe, which the adjacent
 Figures, will, I hope, assist you to. The Doctrine of these
 Motions will perhaps be made very obvious to you, by inspect
 ing the following Plates. Plate XXIV. Is a Representation of
 the Convexity, if I may call it so, of the intire Creation, as a
 universal Coalition of all the Stars consphered round one
 general Center, and as all governed by one and the same Law.
 Plate XXV. Is a centeral Section of the same, with the Eye
 of Providence seated in the Center, as in the virtual Agent of
 Creation. Plate XXVI. Represents a Creation of a double
 Construction, where a superior Order of Bodies C, may be ima
 gined to be circumscribed by the former one A, as possessing
 a more eminent Seat, and nearer the supream Presence, and
 consequently of a more perfect Nature. Lastly, Plate XXVII.
 Represents such a Section, and Segments of the same, as I
 hope will give you a perfect Idea of what I mean by such a
 Theory. Fig. i. is a corresponding Section of the Part at A,
 in Fig. 2, whose versed Sine is equal to half the Thickness of
 the starry Vortice AC, or B.A. Now I say, by supposing the
 Thickness of this Shell, 1. you may imagine the middle Semi
 Chord AD, or AE, to be nearly 6; and consequently, thus in
 a like regular Distribution of the Stars, there must of course
 be at least three Times as many to be seen in this Direction
 of the Sine, or Semi-chord AE, itself, than in that of the semi
 versed Sine AC, or where near the Direction of the Radius
of the space G. Q.E.D.                                     -

                of Thomas Wright of Durham.                -      249
    “But we are not confined by this Theory to this Form only,
there may be various Systems of Stars, as well as Planets, and
differing probably as much in their Order and Distribution
as the Zones of Jupiter do from the Rings of Saturn, it is not
at all necessary, that every collective Body of Stars should
move in the same Direction, or after the same Model of Mo
tion, but may as reasonably be supposed as much to vary, as
we find our Planets and Comets do.
    “Hence we may imagine some Creations of Stars may move
in the Direction of perfect Spheres, all variously inclined,
direct and retrograde; others again, as the primary Planets
do, in a general Zone or Zodiac, or more properly in the man
ner of Saturn's Rings, nay, perhaps Ring within Ring, to a
third or fourth Order, as shown in Plate XXVIII. nothing
being more evident, than that if all the Stars we see moved in
one vast Ring, like those of Saturn, round any central Body,
or Point, the general Phaenomena of our Stars would be solved
by it; see Plate XXIX. Fig. 1. and 2. the one representing
a full Plane of these Motions, the other a Profile of them, and
a visible Creation at B and C, the central Body A, being
supposed as incognitum, without the finite View; not only the
Phaenomena of the Milky Way may be thus accounted for,
but also all the cloudy Spots, and irregular Distribution of
them; and I cannot help being of Opinion, that could we view
Saturn thro' a Telescope capable of it, we should find his
 Rings no other than an infinite Number of lesser Planets, in
 ferior to those we call his Satellites: What inclines me to
believe it, is this, this Ring, or Collection of small Bodies,
appears to be sometimes very excentric, that is, more distant
from Saturn's Body on one Side than on the other, and as
visibly leaving a larger Space between the Body and the Ring;
 which would hardly be the Case, if the Ring, or Rings, were
 connected, or solid, since we have good Reason to suppose,
 it would be equally attracted on all Sides by the Body of Sa
 turn, and by that means preserve everywhere an equal Di
 stance from him; but if they are really little Planets, it is clearly
 demonstrable from our own in like Cases, that there may be
 frequently more of them on one Side, than on the other, and
 but very rarely, if ever, an equal Distribution of them all
 round the Saturnian Globe.                                            -
     “How much a Confirmation of this is to be wished, your
 own Curiosity may make you judge, and here I leave it for the
 Opticians to determine. I shall content myself with observing
 that Nature never leaves us without a sufficient Guide to con
 duct us through all the necessary Paths of Knowledge; and
 it is far from absurd to suppose Providence may have every

250 Prof. De Morgan's Account of the Speculations
where throughout the whole Universe, interspersed Modules
of every Creation, as our Divines tell us, Man is the Image
of God himself.
   “Thus, Sir, you have had my full Opinion, without the least
Reserve, concerning the visible Creation, considered as Part
of the finite Universe; how far I have succeeded in my de
signed Solution of the Via Lactea, upon which the Theory of
the Whole is formed, is a Thing will hardly be known in the
present Century, as in all probability it may require some
Ages of Observation to discover the Truth of it.”
   The eighth and ninth letters, which are on the modes of
conceiving space and time, and contain general reflections on
the whole scheme, contain nothing which need be quoted.
Wright seems to have been the first who started the idea of
representing the solar system by selected objects on the earth.
Representing the sun by the dome of St. Pauls, a sphere of
eighteen inches diameter at Marylebone will be the earth, and
so on. There is internal evidence that these letters were
written in London.
   I should sum up by saying that Wright appears to have
been a man of great ingenuity, and of moderate learning, of a
strong turn for the invention of hypothesis, and great power
of appreciating its probability. He had a firm persuasion that
astronomical discovery was then very imperfect, both in quan
tity and quality, a persuasion which regulated even his ordi
nary expressions. It is not often, in his day, that we find, as
in his works, the planets described as the known planets, im
plying an assumption that there might be more. He gave the
theory of the milky way which is now considered as established,
contended for what is now called the central sun, inclining
strongly to the belief of an actual central body, though he
sometimes qualifies it by stating the alternative of a central
body or a central point. He contends for the probability of
different creations of the kind of which the milky way is one;
but he does not seem to have known of more than half a dozen
nebulae, and he does not push his views so far as to conjecture
that these “cloudy spots” are themselves other such creations:
he rather refers them to condensations occurring in the mass
of stars to which our sun belongs. His prediction of the ulti
mate resolution of Saturn's rings into congeries of small satel
lites remains to be verified; but it is thought by some to be
most probable that such is the truth. It is hardly necessary
to say that Wright supposes mutual gravitation to be the
connecting agent between star and star, as well as between
stars and their planets.
   Kant adds to what he probably learnt from the review of

                 of Thomas Wright of Durham.                 251
Wright, the distinct supposition that the nebulae are other
specimens of constellative systems, and that these systems,
with our own, may be but parts of a larger one, and so on.
He also declares for Sirius as the central body of our system.
Wright considers Sirius merely as our nearest neighbour.
   There is an account of Thomas Wright (with a good por
trait) in the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1793, vol. lxiii. pp. 9,
126, 213. He was born at Byer’s Green, about six miles
from the city of Durham, September 22, 1711, the son of a
carpenter, a small landholder. He was apprenticed to a
clock-maker, then went to sea, and afterwards struggled for
many years as a maker of almanacs, a lecturer, and a teacher
of mathematics. During this time he published some works.
At last he seems to have risen into note as a teacher of the
sciences in noble families; and we find him in affluence to
wards the end of his life, but how it came is not stated. He
built himself a handsome house at Byer’s Green in 1756–62,
and died there February 25, 1786. By various communica
tions made by him to the Gentleman's Magazine from 1744
upwards, it appears that he was an observer, particularly of
comets, a calculator of their elements, &c. In his younger
days he was employed by Heath and Sisson as a maker of
mathematical instruments; and he wrote on navigation and
taught it with a reputation which procured him, in 1742, an
offer of the professorship of navigation in the Imperial Aca
demy of St Petersburg. He was moreover an engraver, and
even executed the plates for some of his own works; and as
the one which I have described has so many quarto plates,
effectively done in mezzotinto, and without the name of any
engraver attached, I conclude, in spite of “by the best masters”
in the title-page, they are of Wright's own workmanship. He
had some acquired scholarship, but not of a very profound
Cast.                                     -
   I learn from Professor Chevallier, of the University of
Durham, to whom I am indebted for the references to the Gen
tleman's Magazine, that when the library of Mr. Allan of Dar
lington, the author of the memoir cited, was sold by auction
in London in 1822, it contained, as the memoir states, the ori
ginal copper of several of Wright's plates. And further, that
Wright appears to have been consulted on matters of taste :
for that in the chapter library of Durham there is a design by
him for some alterations in the Cathedral, including an orna
mented battlement with finials upon the western towers; which
design was carried into execution, as is to be seen.
      he works by Wright which are mentioned in the memoir,
are some calculations of eclipses (single leaves, I suppose,

252          Mr. R. Hunt on the supposed Influence of
descriptive of the phases, after the manner of the time); the
Pannauticon, a work on navigation, published in 1734; Lou
thiana, a work on the antiquities of Ireland, of which one
volume only was published in 1748; the treatise described in
this article; and others which I do not note, as according to
a common fashion of biographical memoirs, there is a con
fusion between works “completed ” and works printed and
published. Lalande mentions The Use of the Globes, Lon
don, 1740, 8vo; Clavis Caelestis, being the explication of a
diagram entitled A Synopsis of the Universe. ... London,
1742, 4to; and the work above described.
    It seems to me that Wright is entitled to have his specula
tions considered, not as the accident of a mind which must give
the rein to imagination, and sometimes get into a right path,
but as the justifiable research and successful conclusion of
thought founded on both knowledge and observation. And
I submit that his name ought to be enrolled in the list of dis
COWerers.

XXXVII. On the supposed Influence of Magnetism on Chemical
                 Action. By RoberT HUNT, Esq.                -
                       To Richard Phillips, Esq.
       DEAR SIR,
THE         question whether magnetism exerts any influence on
       chemical phaenomena, has for a very considerable period
 agitated the world of science. On the one hand, we find Von
 Arnim, J. W. Ritter, Ludicke, Maschmann, Hansteen,
 Schweigger, Döbereiner, Muller, Kastner, Fresnel, Murray,
 Rendu, Zantedeschi, and Ampère expressing opinions, derived
 from their observations, that some influence is exerted, in
 many cases retarding, and in others accelerating chemical
 action; while one or two of these observers assert that mag
 netism has even the power of setting up chemical change.
 On the other hand, Steinhäuser, Erman, Dulk, Wetzlar, Otto
 Linné Erdman, Berzelius, Ridolfi, Nobili and Wartmann”,
 state that they have not been enabled to detect any such influ
 ence, although they have employed magnets of great power in
 their experiments.
     It is evident, from this array of names, that the question is
 surrounded with considerable difficulties; and it becomes
    * Third Memoir on Induction by Prof. Elie Wartmann, Phil. Mag, for
 April, 1847, p. 264,                     -           -    -

                 Magnetism on Chemical Action.               253
therefore the more important to settle it with certainty, either
one way or the other, if possible.
   It is only honest that I should state, that the results of all
my earlier experiments led me to believe that magnetism ex
erted a retarding influence upon chemical action; and under
this impression, having made some hundreds of experiments,
I submitted a communication to the Royal Society, which I
afterwards withdrew, from the circumstance that under some
new modifications of these experiments I obtained many ex
ceedingly contradictory results.
   It may be imagined that careless manipulation, or the inter
ference of other influences which should have been guarded
against, must have been the cause of this want of uniformity.
I am unwilling to admit this; and although I feel confident
that I have established clearly, in some recent experiments,
the fact that magnetism exerts no influence on the chemical
action set up, I can only explain the very decided results
which crowd the pages of my note-book, and which deceived
such men as Hansteen, Fresnel and Ampère, on the sup
position that there exists some molecular forces with which
we are not yet acquainted, but which are most sensibly af
 fected by several of the elementary forces, and consequently
determine the intensity of chemical excitement. In no other
way will the phaenomena admit of explanation, which I have
again and again witnessed, when iron wires were placed in
solutions of litmus, of sulphate of copper, of sulphuric acid,
&c., and arranged in different orders in reference to the mag
netic equator, or disposed in various relations as regards
powerful permanent magnets and electro-magnets.
   I do not deem it advisable to occupy the pages of the Phi
losophical Magazine with any description of these experiments
at the present time, particularly, as I intend to pursue the in
 vestigation in the hope of elucidating its involved phaenomena.
 I desire only to call attention to a form of experiment, which
 appears to me to be most unobjectionable, and which I think
 we may regard as an experimentum crucis.
    The conditions which I thought essential to the accurate
 solution of this question were the following:—                  -
    I. A correct measure of the amount of chemical action.
    2. Means of determining if the action was constant and
 unvarying.
    3. The power of bringing the whole under magnetic influ
 ence without in any way disturbing the arrangement, or bring
 ing any other forces besides magnetism into action.
    This was effected in the following manner:—A soft iron
 wire (a), which previously to the experiment was ascertained

254        Mr. R. Hunt on the supposed Influence of
not to possess polarity, was placed in a glass tube, around
which was wound four or six coils of copper wire carefully
covered with sealing-wax. Thus arranged, it was placed in
a vessel holding diluted sulphuric acid (D), and another wire,
sometimes of copper and sometimes of iron (b), being placed in
the same solution, both were connected by long copper wires
with a galvanometer (E), placed at such a distance as to be
entirely removed from the influence of magnetic attraction.
One wire from the helix was connected with a pole of a gal
vanic battery (F), consisting of one or more pairs of plates, the
other wire being so placed that the circuit could be readily
made or broken. This arrangement being completed, every
thing was so secured that the wires in the electrolyte should
not suffer the slightest disturbance when connection was made
or broken between the helix and the battery.
   It is evident by this means, a very delicate galvanometer
being used, that I secured a most accurate measurer of the
chemical action excited by the acid and the iron wire; that I
had the power of rendering the iron magnetic at pleasure, and
of using any amount of force I thought proper.
   An iron and a copper wire being immersed in the electro
lyte, the astatic needles of the galvanometer were allowed to
come to absolute rest, and the permanent deflection observed.
The circuit with the battery through the helix was now com
pleted, and consequently, by induction, the iron rendered
powerfully magnetic. In every instance, upon either making
or breaking connection, the needle of the galvanometer vi
brated from 8° to 5°, but steadily returned to its permanent
deflection, as previously noted.
   This transient disturbance of the needle arose from the pas
sage of an induced current through the electrolyte, and by the
wires to the galvanometer, and was evidently not at all due to
any magnetic influence. It was a case precisely similar to the

                 Magnetism on Chemical Action.              255
following one, mentioned by Dr. Faraday in his Experimental
 ... 1st series, par. 20.
  “When a small voltaic arrangement was introduced into
the circuit between the galvanometer and its helix or wire so
as to cause a permanent deflection of 30° or 40°, and then the
battery of one hundred pairs of plates connected with the in
ducing wire, there was an instantaneous action as before; but
the galvanometer-needle immediately resumed and retained its
place unaltered, notwithstanding the continued contact of the
inducing wire with the trough: such was the case in which
ever way the contacts were made.”
   The direction of the current through the helix was altered,
so that sometimes the north pole was in the solution and some
times the south pole; but no difference was observed upon
the galvanometer-needle.
   Bunsen's battery was the one employed, and from one to
six pairs were used; but the increased power did not make
the slightest difference. In every experiment the iron wire
was changed; for it was found that it became, when magnet
ized thus, being at the same time under the influence of che
mical excitement, more permanently polar than electro-mag
nets do ordinarily.
   When two iron wires were employed, one of them was
almost invariably found to be positive to the other when they
were first plunged into the dilute acid; but after some short
time they were more equally influenced: and although the
deflection may at first have been 20° or 30°, yet the galvano
meter-needle slowly returned to zero, or at most indicated only
a deflection of 2° or 3°. It certainly was expected that mag
netism would render one wire positive to the other in a much
more decided manner; but no such effect could be detected
in any one of a great number of experiments; the transient
tremor being the only influence observed upon the needle
when the helix was connected with the battery or disconnected
from it.
   It was thought possible, and indeed some previous experi
ments with permanent magnets led me to the conclusion, that
two magnets of equal power being placed in the solution, one
with its north pole and the other with its south pole immersed,
would give some indication of a current, arising from a differ
ence in the chemical action upon them. With this view two
helices were prepared, and arranged in the vessel D so that
both of the iron wires a b could be rendered magnetic at the
same time. Not any indication could be obtained with the
galvanometer, nor could any deflection be observed even when
the electro-magnetic influence was considerably different upon
the two wires,

256                  The Rev. B. Bronwin on a
   With the view of ascertaining if any diamagnetic conditions
could be induced which would in any way influence chemical
change, wires of copper and of zinc were substituted for those
of iron; but in no case was any deflection produced upon the
needle of the galvanometer which could be at all attributable
to magnetic influence.
   From these experiments, which of course have no bearing
upon the disposition of crystals, or the direction of bodies free
to move near the poles of magnets, I am compelled, notwith
standing my former impressions, to conclude that MAGNETISM
has no direct influence upon this form of cHEMICAL ACTion
either as an accelerating or a retarding agent.

              tion. By the Rev. BRICE BRoN win *.
   N the seventh Number, new series, of the Cambridge Ma
      thematical Journal, Mr. Boole gave a solution of a par
ticular differential equation, having for its coefficients certain
integral functions of w. The object of this paper is to show
that it admits of an infinite number of solutions; or rather,
that an infinite number of equations may be solved by it, and
those equations not necessarily having integer coefficients.

XXXIX. Researches on the Radiations of Incandescent Bodies,
    and on the Elementary Colours of the Solar Spectrum. By
    M. MELLONI*.
AMQNG             the more recent scientific publications will be
         found a memoir by the American Professor, J. W.
Draper, On the Production of Light by Heath, which appears
to me to merit the attentive consideration of those who interest
themselves in the progress of the natural sciences. The author
treats, in a very ingenious manner, some questions allied to
my own researches on light and radiant heat. In reading this
interesting work several ideas have presented themselves to
 me, which I have submitted to the test of experiment. I be
lieve that an analysis of the memoir of Mr. Draper, accom
panied with a brief account of what I have done, will not be
 without interest to the readers of this journal.                      -
     Every one knows that heat, when it accumulates in bodies,
 at last renders them incandescent; that is to say, more or less
 luminous and visible in the dark.          Is the temperature neces
 sary to produce this state of incandescence always the same,
 or does it vary with the nature of the body? In either case
 what is its degree? and what is the succession of coloured
 lights emitted by a given substance, when brought to tempe
 ratures more and more elevated? . . Finally, what is the rela
 tion that subsists at different periods of incandescence between
 the temperature and the quantity of light and of heat emitted
 by a body?
     To solve these different questions, of which some have been
 already studied by other philosophers, Professor Draper has
 made use of an instrument composed of a strip of platina ig
 nited by the action of a voltaic current. The strip was vertical,
  its length one inch and one-third, its width the twentieth of
  an inch, and its upper extremity being fastened to a firm sup
  port, it was kept stretched by a little weight furnished with a
  copper wire, that dipped into some mercury placed in a cup

   and on the Elementary Colours of the Solar Spectrum. 268
below. The electric circuit was established by placing the
mercury and the upper extremity of the platina strip in com
munication with the poles of a Grove's battery, of which the
force, properly moderated by a Wheatstone's rheostat, could
be kept constant for about an hour. By means of this ar
rangement, the strip of platina, more or less ignited by the
action of the voltaic current, preserved its rectilinear direction;
the copper wire which was fastened to the weight merely dip
ping more or less deeply into the mercury. To determine
the dilatations of the strip, there was attached to its free ex
tremity a long and very slender horizontal lever, arranged in
such a manner that the point of attachment was very near one
of the extremities of the lever which worked upon a pivot, and
the other end traversed over a divided scale, taking a position
more or less oblique to the horizon as the weight and wire
descended by the dilatation of the strip, and indicating on the
graduated arc the quantities sought.
    The temperatures were then calculated on the hypothesis
that they were proportional to the dilatation of the platinum,
employing for this purpose the coefficient of Dulong and Petit.
It will be understood that these calculations are easily made
when we know the length of the strip and of the lever, and
also the position of their point of attachment. In the instru
ment employed by Draper, each degree on the graduated arc
corresponded to an elevation of 115° F. above the temperature
of the air.               -
    Suppose, now, we commence by using a feeble current, the
force of which is gradually increased by means of the rheostat.
The heat correspondingly augments in the strip, and finally
makes it visibly red-hot in the dark room in which the expe
riment is to be conducted. The degree that the index marks
is then to be observed. This experiment was repeated several
times, and with the aid of different persons (who ought to
remain for some time in the dark for their eyes to acquire a
due sensibility), and from the mean of all the observations the
temperature at which the platina began to be red-hot was cal
culated. From the experiments of our author this tempera
ture is 97.7° F.
    To determine whether all substances become red-hot at the
same degree of heat, Professor Draper took a gun-barrel, the
touch-hole of which was closed, and placed in it successively
platina, copper, gas carbon, lead, earthenware, and other sub
stances; then, making the barrel red-hot in the fire, he ob
 served attentively the moment when the incandescence com
 menced to manifest itself in the barrel, and the substance which
 it contained.   He could discover no difference of time between
 the two  phaenomena; for the gun-barrel and the substance

264    M. Melloni on the Radiations of Incandescent Bodies,
under trial became simultaneously luminous as the temperature
was rising, and also simultaneously lost this property when,
after being removed from the fire and carried into a dark place,
the temperature fell by radiation.
   It is important to observe, that in some cases, for example
with lead, the matter contained in the tube became incandes
cent some time after it had melted: this shows that the tem
perature necessary for the first manifestation of the luminous
condition does not depend on the solid state of the body sub
mitted to the experiment, and that it takes place in all sub
stances which maintain themselves in the liquid condition
without boiling at 977°F. Professor Draper excepts from
this law the fluoride of calcium and carbonate of lime, which
become luminous much sooner. These cases do not in reality
belong to the phaenomena we are now considering, but to those
of phosphorescence, which require a lower degree of heat, ac
cording to the nature of the substance. I may add that, re
garding the     º          in a general point of view, we should
also except those cases in which the development of light
arises in chemical combinations.
    But these two exceptions are easily recognized by the quality
 of the first colours that appear. Thus the carbonate of lime
 emits, the moment it becomes visible, a white light, and the
fluoride of calcium a blue light. Sulphur appears yellow when
it combines chemically with copper, and blue when it unites
with oxygen. Some philosophers of the highest eminence,
 among others M. Biot, suppose that the first light disengaged
 by incandescent bodies is of the latter colour; and they have
 accounted for this on the principles of a theory which is now
 almost universally abandoned *. We shall presently see what
 is the probable origin of the various tints that arise from phos
 phorescent bodies and chemical combinations: we shall merely
 observe here, that the colour mentioned by Biot occurs in
 flames; and that these cases of combustion, belonging to the
 class of chemical combinations, ought to be carefully distin
 guished from incandescence, properly speaking, which arises
 directly and solely, as we have already said, from an elevation
 of temperature in the body, and which always commences
 with a red light.
    As to the exact degree of this temperature, the objections
 which might be raised against the mode employed by our
 author are of very little importance; if we compare the results
 at which he arrives with those that have been obtained by
 Wedgewood and Daniell, the difference is only 30° in excess
 for the first case, and 3° too little in the second.        The differ
 ences are much greater when compared with the deductions

    and on the Elementary Colours of the Solar Spectrum. 265
of Davy and Newton, which give 812° and 635°; but those
numbers, and especially the latter, were obtained by methods
too imperfect to be trustworthy; consequently the number
977° F. given by our author, must approach very closely
the degree of heat which produces the first incandescence
of bodies.
    After having studied this first question, already examined
by other philosophers, Professor Draper enters on an entirely
new field of research, investigating the nature of the colours
which are developed by an ignited body as its temperature is
increased.
    For this purpose he employed a prism of fine flint glass,
setting it vertically at a certain distance from the strip of pla
tina; but previously having placed in the position the platina
was to occupy, a vertical slit of the same size in a piece of
metal, through which a beam of the daylight passed. The
spectrum resulting from the transmission of this beam through
the prism was received on a small telescope furnished with
micrometricwires, and carefully examined in its different parts,
for the purpose of determining exactly the position of Fraun
hofer's dark lines. The strip of platina was then set in the
same place, and he proceeded to make observations on the
spectra produced by it at different periods of incandescence.
 From these it results, that the first spectrum visible in com
plete darkness corresponds to a temperature of 1210° F., and
extends from the fixed line B to the line F.; the second spec
 trum produced by a temperature of 1325°, commences very
nearly at the same line B, and terminates at the line di the
 third at a temperature of 1440°, appears to begin a little
 nearer the line A, and goes to some distance beyond G.;
 lastly, the fourth, corresponding to a temperature of 2130°,
 approaches much nearer to A, and extends as far as the line l.
 In other words, the spectrum of the strip of platina which cor
 responds to the red extremity of the prismatic spectrum, is at
 first very short, and contains only the less refrangible colours;
 but as the temperature rises, the spectrum of incandescence
 extends towards the violet extremity, obtaining the more re
 frangible tints, and at last acquiring all the colours and all the
 extent of the solar spectrum, except the terminal rays at the
  two extremities, which escape the observer evidently on ac
 count of their extreme feebleness.     The same cause (insensi
  bility due to a want of luminous energy) makes the first spec
  trum appear, at the red end, a little shorter than the last;
  because the less refrangible rays of that colour are, as is well
  known, so feeble, even in the solar spectrum, that we are
  unable to perceive them unless they are isolated in a place
  that is totally dark: much more therefore ought they to re

266 M. Melloni on the Itadiations of Incandescent Bodies,
main invisible to the observer, when the spectrum arises from
luminous agencies so little energetic as are those of the first
periods of incandescence.
   To a perfectly sensitive eye, the variations of length would
evidently have taken place in the direction of the more refran
gible rays only, and all the spectra would have commenced at
the extreme limit of the red rays.
   It results from all these observations, that when the incan
descence of a body becomes more and more vivid and brilliant
by the elevation of its temperature, there is not only an aug
mentation in the intensity of the resulting light, but also in the
variety of elementary colours which compose it; there is, too,
an addition of rays so much the more refrangible as the tem
perature of the incandescent body is higher. In this there is
therefore established an intimate analogy between the pro
gressive development of light and that of heat. Indeed, as
soon as I had convinced myself of the immediate transmission
of every variety of radiant heat through rock salt, I availed
myself of that valuable property to study the refraction of heat
from different sources; and I discovered that radiations coming
from those of a high temperature contain elements more re
frangible than those which are derived from sources that are
not so hot.
   After having pointed out how very important for the theory
of the identity of calorific and luminous radiations, is the ana
logy or rather absolute equality which exists between his ex
periments and mine on the successive appearance of the ele
mentary rays, Professor Draper passes forward to investigate
the law of the increase of the luminous and calorific radiations,
according as the temperature of the source of heat is elevated.
   Bouguer has shown that a difference of one-sixtieth in the
quantity of light which acts on the eye is insensible, and that
thus this fraction constitutes the limit of perceptible variations.
From this it arises, that we easily perceive differences in the
intensity of light when they exceed even to the smallest extent
the sixtieth part of the entire quantity. Let there be placed,
for example, an opake cylinder between the red-hot platina,
or other source of light, and a sheet of white paper arranged
at such a distance that its surface may be illuminated all over
by the light of the shining body, except on those parts where
the shadow of the cylinder is thrown. Then let there be a
lamp furnished with a metallic tube in which there is a small
opening; let the rays of the lamp which go out through the
aperture fall on the paper enlightened by the luminous source
of which we wish to measure the intensity; let the lamp be
gradually approached until the shadow of the cylinder is no
longer sensible; let this experiment be repeated in each of

   and on the Elementary Colours of the Solar Spectrum. 267
the different cases we wish to compare with one another,
measuring each time the distance from the lamp to the paper.
It is then evident that the values sought will be in the inverse
ratio of the numbers found.
   This method, invented by Bouguer to determine the relative
intensities of different luminous sources, and employed by
Draper to measure the quantities of light emitted by a strip
of platina brought to different degrees of incandescence, is the
only one by which we could hope for a successful result.
The method of the equality of shadows, well-known under the
name of Rumford’s method, would have furnished in the re
searches of the learned American uncertain data, on account
of the difficulty of establishing an exact comparison between
the accidental green tint introduced into the shadow enlight
ened by the yellow rays of the lamp, and the red light emitted
by the ignited metal.
    As to the measures of the radiant heat, they were determined
by the aid of the thermo-multiplier; that admirable instrument
which has revealed to science so many new properties of ca
lorific radiations, and which still is rendering eminent services
in the hands of able chemists far beyond the Alps. Professor
Draper had only to arrange at a certain distance from his strip
 of platina a thermo-electric pile, and to observe for each phase
 of incandescence the deviation of the index of the galvanometer
 to determine the quantities sought. In this manner he ob
 tained the numbers contained in the following table, divided
 into three columns.              The first of these columns indicates the
 temperature for each degree of the scale of dilatation, com
 mencing with the point of incandescence: the difference be
 tween each of the successive terms of this series is thus con
 stant, and equal to 115°. The second and third columns give
 the corresponding quantities of light and heat. It is almost
 superfluous to add, that the unity for light is entirely indepen
 dent of that for heat, and that the similar independent unities
 are not referable to the same point of the scale.

   The numbers of the two latter columns show evidently that
the augmentations of both these agents, though feeble at first,
become very rapid at last; from which it results that the ra
diations both of light and heat follow in the progression of
quantity the same analogy that we have just observed in the
progression of quality.
   This parallel march of the two agents seems to have entirely
changed the opinion of the author as to the nature of the rays
of light and heat, and the different chemical and physiological
effects due to the sun and terrestrial luminous and calorific
sources. The preamble of his memoir contains the following
passage relative to this point:-
   “As the experiments now to be described lead to some
striking and perhaps unexpected analogies between light and
heat, they commend themselves to our attention, as having a
bearing on the question of the identity of those imponderable
principles. It is known that heretofore I have been led to
believe in the existence of cardinal distinctions, not only be
tween these but also other imponderable agents; and I may
therefore state, that when this investigation was first under
taken, it was in the expectation that it would lead to results
very different from those that have actually arisen.”
   The author adds, immediately after the experiments relative
to the luminous and calorific radiations, which are simultane
ously developed in the strip of platina at different phases of
incandescence, “I cannot here express myself with too much
emphasis on the remarkable analogy between light and heat
which these experiments reveal. The march of the phaeno
mena, in all their leading points, is the same in both cases.
The rapid increase of effect as the temperature rises is common
to both. And it is not to be forgotten, that, in the case of
light, we necessarily measure its effects by an apparatus which
possesses special peculiarities. The eye is insensible to rays
which are not comprehended within certain limits of refrangi
bility. In these experiments, it is requisite to raise the tem
perature of the platinum almost to 1000° before we can dis
cover the first traces of light. Measures obtained under such
circumstances are dependent on the physiological action of
the visual organ itself, and hence their analogy with those
obtained by the thermometer becomes more striking, because
we should scarcely have anticipated that it could be so com
plete.”

lity of the rays emitted as the temperature of the metal rises,
Professor Draper criticises some of the facts upon which Sir
D. Brewster founds his opinion on the existence of the red,

trum. These criticisms acquire more importance since the
illustrious mathematician, Airy, the Astronomer Royal of
England, has denied the deductions of Sir D. Brewster, and
refers to several of his experimental researches in support of
the view, that a particular colour corresponds to each element
of the spectrum”.
   “As (in the experiment in which a metal is ignited),” adds
Professor Draper, “the luminous effects are undoubtedly
owing to a vibratory movement executed by the molecules of
the platinum, it seems from the foregoing considerations to
follow, that the frequency of those vibrations increases with
the temperaturet. In this observation I am led by the prin
ciple, that “to a particular colour there ever belongs a parti
cular wave-length, and to a particular wave-length there ever
belongs a particular colour;' but in the analysis of the spec
trum made by Sir D. Brewster by the aid of absorptive
media, this principle is indirectly controverted; that eminent
philosopher showing that red, yellow, blue, and consequently
 white light, exist in every part of the spectrum. This must
necessarily take place when a prism which has a refracting
 face of considerable magnitude is used; for it is obvious that
 a ray falling near the edge, and one falling near the back,
after dispersion, will paint these several spectra on the screen;
 the colours of the one not coinciding with, but overlapping
 the colours of the other. In such a spectrum there must un
 doubtedly be a general commixture of the rays; but may we
 not fairly inquire whether, if an elementary prism were used,
 the same facts would hold good; or, if the anterior face of the
prism were covered by a screen, so as to expose a narrow
fissure parallel to the axis of the instrument, would there be
found in the spectrum it gave every colour in every part, as in
 Sir D. Brewster's original experiment? M. Melloni has
shown how this very consideration complicates the phaenomena
of radiant heat; and it would seem a very plausible suggestion
that the effect here pointed out must occur in an analogous
manner for the phaenomena of lightf.”

   t This expression ought not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather
as relative to the new rays which at a given temperature are added to those
already existing in the spectrum.—(Note of M. Melloni.)
   f Sir David Brewster has replied to Professor Draper as follows:—“As
my experiments were not made upon spectra formed upon screens by prisms
with large refracting surfaces, they are not liable to this criticism, even if
it were otherwise well-founded. The spectra which I use are so pure, and
free from all commixture, that Fraunhofer's black lines are distinctly visible;

  270    M. Melloni on the Radiations of Incandescent Bodies,
     I shall here observe frankly, that the optical complica
  tion (alluded to in this criticism) does take place, as may be
  clearly proved; it is this very circumstance which led me to
  detect the errors which had been committed in the determina
  tion of the maximum of temperature in spectra arising from
  different substances. That there may remain no doubt on
 this point, I will transcribe from my memoir, communicated
 to the Royal Academy on November 24, 1843, the part that
  relates to this subject.
     “Let one of the three surfaces of an ordinary glass prism
 be covered with a layer of India ink; let it dry, and then
 divide it into three equal portions at right angles to its axis.
  Remove with a penknife the ink from the middle portion, and
 also a band four or five millimetres wide on the sides of the
 two lateral compartments, so that these two bands from which
 the ink has been removed, may be on opposite sides, and
 form by their junction with the central force a kind of Z. It
 will be understood, that a solar beam issuing from a prism
 thus arranged will produce three coloured images side by
 side; the middle one is very luminous, –it arises from the
 part of the prism from which all the ink is removed; the two
 others, which are much paler, arise from the lateral bands.
 It will also be perceived, that the middle image or spectrum has
 each of its extremities on the boundary of one of the extremities
 of the lateral spectra; and that when, for example, its red
 extremity is in the same line with the red extremity of the left
 spectrum, its violet extremity will be upon the same line as
 the violet extremity of the right spectrum, and vice versä. As
 to the other two extremities of the lateral spectra, they will
 not be found corresponding to the extremities of the central
 spectrum, but to some one of the interior colours, and they
 will evidently be more distant as the width of the uncovered
 bands is less in proportion to the width of the prism. In one
 of my experiments made with an equilateral prism of crown
glass, the width of which was twenty-four millinnetres, and that
 of the lateral bands five, I found, at a distance of two metres,
 that the red extremity of the left spectrum was upon the same
 line as the upper part of the yellow belonging to the central
 image, and the violet extremity of the right spectrum was
and the results are precisely the same when the refracting face of the prism
is reduced to the smallest possible dimensions.”
   “My analysis of the spectrum by absorption does not therefore indirectly
controvert the principle, that “to a particular colour there ever belongs a
particular wave-length, and to a particular wave-length there ever belongs
a particular colour, as Dr. Draper states, in theoretical language, the well
known proposition of Sir Isaac Newton; but it directly controverts it, and
absolutely overturns it.”—Phil. Mag., June 1847, p.462, (Note of M. de laR.)

    and on the Elementary Colours of the Solar Spectrum. 271
upon the blue of the same image. A prism of water, prepared
in like manner, of which the refracting angle was 79°, gave
analogous results. In one, as in the other case, the red ex
tremity of the left spectrum was on a level with the green of
the central image, when the observations were made at the
 distance of a metre from the prism.
    “Let us imagine the central unpainted part of our prism
 to be divided into a series of longitudinal elements, the width
 of each being equal to that of the lateral bands. It is clear
 that each of these elements will produce a refracted image
 similar to the two pale spectra arising from the lateral bands;
 and that the two last images of the series will be as it were
 continuations of those spectra. Therefore, the red and the
 violet which we see by the side of the yellow and blue of the
 central coloured spectrum, equally exist in that central spec
 trum, and enter into the composition of those tints. This
 argument is unanswerable; it establishes that, instead of being
 absolutely pure, or even nearly so, the gradations of the
 image formed by the central compartment contain different
 colours.”
    I had already proved, in 1843, that the colours obtained by
 ordinary prisms at a distance less than two metres, are com
 posed of a mixture of colours belonging to the spectra of the
different elementary bands of the prism; and that the red,
the violet, and consequently all the other prismatic colours of
the two extreme elements, are so much the nearer to the
centre as the observation is made nearer to the prism. Now,
in the experiment of Sir D. Brewster the prism is very close
to the eye, -the spectrum obtained in this experiment must
necessarily be formed of very impure tints; and the colour
which appears in a given zone which has lost by absorption
the dominant tint, does not belong to a ray of the same re
frangibility as the tint absorbed, but rather to colours of the
elementary spectra of the superior or inferior parts of the
prism.
   To prove this directly, I have repeated the fundamental
experiment of Sir D. Brewster. It consists, as is well known,
in interposing between the eye and the spectrum, produced
by the refracted image of a luminous object seen through the
prism, a slip of glass deeply coloured blue by the oxide of
cobalt. The spectrum was formed from the light of a circular
aperture, ten millimetres in diameter, made in a metallic plate
placed in the shutter of a dark chamber. The prism was of
flint glass, equilateral, twenty-five millimetres wide, and suf

 272    M. Melloni on the Radiations of Incandescent Bodies,
 ficiently pure to produce distinctly the black lines of Fraun
 hofer. It was attached to its support by one end, placed
 fifteen feet from the window, and fixed horizontally in the
 position of minimum deviation. Its anterior face was covered
 for one-third of its extent with India ink.   From the middle
 of this there was removed a longitudinal space, which ran from
end to end of the blackened band, leaving free and uncovered
 a horizontal line little more than a millimetre in width.    The
 slip of blue glass covered only two-thirds of the prism count
 ing from the painted extremity.
    Things being thus arranged, I observed the image of the
 aperture successively through the uncovered part of the prism,
 and then through the two portions on which the blue glass
 was placed. The first operation gave me the normal spec
 trum; the second, made after the method of Brewster, fur
nished a complex spectrum ; the third, a spectrum arising
from a little portion which may be regarded as the mean
longitudinal element of the prism. Now, on comparing the
 first image with the second, I observed the phaenomena of
luminous and obscure zones so well described by Herschel.
 On comparing then the third image with the second, I per
ceived that the luminous zones belonging to the elementary
spectrum were much more sharp, although less intense, much
narrower, and traversed by obscure zones, much deeper,
larger, and with contours more striking than those of the
spectrum which came from the unpainted part of the prism.
It was easy thus to convince myself, by the comparative in
spection of the three images, that the differences of tint
between the second and third spectrum corresponded to the
colours which Sir D. Brewster imagines to have the same
refrangibility as the tints absorbed. #. his spectrum, for in
 stance, the normal orange colour is replaced by an obscure
zone invaded on one side by the red, and on the other by the
yellow, from which he infers the presence of these two colours
in the orange. Now these invasions of the yellow and red do
not exist in my elementary spectrum, in which all the space
corresponding to the orange is occupied by a dark zone; the red
and the yellow which limit this zone, in the spectrum produced
by all the middle part of the prism covered by the blue glass,
are therefore independent of this spectrum, and belong to spectra
of elementary layers superior and inferior to the intermediate
line.
    This last conclusion is nevertheless not exempt from objec
tions. For in a dark room the observer must necessarily have
his pupil much dilated, and his sight be more or less confused;
consequently, on looking at one time through the uncovered

prism, and at another through a limited space of the prism
 narrower than the pupil of the eye, it may happen that the
greater extent of the tints transmitted by the blue glass in the
first observation may arise from an indistinct vision, and not
from a real overlapping of the colours from the superior and
inferior parts of the prism. This conjecture seems the more
plausible, since all the rays refracted by the prismatic elements
are not perceived by the observer, but only those that pass
through the aperture of the pupil.
   To determine whether this was in reality the cause of the
phaenomenon, I placed four small bands of tin around the
circular hole in the shutter, and arranged them so that they
formed by crossing one another a perfectly square aperture,
the sides of which were horizontal and vertical. Then placing
before the prism a slip of glass of a deeper blue than the pre
ceding, I saw on looking successively through the central
part of the prism and the part from which the paint was par
tially removed, that the two spectra modified by the interpo
sition of the coloured medium were composed of a red rect
angle, almost square, followed by a broad dark zone, and then
by a very brilliant yellow rectangle, of which the longer sides
were directed vertically and parallel to the length of the spec
trum. There came then a deep indistinct colour, then the
blue, to the modifications of which it is unnecessary here to
attend, but only to the changes of colour and darkness of the
space already mentioned which precedes the yellow.
   On observing attentively the rectangular form of the space
occupied by the yellow rays in each of these spectra, it will be
distinctly perceived to be less elongated in the elementary
spectrum than in the compound spectrum. Now distinct vision
may diminish the magnitude of the image formed upon the
retina, and render the contours more decided and sharp, but
it cannot vary the relations of its dimensions. The shorter
length of the yellow rectangle in the elementary spectrum must
then arise from an effect different from that which is produced
on vision by the smallness of the aperture through which the
prismatic image is observed. We cannot therefore suppose,
the vertical sides of the rectangle being a little sharper and
more vivid than the horizontal ones, that this difference of
illumination can give origin to the phaenomenon in question ;
for any alteration arising in that way would be in the opposite
direction to that actually observed. For, in reality, the most
luminous images being those which undergo the greater re
duction of size in passing from confused to distinct vision, the
yellow rectangle of the spectrum observed in the elementary
prism ought to be shorter in the horizontal than in the vertical

274     M. Melloni on the Radiations of Incandescent Bodies,
direction; nevertheless the difference is manifested in just the
opposite manner. Therefore the elongation of the yellow
rectangle in the central spectrum arises beyond all doubt,
altogether or in part, from a partial overlapping of the yellow
rays belonging to the spectra of the entire series of elementary
prisms, the rays from which traverse the dilated pupil of the
observer. This overlapping takes place perpendicularly to
the axis of the spectrum, and consequently in a vertical direc
tion in the arrangement adopted in my experiment.
   The method proposed by Sir D. Brewster to determine the
composition of the solar spectrum does not therefore appear
to me adapted to the end in view: and until it shall have been
proved that the colours of a spectrum, perfectly pure, change
by the interposition of a medium placed near the prism, the
 change persisting at every other distance, the existence of dif
ferent colours in the same transverse element of the spectrum
ought to be regarded as entirely hypothetical.
    I can therefore no longer admit the existence of different
colours in the same part of the spectrum: I hold it as proved,
that every particular tint arises from a single ray possessing a
particular frequency of vibration, and a particular wave-length.
 I think altogether with Newton, that colour is a characteristic
 sign, distinctive of the different elements contained in the
 beams of the sun and of luminous bodies; elements which are
 separated only and solely under the action of the prism in
 virtue of their different degrees of refrangibility.
    In thus rejecting a means of analysis, which has enjoyed
until now much favour among philosophers, we ought to re
 collect that Sir David Brewster is the author of very many
 beautiful and important discoveries confirmed by experiment;
 works, from the merit of which the conclusion here arrived at
 can never detract, any more than the errors committed by
 Newton on diffraction and the dispersion of luminous rays by
 diaphanous bodies of different kinds, can ever lessen the glory
 which must belong to his optical researches, and his discovery
 of the system of the universe.                       -
    To return to the researches of Professor Draper. I say
 that they conduct, as do others heretofore known on light and
 radiant heat, to a perfect analogy between the general laws
 which govern these two great agents of nature. I will add,
 that I regard the theory of their identity as the only one ad
 missible by the rules of philosophy; and that I consider myself
 obliged to adopt it, until it shall have been proved to me that
 there is a necessity of having recourse to two different prin
 ciples for the explanation of a series of phaenoumena which at
 present appear to me to belong to a solitary agent,

     and on the Elementary Colours of the Solar Spectrum. 275
    I conclude, that the molecules of bodies, slightly heated,
vibrate slowly, and produce long and invisible waves in the
aethereal medium which surrounds them. As the temperature,                    º
                                                                              º,
                                                                              -
rises the molecular vibrations chiefly augment in extent, pre-i \,,           -> * ,
serving the same isochronism; but some ambhg them increase
in frequency also. This increase, nevertheless, does hot bic
come very distinct until near the point of incandescence.
Then a portion of the ponderable particles begin to vibrate
more swiftly than the rest, and produce in the aether shorter
undulations, which are consequently more refrangible; and
of which some become visible; all contributing to increase
the energy and variety of the radiation, until at last a
great number of elements of luminous and obscure heat are
found united in the radiant flux from sources of high tem
perature”.
    There are, however, certain bodies whose state of mole
cular equilibrium is such that their particles possess a great
facility of vibration; these particles acquiring long before the
period of incandescence, altogether or partly, that rapidity of
oscillation from which arises visible heat.          These bodies con
stitute the class of phosphorescent substances.
     When one body combines chemically with another, its
molecules acquire in an instant a very violent vibratory
motion, and then may subsequently assume vibrations that are
slower. This is what appears to take place in flames, which
originate in the combustion of bodies; they commence almost
always by a blue or violet light, and then become white or
yellow.
     But to return to the case in which light and heat are deve
 loped by elevation of temperature only ; we discover that
 aethereal undulations incapable of acting on the organ of vision
 are not alone found in radiations coming from hot and dark
 bodies, but also in those that arise from luminous sources.
 These invisible rays are not homogeneous: they are of dif
 ferent kinds; and their specific properties are altogether ana
    * These views, being the direct consequences of the undulatory theory,
 are not only established in the memoir of Professor Draper here reviewed
 by M. Melloni, but also in an earlier paper inserted in the Philosophical
 Magazine, Feb. 1847; of which a translation is given in the Bibliothèque
  Universelle, June 1847, respecting which M. De la Rive remarks in an in
 troductory note, “Il mous semble, en effet, d'une importance assez grande
 par l'étude bienfaite et l'explication remarquable qu'il contient des phé
 nomènes si singuliers de l'antagonism des rayons de lumière dans les effets
 chimiques.” It also appears from that paper, that he has held them ever
 since 1842, and used them for the purpose of explaining those remarkable
 cases of chemical interference which Sir J. Herschel describes, on the
 hypothesis that the aethereal waves cause the particles of surfaces on which
 they impinge to execute vibratory    *—Sas           of the Translator.)

     In conclusion, I cannot but express my admiration how the
  discovery of a series of facts, which seemed contrary to the
 theory of the identity of light and heat, has become now the
  fundamental basis of that theory. Who would not have
  thought at first sight, that the radiations of heat were of a
  nature altogether different from light, on seeing them trans
  mitted in such different proportions through substances endued
  with the greatest transparency; traversing other bodies,
  strongly coloured, in an immediate and instantaneous manner,
  and this in greater abundance than through some media per
  fectly limpid; and going in a single rectilinear path through
  a plate of completely opake glass? Yet, nevertheless, these
  singular properties are the necessary consequences of the
  transparency and coloration of bodies for heat combined with
  different periods of the aethereal undulations. No one could
  have ever maintained the identity of light and heat until there
 had first been proved coloration of the one and the other of
  these agents, and the quality that every ray of dark heat pos
 sesses of propagating itself and being refracted in a solid body.

 is to be observed that these values of u, v, w are perfectly
general, being obtained prior to any consideration of the way
 in which the fluid is put in motion, and consequently apply to
 all points of the fluid in every instance of motion in which
 powers of the velocity and condensation above the first may
 be neglected. Now the motions we are about to consider are
 vibratory, or at least, not such that any part of the velocity
 remains permanently the same at the same point of space for
any length of time. Consequently C=0, C = 0, and C" = 0.

gives to p an exact expression, and, as we shall see, applies to
the present inquiry, viz. the form Ael". Since p must not in

   Since equation (1.) is linear with constant coefficients, it
will be satisfied by the sum of any number of such solutions
as that just obtained, f, e, P., A, and c being different in general
for each. Hence we have generally,

   It follows, since in each of the terms under the sign X the
quantities which are independent of x and t are at our disposal,
that we may satisfy by this integral any state of the fluid in
the direction of z, subject to the limitation that the condensa
tion and velocity are at all times small. The course of the
reasoning shows that the particular form of the function G,
which has conducted to the above results, has not been arbi
trarily adopted, but is really the only form that determines
the velocity of propagation, and gives a definite solution of
the problem. Also as the particular supposition by which
tudw-H vay--wdz was made an exact differential, has conducted
to the above values of W and S, which are of general applica
tion, no want of generality has been introduced by that sup
position, so far at least as the motion in the direction of z is
concerned. I proceed now to the consideration of equation
(4.), by which the motion transverse to the axis of z is defined.
   As this equation does not contain t, there is no propagation
of motion in any direction parallel to the plane of ay; or the
propagation in the direction of 2 takes place without lateral
spreading. A value off expressed in finite terms is not there

                       the Velocity of Sound.                    281
fore required, as in the case of the integration of equation (3.),
for deducing velocity of propagation. It may however be
argued, that as a particular value of p was found, by which
the vibrations in the direction of s were defined, prior to any
consideration of the manner in which the fluid was put in
motion, so a particular value off exists (whether expressible
in finite terms or not), by which the condensation and velocity
in directions transverse to the axis of z are defined, and which
is equally independent of the arbitrary disturbance. . Now the
form of equation (4.) clearly points to a supposition of a general
nature, by which that equation is converted into another con
taining two variables, and consequently giving a particular
expression for f, viz. the supposition that f is a function of r
the distance from the axis of z; according to which the con
densation and transverse velocity are the same at the same
distance from the axis in all transverse directions.        Thus di
rection of propagation is determined ab initio, in a manner not
depending on the particular disturbance, but which is common
to all disturbances; for plainly the initial direction of propaga
tion is the axis about which the condensation is symmetrically
disposed. The above supposition respecting,f converts equa
tion (4.) into the following,

assuming that f=1, and       #=0,     when r = 0.      It is easily
shown from this result, that there are an unlimited number
of possible values of r for which f vanishes. But we have no
right to conclude that equation (7.) gives the expression for f
that we are seeking for, unless at some distance from the axis
f and  #   vanish together; that is, unless at some distance there
be neither condensation nor variation of condensation, for
otherwise there will be transverse propagation. Now equation
(7.) does not satisfy this condition, as would appear by tracing
the curve which it represents. To meet this difficulty, re
course must be had to the exact equation corresponding to the
approximate equation (4.). That equation I have obtained in
my paper on Luminous Rays (Cambridge Philosophical Trans
actions, vol. viii. part 3, p. 368), to which, as the reasoning is

    The least value of r corresponding to fa-0, as given by this
last equation, is the radius of a cylindrical surface within which
the motion of the fluid filament under consideration is con
tained. It may be remarked, that the second term of equation
(9.) must be very small compared to the others (excepting
where f approaches to zero), in order that that equation may
 be equivalent to a linear equation with constant coefficients.
 By the omission of the second term, equation (9.) becomes
 identical with (6.). Hence the least value of r corresponding
 to f-0 is very nearly the same as derived from either equa
 tion.   Let l = this     i.    value.    Then the value of l is ob
 tained by finding the least root of the equation,

  Now it may be thus argued that x and l have to each other a
 constant ratio. These quantities must be related in some way,
 otherwise the motion is not defined. Let F(A, l, a =0 express

                        the Velocity of Sound.                  283
this relation, a being the maximum condensation corresponding
to f- 1. As there are no other quantities concerned in this
relation, and as A and l are the only linear quantities, this

equation is equivalent to =x(a). And we have above
Hence
                           -V; =x(a).
But it has already been shown that k is independent of a.
Hence x(a) is a constant, and k is the same for all vibrations,
   We have thus been led, by reasoning exclusively on hydro
dynamical principles, to the following conclusion. The velo
city of transmission of a vibration in a medium, for which the
relation between the pressure and the density is given by the
equation p = a”p, is not simply a, but a greater quantity
a. 3. 1 +%, which is the same for vibrations of different magni
tudes.
   To ascertain the numerical value of k, it would be necessary
in a particular instance to obtain by experiment the ratio      }.
    The application of the foregoing result is not confined to
particular cases of disturbance.      For according to the mathe
matical theory above given, the state of the fluid, whatever, it
 may be, is, at every instant, and therefore at the instant of dis
 turbance, composed of vibrations in fluid filaments unlimited
 in number, and unlimited as to the directions of their propa
 gation. In all these filaments the velocity of propagation is the
 Same.
    I cannot avoid adverting here to a difficulty which has long
 presented itself to me, with respect to the explanation usually
 given of the excess of the velocity of sound above the value a.
 Admitting that a sudden condensation by          .*.           heat
 produces a higher degree of temperature, and therefore of
 elastic force, than would exist in the same state of density
 without such development, does it not thence follow, that a sud
 den rarefaction, by absorbing heat, produces a lower tempe
 rature and a less elastic force than would exist in the same
 state of density without such absorption? But the observed
 increase of velocity of propagation requires an increase of ela
 stic force, as well where the fluid is rarefied as where it is con
 densed. May it not be that the developed heat (whether
 positive or negative) is carried off too quickly by radiation to

XLI. On the Development of Functions of the form F(z+4).
   By SAMUEL Roberts, B.A. Manchester New College”.
IT is the object of the present paper        to derive Laplace's
       development of Wu, where u- F(z+apu), by a simple
combination of differential and integral processes; and like
wise Lagrange's and Taylor's theorems, which are particular
cases of that form, but may be immediately arrived at by a
similar method.
   Let F(x+a) be any function of (z+4), z and a being vari
able; without inquiring whether z and w are dependent or
independent, we have

   But since all the limits are determined by the outermost
limits 0 and ar, we may take away the accents from t't", &c.,

    Since we have not determined whether a shall or shall not
be a function of z, we do not know whether or not we may
invert the order of differentiation and integration. In the first
term, however, the function under the sign of differentiation
does not contain t explicitly, and therefore it becomes

of 2, such that we may change the order of integrations and

An Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foyle Base in Ireland,
    with its verification and eatension by Triangulation; together with
    the various methods of Computation followed on the Ordnance Survey,
    and the requisite Tables. By Captain WILLIAM Yollond, of the
    Royal Engineers, F.R.A.S. Published by Order of the Honourable
    Board of Ordnance.
    N our Number for January 1843, we announced the publication,
      under the authority of the Board of Ordnance, of a volume con
taining the observations of stars made with Ramsden's zenith sector,
at ten different stations on, or connected with, the arc of meridian
which extends from Dunnose in the Isle of Wight to Balta, in Shet
land. It was announced in that volume, that the triangulation was
 then in so forward a state that the printing of the geodetical obser
 vations would shortly be commenced. Though five years have elapsed
 since that announcement, the triangulation, it appears, is not yet
 completed; and in the mean time we are favoured with the present
 volume, giving an account of the measurement of the Lough Foyle
 Base, preparatory to the survey of Ireland, with the detail of nu
 merous experiments on the expansion of metals and comparisons of
 various standards of measure; a description of the methods followed
 at the Ordnance Map Office in the computation of the triangulation,
  and of the altitudes, longitudes, latitudes, and bearings of the stations;
  together with sundry tables for facilitating the calculations. This
  base, it is to be observed, was measured in 1827 and 1828, that is
  to say, twenty years ago. Why the account of the measurement
  was not given sooner, or why it is given at this particular juncture
  without the triangulation, does not very clearly appear; but the
  delay which has taken place cannot but be regarded as unfortunate.
  Of the officers who were concerned in the operation, the two who
  took the most active and prominent part (Captain Drummond and
  Lieutenant Murphy) have died ; others have retired from the service;
  and the consequence is, that the description, both of the apparatus
  and the details of proceeding, does not come from one who was per
  sonally engaged in the operation, and who could supply deficiencies

of record by his own knowledge or recollections, but has been com
piled, in part at least, from loose notes and memoranda, not always
full, and in some cases discrepant. - Captain Yollond, on whom the
duty of drawing up the account devolved, has executed the task with
great ability; and it must be confessed that his intimate acquaintance
with the methods followed in the survey department, and the great
interest he manifestly takes in the subject, tend in no small degree to
counteract the disadvantage under which he has been placed in con
sequence of his non-participation in the actual measurement. But
while we willingly concede all praise to the editor of the work, we
cannot forbear remarking on the circumstance, that the account
of so essential and important a part of a great and costly national
undertaking is given to the country without the name of the officer
who was officially charged with its superintendence.
   The portion of this volume to which the greatest interest attaches,
or rather would have attached, had it appeared at an earlier period, is
the description of the measuring apparatus, of which no detailed ac
count had been published, and little more was generally known than
that it had been invented or suggested by Major-General Colby, and
was constructed on the principle of eliminating the effects of varia
tions of temperature by compensation or self-adjustment. But in
formation on this subject has now also been supplied by the publi
cation of Colonel Everest's late work on the measurement of two arcs
of meridian in India, in which a similar apparatus used for the mea
surement of the bases connected with those operations is minutely
described. Captain Yollond gives the following as the reasons which
led to the adoption of the method in question:—
   “All the methods of measuring base lines which had been in use
previously to the commencement of the present survey, were more
or less dependent for their accuracy on the knowledge of the tem
perature of bars or chains when applied in measuring. But as the
temperature of the air is seldom equable for any considerable portion
of the day, and the time which substances occupy in heating or cool
ing varies according to their nature, their masses, and their surfaces,
it did not appear that a thermometer had been or could be devised which
would give the knowledge of the temperature of a bar or chain through
out its whole length at the moment it was used as a measure. This led
to the principle of compensation; a principle which had long been
in use in pendulums, and which had been applied to them in many
ingenious ways.”—P. 7.
   We demur to the opinion stated in the sentence we have printed
in italics. The apparatus used by Delambre in the measurement of
the bases for the French arc of meridian, indicated the relative
lengths of a bar of copper and a bar of platina, and thence gave the
absolute expansion of the platina or measuring bar “throughout its
whole length at the moment it was used as a measure.” Bessel's
apparatus (on the same principle, though differently constructed)
also showed the expansion of the measuring bar at the time it was in
use. In both cases the apparatus formed of itself a metallic thermo
meter; and we conceive that the expansion (for which alone a know
                  Af-                                                 f

                   Notices respecting New Books.                    289
ledge of the temperature is necessary) was indicated by both methods
with a precision equal to that with which the absolute lengths of the
bars can be determined. In the case, indeed, of the long steel chains
formerly used in the Ordnance Survey, the uncertainty respecting
the temperature of the different parts of the measuring chain forms
a serious objection; but with respect to simple bars of a moderate
length, the practical difficulty of determining the expansion at the
moment of the measure does not seem insuperable.
    The following is the description of the measuring bars, omitting
the references to the plates:—
    “The compensation bar consists of two bars, of brass and iron,
10 feet 1:5 inch long, 0.5 inch broad, placed 1.125 inch apart, sup
ported on brass rollers at one-fourth and three-fourths of their length,
and firmly fixed together at their centres by transverse steel cylin
ders 1-5 inch in diameter, and being free to expand from, or contract
towards, their centres independently of each other. At the extremity
of, and at right angles to, each of these bars is a flat steel tongue
 62 inches long, l l inch broad, and 0.25 inch thick; projecting
3:25 inches on the side of the iron bar, and moving freely on conical
brass pivots, riveted into the brass and iron bars, each axis being
perpendicular to the surface of the tongue, allowing it to be inclined
at slightly different angles to these bars according to their expansion
from, or contraction to, their centres.     The centres of the two axes
 are at 0:5 inch and 2-3 inches from the end of the tongue next the
brass bar. On the tongue, and flush with its upper surface near the
 (projecting) extremity, is inserted a silver pin, with a dot marked on
 it, as the compensation point.”—P. 10.
    The number of such bars used in the measurement was six.
    Besides the compensation of the expansion of the measuring bars,
 and the consequent avoidance of all reductions to the normal tem
 perature, another object, which was considered of importance, was
 aimed at in the new apparatus. “To avoid the possibility of acci
 dental displacements incident to the ordinary mode of measuring base
 lines by the contacts of the ends of rods, or by the adjustments
 of the coincidences of lines, it was deemed advisable that the several
 parts of the apparatus should be combined by visual contacts.”
 Accordingly an interval of about six inches was left between the
 measuring bars, when placed in the line of the base, for the accurate
 measurement of which a microscopic apparatus, also on the principle
  of compensation, was contrived.     It is described as follows:—
     “The compensation microscope consists of three microscopes,
 placed 3 inches from centre to centre, connected by two bars of
  brass and iron, 7 inches long, 0.6 inch broad, and 0.375 inch thick,
  2:5 inches apart, firmly secured together by means of a brass collar
  and cylinder, forming part of the tube of the centre or telescopic
  microscope; the two bars carrying with them the outer microscopes,
  of two inches focal distance, being free to expand from, and contract
  towards the central microscope, independently of each other, and
  thereby forming with it small angles of inclination similar to the
  steel tongues of the compensation bars. The compensated point of

each is so adjusted as to be in the outer focus of its object-glass.
The microscopes revolve on the axis of the telescopic microscope in
a tube fastened to a horizontal plate attached to a tripod-stand with
levelling-screws, and furnished with longitudinal and lateral adjusting
screws.    On one side, secured to the brass bar, is the spirit-level for
levelling the microscopes; and on the other, firmly attached to the
centres of the bars by a brass plate, is a telescope embraced by a
brass collar with a small cylinder projecting from one side, which
turns in a socket attached to the plate: thus affording it a vertical
motion, allowing objects to be seen in opposite directions. . . . . The
compensation microscopes are seven in mumber; the weight of each
microscope is 5 lbs.”—P. 11.
   The mode of using the apparatus will be readily apprehended from
the above description. When the several sets of bars and microscopes
are properly adjusted in the line of the base, the microscopes stand
vertically over the tongues at the adjacent ends of each two sets of
bars, and the dots on the tongues are respectively bisected by the
wires of the two outer microscopes, so that the distance between
the dots is the same as that between the foci of the miscroscopes.
   The first question which arises in respect to the new apparatus is
this : Has the attempt to effect a perfect compensation been practi
cally successful? The answer, we apprehend, will scarcely be satisfac
tory. It was seen from the first that a disturbing cause exists in the
unequal facilities with which different metals receive and part with
heat, in consequence of which the two bars, at the time they were used
in the measurement, would probably have different temperatures; in
which case the distance between the compensation points would ne
cessarily be altered, and the error arising from such alteration might
even exceed the whole amount of the expansion of a simple bar for
a corresponding variation of temperature. To remedy this inconve
nience, the idea was suggested of covering the bars with coats of
varnish, so as to produce at least a similarity of surface. A great
number of experiments were made with a view to test the adequacy
of this remedy; and as the results were considered to be satisfactory,
the measuring bars, as well as the connecting bars of the microscopic
apparatus, were varnished accordingly.      In the present measurement
it seems to be assumed that the disturbing cause was by this means
completely removed. Colonel Everest, on the contrary, found that
this was not by any means the case; and he explicitly states that he
considered the advantages of the varnish to be more imaginary than
real. But it is manifest that if the compensation is only partially
effected, the method loses at once all its theoretical advantages; and
is even attended with this disadvantage, that inasmuch as the effect
of a varying temperature on the compound bars is unknown, no
allowance can be made for it as in the case of a simple bar whose
rate of expansion is determined, and follows a known law.
   As the distance between the compensation points of a set of bars
cannot by any effort of art be made equal to 10 feet ea actly, and as
the distance in respect of any two sets will not be exactly the same,
each of the six sets used in the measurement, after the compensation

points had been fixed, was carefully compared with a standard iron
bar of 10 feet, and the difference ascertained at the temperature of
62°Fahrenheit's thermometer.        The unit of the measure, therefore,
so far at least as it depends on the measuring bars, was this 10-foot
iron bar. For the same reason it was necessary to determine the
exact distance between the outer foci of the microscopes, in each of
the seven sets of microscopic apparatus, in terms of a certain stand
ard. The standard used for this purpose was a brass scale, on which
the fine dots were marked at a distance of 6 inches. In this pro
ceeding we find another objection to the method. The part of the
base to which the bars were applied, that is to say #} of the whole,
is referred to a standard iron bar of 10 feet, and the remaining ºr
to a brass standard scale of 6 inches.   In order, therefore, to obtain
the length in terms of a single standard, it becomes necessary to
determine the exact relation of the 6-inch scale to the 10-foot bar,
for at least the whole range of temperature within which the mea
suring apparatus was compared with the respective standards. Hence
it is necessary to determine, not only the exact relation of two scales
of very unequal lengths at a given temperature, but also their rates
of expansion. The circumstance of the two standards being con
structed of different metals seems an unnecessary complication.
   The site selected for the measurement was on the eastern border
of Lough Foyle, in the county of Londonderry. It was proposed
to commence the measurement from the strand, near Mount Sandy,
at the entrance of the Lough, but the rugged and broken nature of
the ground, composed of low sand-hills, made it necessary to begin
about two miles to the south of the intended limit.          From the
point which was selected the measurement was carried southward to
a small rising ground called Sheep Hill, about a quarter of a mile
south-east of the church of Ballykelly. The distance between the north
end and Mount Sandy was afterwards determined by triangulation.
The mean height of the ground above the sea at high-water was
about 18 feet.
   The whole length of the base, to which the measuring appa
ratus was applied, is 41640.8873 feet, or nearly 7+? miles. The
extension from the north end to a station near Mount Sandy is
11559'8270 feet, or nearly 24 miles. This last number is the mean
of the results of the triangulation computed in eight different ways.
It is probably just as accurate as that which expresses the measured
part of the base; but admitting it to be so, we confess our inability
to perceive what particular advantage was proposed to be gained by
the prolongation. It gives no additional security whatever for the
accuracy of the computed distances, which depend solely and abso
lutely on the portion actually measured. If triangulation is to be
admitted, the side of any triangle, determined with equal precision,
may just as well be assumed as the base of the survey.
   For the purpose of verification the base was divided into seven
sections, and after two of them had been measured by the appa
ratus, the length of the second section was computed from the first
by a triangulation. All the    *parts 2
                                           were verified in a similar
                                                                        -

manner. The differences between the computed and measured
lengths were found to be exceedingly minute, excepting in one case,
where the proportionate error amounted to a foot in 9.8 miles. It
is not likely, however, that the probable error of the whole length
exceeds 3 or 4 inches.
   Unusual precautions were taken for the purpose of preserving the
base points, so that they may be available, if required, at any
future time.    And this was done not only at the two points where
the measurement commenced and terminated, but also at an inter
mediate station (Minearney), and at Mount Sandy, to which the base
was prolonged by triangulation. At each of those four points a
circular piece of ground, to the extent of 30 feet in diameter, was
purchased by the Ordnance and enclosed. The foundations of the
stations were laid in solid masonry. “When the exact position of
the points had been determined, jumper-holes, 1% inch in diameter
and 6 inches deep, were bored in the upper blocks, and pieces of
 platina wire, ºr of an inch in diameter, were inserted in the jumper
holes, and retained in a vertical position by fine wire twisted round
 each, with ends projecting to the sides.     The holes were then run
in with lead to within about one inch of the surface of the stone.
 This last inch was filled up with a mixture of cement and sand that
the jumper-holes might resemble the rest of the stones, and the
platina wires were cut off level with the surface. The dots on the
wires were made with the point of a needle......... The points
 at these four stations are now being further secured from injury by
surrounding them with small dwarf walls, and covering each of them
with a tumulus of earth; another dwarf wall, with an iron railing,
will encircle the space at each station purchased by the Board of
Ordnance.”—P. 152.
    The above precautions were no doubt justified by the importance
of the object, for it would seem that this Lough Foyle base, upon
 which the triangulation of Ireland depends,is to be assumed also as the
 unit of the measure of the whole British arc of meridian from Dunnose
 to Balta. Considering the great precision now attained in such ope
 rations, we are not prepared to say that a verificatory base is indis
 pensable, even for an arc of 10°; yet, we should be sorry to see it
 dispensed with in the present case. The bases measured by Roy
 and Mudge in the early stages of the survey will not, we suppose, be
 considered as sufficiently accurate for this purpose, and if so, it
 would seem to be very desirable that another base should still be
 measured somewhere in the south of England, and nearer to the line
 of the meridian.
    All the details connected with the measurement, both with the
 bars and by triangulation, are very fully given; and we have also
 the results of a great number of experiments, made in different
 years since 1827, for ascertaining the relation of the different sets
 of compensation bars to the standard 10-foot iron bar; of this bar
 to another similar bar, and to various standards of length which
have acquired authority or reputation from the comparisons to
which they have been subjected ; of the microscopic apparatus to

                    Notices respecting New Books.                  293
the standard 6-inch brass scale; and of this scale to various other
scales as well as to the 10-foot standard bar. As there is at present
no legal standard of British measures, the results are provisionally
expressed in terms of the 10-foot iron bar. In these details we
see abundant reasons to justify our regret that an account of the
measurement was not given by the persons by whom the ope
ration was actually performed, and our desire to have another base
measured in England, now that the experience which has been
gained would lead us to expect still greater precision. It appears
that while the measurement was proceeding two records of ob
servations were kept; these are found in many cases to differ from
each other, particularly in the readings of the thermometer, and
no means now exist of determining with certainty which of the
two is the correct one. All the comparisons for ascertaining the
relation of the 6-inch scale to the 10-foot bar made prior to 1844
have been discarded as unsatisfactory in some respects, and it would
seem that we have only very recently, if we have yet, become ac
quainted with the proper manner of making experiments of such
extreme delicacy, and with some of the properties of matter on
which the results depend.        Captain Yollond informs us, that
“during the present year (1847) it has been ascertained, that if a
steel bar be raised to a red heat and then cooled, either gradually
or by immersion in water or oil, it does not return precisely to the
same condition as existed prior to its being heated; it remains, in
fact, enlarged.”
   It would be interesting to know how nearly the lengths of the
sides of the triangles deduced from the Lough Foyle base agree with
the same distances computed from the bases formerly measured in
England with the chain; but on this point we have not yet any direct
information. It appears, however, from comparisons made at South
ampton of the Ordnance new standard bar with a 20-foot iron bar,
from which the lengths of the chains were laid off by Ramsden, that
Ramsden's bar exceeded two lengths of the Ordnance standard bar
by 192795 divisions of the micrometer, or by .009 1877 parts of an
inch.   This amounts to rather more than a foot in five miles—an
error too great to be tolerated at the present time. But as other
errors would arise in transferring the length of the bar to the chain,
and that of the chain to the base, the discordance of the computed
distances may be less or greater than in the proportion just stated.
   The methods of computing the distances, and the longitudes,
latitudes, azimuths and heights of the stations, which are appended
to the volume, would form an appropriate introduction to the details
of the triangulation; for their appearance here the following reason
is assigned:—“The principal reason why the calculations for lati
tudes, longitudes, &c. are now entered on, is, that the formulae and
tables may be available for those who may require them, as they
are believed to be more accurate than any hitherto published.”      It
is satisfactory to be put in possession of formulae and tables more
accurate than any which previously existed; but who the parties
may be who are likely to require those in question, or to what

purpose they can be applied until the observations are given, we
are at a loss to imagine. Connected with this subject the following
piece of information strikes us as curious. For some time the lati
tudes, longitudes and reciprocal bearings are stated to have been
calculated from formulae furnished by the Astronomer Royal. These
formulae, which of course are only approximative, were found not to
be sufficiently exact when applied to some of the large triangles which
occur in the Ordnance Survey, and on the occasion of the recent
chronometrical measurement of the arc of parallel between Green
wich and Valentia, the Astronomer Royal furnished a new set of for
mulae in order that the geodetic longitude of the latter place might
be more rigorously computed. The new formulae, along with others,
 were subjected to the most rigid tests that tables of logarithms
 to ten places rendered possible, and the following result is an
nounced :-
    “On trial it was found that mone of the approximate pro
 cesses given by the various writers on geodesy were sufficiently
 exact to reproduce the original assumed latitude, longitude and
 bearing, on carrying the calculations to the point at which they
 commenced ; and even the formulae given by the Astronomer Royal
 failed to do so, until it was found that the normal, or radius of cur
 vature perpendicular to the meridian for the latitude of the given
 station, must be used in the determination of that of the second
 station, and the normal for the latitude of the second in the deter
 mination of that of the third, and so on, instead of using any ap
 provimate radius. This was ascertained by the non-commissioned
 officer in charge of the calculations, after repeated attempts had
 been made, without success, to alter or modify the various approxi
 mate processes which had been tried, so as to cause them to repro
 duce the assumed data, on continuing the calculations to the original
 point,” &c.
    Far be it from us to disparage a discovery so made; but we would
 beg leave to suggest, that if the substitution of the successive normals
 for the approximate radius be really an improvement on the method,
  there must be a reason why it is so; which reason should be given,
  in order that it may not appear to be the practice in the Ordnance
  Survey to follow empirical modes of calculation, found by groping
 to answer in some particular cases.
    With respect to the future progress of the survey Captain Yollond
  observes, “the present, or at all events the succeeding season will
  serve for the completion of the observations at all the stations re
  quired for giving a connected general triangulation of the United
  Kingdom, including the Western, Orkney and Shetland Islands, with
 the necessary data for the comparisons between the astronomical and
 geodetical determinations; these will be the more valuable, as the
 result of the late operations at the Cape of Good Hope, for the mea
 surement of an arc of meridian depending on a base measured with
 the compensation apparatus described in this work, and reducible to
 the same unit of measure, may ere long be expected to be published.”—
 p. vii. No doubt the result of the Cape measurement will be very

                    Notices respecting New Books.                  295
interesting, but in what respect it will render the British arc more
valuable is not apparent, unless for the general reason that every
new datum for the figure of the earth may be said to increase the
value of all the foregoing. Captain Yollond says because it will be
reducible to the same unit of measure. Are we to infer from this that
the meridional arcs measured in France, Germany, Russia, and other
countries are not reducible to the same unit with those measured by
the compensation apparatus? If so, both the British arc and the Cape
arc will be of comparatively little value; for assuredly the figure of
the earth will be determined with greater certainty from all the conti
mental measurements taken together than from those two alone, what
ever advantage may be attributed to the use of the compensation bars.
But surely there can be no greater difficulty in determining the re
lation of the French toise, or metre, to the standard of the Irish base
than in determining the ratio of the 6-inch scale to the 10-foot bar.
All the arcs whose standards have been preserved must be suscepti
ble of reduction to the same unit of measure; and we trust Captain
 Yollond will not think it necessary (if the matter depend on him) to
defer the publication of the triangles connected with the meridian
until the results of the Cape measurement are known, on the ground
that there are no other arcs with which our own is directly compa
rable. We would remind him that the Indian arcs measured by
Colonel Everest (of which, by the way, he makes no mention) are
not less important than the Cape arc will be for the determination
 of the figure of the earth.   They depend on bases which have been
measured with similar apparatus, and Captain Yollond has himself
already compared their standards with those of the Ordnance Survey.
    But although the observations may possibly be completed in the
 course of the present season, it does not follow that they will
be speedily communicated. “Major-General Colby's retirement
 from the superintendence of the Ordnance Survey at the end of the
present month (March 1847), leaves me unable to state the arrange
 ments which are likely to be made for publishing the mass of Tri
 gonometrical Observations made by the Survey Department during
 the last thirty-six years.”
    To those who have been looking forward to the termination and
publication of the results of this great national undertaking, the an
 nouncement we have just quoted is not calculated to afford much sa
 tisfaction. The last account we have of the trigonometrical observa
tions was published in 1811. Since that year the survey has been
 in progress; it is said that upwards of a million and a half has been
 expended on it; and arrangements are still to be made for the pub
 lication of the observations which have been accumulated in the
 long interval”. That the work will be found to have been executed
   * The subject acquires an immediate interest, from the project which
has been entered upon of an Ordnance Survey of the metropolis for the
alleged but unexplained purposes of the Sanitary Commission. From the
 discussion of this project in the House of Commons, March 24, on the
 Ordnance Estimates it would appear that no one could tell what it was
 to cost, how it was to be paid for, or what purpose it was to answer.

in a highly satisfactory manner, the details given in the present
volume leave no room to doubt; yet however assured we may be
in this respect, we cannot help thinking that, so far at least as
regards the meridional arc, it is important that the final results
should be given under the highest scientific authority. It appears
to us, therefore, to be desirable, that, on the completion of the
triangulation (in the present year, or whenever it may happen), the
observations should be transferred to the Astronomer Royal, to
whose department in fact the determination of the meridian may be
considered as properly belonging in order that the length of the arc
may be deduced under his direction and superintendence. The
mapping of country could not possibly be better executed than it
has been under the present arrangements.
A Description of Active and Ertinct Volcanos, of Earthquakes, and of
     Thermal Springs, with remarks on the causes of these phaenomena,
    the character of their respective products, and their influence on the
    past and present condition of the Globe. By CHARLEs DAUBENY,
    M.D., F.R.S. (Second Notice.)
    The subject of thermal springs has attracted a large share of Dr.
Daubeny's attention. From their chiefly occurring in the vicinity
of volcanos, or along lines of geological disturbance, as well as
from the peculiar chemical products which they contain, he shows
that in the majority of cases they must be intimately connected with
 volcanic operations. Nevertheless, we are disposed to qualify this
 generalization in the case of thermal springs no less than of earth
 quakes. Whatever opinion may be held as to the fluidity of the
 earth's nucleus, there is no denying that the interior of the earth (as
 far as we know it) is hotter than the surface. A thermal spring
 therefore, when it occurs at a distance from the direct heat of an
 active volcano, merely means a spring which rises from a great depth,
 of which we have a notable instance in the artificial hot-spring of
 Grenelle, obtained by boring in the middle of the Paris basin, at a
 great distance from volcanic operations or disturbed strata. A na
 tural hot-spring of course implies the existence of a deeply extend
 ing fissure, up which it finds a vent; and if we admit that other
 causes besides volcanos have had a share in breaking up the crust
 of the earth, these causes would also contribute to bring thermal
 Mr. Wyld, to whom we should give credit for practical knowledge, was of
 opinion “that the survey undertaken for the Sanitary Commission was
 entirely unnecessary, a waste of public money, and would not answer the
 purpose contemplated.” Colonel Anson stated that six persons were em
 ployed and that the expense already incurred would “probably be under
  1000l., and that he believed matters were on a very excellent footing.”
 Lord Morpeth spoke of a “moderate sum.” His predecessor, Lord Lin
 coln, stated that the estimates had risen from 25,000l. to 100,000. Ac
 cording to Mr. Wyld, a similar survey of Dublin had cost 200,000l., Mr.
 Wyld stated that “there had been sufficient surveys provided for London
 under the Parochial Assessment's Act, for which the inhabitants had already
 paid 300,000l.”

waters to the surface. And although, as Dr. Daubeny shows, we
find in springs remote from volcanos similar gaseous products to
those emitted by volcanos themselves, yet it is possible that the
production of these gases may be a general occurrence in the sub
terranean regions, and in that case they would escape wherever
they can find an exit, either by the thermal spring or the volcanic
chimney.
   Concluding his summary of the facts of volcanic geology, Dr.
Daubeny proceeds in part 3 to draw conclusions from them as to
the causes of volcanos, the circumstances that influence the cha
racter of their products, and the uses they fulfill in the oeconomy of
Nature.
   The two principal theories now maintained, as to the causes of
volcanic action, are the mechanical one and the chemical; the for
mer of which supposes that the earth's crust floats on a nucleus of
melted matter, the heat of which produces the expansive and explo
sive forces of the volcano; while the latter maintains that volcanic
heat is the direct effect of local chemical operations going on beneath
the district where the phaenomena are displayed. As we can never
hope to obtain any positive knowledge of the regions where volcanos
originate, and can only speculate as to their causes by studying a
multitude of very complicated effects, it is probable (and the reflection
is consolatory) that these rival theories may continue to enliven the
meetings of the Geological Society in future ages, long after every
region of the world has been mapped, every section measured and
every fossil described.
   Dr. Daubeny has for many years been an advocate of the chemical
theory, and supposes volcanic heat to arise from the access of oxy
gen to the metallic bases of the alkalies and earths. All who have
witnessed the combustion of potassium or of sodium by the contact
of water must admit that this is a possible hypothesis, and the ques
tion therefore is merely whether that or the mechanical theory is
the more probable.     In proof of his opinion, Dr. Daubeny adduces
the vicinity of volcanos to the sea, the aqueous vapours which they
 emit, and the hydrogen, nitrogen and other gases which indicate the
 decomposition of air and of water, and the absorption of oxygen. He
 has argued this question with great ability on chemical grounds, and
 has certainly made out a very good case, though we are not prepared
 as yet to enlist ourselves under either banner. Both theories may
 easily be true. Central heat and central fluidity may still exist as a
 relic of the chaotic epoch, and would even be auxiliary to the che
 mical operations which may take place in the more superficial re
 gions of the earth's interior.
    Dr. Daubeny adopts to a great extent the views of Von Buch re
 garding “craters of elevation,” that is, cavities formed by the up
 heaving and consequent separation of the superficial strata, as di
 stinguished from “craters of eruption,” caused by the accumulation
 of ejected matter round the orifice of a volcano.     Like all doctrines
 which assume a controversial form, the elevation theory has been
 pushed too far by one party and unreasonably cried down by an

298                Notices respecting New Books.
other. Whenever beds of sedimentary origin possess an anticlinal
or quaquaversal dip, at a higher angle than water could have depo
sited them, they may be said, in a general sense, to form a “crater
of elevation.” This crater may be either circular or elliptical ; or
the ellipse may be so long as to appear linear; it may arise from the
direct outbreak of a volcano, or from those other causes of elevation
which probably exist; it may have a symmetrical cavity in its cen
tre, or it may be filled up by the elevated matter, and have no cavity
at all;-yet the mechanical elements of an elevation-crater remain
unaltered. We have plenty of such craters in our own land; the
Weald of Kent (allowing for subsequent denudation) is an elevation
crater; so are the more symmetrical domes of limestone near Dud
ley (one of which has a crateriform depression on its summit); and
so are the beautiful valleys of Woolhope in Herefordshire and of
Ashover near Matlock.       Wherever the inclined beds are of aqueous
deposition (whether their ingredients are volcanic or not is immate
rial), there is no difficulty in attributing their present arrangement
to elevatory forces. But when a crateriform cavity is surrounded by
inclined masses of lava, scoriae, or other purely igneous matter, the
problem is far more difficult, and becomes a fair question for contro
versy. Whether the materials which form a volcanic cone are ele
vated or erupted, they equally assume a quaquaversal inclination,
and it is often impossible to determine whether they have originally
formed a continuous stratum or have been outpoured at successive
epochs. Nor does the difficulty appear to us to be diminished by
the presence in a crater of a trachytic nucleus, which Dr. Daubeny
considers to be conclusive evidence of elevation; for if the trachyte
has once been fluid, why may it not have been ejected up the funnel
of the volcano in a semi-liquid form 2 In some countries, Asia Mi
nor for instance, there are regular coulées of trachyte which have
flowed down the existing valleys, and we do not therefore see why
trachyte in a less perfect state of fluidity may not have blocked up
the mouths of volcanos, or even, when in an almost solid state, have
formed conical masses, like the Puy de Dome, on the surface of the
earth.
   It is nevertheless highly probable that nearly every volcanic cone
has a nucleus of elevated rocks.     Before a volcano can commence at
a new point a vent must be made for it, either by pushing the in
cumbent strata laterally, or, which is far easier, by bursting them
upwards. But in the majority of cases these rocks so elevated
would soon be buried far from human ken by the accumulations of
erupted matter.
   The author next treats of the subject of basaltic or trap rocks,
which he considers to be caused by volcanic eruptions taking place
under submarine pressure, instead of exploding into the atmosphere
like ordinary volcanos. It was hardly necessary at this time of day
to go into much detail to prove the connection between trap and
volcanic rocks; we should rather go a step further, and assert the
actual identity of the operations which produce them. It appears
to us that pressure of any kind is sufficient to account for the dif

                   Notices respecting New Books.                     299
ference between ordinary volcanic products and those commonly
called trap.    This pressure is no doubt often due to the presence of
a deep sea over the point of eruption, but the hydrostatic pressure
of an ascending column of lava is a still more powerful agent.
The lava in a volcanic chimney may be compared to the scum
and slag in an iron furnace, while trappean rocks represent the
heavy and fluid metal which lies beneath it. The pressure of a
column of fluid lava 10 or 20,000 feet high would inject the denser
matter below into every accessible crevice, horizontally as well as
vertically, and when exposed in after ages by denudation, it would
exhibit those dykes and tabular masses of basaltic rocks which Dr.
Daubeny refers more exclusively to submarine eruption.
   Our author attributes the columnar and jointed structure of
basalt to its aggregation, in the act of cooling, into spheroidal masses,
 which by their mutual pressure acquire a subhexagonal form. It
appears to us, however, that contraction, and not pressure, is the
“appropriate idea" to be applied to the prismatic structure of
basalt. Dr. Daubeny, indeed, maintains that the columns often
approximate so closely that no contraction can have taken place.
But the fact of the rock separating into columns proves that a cer
tain interval exists between them, and the smallness of this interval
merely shows that the contraction was small in amount. From the
moment that the basalt begins to solidify, the cooling process must
be accompanied by contraction, and although the rock may then
have a tendency to assume a spheroidal or concretionary structure,
we do not see how such concretions can exert a mutual pressure at
 the same time that they are separating from each other by con
traction. Moreover, the spheroidal structure is often absent, and the
basaltic prisms then present a homogeneous texture through their
whole length. The subhexagonal structure would therefore appear to
be the first or normal condition which a tabular mass of basalt tends
to assume, and the spheroidal arrangement to be the offspring and
not the parent of that structure.
   This volume is appropriately concluded by a chapter on the final
causes of volcanos, in which those who have exclusively regarded
these igneous operations in the light of destructive agents, will be
gratified by some sound and philosophical views as to the benefits
which they confer on the organic creation. We will quote the fol
lowing as an example:–
   “Potass, soda, certain earthy phosphates, lime, magnesia, must
be present wherever a healthy vegetation proceeds. Now some of
these bodies are naturally insoluble in water, whilst others are dis
solved with such readiness, that any conceivable supply of them, in
their isolated condition, would be speedily carried off and find its
way into the ocean. The first, therefore, must be rendered more
soluble, the latter less so, than they are by themselves. Now the
manner in which nature has availed herself of the instrumentality of
volcanos to effect both these opposite purposes is equally beautiful
and simple.

 lime and magnesia, in what I have termed a dormant condition, that
 is, so united by the force of cohesion and of chemical affinity as not
 to be readily disengaged and carried off by water. * * * *
     “Now nature has provided, in the carbonic acid which is so
 copiously evolved from volcanos, and which consequently impreg
 nates the springs in those very countries, more particularly where
 volcanic products are found, an agent capable, as completely as
 muriatic acid, though more slowly, of acting upon these descriptions
 of rock, of separating the alkali and alkaline earths, and of present
 ing them to the vessels of plants in a condition in which they can
 be assimilated.
    “'Thus every volcanic as well as every granitic rock contains a
 storehouse of alkali for the future exigences of the vegetable world,
 whilst the former is also charged with those principles which are
 often wanting in granite, but which are no less essential to many
 plants—I mean lime and magnesia.
    “Had the alkalies been present in the ground in beds or isolated
 masses, they would have been speedily washed away, and the vege
 tables that require them would by this time have been restricted to
 the immediate vicinity of the ocean.”—P. 701.

    The author, after adverting to the labours of Robiquet, Heeren,
Dumas, and Kane in the investigation of the proximate principles of
the lichens, especially of those which yield red colouring matter with
ammonia, and also of the more recent inquirers on this subject, such
as Schunck, Rochleder, Heldt and Knop, who have greatly extended
our knowledge of this interesting but difficult department of organic
research, proceeds to state that nearly two years ago his attention
was directed by Dr. Pereira to a kind of Orcella weed, which had
been recently imported into London from the Cape of Good Hope,
but which had been rejected by the London archil manufacturers
as being unfit for their use, from the small quantity of colouring
matter it yields when subjected to the usual process. With a view
to ascertain whether or not the red dyes obtained from the various
lichens result from the action of ammonia on a certain crystalline
principle, described by Schunck under the name of lecanorine, the
author procured quantities of the several lichens usually employed
by the archil makers, and subjected them to investigation; the minute
details of which, together with the results, are given at length in the
present paper.
   The specimens examined are the following:—

             I. South American variety of Roccella tinctoria.
   The lichen was cut into small pieces and macerated with a large
quantity of water for some hours, then quick-lime was added. A
yellow solution was obtained, from which muriatic acid precipitated
the colouring matter, as a bulky gelatinous mass; this was washed,
dried on a plate of gypsum, and dissolved in hot spirits of wine (not
boiling). The solution on cooling deposited the colouring principle
in small white prismatic needles arranged in stars. This is—
    1. Alpha-Orsellic acid (hydrated). . . . . . . . . . Cas His Ola-H HO
and its salt of baryta—
       Alpha-Orselliate of baryta . . . . . . . . . . . . ...   Cas His Ola-H BaO
    2. Alpha-Orsellesic acid was obtained by mixing crude gelatinous
orsellic acid with a little water, neutralizing with lime or baryta, and
precipitating with muriatic acid. A gelatinous hydrate is obtained,
which may be purified by solution in dilute alcohol and crystallization.
    The composition of this acid and its baryta salt is as follows:—
             Alpha-Orsellesic acid . . . . . . C, H, O,4-HO
              Alpha-Orsellesiate of baryta Clº HsO,--BaC).
    This acid gives a fugitive bluish-red or violet tint with hypochlo
rite of lime. Orsellic acid gives a deep blood-red tint, quickly
changing to yellow.
    3. Orsellesic ether, C, H, O, +C, H, O, is obtained from alpha-or
 sellic acid by boiling in strong alcohol, evaporating to dryness, and
 dissolving in boiling water. It crystallizes on cooling in long flat
 needles, having a yellowish colour from adhering resin.
            II. Roccella tinctoria from the Cape of Good Hope.
     By processes similar to those just mentioned, this lichen yielded—
           1. Beta-Orsellic acid. . . . . . . . . .    Cai Him Ou-H HO
               Beta-Orselliate of baryta. . . . Cai Hi! Ou-H BaO.
     2. Beta-Orsellesic acid (formula to be given hereafter).
     3. An ether compound, which is probably orsellesic ether.                  By
 three experiments its composition was found to be—
                                        I.           II.            III.

     4. Roccellinine.—Obtained by drying the gelatinous mass which is
  precipitated from the lime solution by muriatic acid, and boiling in
  strong spirit. The ether compound dissolves, and roccellinine remains
  behind. It is purified by repeated crystallization from strong spirit,
  aided by animal charcoal, and presents itself in soft hair-like crystals
  about an inch long, arranged in stars. It is a very indifferent sub
  stance, appearing however to be a feeble acid.
      Its empirical formula is Cas Hiz Ols.

    By similar treatment yielded—
            1. Erythric acid. . . . . . . . C. HoO,--HO.
    This acid gives a blood-red colour with hypochlorite of lime.
            2. Erythric ether . . . . . . Cº. HoO,--C, H, O,
            3. Erythric methylic ether C, H, O,--C, H, O.
    This ether crystallizes in longer and narrower prisms than erythric
 ether.
    4. Erythrelesic acid is analogous to alpha- and beta-orsellesic acids.
    5. Picro-erythrine.—By neutralizing erythric acid with lime or
baryta, and throwing down erythrelesic acid with muriatic acid, a
mother-liquid is obtained containing picro-erythrine, from which that
 substance may be separated in the form of yellowish crystals; , and
these may be purified and decolorized by repeated crystallization from
hot water aided by the use of animal charcoal. Picro-erythrine gives
a blood-red colour with hypochlorite of lime.
    Its empirical formula is Ca. He, Oxy.
    6. Pseudo-orcine, of which the empirical formula is Clo His Olº.      It
is obtained by boiling the lime solution of R. Montagnei till it is re
 duced to one-fourth of its bulk, passing carbonic acid in excess .
through the liquid, and evaporating the filtered liquid to the consist
 ence of a syrup; this is introduced into a flask and digested with a
large quantity of ether, which dissolves orcine and leaves pseudo
orcine. On being crystallized two or three times from strong spirit,
it is obtained in large shining colourless crystals. Still larger cry
stals may be obtained from an aqueous solution. Hypochlorite of
lime has no action upon it.
    The author then gives a mode of extracting the colouring princi
ples of the lichens, so as to make them portable for commercial pur
poses. The extraction might be performed in the country where the
lichens grow, by cutting them up into small pieces, macerating in
milk of lime, neutralizing with muriatic or acetic acid, collecting
the gelatinous precipitate on cloths, and drying it at a gentle heat.
    He also suggests two modes of estimating the quantity of colour
ing matter in the lichens.
    1. By macerating a known quantity of the lichen in milk of lime,
and adding bleaching powder of known strength from an alkalimeter
till all colour disappears from the liquid, and noting the quantity of
solution required. It is thus found that—

                        IV. Evernia Prunastri.
   1. Evernic acid is obtained by extracting the lichen with milk of
lime, precipitating with muriatic acid, drying the precipitate, and
digesting in weak spirit till nearly two-thirds are dissolved. The
solution yields crystals of evernic acid. The insoluble part is usnic
acid. Evernic acid yields only a slight yellow colour with hypo
chlorite of lime.

   2. Evernesic acid is obtained by dissolving evernic acid in a slight
excess of caustic potash, passing carbonic acid gas through the solu
tion to saturation, and concentrating the solution : evernesiate of
potash crystallizes out. From this the acid may be separated by
means of muriatic acid. It gives a yellow colour with hypochlorite
of lime.

   This substance is always obtained when any of the colouring prin
ciples of the lichens which yield red dyes with ammonia are subjected
to particular processes.   The best way of obtaining it pure is to boil
the alpha-, or beta-orsellesic acid, or the erythrelesic acid in water
for about an hour. Carbonic acid is given off, and crystals of co
lourless orcine are deposited. It gives a dark purple red colour with
hypochlorite of lime, quickly changing into deep yellow.

gas through a solution of orcine.

   This principle is found in Usnea florida, U. hirta, U. plicata, U.

and Usnea florida, by the use of lime and muriatic acid.

   Feb. 17,-" On a Formula for the Elastic Force of Vapour at
different Temperatures.” By Captain Shortrede. Communicated
by Lieut.-Col. Sykes, F.R.S.
   The author adopts as the basis of his formula the first series of
experiments at high temperatures made by the French Academy,
and those of Magnus at low temperatures. For the Academy's

3O4.                          Royal Society.
experiments, he adopts the indications of the smaller thermometer in
the steam in preference to those of the larger thermometer in the
water. Of Dr. Young's sort of formulae, he notices that of the Aca
demy and several others with exponents varying from 5 to 7. From
the elasticity at freezing, as given by Magnus, compared with four
of the Academy's experiments, he shows that for the range of obser
vation the number 6 is preferable to 5 as an exponent; but, as he
states, no formula of this sort with a constant index can be found to
agree with the observations throughout.
    The formula of Magnus he finds to agree with these observations
better than any of the others; but being adapted to the air-thermo
meter, and therefore not convenient for ordinary use, he gives his
own formula adapted to the mercurial thermometer,
                           t   500+225 log A
                             T     5–logA ’
t being the temp. Cent., and A the elasticity in atmospheres of 0"'76
at zero, or 30 inches at 58°Fahr. ; ... the temperature being given,
the formula becomes

                          log A=5– 225 + . .
    The author compares with the experiments the formula of the
Academy and those of Southern, Coriolis, Tredgold, and one deduced
as above ; also that given by August, and the same modified so as
to give at freezing the elasticity found by Magnus; also that of
 Magnus, and the same reduced to the mercurial thermometer by the
 data of Dulong and Petit; and lastly, his own formula. Then as
suming that the experiments of Magnus are represented by his for
mula, he compares the other formula with it at every 10° from—10°
to 100°Cent. He shows that for the range of their experiments the
 Academy's formula is better than the others of Dr. Young's sort;
but at low temperatures it is very erroneous.        Southern's formula
 at low temperatures is better than that of Coriolis, but at high tem
 peratures not so good.      Tredgold and the other like it are better at
 low temperatures than that of Coriolis, but worse at high tempera
 tures. August's formula is very erroneous; and in its modified form
 it is still worse, the errors increasing to about 10° or more, showing
 that the theoretic considerations by which it is deduced are not
 founded in truth. With the Academy's experiments, the errors of
 Magnus's formula are —, but when reduced to the mercurial ther
 mometer they are all +, the mean of the whole being 0°-33. With
 the new formula the errors are nearly balanced, the sums on the
 thirty experiments being — 19-78 and +3°55, in only two cases
 amounting to half a degree. On the twelve experiments, at or near
 the maximum, the errors are — 19:12 and +0°43.
     From zero to 100° the differences between the new formula and
 that of Magnus are all of one kind; and when reduced to tempera
 ture are less than 0°4, which the author thinks to be within the
 probable difference between the air and mercurial thermometers, and
 within the errors of observation.                                       -

 of vapour in atmospheres. Also modifying his formula,

 gives a table off for every degree from —40° to +360°, by the help
 of which he compares with his formula, the experiments of Robison,
 Southern, Dalton, Taylor, Arsberger, Ure, and those of the American
Committee, and shows that they differ more widely from each other
than from the formula.
   Considering the care bestowed to ensure the elasticities being cor
rectly measured, the author is disposed to attribute a great part, but
not the whole, of the discordance on the several results to errors in
the measures of temperature arising from smallness of scale or incor
rectness of division.
   Feb. 24.—“On the Moist-Bulb Problem.” By Captain Short
rede. Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel W. H. Sykes, F.R.S.
   The author adopts the notation of Professor Apjohn, and by a
similar method deduces the fundamental equation, which is then
translated into numbers, taking 1175° F. as the sum of the latent
and sensible heats, 0.267 as the specific heat of dry air, the weight
of aqueous vapour as five-eighths of that of air, and its specific heat
 =0-867, that of water being unity.
   The coefficient for barometric pressure is resolved into a simple
change on the temperature of the air, and consequently also on the
depression of the moist bulb ; and the equation is put into a shape
convenient for use, and shown to be free from objection. The
author uses the table of the force of vapour, given in the accom
panying preceding paper, and then gives a table of maximum
depressions for every degree of the moist bulb from —40° to 212°,
and another table interpolated from it for every degree of temperature
of the air from 0° to 212°.
   Gay-Lussac's depressions are then compared with those of the new
formula; and the errors are shown to be almost insensible near the
freezing-point, but increasing gradually, till at 25 Cent. it is about
10 per cent. The author attributes these errors to the gradual de
terioration of the chloride of lime during the experiments.
   The author then comparesPrinsep's maximum depressions collected
and given in vol. v. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.
The observed depressions are generally below those given by the new
formula, like those of Gay-Lussac. The errors on those where the
air was heated by a steam-pipe, are not greater than on those at na
tural temperatures; and that with air passing through a porcelain
tube at an orange heat, falls within the limits assigned by Prinsep in
estimating the temperature of the air.
   Apjohn's maximum depressions are then compared with the new
formula. And here the errors are of an opposite character to those
preceding, which the author attributes to the lowering of tempera
ture occasioned by expansion on escaping from the compression used

to force the air in a rapid current through the apparatus.      Apjohn's
dew-point observations are then compared, and the errors are found to
be similar to the preceding, and apparently from the same cause.
   To make the formula generally useful, the author gives a table of
the depression of dew-point below temperature for every degree of
depression of the moist bulb, at every 5° of temperature from 0° to
100°, and for every 10° from 100° to 140°, which he protracts on a
chart, so as to give the dew-point in every case with little more
trouble than is required for reading a common thermometer, and
also at the same time the elasticity of vapour in the atmosphere.
    “Experiments on the influence of Magnetism on Polarized Light.”
 By Professor Carlo Matteucci. Communicated by Sir John F. W.
 Herschel, Bart., V.P.R.S. &c.
    The object of this notice is to communicate some recent experi
 ments on diamagnetism, and particularly on the influence of mag
netism on polarized light. The following extracts are in the words
 of the author:—
    “The apparatus I employed in these experiments was an electro
 magnetic apparatus invented by M.Rumkorf, and described by M. Biot
 at a meeting of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, and consisting of
 a powerful electro-magnet, of which the soft iron cylinder is traversed
 by a hole in the direction of the length of the axis, through which
 hole the ray of polarized light is made to pass; and the voltaic cur
 rent which I employed on this occasion was that of seven pair of
 Grove's construction. I made my first experiment with a piece of
 heavy glass, which I received from Faraday himself. In order to
 assure myself of the exact amount of rotation induced by magnetic
 action, I caused the ray of light, before it reached the heavy glass,
 to pass through the system invented by M. Soleil, consisting of two
 equal plates of perpendicular quartz, placed side by side; the one
 turning to the right, the other to the left. I ascertained, first of all,
 the rotation produced by making the current pass sometimes in one
 direction, and sometimes in the other; the two rotations, one to the
 right, the other to the left, thus produced, were exactly the same.
 Then I compressed slightly the middle part of the piece of heavy
 glass, in the same manner as one compresses pieces of glass. I was
 then obliged to turn the eyepiece in a certain direction in order to
 restore the image to its first condition; in my experiments I always
 had to turn it, after compression, towards the right. I next made
 the current pass, first in one direction, then in the other. The ge
 neral facts which I have observed constantly and without exception
 are the following —The rotation produced by the magnet on the com
pressed piece of heavy glass is not the same to the right as it is to the
 left ... the rotation produced by the magnet is considerably greater in
 the direction of the rotation produced by compression than it is in the
 contrary direction : the rotation produced by the magnet on the com
 pressed heavy glass, and in the direction of the rotation produced by the
 compression, is greater than that produced by the same magnet on glass
 which has not been compressed, and the rotation in the contrary direc
 tion is less. The following are the numerical results.

                             Royal Society.                           307
    “In one experiment I obtained on a piece of heavy glass not com
pressed, 3° of rotation to the right or to the left, according to the
direction of the current: on slightly compressing the glass, I had to
turn to the right the eyepiece to 4°, 5°, and even to 8° in order to
restore the image to its first condition. In closing the circuit, the
rotation produced in the same direction as that due to compression
was 33° or 4°, while the rotation produced in the contrary direction
was from 2° to 15°. On ceasing to compress the glass, I obtained
the same phaenomena as I had observed before the compression.
    “I have made in the same manner experiments with a piece of
flint-glass, which produced a rotation of 2° under the influence of the
magnet. When I applied the same magnet to pieces of compressed
flint-glass, I could not discover the slightest sensible rotation in
whatever direction I might make the current pass. Plates of quartz
cut perpendicularly or parallel to the axis, and compressed in various
directions, did not acquire any rotatory power under the influence of
 the magnet. I think that the peculiarity exhibited by compressed
 heavy glass is of some interest, in as far as it appears likely to lead
 to a more satisfactory explanation of the want of rotatory power
 communicated by magnetism in crystalline bodies.
     “I shall conclude by communicating the negative results of some
 experiments I attempted with a view to discover the action of dia
 magnetic bodies on each other, and of magnetism on gaseous bodies.
 I suspended small needles of bismuth between the poles of a very
 powerful electro-magnet, and with a good chronometer I counted
 the number of their oscillations, either alone or in the vicinity of
 pieces of bismuth of various shapes and sizes.      I repeated these ex
 periments with all possible care, avoiding the slightest current of air,
 reckoning the smallest oscillations, and those of the same extent in
 the different cases. I never obtained any differences beyond half a
  second, which existed equally whether the pieces of bismuth were
  near or not. The experiment therefore does not serve to show the
  action of diamagnetic bodies on each other; an action which natº
  rally ought to exist, but which perhaps is overpowered by the stre+8°
  action of the magnet.
      “I afterwards counted the oscillations of a small needl      ismuth,
  which I succeeded in suspending by a silk fibre (fil- cocon) inside
  of a glass ball blown at the top of a barometer-tubº-      The ball  WaS

        GENTLEMEN,
      AVING received on the 9th instant a letter from Sir J. W.
       Lubbock, informing me that he had observed a spot on the
sun on the 19th of November last year, very similar to that which I
took the liberty to notify in the Philosophical Magazine of last month,
I beg to be allowed to make the observations, which he places at my
disposal, public through the medium of your pages; as well to fur
mish another satisfactory proof of what appears not to have been
sufficiently noted or credited, in general, as to acknowledge the
priority of his observation of the fact in question. Comparing the
appearances of the two spots, Sir J. W. Lubbock says,—
   “Like yours it was seen as one with the naked eye by my children
and by my labouring people, with whom I happened to be, and who
called my attention to it.     Like yours it was seen as two spots in a
telescope, with a number of smaller ones under it.     I enclose a copy
of a drawing I made at the time. Like yours it was seen through a
fog, the sun's disc being of a blood-red colour. It would seem that
there must have been about sixty-seven days intervening between
your observation and mine; and as the sun revolves about its axis
in 25.4 days, I presume either the spot must have changed its place,
or it was not the same.”
   Though the sketch referred to has certainly some general resem
blance to the spot of the 25th of January, the central nuclei of the
latter were much more oblong, or rather stripe-shaped; and the
aggregation of spots and shallows on one side of these formed the
aspect of a crescent, or segment of a circle, not unlike an eyebrow,
*lative to the others when viewed through a telescope. Still such
traiºmutations might be expected to have occurred between No
Yºmbe, and January in the same spot. Had the position been nearly
the same, and the period of revolution completely accorded, the spots
might have been considered identical.
   I had some dimºulty in recognizing the spot of the 25th of January
after its reappearing, which I first noticed on the 14th of February.
As it advanced, however, I think I found sufficient similarity of fea
tures to identify it, the time also agreeing with the period of appa
rent rotation. The whole seemed contracted, and the various umbrae
had become conjoined more or less, the arched cluster also forming
a junction with the central penumbra. Some of the smaller         spots
had run into one, and the two long central spots had also united.
A. detached spot west of these had probably broken out since the
disappearance. Such was its aspect on the 22nd of February; un
favourable weather and other circumstances prevented my inspecting
it ºftener: . From a conversation I had lately with my friend Mr. j.
Adie, optician, who had also seen the spot with the naked eye, I am

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                       309
 inclined to think I had over-estimated its dimensions. Probably a
 fifteenth part of the solar diameter would be nearer the truth. The
 obscuration was however so large as to attract the notice of the most
 unobservant. People in Prince's Street, I understand, were gazing
 at it as they lounged along. Having no pretension myself to astro
 nomical acquirements, I can claim only to be considered as a simple
 eye-witness to a fact, and shall be glad if chance has led me to cor
 roborate the observations of Sir J. W. Lubbock or others.                   The
 latter gentleman, in his Note on Shooting Stars, also mentions having
 recently seen other solar spots with the naked eye, which disappeared
 altogether in a day or two. This I had read before receiving
 his obliging communication. The natural inference from similar
 repeatéd observations I imagine must be, that the great forces in
 operation on the solar surface are gradually increasing and extending
their energies; so that we may possibly have, in process of time,
half of the sun's body obscured, as Abulferagius relates occurred in
 the seventeenth year of the emperor Heraclius during the space of
nine months! The solution of this mighty solar problem is yet to
be achieved; and perhaps it would be a step to our knowledge of
the physical constitution of the sun, if by calculating the perturba
tions of some comet, as suggested by Sir J. W. Lubbock, its origin
could be traced back to the solar mass, from which it had been pro
jected by the tremendous forces there in obvious operation.

ON A NEW METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING THE PROTOXIDE OF
    IRON    FROM THE     PEROXIDE BY THE BLOWPIPE.                   BY E. J.
    CHAPMAN, ESQ.
   The presence of iron in any compound may be detected, it is              º
known, and with great certainty, by the blowpipe; but no me
has hitherto been
distinguished         givenperoxide
                from the      by which     the protoxide

                                                 of that instrume”       After
several trials to accomplish this, I discovered the follow”8 method,
which is both decisive and simple, requiring more               for its per
formance    but the ordinary   reagents   of the  blowpº-case.
   A very minute quantity of oxide of copper” to be dissolved in a         -
bead of borax on the platinum wire       º be faintly coloured;
and the substance under examination being added to it, the whole
is to be subjected, but for an instant only, to a reducing flame;
when, if protoxide of iron were originally, present in the assay
matter, the CuO will be redaced to Cuº O, forming small red spots
or streaks, which become visible as the glass cools. The Fe0 is
converted into Fe2O3 at the expense of the oxygen of the copper.
       the above

time,             experiment,

                                                          even            sub
                                                                               a
stance under examination contained only the peroxide of iron, as

310            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
this would be converted by the flame into protoxide, and thus act,
as before stated, on the oxide of copper; and if, furthermore, this
latter substance were contained in too large a quantity in the borax
glass, it might become reduced by the sole action of the yellow
flame, and thus give rise to an erroneous result. To obviate, there
fore, all doubt as to the presence or absence of Fe0 in any com
pound, I find it advisable to conduct the operation in a different
manner, by which not the slightest uncertainty can be experienced.
    The borax bead must be coloured by a sufficient quantity of oxide
of copper to render it of a fine blue tint, but transparent, when cold.
To this the substance under examination in powder must be added,
and the bead exposed for a moment, or until the iron compound
begins to dissolve, to an oxidating flame. If peroxide of iron alone
be present, the glass will remain transparent, and of a green or
bluish-green colour; but, on the contrary, if the added substance
contained protoxide of iron, the glass on cooling will be marked with
 opake red patches, due to the reduction of the CuO to Cuº O, as
 before explained. Care must be taken not to continue the blast too
long, otherwise the suboxide of copper might be again oxidized, and
the whole of the protoxide of iron converted into peroxide. After
 one or two trials, however, no error can possibly arise.
    This reaction is not prevented by the presence of silica or other
 acids. Amongst the silicates, the hedenbergite (a variety of au
gite) 3CaC), 2SiO3 + 3 FeO,2SiO3, the dark-coloured hornblendes
 §6) Sio-3Feo,2SiO5, Herries(3.3SiO5)+2(Feo,sio),
 and other minerals, give very positive results.
     Finally, it will be perceived that in certain cases the protoxide of
 iron, either alone or in combination as a salt, may serve to replace
 tin in the detection of oxide of copper by the blowpipe. For in
 stance, when testing for minute portions of copper with borax on
 the platinum wire, the glass must be removed to a piece of charcoal
 $f we wish to render evident the red suboxide by means, of tin; for
  °ºrwise the end of the wire would be destroyed, the tin forming
  With,” a fusible alloy. By employing, however, a small fragment of
  sulphate of iron to ensure this reduction, the bead may still be re
  tained 9 tº platinum wire; and we shall thus effect a saving of
  time and trouba, and preserve our charcoal for other experiments,
  an advantage of Ir, little consequence when travelling, or in situa
  tions where good charcoal is not easily procurable. Nevertheless,
  it must be confessed, that under other circumstances, tin is, for this
 purpose, the better reagent ºf the two.—From the Chemical Gazette

     ON THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL METALS IN THE HUMAN
             BLOOD, AND THE FIXED SALTs IT contAINS.
 . M. Millon states, that when blood flowing from a vein is received
 into about three times its bulk of water, and after this dilution is

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              311
introduced into a bottle of chlorine gas, it coagulates, becomes of a
brown colour, and forms a gray amorphous mass, in which the orga
nization of the red particles entirely disappears. When it is thrown
upon a cloth and pressed, a liquid flows from it which filters rapidly
and remains limpid.
   If this reaction be minutely examined, it is found that a peculiar
development of the elements of the blood has occurred. The orga
nized portions are found almost entirely in the coagulated portion;
while, on the contrary, all the saline principles are collected in the
liquid.
   This separation is so perfect, that when the coagulum is first
washed and afterwards burnt, it is destroyed without leaving any
residue. On the other hand, the liquid evaporated to dryness and
burnt in the organic analysis tube, yields so little carbonic acid, that
it cannot be estimated at more than 1 per cent, of the organic matter
of the blood, which chlorine does not coagulate.
   It is easy to determine that the coagulum furnished by the organic
principles does not contain the fixed salts of the blood, and does not
condense them, but contains such a quantity only as is proportional
to the quantity of the water with which it is impregnated; so that
if the water in which the blood is received be weighed, and it be again
weighed afterwards, a known weight of the filtered liquid may be
acted upon as a determinate quantity of the blood
   This liquid is so proper for all analytical researches, whether qua
litative or quantitative, that the fixed salts of the blood are immedi
ately discovered and their quantity ascertained. To give some idea
of this rapidity, two or three minutes are sufficient to obtain from
the blood even the iron which it contains, in the state of a limpid
solution, in which all the reactions of this metal are discoverable.
   The other fixed salts are also recognized, and their quantity deter
mined, without incurring the tediousness and well-known difficulties
attendant upon the calcination of organic matters.
   This method is, in fact, an analysis of the fixed salts of the blood
in the humid way: it cannot fail to be advantageously applied to
other tissues, and to other liquids of the animal ceconomy; added to
which, the most repulsive organic matters are by the action of the
chlorine converted into common saline solutions.
   The facility of isolating the saline portion of the blood leads to
other results well-worthy of notice. Human blood is known always
to contain silica, manganese, lead and copper. The proportion of
silica and of the metals is sufficient to prevent the necessity of any
peculiar modification in the analysis. After having evaporated to
 dryness the liquor left after the action of the chlorine, the residue is
 to be calcined for a short time, to get rid of the small quantity of
 organic matter which the chlorine has not rendered insoluble. The
 insoluble  portion of the ashes is then to be treated like a mineral, in
 which the quantities of silica, lead, copper, and manganese are to be
 determined. It is found that 100 parts of the insoluble residue of
 ashes of the blood yield—

 312          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.

                    Manganese. . . . . . 10 to 24 ..
 After this determination, so easily effected, it became a curious sub
ject of inquiry, whether the copper and the lead are disseminated
 throughout the whole mass of the blood, or if, as happens with the
 iron, they are confined to the red particles.
    Experience has left no doubt on this subject. One kilogramme
 of the clot, carefully separated from the serum of many bleedings,
 yielded 0.083 gr. of lead and copper; one kilogramme of serum se
 parated from the preceding clot yielded only 0.003 gr. of these two
 metals. These three milligrammes of lead and copper contained in
 the serum, ought undoubtedly to be attributed to the red globules
 dissolved or suspended in the lymph.
    It appears, then, that the copper and the lead are not diffused
throughout the blood, but are fixed with the iron in the globules;
 and everything leads to the conclusion that they contribute, as it
does, to organization and to life. Do they exert a decided influ
 ence on the health 2     Does chlorosis exist on account of deficiency
 of copper, lead and manganese ? or is their excess the secret cause
 of any obscure and disordered affection ? Therapeutics ought to
answer these questions, and enlighten us in its turn.        Legal medi
cine, on its part, will perhaps draw up useful hints as to the per
manent presence of these metallic poisons, and with respect to their
enormous variations, even in the midst of life.—Comptes Rendus,

ON THE ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF CRYSTALLIZED MINERALS,
                            BY M. EBELMEN.
   The author observes, that hitherto only two methods have been
employed to obtain crystallized and definite combinations in the dry
way. One consists in submitting to igneous fusion bodies, either
simple or compound, alone or mixed with each other in certain pro
portions proper to constitute definite compounds.       It often happens,
in this case, that crystals are formed and are isolated throughout
the fused mass during its cooling. It is in this way that various
compounds which have been isolated, have been found in the pro
ducts of glass-houses, and in the scoriae of metallurgic processes,
which M. Mitscherlich has found perfectly to resemble the products
of the mineral kingdom. It is by the same method that M. Berthier
has prepared a certain number of crystallized borates and silicates.
It has as yet been applied only to compounds which are fusible at
the temperature of the furnaces to which the mixture of substances
is exposed.             -
   The second method can only be employed with compounds which
are distillable or volatile. It has long been known to chemists by
the name of sublimation.
   The process which M. Ebelmen has employed is perfectly new,

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                313
and quite different from the two preceding. The object was to
discover a substance which possesses, at a high temperature, the
property of water at common temperatures, or a little higher, with
respect to the substances which it holds in solution. It is well-known
that the evaporation of the water admits of the formation of many
crystallized bodies.
   It is well-known that there are some substances which are volati
lized at very high temperatures, and which are nevertheless powerful
solvents, when in fusion, of the greater number of metallic oxides;
among these there may be cited boracic acid, borate of soda, phos
phoric acid, and the alkaline phosphates. It seemed reasonable to
suppose that, by employing some one of these substances with cal
culated proportions of certain oxides, and exposing the mixture to
a high temperature in open vessels, crystallized combinations might
be obtained by the evaporation of the solvent. Experiment perfectly
confirmed this conjecture.
   The author commences with the production of various minerals,
which may be considered as formed of a compound of one equivalent
of oxides constituted of two atoms of metal and three atoms of oxy
gen, with one equivalent of an oxide constituted of one atom of
oxygen and one of metal.
   The greater number of these minerals are very hard, and belong
to the class of precious stones; and they constitute a natural family,
comprehending a great number of species, as the spinelles, cymophane,
chromate of iron, oxidulated iron, &c. All these minerals, except
cymophane, are isomorphous, and generally crystallize in regular
octahedrons. The author attempted to produce some of these mi
nerals by the method just described.
   Spinelle.—This, as is well-known, is an aluminate of magnesia,
the formula of which is A12 O% MgO.       Nature presents it to us pos
sessing different colours. The red spinelle is that most valued by
lapidaries, and it owes its colour to about Tºndth of oxide of chro
mium. When the magnesia is partly replaced by protoxide of iron,
the varieties are more or less coloured and opake; all crystallize in
regular octahedrons, slightly or not at all modified, with the exception
of the variety known by the name of pleonaste, which crystallizes in
rhombic dodecahedrons.                                 -
   The hardness of the natural spinelle is 8; it scratchesquartz readily;
its density varies from 3:523 to 3'585.
   All varieties are infusible by the blowpipe. The red varieties
become black and opake; on cooling they assume, by transmitted
light, a greenish tint, and then their original colour is restored.
   M. Ebelmen then proceeds to state, that having weighed each of
the fixed matters separately which were to enter into the compound,
and the fused boracic acid reduced to powder, the whole was heated
on a sheet of platina in the mode which the author details. Various
precious stones were formed, as spinelle of various colours and co
lourless, and cymophane, and several other crystalline compounds.
To give an example of the method adopted, and the success attend
ing it, we will quote the formation of the rose-coloured spinelle.

                 Green oxide of chromium .... 0-10 to 0-15 gr.
   By heating this mixture, well-defined and brilliant crystals of a
rose-red colour were obtained, the form of which was easily distin
guished by a glass. They were regular octahedrons, truncated on
the twelve edges, constituting the octaedre émarginé of Haüy. Quartz
was readily scratched by the mass; by treating this with hydro
chloric acid repeatedly, the crystals were left unacted upon and se
parate; their density was 3’548, while that of the natural spinelle
varies from 3’523 to 3'585.

already made as to the composition of the rose spinelle. Various
other crystals of this substance when submitted to analysis showed
their agreement in composition with the natural minerals.-Ann. de
Ch. et de Phys., Fevrier 1848.
        ON THE CRYSTALLINE FORM OF METALLIC ZINC.
   M. J. Nicklès observes, that the crystalline form of pure zinc has
already been described by M. Noeggerath (Poggendorff’s Annalen,
vol. xxxix. p. 324), who found this metal in prisms with hexagonal
bases. Zinc, antimony and arsenic, are then the only crystalline
metals, the form of which does not belong to the regular system.
The metals of the magnesian series do however crystallize in this
 system ; and if zinc has hitherto formed an exception, it may be
hoped that dimorphism will eventually connect this metal with
the group of metals to which it belongs by its chemical properties;
and the author mentions that he is enabled to state this fact already
with respect to some crystals of pure zinc prepared by M. Favre
 according to the process of M. Jacquelain.
   These crystals are very distinct pentagonal dodecahedrons, very
similar to the form of iron pyrites and gray cobalt.
   This example of dimorphism is not unique among metals. Prof.
Miller, who has examined the crystalline form of tin, has shown that
it crystallizes in the system of the prism with a square base. M.
Frankenheim has observed the same metal crystallized in cubes; and
very lately M. G. Rose (Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. lv. p. 329)
has announced that platina and iridium are isodimorphous. Both
crystallize in the rhombohedric and cubic system.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            315
    According to these statements, it will not be surprising to observe
antimony and arsenic subject to the common law, and belong to the
regular system, which appears really to be that of all the metals.—

          ON THE CRYSTALLIZED MONOHYDRATE OF ZINC.
                           By M. J. NICKLEs.
    The author states that a mineral exists, and is known by the name
of cupreous hydrate of zinc, which contains the hydrates of zinc and
copper, and has the cleavages of a right rhombic prism; and wishing
to know the relation it might bear to the artificial monohydrate of
zinc, he prepared some of it to examine its crystalline form.
    Runge was the first who observed the formation of crystallized
hydrate of zinc on a pile, the elements of which, iron and zinc, were
immersed in ammonia, potash or soda. Schindler found it to con
sist of
                    Oxide of zinc. . . . . . . . . .  81-62
                    Water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18°36
 These numbers agree with calculation, which requires 81-71 of
 oxide and 18-29 water.      Two experiments gave M. Nicklès the same
 number.
    The process recommended by M. Runge is very simple.            It is
 sufficient to introduce iron and zinc into a bottle containing either
 potash or ammonia; after some time, small crystals of the monohy
 drate are deposited on the sides of the bottle; very pure hydrogen
 gas is given out during the action.
     This hydrate has the form of very limpid right rhombic prisms.
 When prepared from the zinc of commerce, these crystals frequently
 contain a black nucleus derived from the impurity of the zinc. This
 nucleus diminishes their limpidity, but renders the faces more re
 flective. The crystals are generally modified in the same manner. The
 summit is terminated by a bevil parallel to the great horizontal axis,
 and the lateral edges are generally truncated by a terminal face. It
 will be observed that these crystals belong to the same system as the
 hydrate of zinc and copper of mineralogists.
     The author states that some observations were made by him during
 the preparation of the crystals, which he transcribes: the laminated
  zinc of commerce is more readily attacked than the fused metal :
  some of the latter was introduced into ammonia, with another por
  tion of the same zinc laminated; the laminated zinc was dissolved
  in a short time, but the fused metal was hardly acted upon. When
  it is recollected that laminated zinc is denser than fused, the differ
  ence of solubility appears singular; but it is readily explained by
  considering the texture of both. In fact, when fused and cooled,
  zinc has a crystalline structure, which it loses completely by lamina
  ting; and it is well-known, that in general crystallized substances
   do not so readily dissolve as amorphous bodies.
      The state of the iron employed also influences the energy of the
   reaction; but in this case it is the less dense metal which acts the
   best.   Iron turnings favour the reaction, but laminated or forged

316            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 iron retards it. In the first case the metal has not lost its crystalline
 structure; in the second all crystallization is destroyed.        Moreover,
the homogeneity of the surface must also diminish the influence of
 laminated iron.                  -
    It will be observed, that this opposition of effects is subordinate to
 the part which the metal ought to play in the reaction; for the zinc
 only dissolves, the iron serves merely as a negative pole.
    The briskness of the action is measured by the hydrogen disen
 gaged. This is abundant with ammonia, potash or soda, when la
minated zinc and iron turnings are employed; but, on the contrary,
it is more or less slow, according as the conditions are varied : 1
part of iron turnings, 3 parts of laminated zinc, and 300 cubic cen
timetres of solution of ammonia, yielded crystals in ten days; the
iron did not dissolve, its action was constant, and it was requisite
merely to replace the zinc from time to time as it disappeared.
   The crystals are deposited wherever there are inequalities. They
 are very small if the action is rapid; but when it is moderately slow,
they are very well-formed. They are always very brilliant when ob
tained with ammonia; when with potash or soda, they are entirely
opake: this happens because the greater part of the hydrate of zinc
is decomposed in these solutions, and a magma is deposited which
contains but few crystals.
   An experiment in which iron was replaced by lead, gave in four
months rather large crystals, considering the quantity of ammonia
employed.
   In another experiment commenced the same day, there were em
ployed ammonia, copper turnings and laminated zinc ; after four
months there were deposited large prisms upon the inequalities of
the copper. It is to be observed, that during the whole of this time
the ammonia did not become blue, and yet it was left exposed to
the air. The author ascertained that in general the ammonia under
these circumstances is not rendered blue in the air, if the two metals
are completely immersed.
   This fact is so simple, that it is astonishing that it has not been long
known. Finally, it belongs to the series of observations which Davy
has made on the influence of saline solutions on copper. This metal,
in fact, cannot be attacked by oxygen, when in the presence of a
metal which is more electro-negative than it, in the medium under
consideration.
   This is so true, that if instead of zinc we make use of iron or tin,
or of metals in fact which are negative in ammonia with relation to
copper, the ammoniacal liquor becomes as blue in the air, at least as
rapidly as if copper alone were employed.
   The same does not occur if copper be immersed in a solution of
zincate of ammonia in contact with the air, but without metallic zinc.
The liquor, it is true, does not become coloured for some hours; but
in twenty-four hours small crystals of hydrate of zinc are formed*.
   * If the arrangement be so made as not to immerse the whole of the
copper in order to favour the absorption of oxygen, the precipitation is much
more rapid and abundant; the monohydrate is deposited as a granular
powder, mixed with a few crystals.

   The zinc has then been replaced by copper.            If this ammoniacal
solution of copper be agitated with zinc, this metal, conformably to
its greater affinity for oxygen, will in its turn displace the copper,
and it is precipitated upon the zinc in a very fine powder, and in a
short time the liquor ceases to be blackened by sulphuretted hydrogen.
   This, then, furnishes an example of reciprocal affinity which is
worthy of attention, and from which chemical analysis may derive
utility.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Janvier 1848.
       on THE HYDRATE of CADMIUM.                  By M. J. NICKLês.
   This hydrate may be obtained, like that of zinc, by means of am.
monia, iron and cadmium, or by causing copper to act upon an am
moniacal solution of oxide of cadmium.
    It is but slightly permanent, and is partially decomposed in the
liquid in which it is formed.     It would seem that this ready decom
position is owing to the energy of the reaction; at any rate the
author has obtained it perfectly homogeneous, operating slowly by
putting a strip of cadmium in communication with a bar of hardened
iron, and immersing the whole in a U-shaped tube full of ammonia.
    By allowing the ammoniacal mother-waters to stand, a fresh quan
tity of hydrate is deposited. If the surface of evaporation is great,
it is deposited in flocculi; if, on the contrary, the evaporation takes
place in an imperfectly corked bottle, it is formed in mammillated
masses, with traces of crystallization; and this is the form in which
the author has usually obtained it.
    M. Nicklès had only a small portion of this substance for analysis.
 It yielded—
                    Oxide of cadmium....           89-74

                                                  100'00
    Calculation requires 87-63 of oxide and 12:37 of water; the
substance had therefore evidently undergone some change previous
to analysis.-Ibid.
ACTION OF ACIDS AND ALKALIES ON ASPARAG IN AND ASPARTIC
                          ACID,     BY M. Pllt IA.
    The author observes, that all chemists who have examined aspa
ragin have observed the great tendency which it possesses to be de
composed by acids and alkalies, yielding ammonia and aspartic acid.
M. Liebig states, even aspartic acid, when boiled in strong hydro
chloric acid or fused with potash, is converted into ammonia and a
new acid.      M. Piria has arrived at a very different conclusion; he
finding that neither hydrochloric nor sulphuric acid sensibly acts on
aspartic acid, nor is any effect produced by nitric acid when free
from nitrous vapour. Asparagin, on the other hand, is decomposed
by various acids at a boiling heat, yielding ammonia, which combines
with the acid employed, and free aspartic acid.
    M. Piria found that crystallized asparagin, boiled for about an

3.18          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
hour in concentrated hydrochloric acid, gave a solution which yielded
no crystals on cooling.
    The liquid being evaporated to a syrupy consistence yielded cry         *
stalline laminae, which were very soluble in water, and deliquesced
by exposure to the air. M. Piria at first thought he had obtained
the new acid mentioned by Liebig ; but he found it was aspartic
 acid, and that the liquid contained sal-ammoniac. Aspartic acid
 treated in the same way yielded crystalline laminae of the acid un
 changed, but the solution contained no sal-ammoniac.
    It appears, therefore, that concentrated hydrochloric acid when
 heated converts asparagin into aspartic acid and ammonia, and by
 combining with the latter forms sal-ammoniac; the hydrochloric acid
 renders the aspartic acid soluble, without it the acid is scarcely soluble
 in cold water.
    Aspartic acid retains hydrochloric acid even after evaporation to
 dryness and heated to 212°; this dissolved in water abundantly pre
 cipitates nitrate of silver. The substance which M. Liebig supposed
 to be a new acid is a concentrated solution of aspartic and hydro
 chloric acids. With nitric acid, aspartic acid and nitrate of ammonia
  were obtained ; when pure nitric acid is employed, no nitrous or
 other gases are evolved.
    Aspartic acid obtained by means of nitric acid gave—

     The formula is CS HT NO3, as already determined.
     From these and various other experiments M. Piria has arrived at
  the following conclusions:—
     1st. Asparagin, discovered by Vauquelin and Robiquet in aspa
  ragus, and since in many other vegetables, exists in great abundance
  in vetches.
     2nd. Asparagin does not pre-exist in the seed, but is developed
  during germination and vegetation, either in the light or in the dark,
  and disappears at flowering time.
     3rd. Asparagin, hitherto regarded as a neutral body, possesses an
  acid reaction, and displaces acetic acid from its combination with
  oxide of copper; the compound of which with asparagin has for its
  formula CuO, C* Hi Nº O', and proves that asparagin, heated to
   212°F., that is, till it ceases to lose weight, still contains one equi
  valent of water separable by bases.
     4th. Asparagin dissolved in water with the presence of the juice
  of vetches, undergoes a kind of fermentation, by which it is converted
  into succinate of ammonia, appropriating four equivalents of hydrogen
  and two equivalents of oxygen.
     5th. Asparagin, boiled in pure hydrochloric acid, or in nitric acid
  free from nitrous acid, is converted into ammonia, which remains
  combined with the acid, and into aspartic acid, When fused with
                                                                          <U+017F>

 potash it disengages ammonia and afterwards hydrogen, and is
 changed into acetic and oxalic acids.
     6th. Asparagin and aspartic acid, treated with hyponitric acid, are
 converted, like the amides, into water, nitrogen, and into malic acid,
 which remains in the liquor. This result leads to the adoption of
 the opinion that these two bodies are amides of malic acid, corre
 sponding to oxamide and oxamic acid.—Ann, de Ch. et de Phys.,

     § I. Combination of Orygen with the permanent Gases.
     HE determination of the quantity of heat evolved during
        the combination of oxygen with hydrogen has occupied
at different periods some of the most distinguished cultivators
of chemical science, among whom we may cite the names of
Crawford, Lavoisier, Dalton, Davy, and in more recent times,
of Despretz and Dulong. The heat produced in other cases
of gaseous combination has been made the subject of investi
gation by Dalton, Davy and Dulong; but the methods em
ployed by the two former were so defective as to render their
results of comparatively little value.
   The experiments of Lavoisier were performed with his ca
lorimeter, an instrument capable of yielding accurate results
in certain cases, and when all due precautions are taken, but
for obvious reasons now rarely, if ever, employed in investi
gations of this kind. Of the method employed by Despretz
no detailed description, so far as I am aware, has been pub
lished. From the brief notice given by M. Cabart, we are
made acquainted with the general form of apparatus employed
by Dulong. It is evident from this description that Dulong's
mode of operating must have been entirely different from that
adopted in the present investigation. This circumstance
should be kept in mind in comparing the results.
   In the following experiments, the mixtures of the gases,
prepared in the same manner as for a common eudiometric

322     Dr. T. Andrews on the Heal disengaged during the
experiment, were introduced into a copper vessel (Plate III.
figs. 3 and 4), whose capacity was about 380 cubic centimetres.
A vessel made of thin sheet copper will resist the force of the
explosion of this quantity of even a mixture of olefiant gas and
oxygen. It was closed by a screw, as shown in the figure,
the head of which is perforated with a conical aperture (the
apex towards the outside) to admit a very tightly-fitting cork.
Through this cork a silver wire a a passes, and another b is
soldered to the side of the screw; these wires, as shown in the
figure, are connected by a very fine platina wire. When the
vessel is closed (fig. 3), the first silver wire is brought into
contact with a narrow band of copper cc, which surrounds the
upper edge of the vessel, but is at the same time insulated
from it.
    The vessel containing the mixed gases, and adjusted in the
manner described, was introduced into another of larger ca
pacity, which was then filled with water at the proper tempe
 rature. The latter was suspended in a cylinder having a
 moveable cover at both ends, and the whole was finally intro
 duced into an outer vessel, also of a cylindrical shape, and
 which was capable of being rapidly rotated round its shorter
 axis. The whole arrangement will be understood by inspect
 ing fig. 5, in which the several parts of the apparatus are re
presented.
    Before observing the initial temperature, the apparatus
 was rotated for sometime in order to establish a complete uni
 formity of temperature through all its parts. The apparatus
 being fixed in the position shown in fig. 5, the thermometer
 was next introduced through the apertures shown in the lids,
 and the temperature observed. On the removal of the ther
 mometer, the exterior of the apparatus was brought into con
 tact with one pole of a voltaic battery, while the other pole
 was passed through the water till it came into contact either
 with the central silver wire, or with the copper band (c c, fig. 3).
 The position of the wires at this period of the experiment
 is shown in fig. 5. By this arrangement the circuit was com
 pleted through the fine platina wire, which, becoming instantly
 ignited, caused the mixture to explode. The orifice of the
 calorimeter was then quickly closed with a good cork, the lid
 of the outer vessel shut down, and the whole rotated for thirty
 five seconds, in which short space of time the heat produced
 by the combination was found to be uniformly distributed
 through the apparatus. This rapid distribution of the heat
 was greatly facilitated by the presence of a small quantity of
 water in the inner vessel. The thermometer, previously
brought as nearly as possible to the expected temperature of

               Combination of Bodies with Orygen.            323
the liquid, was again introduced, and the increment of heat
observed.
   The duration of the experiment was so short, that scarcely
any correction for the cooling and heating influence of the air
was required. The temperature of the air was in general a
little above the mean between the initial and final temperatures
of the apparatus: the heat, however, was given out so rapidly,
that the latter must have been nearly at the final temperature
during the greater part of the time. After each experiment, the
apparatus was again rotated for a period of thirty-five seconds,
and the loss of heat from cooling observed. I have assumed
one-half of this loss to be the required correction, except in
the case of olefiant gas, when the initial temperature was a
little lower than usual. The correction so applied, it will be
seen, never exceeded 0°005 C.
   The thermal values of the different parts of the apparatus
in terms of water were as follows:—
           Copper 170 grms. x 0.095        . .   16:15
           Brass    111   ...   x 0.094 .   . .  10:43
           Solder    15   ...   x 0.043    .  .    0-64
           Leather, cork, &c.     .  .  .  .  .    0.48
           Thermal value      .   .  .  .  .  .  27-70
   The amount of water was always determined by weighing
the apparatus with its contents after each experiment, and
deducting the weight of the same when dry.
                     Hydrogen and Oxygen.
   The hydrogen gas was purified, according to the method
of M. Dumas, bypassing it through a series of tubes in which
it was successively exposed to solutions of the acetate of lead,
sulphate of silver, and hydrate of potash. It was afterwards
collected over water in a graduated vessel. In this way it
became contaminated with a small quantity of atmospheric
air, the amount of which it was necessary to ascertain with
precision. This was effected by an independent experiment,
in which the gas was collected in exactly the same manner.
In the case of other gases, the true volume was inferred from
the diminution which occurred after the explosion. The dif
ficulty of obtaining accurate results in experiments upon gases
collected over water (which for obvious reasons could not be
avoided in this inquiry) is so well-known to chemists, that I
deem it unnecessary to dwell upon this point. I have endea
voured in every case to determine by experiment, and to apply
the necessary corrections for absorption, &c., but at the same

   Hence we have for the heat evolved during the combination

a pressure of 29'92 in. (0.76 in.) with oxygen,-

   Taking the mean of these numbers, we deduce for the heat
produced during the combination of
         One litre hydrogen with oxygen . . 3036
         One litre oxygen with hydrogen . . 6072
         One gramme oxygen with hydrogen 4226
         One gramme hydrogen with oxygen 38808
   The unit to which these numbers are referred is the same
as that adopted by Dulong, viz. the amount of heat required
to raise, through one degree centigrade, one gramme of water
taken at the temperature at which the experiment is performed.
   The above results fully confirm the accuracy of Dulong's
experiments, the mean of which gives 3107 units for the heat
produced by the combustion of one litre of hydrogen gas.
   The heat obtained in the union of oxygen and hydrogen
arises from two distinct causes; one the chemical combination,
the other the condensation of the vapour formed by the com
bination. The latter is an accidental complication, which

                Combination of Bodies with Oxygen.                325
would not have interfered with the result if the experiment
had been performed at a temperature superior to 100°C. If
we assume the latent heat of steam at 20° to be 611 units, the
heat evolved by the condensation of 1.125 grn. steam will be
687, which, taken from 4226, leaves 3539 for the true heat due
to the chemical combination of 1 grm. oxygen with hydrogen;
and a similar correction may be applied to the other numbers.
                    Carbonic Oride and Oxygen.
   The carbonic oxide was prepared by the action of sulphuric
acid on oxalic acid, the carbonic acid formed during the pro
cess being absorbed by a solution of caustic potash. To en
sure complete combustion, an excess of oxygen was always
employed. The residual gas, after being deprived of its car
bonic acid, was measured, and the original volume of carbonic
oxide was deduced from the reduction of volume of the mix
ture after combustion.        As before, I have endeavoured to
correct the volumes actually found for the errors inevitable to
eudiometric experiments performed over water. A small
allowance was also made for the air extracted from the water
(about 20 grims.), which was always left in the inner vessel.
   In the subsequent tables, M designates in cubic centimetres
the volume of the gaseous mixture before combustion; Mc, the
same corrected for absorption by water during the transference
from one vessel into another, &c.; R, the volume of the residue
(consisting chiefly of the excess of oxygen) after combustion
and removal of the carbonic acid; RC, the same corrected.

by the combustion of one litre. The gas however was not free
 from empyreumatic odour.
    If we apply a similar correction for the heat produced by
 the condensation of the vapour of water to that employed be
 fore in the case of the combustion of hydrogen, we shall obtain
for the true heat due to the combination of one gramme of
oxygen with marsh gas 2931 units.

 to take into account the heat produced by the combustion of
 this portion of carbonic oxide. In order to ensure the com
plete combustion of the gas, and at the same time to diminish
 the force of the explosion, nearly four and a half volumes of
 oxygen were taken for every volume of olefiant gas.

   § II. Combination of Ovygen with Solid and Fluid Bodies.
    A considerable modification of the apparatus was required
for the determination of the heat produced during the combi
nation of solid and liquid substances with oxygen. The slow
ness of the combustion in most cases made it necessary to
operate upon a larger scale; and as the apparatus could no
longer be inverted, it was also necessary to distribute the heat
by a different method.                       -                -
    Fig. 1 exhibits the general form of the apparatus. The
combination took place in a copper vessel of about four litres
capacity. The combustible was placed in a platina cup, shown
in fig. 2, which is suspended from the lid of the copper vessel
by means of platina wires. A fourth wire, also of platina, but

328    Dr. T. Andrews on the Heat disengaged during the
insulated by being surrounded by a glass tube, descends
through an opening in the lid, and is connected below with the
platina cup through the medium of a very fine platina wire,
and above with a circular disc of copper, which is seen de
 tached in fig. 2, and in its proper position in fig. 1. Before
 the commencement of an experiment, this disc was firmly
 fixed to the lid of the copper vessel, but it was also carefully
insulated from it. Thus, by bringing the disc and any other
part of the copper vessel into contact with the opposite poles
of a voltaic battery, the fine platina wire could be instantly
ignited.
    In performing an experiment, the copper vessel was first
filled with pure oxygen gas, the lid carrying the platina cup,
&c. then introduced into its place, the copper disc attached
to the lid, and its metallic connexion with the insulated wire
c carefully secured. The whole was next placed in the calo
 rimeter, which contained the proper quantity of water previ
 ously cooled to the required temperature, and weighed. The
inner vessel was secured in its place by the vertical rod a a.
 The calorimeter was covered with a lid containing apertures
for the vertical rod and the thermometer, and the whole was
surrounded by an outer vessel of tin plate to prevent the effects
of radiation. The details of the arrangement will be obvious
from an inspection of fig. 1. By means of the horizontal arm
c c, the inner vessel could be agitated through the water in the
calorimeter. A pin shown at b restrained the motion of the
vertical rod within such limits that the inner vessel was never
permitted to rise during the agitation above the surface of the
water in the calorimeter. Upon the sides and bottom of the
inner vessel small hollow knobs were placed, which maintained
at all times a certain distance between the two vessels.
   Previous to the commencement of an experiment, the inner
vessel was gently moved up and down till every part of the
apparatus had acquired the same temperature. The ignition
was effected by a similar method to that already described in
the previous section, by bringing the vertical rod and the cop
per disc respectively into contact with the terminal wires of a
galvanic arrangement. The same aperture in the lid served
for the introduction of the thernmometer and afterwards of the
galvanic wire. . After the combination had begun, the inner
vessel was gently moved up and down within the calorimeter
for a sufficient period of time to allow, not only the combustion
to be completed, but the heat thereby produced to be uni
formly distributed through the whole of the apparatus. In
every experiment, after the observation of the final tempera
ture, the agitation was again repeated during two minutes, in
                                                                  /

               Combination of Bodies with Oxygen.           329
order to ascertain positively that the whole of the heat had
been obtained.                                               -
   The longer period of time occupied in these experiments
rendered the corrections for the cooling and heating influence
of the air of more importance than in the former observations.
To determine with absolute accuracy the value of these cor
rections, under the varying circumstances of each experiment,
would have been extremely difficult. It has therefore been
my endeavour so to arrange the experiments, that the amount
of correction to be applied in each case may be very small;
so small, indeed, that the application of an imperfect approxi
mation may be practically sufficient. From the effects of fric
tion, the proximity of the person of the observer and other
causes, the rate of heating was always greater than the rate of
cooling for equal differences between the temperature of the
air and of the apparatus; and for the same reasons, the latter
was found to maintain a stationary temperature only when the
thermometer in it indicated a temperature about 0°-3 C. higher
than that of the surrounding air. If we represent by a the
difference between the temperature of the air and of the ap
paratus, the correction V for the gain or loss of heat sustained
by the apparatus during m minutes will be expressed by the
formula,
      -            V= + m (a + 0°-3) 0°.0025.
   The values of V given by this expression agree within the
ranges of temperature which occurred in these experiments,
very closely with the direct results of observation.
   The usual time which elapsed between the observation of
the initial and final temperatures was sixteen minutes; and in
such cases it was assumed that the apparatus was at the
minimum temperature during one and a half minute, at the
maximum during eight minutes, and during the intermediate
period at the temperature of the air. In other cases, where
the combination took place more quickly, the corrections were
made on the assumption that the apparatus was at the minimum
point during one minute, and at the maximurn during one-half
of the whole time occupied by the experiment.
                       Carbon and Oxygen.
   The carbon was employed in the form of wood-charcoal.
It was purified by the method of M. Dumas from all oxidable
matters; first by ebullition in strong nitro-muriatic acid, and
afterwards by exposure for several hours at a strong red heat
to the action of dry chlorine gas. To expel all volatile com
pounds, it was finally exposed to a strong white heat under a
 layer of charcoal. The earthy impurities, together with a

380     Dr. T. Andrews on the Heat disengaged during the
certain portion of carbon (which, notwithstanding the great
excess of oxygen, always escaped combustion), remained in the
platina dish after each experiment. By deducting the weight
of this residue from that of the carbon originally taken, the
weight of the carbon consumed was immediately obtained.
To obtain with accuracy the weight of the charcoal, it was
introduced in the state of fine powder into the platina cup
already referred to; and after being heated nearly to ignition,
the latter was enclosed in a copper box, which, when covered
by its lid, communicated with the external air only by a very
small aperture. The whole was then allowed to cool in vacuo
over sulphuric acid; and when cold, a stream of dry air was
admitted into the receiver. The aperture in the lid being
now closed, the weight of the entire was determined.
   To obtain complete combustion, a very large excess of
oxygen was employed; but even with this precaution, car
bonic oxide was discovered in the residual gas in several of
the following experiments.
   In the subsequent tables, M designates the weight of the
substance burned; T, the temperature of the air, and the other
letters the same quantities as before.

    These numbers cannot be considered perfectly accurate,
but are probably a little below the truth, in consequence of
the formation of the small quantity of carbonic oxide to which
reference has already been made. The results of M. Dulong
differ from one another still more than the preceding; no
doubt from the operation of the same cause, namely the for
mation of variable quantities of carbonic oxide. His numbers
for one litre of oxygen consumed vary from 3770 to 4004
units, the mean result indicating 7288 units for the heat pro
duced during the combustion of one gramme of carbon. The
number given by Despretz for the same is 7912 units. The
ancient experiments of Lavoisier present a remarkable coin
cidence with the results now obtained; and considering the
form of apparatus employed, and the infant state of the science
at the time they were performed, are deserving of special re
ference, as furnishing a singular example of the accuracy and
ability by which so many of the works of that eminent philo
sopher are distinguished. He found that 1 lb. of carbon in
burning melted 96.5 lbs. of ice, which corresponds to 7624
units. In deducing the latter number, the latent heat of
water has been taken to be 79°, in accordance with the expe
riments of Provostaye and Desains. The results of Crawford
and Dalton on the heat evolved during the combustion of
charcoal are altogether erroneous”.
    * Since the above was written, the results of an extended inquiry into
 the same subject have been communicated to the French Academy by MM.
 Fabre and Silbermann. (Comptes Rendus, xx. 1565, and xxi. 944.) They
 find that the development of heat is considerably affected by the physical
 state in which the carbon exists before combustion. Thus the mean quan
 tity of heat disengaged, according to their experiments, by the diamond,
 amounts to 7824 units, by natural graphite to 7796, by artificial graphite
 to 7760, and by wood-charcoal to 8080 units. In these experiments, the
 quantity of carbonic oxide formed during each combustion was determined,
 and the result obtained by direct experiment was corrected accordingly.
 Considering the great importance of the subject, I have long intended to
 resume the inquiry, and have indeed already obtained some new results,
 but they are still in a very imperfect state. From a rude estimate of the
 quantity of carbonic oxide which was formed in the experiments described
 in the text, I inferred at the time that the true quantity of heat disengaged
 during the conversion of carbon into carbonic acid amounts to about 7900
  units, or nearly the number already obtained by Despretz. On repeating
 these experiments, I found that if the charcoal be suspended in a cage
  formed of fine platina wire instead of being placed in a cup, the combustion
  proceeds with such vivacity that not more than gººdth part of the carbon is
  converted into carbonic oxide. In a single experiment performed in this
  way with wood-charcoal (not however perfectly purified), I obtained 7860
  units of heat, which, corrected for the carbonic oxide formed, would cor
  respond to 788l units, as expressing the entire heat produced by the con
  version of carbon into carbonic acid. This nearly agrees with the experi
  ments of Fabre and Silbermann on the combustion of the diamond and

332     Dr. T. Andrews on the Heat disengaged during the
                            Sulphur and Oxygen.
   The sulphur was employed in the state of flowers of sulphur
deprived of the acid with which they are always contaminated
by washing. A small quantity of earthy residuum remained,
the weight of which was determined at the end of each expe
riment, and deducted from the original weight of the sulphur.
During the combustion, a small quantity of sulphuric acid
(corresponding to about 3 per cent. of the sulphur) was formed,
for which reason the experimental results must indicate a little
more than the true quantity of heat due to the conversion of
sulphur into sulphurous acid. The heat in these experiments
was given out in the course of eight minutes.

    Dulong's experiments indicate from 2452 to 2719 units of
heat for each gramme of sulphur burned.
graphite, but differs from their experiments with wood-charcoal itself.
Further researches are required to settle this difficult question. At present
I will only venture to direct attention to the apparently anomalous circum
stance in Fabre and Silbermann's results, that while wood-charcoal extricates
 so much more heat in combining with oxygen than graphite or the diamond,
 the two latter yield very nearly the same quantity of heat. The analogy
of the specific heats of these three forms of carbon is at variance with such
a result, as will immediately appear from the following comparison :-
                                   Specific heat        Heat of combination
                                    (Regnault).       (Fabre and Silbermann).
             Diamond............... 0.147                        7824
             Graphite...............  0-20)                      7778
             Wood-charcoal ...... 0.242                          8080
   Thus, while wood-charcoal has both a higher specific heat, and gives more

                       Alcohol and Oxygen.
   The alcohol employed was perfectly pure. Its density at
15° was 0-7959, and it was always redistilled from a large
excess of pure lime immediately before being used. The
principal difficulty in examining the heat produced by the
combustion of this substance, was to complete all the prelimi
nary arrangements a<U+017F>ter its introduction into the oxygen gas
so as to ignite it before any appreciable quantity had evapo
rated. The shortest time in which I was able to accomplish
this was seven minutes; but there can be little doubt that any
portion of alcohol which might rise into the state of vapour
during this time would become ignited along with the rest.
The duration of each experiment was five minutes.                -

tuted for the platina cup, as platina enters into combination
with phosphorus at the elevated temperature at which the latter
burns in oxygen gas. The experiment occupied ten minutes,
from the slowness with which the porcelain dish gave out its
heat.

   The zinc employed in the following experiments was care
fully distilled from the purest varieties of the metal in com
merce. It was scarcely attacked in the cold by dilute sul
phuric acid.     It still however contained 0-0005 lead : but this
trace of impurity could exercise no influence on such experi
ments as the present.               -
   To prevent the agglutination of the fine parts of the zinc
during the combustion, it was mixed in the state of very fine
filings with one-half its weight of pulverized quartz. The
ignition of the zinc was effected by the assistance of a small
portion of phosphorus (about 0.008 grm. in each experiment),
which was inflamed in the usual way by the voltaic battery.
In calculating the results, the heat produced by the combus
tion of the phosphorus was estimated and deducted.
   In the case of this metal, it would have been manifestly im
possible to collect the oxide formed by the combustion; nor
was it practicable to ascertain the weight of metallic zinc which
had escaped oxidation, as an alloy was formed in every expe
riment between the zinc and platina. To protect the platina
cup from being rapidly destroyed by the latter action, it was
even found necessary to place a thin sheet of platina below
the zinc, and this required to be renewed after every experi
ment.     For these reasons, no alternative remained but to
measure the oxygen consumed in each experiment. This was
effected by ascertaining, after the increment of temperature
had been observed, the volume of gas which had disappeared.
There was some difficulty in making this determination with
accuracy, but every possible precaution was taken to avoid
error.    In the next two tables, M is the volume of oxygen
consumed.      It was measured in a moist state.             -

    In the experiments with this and the remaining metals, the
amount of oxygen was ascertained by determining the increase
 of weight of the metal after the combustion was finished. The
 tin was mixed with half its weight of pulverized and recently
 ignited quartz, and the weight of the mixture carefully deter
 mined both before and after the experiment. To produce

336    Dr. T. Andrews on the Heat disengaged during the
ignition, only 0.001 grim. phosphorus was required. . The
heat evolved by the combustion of this weight of phosphorus
is nearly six units; but as a part entered into combination
with the tin and thus escaped combustion, I have taken only
four units from the final results as a correction.      The same
small quantity of phosphorus was found to be sufficient in all
the subsequent experiments with oxygen. In some instances,
indeed, its presence might have been wholly dispensed with ;
but as it rendered the success of the experiment in all cases
very certain, and at the same time introduced a very trifling
correction, I always employed it. In the tables which follow,

but the results in different trials did not agree well with one
another, and the combustion proceeded so slowly that nearly
half an hour was occupied in each experiment. It was assumed
in correcting for the cooling influence of the air, that the ap
paratus was at the maximum temperature during twenty-two

   The last four sets of experiments are favourable to the view
proposed, I believe, by Dulong, that the quantities of heat
produced by the combination of a metal and of its oxide with
oxygen are the same for equal quantities of oxygen absorbed.
Thus in the case of tin and its protoxide,
                     -  -          p           we have for one
gramme of combining oxygen the numbers—
                               4230
               *.              4349;
and for copper and its protoxide—

                               2288.
   The experiments of Dulong on tin and its protoxide agree
with this conclusion. I may remark, however, that the results
now obtained with the protoxide of copper can only be con
sidered to be approximations; and that further researches will
be necessary to discover whether the above differences will
disappear when the true numbers are exactly ascertained, or
be increased. The principle will in any case only apply to
metals, such as tin and copper, which are capable of forming
oxides inferior to those produced by their combustion in
oxygen gas.
   Among the gaseous combinations, the heat evolved by the
combustion of equal volumes of hydrogen and carbonic oxide
is nearly the same, viz. 3036 for one litre of the former, and
3057 for the same volume of the latter; but this agreement is
more apparent than real, and would entirely disappear if the
experiments were made under strictly identical circumstances,
that is, in such a way as to obtain the resulting compounds in
both cases in the aëriform state.    In fact, if we correct the
number expressing the heat due to the combustion of hydrogen
for the latent heat of the vapour of water, it will become re.
duced to 2540, a number which is far from identical with 3057.
   It has been inferred from the experiments of Dulong, that
the heat evolved in the combustion of a compound gas is the
same as that evolved in the combustion of its constituents.
This principle would lead to the very improbable conclusion,
that the separation of the elements of the compound gas is not

 XLVI. The ASTRoNoMER Roy AL's Remarks on Professor
    Challis's Theoretical Determination of the Velocity of Sound.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
THE publication of an essay in your Magazine is commonly
       understood to be a challenge to discussion. With this
understanding, I beg leave to transmit to you a few remarks
on a paper by my friend Professor Challis printed in the last
 Number of the Philosophical Magazine.
   The conclusions at which Professor Challis arrives are very
startling, that soniferous vibrations may be communicated
along a limited cylinder or “filament” of air without affecting
the air which surrounds it; and that the theoretical velocity of
sound is not that in which all mathematicians, who have hi
therto investigated the subject, have agreed.     I need not say
that such conclusions cannot be admitted without the most
distinct evidence; and I think that I shall be able to show
that this evidence is not to be found in Professor Challis's
paper.                                                           -
   I see no ground to question any important step (except one
of interpretation near the bottom of page 280) as far as page
281 line 5 from the bottom; and I will briefly call your atten
tion to the state in which the problem is there left by the
                               Z 2

340 The Astronomer Royal's Remarks on Prof. Challis's
mathematical investigation.       On page 278 a constant —b%
{whose sign is fixed without any ostensible reason, but for
which I shall hereafter give a reason} has been introduced;
it is indeterminate; there is no d priori reason for thinking
that it has any assignable value, or that it is needed at all:
but as it is possible that such a constant may be admissible,
it is quite proper that it should be introduced for trial in the
subsequent parts of the investigation. It is accordingly intro
duced and tried, and we immediately perceive that, if it has a
value different from zero, the result of non-diffusion of vibra
tions, which Professor Challis considers tacitly as the first
object to be secured, (see p. 281, line 10 from the bottom,)
cannot be obtained.       Most reasoners would conclude, either
that such a result is not legitimately to be expected, or that a
last trial should be made by supposing bºa O. Instead of this,
Professor Challis has recourse to another equation, extracted
from another memoir, and not demonstrated here, which he
considers more accurate than his equation (4.); and he then
uses this new equation in conjunction with equation (3.), and
thus obtains the startling results to which I have alluded.
   I must request you to record my protest against the intro
duction of this new equation. The equations (3.) and (4.)
have been fairly and honestly obtained together, and they
ought to be fairly and honestly retained together. One cannot
be obtained without the other, and one ought not to be changed
without reinvestigating the other and changing it if necessary.
   I must also object to the application of the word “approxi
mate” to the equation (4.). The equation is perfectly accu
rate as far as the first order of disturbances of particles, which
is the limit of the investigations in this paper.
   As the remainder of the paper, except the last paragraph,
is entirely founded upon the introduction of the new equation,
I conceive that it offers no evidence whatever for Professor
Challis's conclusions.
   I will now point out what I conceive to be the legitimate
conclusions from equations (3.) and (4.).
   (a.) We may suppose e=O or b-0. The equation (6.) is
then reduced to            -
                         £4.1.37-0
                         if t w if    — vº
and the equation (4.) is reduced to
                         dºf dif     =0.

The general solution of the former of these equations con

tains logarithms, and the general solution of the latter contains
exponentials and multiples of w and y; all of which, as they
may be infinite, are unsuited for our purposes. We can only
adopt the value f = constant; and the definition of the air
disturbance will be given by equation (8.) reduced to the form
                          dº?
                          dº?
                                  dº = 0,
                              —as d2?
from which the usually received consequences follow.
    (3.) We may suppose bº to have a value; and this value
must have the sign which Professor Challis has given it, as
otherwise the solution of equation (4.) would contain expo
mentials. The most general solution of the equation which I
can then give, free from exponentials, is
                      f=X. A cos(p++ qy-H B),
where
                                    2
                          p°+ q2 = º, =4e.
 Multiplying this expression by Professor Challis's expression
for p, namely,
                              e           e
              711 . cos((n- #)-- (n+ #)at c},
and expanding the product of the cosines, we find that the
 value off will be expressed by the two series of terms
       s.”. co: (-)-ºp, w—(n+ #)at-C).
     +3.”.cos((n- #)--pº-y- (n+ ..)at-C").
 Each of these represents a series of plane waves of indefinite
 extent, the position of the plane at any instant being defined
 by the equation
             (n– #)-per qy = a given quantity,
 Ol'
             (n- #)--pr—ay = a given quantity.
 If we put R for the normal drawn from the origin of co-ordi
 nates upon the former plane, it is easily found that
      R=

The velocity of the wave in the direction perpendicular to the
wave-plane is clearly a, as found by ordinary investigations.
   It appears from the form of this result, that though the
equation (4.) does not contain t, yet there is propagation of
motion in a direction inclined to 2, with lateral spreading to an
indefinite extent; and thus the inference by Professor Challis
on page 280 line 4 from the bottom is not supported.
   (y.) As we may combine as many of these plane waves as
we please, it follows that we may take an indefinitely great
number of plane waves, so arranged, that their normals shall
all be in a conical surface of which 2 is the axis, and shall
make with each other equal small angles. The former con
dition, it is easily seen, is obtained by making
                         b             b    .
                   p=    : cost,    q=;’ sin ( ;
and the latter, by supposing the small increments of 0, in
passing from the normal of one wave to that of another, to be
equal. Also let w be the angle which the plane passing through
the point ayz and the axis of & makes with the axis of a, so
that was r. cos w, y = r. sin w. Then the expression for f
becomes                                                -
                 s.Acos(#co. 6-w)+B},                -
or, as our summation is now supposed to apply only to a series
of waves for which 0 varies by very small equal quantities,

         On the Constitution of the Luminiferous Ather.        343
    This series is precisely that which Professor Challis has
found on page 281. And thus it appears that the solution in
which that series is concerned does in reality express the in
terference of an indefinite number of plane waves, all travelling
with the velocity assigned by the ordinary theory, and all in
definitely extended in the direction of their planes. These
waves cannot all originate from one source, and therefore this
solution does not relate to the problem of sound, in its ordi
nary acceptation.
   I will only further allude to the difficulty to which Professor
Challis adverts in his last paragraph. The difficulty must
arise, in some way, from misunderstanding on words. The
most trifling examination of the process in the investigation of
the velocity of sound serves to show that the velocity does not
depend on the absolute pressure of the air in its normal state
of density, but upon the proportion of the change of pressure
to the change of density. This is increased by the suddenness of
condensation in one part, which when the elastic force is great
makes it still greater, and by the suddenness of rarefaction in
another part, which when the elastic force is small makes it
still smaller; thus in both ways increasing the change of
pressure.                             -

XLVII. On the Constitution of the Luminiferous AEther.          By
   G. G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Cam
   bridge*.
     HE phaenomenon of aberration may be reconciled with
       the undulatory theory of light, as I have already shown
(Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 9), without making the violent sup
position that the aether passes freely through the earth in its
motion round the sun, but supposing, on the contrary, that
the aether close to the surface of the earth is at rest relatively
to the earth. This explanation requires us to suppose the
motion of the aether to be such, that the expression usually
denoted by uda +vdy--wdz is an exact differential. It becomes
an interesting question to inquire on what physical properties
of the aether this sort of motion can be explained. Is it suffi
cient to consider the aether as an ordinary fluid, or must we
have recourse to some property which does not exist in ordi
nary fluids, or, to speak more correctly, the existence of which
                     * Communicated by the Author.

344         Mr. G. G. Stokes on the Constitution of
has not been made manifest in such fluids by any phaenomenon
hitherto observed? I have already attempted to offer an ex
planation on the latter supposition (Phil. Mag., vol xxix. p. 6).
Professor Challis, in his last communication, has considered
the aether as an ordinary fluid.
   In my paper last referred to, I have expressed my belief
that the motion for which uda + &c. is an exact differential,
which would take place if the aether were like an ordinary
fluid, would be unstable; I now propose to prove the same
mathematically, though by an indirect method.
   Even if we supposed light to arise from vibrations of the
aether accompanied by condensations and rarefactions, analo
gous to the vibrations of the air in the case of sound, since such
vibrations would be propagated with about 10,000 times the
velocity of the earth, we might without sensible error neglect
the condensation of the aether in the motion which we are
considering.    As far as the case in hand is concerned, Pro
fessor Challis might have regarded p as constant, and treated
p as he has treated s. Suppose, then, a sphere to be moving
uniformly in a homogeneous incompressible fluid, the motion
being such that the square of the velocity may be neglected.
There are many obvious phaenomena which clearly point out
the existence of a tangential force in fluids in motion, analo
gous in many respects to friction in the case of solids. When
this force is taken into account, the equations of motion be
come (Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, vol. viii. p. 297)

with similar equations for y and 2. In these equations the
square of the velocity is omitted, according to the supposition
made above, p is considered constant, and the fluid is supposed
not to be acted on by external forces. We have also the
equation of continuity
                        du    dv    dw
                                         =0, .    .   .  .   .  (2)
                        da    dy     dz
and the conditions, (1) that the fluid at the surface of the sphere
shall be at rest 1elatively to the surface, (2) that the velocity
shall vanish at an infinite distance.
   For my present purpose it is not requisite that the equa
tions such as (1.) should be known to be true experimentally;
if they we.e even known to be false they would be sufficient,
for they may be conceived to be true without mathematical
absurdity. My argument is this. If the motion for which
uda-H... is an exact differential, which would be obtained

                    the Luminiferous AEther.                   345
from the common equations, were stable, the motion which
would be obtained from equations (1.) would approach inde
finitely, as u vanished, to one for which udz-H... was an exact
differential, and therefore, for anything proved to the contrary,
the latter motion might be stable; but if, on the contrary, the
motion obtained from (1.) should turn out totally different
from one for which uda: + ... is an exact differential, the latter
kind of motion must necessarily be unstable.               -
   Conceive a velocity equal and opposite to that of the sphere
impressed both on the sphere and on the fluid. It is easy to
prove that ude--... will or will not be an exact differential
after the velocity is impressed, according as it was or was not
such before. The sphere is thus I educed to rest, and the
problem becomes one of steady motion. The solution which
I am about to give is extracted from some researches in which
I am engaged, but which are not at present published. It
would occupy far too much room in this Magazine to enter
into the mode of obtaining the solution: but this is not neces
sary; for it will probably be allowed that there is but one
solution of the equations in the case proposed, as indeed rea
dily follows from physical considerations, so that it will be
sufficient to give the result, which may be verified by differ
entiation.
   Let the centre of the sphere be taken for origin; let the
direction of the real motion of the sphere make with the axes
angles whose cosines are l, m, n, and let v be the real velocity
of the sphere; so that when the problem is reduced to one of
steady motion, the fluid at a distance from the sphere is moving
in the opposite direction with a velocity v. Let a be the
sphere's radius : then we have to satisfy the general equations
(1.) and (2.) with the particular conditions
       u=0, v=0, w=0, when r=a ; . . . . . (3.)
       u- —ly,    v= —my,      w= — ny, when r=co,           . (4.)
r being the distance of the point considered from the centre
of the sphere. It will be found that all the equations are
satisfied by the following values,

with symmetrical expressions for v and w.       II is here an arbi
trary constant, which evidently expresses the value of p at an
infinite distance.   Now the motion defined by the above ex

346           Mr. G. G. Stokes on the Constitution of
pressions does not tend, as p. vanishes, to become one for
which ude--... is an exact differential, and therefore the motion
which would be obtained by supposing uda + ... an exact
differential, and applying to the aether the common equations
of hydrodynamics, would be unstable. The proof supposes
the motion in question to be steady; but such it may be proved
to be, if the velocity of the earth be regarded as uniform, and
an equal and opposite velocity be conceived impressed both
on the earth and on the aether. Hence the stars would appear
to be displaced in a manner different from that expressed by
the well-known law of aberration.
   When, however, we take account of a tangential force in
the aether, depending, not on relative velocities, or at least not
on relative velocities only, but on relative displacements, it
then becomes possible, as I have shown (Phil. Mag., vol. xxix.
p. 6), to explain not only the perfect regularity of the motion,
but also the circumstance that uda + ... is an exact differential,
at least for the aether which occupies free space; for as regards
the motion of the aether which penetrates the air, whether
about the limits of the atmosphere or elsewhere, I do not
think it prudent, in the present state of our knowledge, to
enter into speculation; I prefer resting in the supposition that
wda' -- ... is an exact differential. According to this explana
tion, any nascent irregularity of motion, any nascent deviation
from the motion for which uda + ... is an exact differential, is
carried off into space, with the velocity of light, by transversal
vibrations, which as such are identical in their physical nature
with light, but which do not necessarily produce the sensation
of light, either because they are too feeble, as they probably
would be, or because their lengths of wave, if the vibrations
take place in regular series, fall beyond the limits of the visible
spectrum, or because they are discontinuous, and the sensa
tion of light may require the succession of a number of similar
vibrations. It is certainly curious that the astronomical phae
nomenon of the aberration of light should afford an argument
in support of the theory of transversal vibrations.
   Undoubtedly it does violence to the ideas that we should
have been likely to form a priori of the nature of the aether,
to assert that it must be regarded as an elastic solid in treating
of the vibrations of light. When, however, we consider the
wonderful simplicity of the explanations of the phaenomena of .
polarization, when we adopt the theory of transversal vibra
tions, and the difficulty, which to me at least appears quite
insurmountable, of explaining these phaenomena by any vibra
tions due to the condensation and rarefaction of an elastic
fluid such as air, it seems reasonable to suspend our judge
                   …                                             i

                      the Luminiferous AEther,                  347
 ment, and be content to learn from phaenomena the existence
 of forces which we should not beforehand have expected. The
 explanations which I had in view are those which belong to
 the geometrical part of the theory; but the deduction, from
 dynamical calculations, of the laws which in the geometrical
 theory take the place of observed facts must not be overlooked,
 although here the evidence is of a much more complicated
character.
   The following illustration is advanced, not so much as ex
 plaining the real nature of the aether, as for the sake of offering
a plausible mode of conceiving how the apparently opposite
properties of solidity and fluidity which we must attribute to
the aether may be reconciled.
   Suppose a small quantity of glue dissolved in a little water,
so as to form a stiffjelly. This jelly forms in fact an elastic
solid: it may be constrained, and it will resist constraint, and
return to its original form when the constraining force is re
moved, by virtue of its elasticity; but if we constrain it too
far it will break. Suppose now the quantity of water in which
the glue is dissolved to be doubled, trebled, and so on, till at
last we have a pint or a quart of glue water. The jelly will
thus become thinner and thinner, and the amount of con
straining force which it can bear without being dislocated will
become less and less.      At last it will become so far fluid as to
mend itself again as soon as it is dislocated. Yet there seems
hardly sufficient reason for supposing that at a certain stage
of the dilution the tangential force whereby it resists constraint
ceases all of a sudden.     In order that the medium should not
be dislocated, and therefore should have to be treated as an
elastic solid, it is only necessary that the amount of constraint
should be very small. The medium would however be what
we should call a fluid, as regards the motion of solid bodies
through it. The velocity of propagation of normal vibrations
in our medium would be nearly the same as that of sound in
water; the velocity of propagation of transversal vibrations,
depending as it does on the tangential elasticity, would become
very small. Conceive now a medium having similar proper
ties, but incomparably rarer than air, and we have a medium
such as we may conceive the aether to be, a fluid as regards
the motion of the earth and planets through it, an elastic solid
as regards the small vibrations which constitute light. Per
haps we should get nearer to the true nature of the aether by
conceiving a medium bearing the same relation to air that thin
jelly or glue water bears to pure water. The sluggish trans

200,000 miles in a second : we should expect, d priori, the
velocity of propagation of normal vibrations to be incompa
rably greater. This is just the conclusion to which we are led
quite independently, from dynamical principles of the greatest
generality, combined with the observed phaenomena of optics”.
   I take this opportunity of making a few remarks on my
explanation of aberration (Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 9), more
especially as Professor Challis's words at page 168 of the pre
sent volume would naturally lead to the idea, which, however,
I believe was not intended, that I had only explained the
change in the direction of the normal to a wave of light, so
that something was wanting to complete, on the suppositions
adopted, the explanation of aberration. To prevent misap
prehension, I would observe, that in the explanation of aber
ration I here include the explanation of the rectilinear propa
gation of light, if the explanation of aberration be divided into
two parts; the first, the explanation of rectilinear propagation;
the second, the explanation of aberration on the assumption
of rectilinear propagation. To my own mind, the undulatory
theory cannot be said to explain aberration unless it explains,
either rectilinear propagation, or what is equivalent to it; for
had the stars never been observed, I should have thought it
excessively improbable that the path of a ray was rectilinear
in the neighbourhood of the earth. As to the necessity for
an explanation of aberration on any theory of light, I quite
agree with Professor Challis, as he has stated. Indeed, if I
ever appeared to differ from him on this point, it was not be
cause I held a different opinion, but because I failed to catch
his meaning.
    In my first paper on aberration, it is true that I did not
investigate the nature of the path of a ray of light in space;
but this was only because the method I employed did not
require any such investigation. I showed that, on the sup
positions adopted, the path of a ray, not in space but relatively
to the earth, was in the immediate neighbourhood of the ob
server directed to the apparent place of the heavenly body
from which it came, that is, its place as affected by the ob
served aberration; and that was sufficient for my purpose.
My explanation was not even deficient in consequence of not
taking account of the light coming from the wire to which the
star was referred; for according to my method, everything
was reduced to the case in which the earth and the aether in
its immediate neighbourhood are supposed to be at rest; so

flexion and Refraction of Light.—Cambridge Philosophical Transactions,

that there was no more occasion to notice explicitly the light
coming from the wires, than there would have been if the
earth had really been at rest. While, however, I would vin
dicate my explanation from any flaw or deficiency of reasoning
(unless the not noticing formally and explicitly the light coming
from the wires be regarded as such), I allow that, without
investigation, I fancied the path of a ray in space to be curvi
linear. It was first virtually proved by Professor Challis,
though not explicitly stated, that the path was rectilinear
throughout. Consequently the angle peq(Phil. Mag., vol.xxvii.
p. 14), which I argued was insensible, is in fact zero. The
method which consists in considering the rectilinear propa
gation of light as resulting from the supposition that udz-i-...
is an exact differential, and then the law of aberration as
resulting from the rectilinear propagation, instead of consider
ing the whole at once, has the advantage of showing that we
are at liberty to suppose the velocity of the aether at the sur
face of the earth to be of any amount relatively to the surface.
I had not contemplated this case; for it was the precise ob
ject of my investigation to get rid of the apparent necessity of
supposing the aether to be rushing through the air and through
the earth itself as the earth moves round-the sun.
 XLVIII. On Shooting Stars. By J. P. Joule, Corresponding
   Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Turin, Secretary
   to the Literary and Philosophical Society, Manchester*.
     HAVE read with much interest the valuable papers on
      shooting stars inserted by Sir J. W. Lubbock in the
Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for February and
March. This philosopher seems to have placed the subject
in a fair way for satisfactory solution. He has advanced three
hypotheses to account for the sudden disappearance of these
bodies, the last of which he has enabled us to prove or dis
prove by actual observation.
   I have for a long time entertained an hypothesis with respect
to shooting stars, similar to that advocated by Chladni to ac
count for meteoric stones, and have reckoned the ignition of
these miniature planetary bodies by their violent collision with
our atmosphere, to be a remarkable illustration of the doctrine
of the equivalency of heat to mechanical power or vis viva. In
a popular lecture delivered in Manchester on the 28th of April
1847, I said, “You have, no doubt, frequently observed what
are called shooting stars, as they appear to emerge from the

dark sky of night, pursue a short and rapid course, burst, and
are dissipated in shining fragments. From the velocity with
which these bodies travel, there can be little doubt that they
are small planets which, in the course of their revolution round
the sun, are attracted and drawn to the earth.         Reflect for a
moment on the consequences which would ensue, if a hard
meteoric stone were to strike the room in which we are assem
bled with a velocity sixty times as great as that of a cannon
ball. The dire effects of such a collision are effectually pre
vented by the atmosphere surrounding our globe, by which
the velocity of the meteoric stone is checked, and its living
force converted into heat, which at last becomes so intense as
to melt the body and dissipate it in fragments too small pro
bably to be noticed in their fall to the ground. Hence it is,
that although multitudes of shooting stars appear every night,
few meteoric stones have been found, those few corroborating
the truth of our hypothesis by the marks of intense heat which
they bear on their surfaces*.”
   The likelihood of the above hypothesis will be rendered
evident, if we suppose a meteoric stone, of the size of a six
inch cube, to enter our atmosphere at the rate of eighteen
miles per second of time, the atmosphere being rhodth of its
density at the earth's surface. The resistance offered to the
motion of the stone will in this case be at least 51,600 lbs. ;
and if the stone traverse twenty miles with this amount of
resistance, sufficient heat will thereby be developed to give 1°
Fahrenheit to 6,967,980 lbs. of water. Of course by far the
largest portion of this heat will be given to the displaced air,
every particle of which will sustain the shock, whilst only the
surface of the stone will be in violent collision with the atmo
sphere. Hence the stone may be considered as placed in a
blast of intensely heated air, the heat being communicated
from the surface to the centre by conduction. Only a small
portion of the heat evolved will therefore be received by the
stone; but if we estimate it at only Tºndth, it will still be
equal to 1* Fahrenheit per 69,679 lbs. of water, a quantity
quite equal to the melting and dissipation of any materials of
which it may be composed.
   The dissolution of the stone will also be accelerated in most
cases by its breaking into    º        in consequence of the un
equal resistance experienced by different parts of its surface,
especially after its cohesion has been partially overcome by
heat.
   It appears to me that the varied phaenomena of meteoric
stones and shooting stars may all be explained in the above

varying from four to forty miles per second according to the
direction of their motions with respect to the earth, along with
their various sizes, will suffice to show why some of these
bodies are destroyed the instant they arrive in our atmosphere,
and why others, with diminished velocity, arrive at the earth's
surface.                  -
   I cannot but be filled with admiration and gratitude for the
wonderful provision thus made by the Author of nature for
the protection of his creatures. Were it not for the atmo
sphere which covers us with a shield, impenetrable in propor
tion to the violence which it is called upon to resist, we should
be continually exposed to a bombardment of the most fatal
and irresistible character. To say nothing of the larger stones,
no ordinary buildings could afford shelter from very small
particles striking at the velocity of eighteen miles per second.
Even dust flying at such a velocity would kill any animal ex
posed to it.

       GENTLEMEN,
 THE        inclosed letter appears to me to contain a very per
        spicuous statement of the character, present state, and
 ulterior modes of proceeding of the algebraic theory of equa
 tions; and I think it contains many important suggestions for
 those analysts who may hereafter give their attention to the
 subject. I have ventured to add a few notes, chiefly relative
 to numerical equations,—a subject to which particular but
 well-known circumstances have caused me to give much atten
 tion. These notes, I hope, will not be without their use.

       MY DEAR SIR,                            February 19, 1848.
     N our conversation of yesterday, I mentioned to you, an
       idea that has for some little time occupied my thoughts.
    * Communicated by Mr. Davies. For distinction, Mr. Davies's notes are
 printed in smaller type.                      -

352 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
 You will not be surprised to find that I now proceed to throw
that idea into form, and to execute my project of mapping out
 the theory of equations, and pointing out what parts of the
field have been occupied by writers on the subject, but more
especially by the authors of recent English treatises.
    Algebra, arithmetical and symbolical, is capable of division
 into three parts. The subject of identity might be made to
 constitute the first of these divisions; that of equality the
 second; and that of incongruity or absurdity the third. These
 divisions are of a purely theoretical character; practically
 speaking, the subjects of them are treated indiscriminately as
 occasion requires (a).
    (a). Of these three cases (which are perfectly distinct) it may be
 remarked, that the identity can only arise, from the values of the
 functions on both sides of the equation being essentially equivalent
 for all values of the terms that enter into the composition of the
cquation. It can never, therefore, arise in the equations which
express the conditions of a problem.    On the other hand, the second
is the result of expressing a problem algebraically; and it can never
appear as the result of an alleged theorem ; whilst the third may
make its appearance either from the expression of a theorem which
is not true, or from that of a problem, the conditions of which are
incompatible with each other. My views on this latter subject have
been briefly explained in an article (for temporary private reasons
given anonymously) which appeared awhile ago in the Phil. Mag.
vol. xxix. p. 171.
   It has been usual in treatises on algebra to speak of V-1 (or of
a-E<U+017F>, V-T) as though it were in some peculiar manner, the one
symbol of incongruity. It is, undoubtedly, the first form in which
contradictory conditions are usually encountered in algebra ; and,     º
possibly, with sufficient labour and ingenuity, all other forms or
indications of incongruity may be reduced to this type. Yet it is
altogether unnecessary to reduce, for instance, log (–1) as an
expression, or sin 0=2 as an equation to such a form ; and it would
manifestly, be a still greater waste of time to reduce more complex
functions to such a form when they already involve a perceptible
contradiction. As well might Euclid have imposed upon himself
the condition of reducing all his ea absurdo demonstrations to a con
tradiction of the 10th axiom, because his first demonstration of a
proposition by the method (prop. iv. book i.) happened to be so
effected.
   The assertion that one is equal to one, is an identity; that a
is equal to one, an equation; that two is equal to one, an absur
dity or contradiction. Whether they indicate identity, equality
or contradiction, these three species of proposition are all ex
hibited in algebra under the form of equations: thus,
                       1 = 1;   was l ;  2–1 ;

    with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics. 353
 but it is often a very difficult matter to determine whether
 what purports to be an equation in the strict sense of the term
 be really so, or whether it be not an identity or a contradiction.
    In one point of view, then, the whole of algebraic science
 may be said to be contained in the theory of equations. Even
 when the latter term is used in its restricted meaning, the
 theory is intimately connected with every part of the science,
and we find ourselves face to face with it at a very early period
of our progress into the domain of algebra.
    The vast and illimitable field comprehended under the
phrase theory of equations must undergo a minute subdivision
before we shall be in a condition, either to examine it with
anything like ease, or to arrive at a just appreciation of those
whose labours have advanced it to its present state, or to form
a proper estimate of what may be expected from future re
searches.
    Corresponding to each of the following topics there is a
distinct department of the theory of equations, and this di
stinctness we must keep steadily before us. The topics in
question are as follows:—
    I. The finite and rigorous solution of a given equation or
system of equations. II. The transformation of a given equa
tion into another of a different form.      III. The number of
solutions of a given equation or system of equations. IV. The
relations between the coefficients and roots of equations. V.
The nature of the roots. VI. The limits within which they
lie.   VII. Their numerical values.
    We may also regard the theory of equations as consisting of
two great parts: the theory of algebraic equations, and the
theory of numerical equations. In the former part, accurate
results are exclusively aimed at; and the algebraic theory may
be defined as that which treats of the rigorous solution and
transformation of equations, and the number and properties
of their roots symbolically considered; and we may here in
clude the theory of symmetric functions.
   The aim of the numerical theory is to ascertain the nature
and limits of the roots of equations, and to arrive at values
which shall enable us to satisfy equations, either accurately or
to any required degree of approximation. The subject of
transformation plays an important part in this as well as in the
algebraic theory.
   A literal equation may be treated either as an algebraic or
a numerical one. In the latter case the letters stand for ge
neralized numbers, and the processes applied to them are but
universal types or examples of those which are to be employed
when concrete are substituted for abstract numbers. It is only
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 32. No. 216. May 1848.           2 A

  354    Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
 in their possible application to particular numerical instances
  that such processes are of any value whatever.
     On the other hand, a numerical equation (as we may call
  an equation with numerical coefficients) may be treated as an
  algebraical one, that is to say, by the algebraical theory.
  We may obtain rigorous expressions for its roots, ascertain
 their number, discuss their relations to the coefficients, or
 transform the equation itself by rigorous processes and under
 exact forms, as well when the coefficients are numbers as when
 they are symbols. .
    The different branches of the subject will thus be distin
 guished by bearing in mind their end and object, and not
 by the circumstance of the equation under discussion being
 numerical or not in its form (b).
    (b). This distinction is very important, and has been too much
 overlooked by analysts. It does not, however, appear to be very
probable that the solution of numerical equations is ever likely to
 receive much improvement from the most extended researches into
 the algebraical theory. Even could we find “rigorous expressions
 for the roots of an equation in terms of its coefficients,” it is proved
by the algebraical theory, and justified also by analogy, that these
 “rigorous expressions” will contain radicals of a degree as high as
 the index of the equation itself. The roots to be extracted would
thus become immensely numerous in equations of only a moderately
 elevated degree. Now it is a remarkable fact, that by Horner's pro
 cess the gradual evolution of the figures of the root involves no
more labour than the similar evolution in a binomial equation of the
same degree. It hence follows that any system of solution which
should aim to present us with the radical expressions for the root,
would for all numerical purposes be utterly useless, since it would
add the most intolerable complication and labour to the practical
part of the process. This, too, would be the case, even were we to
bring into play the most powerful engines for extraction we possess,
viz. the methods of Horner and Weddle for the evolution of the
figures. The method proposed would be strikingly retrograde;
and those who have given the closest attention to the question
under this aspect are, I believe, fully satisfied that this stage (evolu
tion of the figures) has attained its final simplification. It is the
only one, however, of which this can be said.
    If by the order of an equation we denote the number of
unknown quantities which enter into it, an equation will be
completely defined when its degree and order are given. Now
equations of the first order present features so peculiar to
themselves, that it might almost be thought that the best
course would be to treat the theory of equations of that order
in the first instance and separately, and afterwards to engraft
on it such extensions as may be necessary for the purpose of

   with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics.            355
adapting it to the higher orders. This course I shall adopt
in pointing out the paths which discovery has taken; but it is
not perhaps the most strictly correct one; for in solving a
cubic by the method handed to us by Cardan, we have to
satisfy two simultaneous equations of the second order. Equa
tions of this order (and with them the process of elimination)
are, in fact, in the ordinary course of study, brought under our
notice before we come to the subject of cubics of the first
order; and perhaps the first example that we see of the trans
formation of an equation is presented in the solution of two
quadratic equations of the second order each of which has on
one side a number and on the other a homogeneous function
of the two unknowns.
   Engaged, then, on a subject matter that seems to set pre
cise classification at defiance, unless we take a view other than
the historical one of the solution of the cubic, I shall for the
present confine myself to the subject of equations which in
volve only one unknown quantity: and, first, to their solutions.
    1. The solution of linear and quadratic equations was un
derstood by the Hindoo algebraists, and the processes em
ployed did not differ in any essential respect from those now
in use (c). But something more than reduction and evolution
   (c). But the Hindú method of “completing the square” is cer
tainly more convenient in practice than the Italian one which is in
common use.      It is surprising, indeed, that the Hindú process is
not more generally insisted on in our elementary books, than we
find it to be.  Even where it is noticed at all, it is never so much
spoken of in respect to its utility as it is under the character of an
exotic curiosity, the chief merit of which arises from its being “old”
and being “Indian.”
was required for the purpose of solving a cubic. The prin
ciple employed by Tartalea (and Ferrei?) was that of render
ing the equation indeterminate by introducing two unknowns
instead of one.      The intróduction of two unknowns suffices
not only for the solution of a cubic, but also for that of a bi
quadratic, as has been shown by Pilatte (Annales de Mathé
matiques, tome ii. pp. 152–154). But Euler had previously
solved the biquadratic by substituting for a the sum of three
unknowns.
   The solution of Ferrari, the first in order of time, was
effected, not by substituting for a, but by giving the biqua
dratic a new form by means of a subsidiary quantity intro
duced for that purpose into the equation. I have shown (Phil.
Mag. S. 3. vol. xxii. pp. 502–503) that a cubic can be solved
by the same means.
   All these solutions are direct: they do not depend upon any
                                 2 A 2

356 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
 assumption as to the number of roots of the given equation.
 The solution of a biquadratic by Descartes is also a direct
 one; and the same remark applies to the solutions of a cubic
given by Tschirnhausen at pp. 206, 207 of the Acta Eruditorum
 (Leipsig) for 1683.
    Euler’s solution of a biquadratic, just alluded to, will be
found in a paper by him, at pp. 216–231 of the sixth volume
 of the Petersburgh Commentarii. His solution of a cubic
there given does not differ in any material respect from that
of Cardan; but Euler has exhibited both these solutions as
 consequences of one method. In fact, if we omit the radical
 signs which Euler attaches to the indeterminate quantities,
his method may in the case of cubics be said to be identical
 with Cardan's, and in that of biquadratics to be a legitimate
extension of it. Euler's solution of a biquadratic is often ex
hibited without the radical signs attached to the indeterminate
 quantities.
    The earlier processes given by Bezout for the solution of a
 cubic (Mém. de l'Acad. for 1762, pp. 23–25), and of a biqua
 dratic (Ibid. p. 52), are direct. But his subsequent ones
 (Mém. de l'Acad. for 1765, pp. 533–552), and those given by
 Euler in the ninth volume of the Novi Commentarii (pp. 70–
 98), are indirect. The fundamental assumption depends upon
our knowledge of the number of roots of a binomial equation
of the same degree as that under discussion.
    It must not be supposed that there is any inferiority in the
indirect methods; on the contrary, there is perhaps a greater
degree of uniformity and coherence in them than in the direct
processes. The method of Lagrange is an indirect one, and
depends essentially upon our knowledge of the number of roots
of a given equation, and of the theory of their symmetric func
tions.   To the indirect class must be added the method of
Spence, and that given by Murphy in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1837 (pp. 161-178), and commented on by
Sir W. R. Hamilton at pp. 256–259 of the eighteenth volume
of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.
   I shall not stop to discuss particular cases in which equa
tions admit of solution,-Demoivre's form of the equation of the
fifth degree for instance. Abel has however given very general
discussions of such cases, of which Dr. Peacock has given an
account at pp. 318-320 of the Sixth Report of the British
Association.
   Curious illustrations of the manner in which the different
departments of the theory of equations are, practically speaking,
blended one with the other, are afforded by the facts, that
before we can apply Cardan's rule to a cubic, we must deprive

    with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics. 357
 the equation of its second term, and so have recourse to
 a transformation, and that many important particulars re
 specting equations depend upon a knowledge of the number
 of their roots. IHow a knowledge of equations of the second
 order is necessary in Cardan's solution of a cubic, I have
 already remarked; but it remains to be observed, that in the
 transition from equations involving one to those involving two
 unknowns, we have the subject of elimination, which is inci
 dental to that transition, forced upon us. The present, then,
 would seem to be the proper place to discuss the subject. But
 such discussion is not now my object, except to the extent of
 remarking that, when the unknown quantities are sufficiently
numerous, the obstacles to the solution of a number of simul
 taneous equations involving those quantities do not arise from
elevation of degree incurred by elimination. That such ele
vation of degree may be avoided, has been shown by Mr.
Jerrard in his Mathematical Researches: as may be expected,
the number of unknowns must, in order to the application of
his processes, considerably exceed in number the given simul
taneous equations. The methods of Mr. Jerrard are in fact
indeterminate, and he has thrown open the gates that lead to
the higher parts of this species of analysis.
   Results similar to those of Mr. Jerrard may be obtained by
means of the method of vanishing groups. The latter method
will enable us to satisfy three homogeneous and simultaneous
quadratics between sia undetermined quantities without making
those quantities equal to zero or decomposing them, and without
having to solve other equations than a biquadratic, two qua
dratics, and two linear equations. And for this system of
homogeneous quadratics we may of course substitute three
ordinary quadratics between five unknowns, and arrive at the
same results by the same means.
  .The present appears to be a proper place for noticing the
subject of equations that have no root. An instance of such
an equation is given by Garnier at p. 335 of his Analyse
(Par. 1814). The subject of “congeneric surd equations”
was however first, I believe, discussed in anything like detail
by Horner in a letter to yourself, published in the year 1836
(Phil. Mag. vol. viii. pp. 43–50). In the last edition of Wood's
Algebra, doubts have been expressed as to the fact of the non
existence of roots of a surd equation; and it is suggested that
possibly the method of solution is at fault. But it may
easily be shown that no quantity other than a root of the
rational product of the surd congeners can satisfy any of those
congeners. Hence, when a congener is not satisfied by a root
of such product, it has no solution whatever; and I have

358 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
shown in the Mechanics' Magazine (current and last volumes),
that the symbolical impossibility or contradiction expressed by
such an equation is convertible into an arithmetical one (d).
    (d). Previous to my first noticing an equation of this class (in
Hind's Algebra) I had looked upon all attempts to prove that every
equation had at least one root, as a superfluous labour; and I know
that not a few algebraists still take the same view of it. The letter
of Mr. Horner's, referred to by Mr. Cockle, was in reply to one
which I addressed to Mr. Horner a few days before, when the sub
ject was new to me, respecting the particular equation referred to ;
and I think the question of fact, as to there being innumerable
 equations which have no root, is set at rest by the discussion in that
letter. Not only the fact, however, is there established, but also
 the true principle which runs through such equations: and whilst I
 have no reason to think that Mr. Horner was acquainted with
 Garnier's solution, I need not urge upon any one who compares
 what Garnier and Horner have done, the utter impossibility of the
 solution of the former having furnished any suggestion for the dis
 cussion of the latter. Mr. Cockle's supplementary discussion, re
 ferred to above, appears to me to complete the inquiry.
    As regards the doubt thrown out by the editor of Wood's Algebra,
 whether the fault be not in the method of searching for the root, it
 may be remarked that such conjectures are scarcely allowable in
 pure science except some method of bringing the question to a de
 cisive test be at least suggested.   It may further be remarked, that
 if we admit the proposed hypothesis, it would follow that, when the
 equation and its congener were reduced to a single equation free
 from radicals, this new equation would have a greater number of
 roots than it had units of dimension; viz. those alleged to belong
 to the surd equation, and those which are admitted to belong to its
 congener. This consequence is contradictory to one of the simplest
 and best established of all our propositions respecting the composition
 of equations; and it never could have occurred to the able editor of
 that valuable work when he proposed the hypothesis in question.
     2. The transformation by which the second term is taken
 away from an equation has been long known. In the case of
 a perfect cubic, it was absolutely necessary in order to the
 application of the rule of Cardan. This transformation is
 effected linearly, that is to say, the equation connecting
 the roots of the original and of the transformed equation
 only contains the first power of those roots, together with
 an arbitrary quantity, which is determined so as to satisfy the
 required condition. This it may be made to do by solving a
 linear equation. In the same manner, by determining the
  arbitrary quantity so as to satisfy a certain quadratic, cubic
  or biquadratic, the third, fourth, or fifth terms of the trans
 formed equation might be made to vanish. But the linear

     with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics. 359
  transformation is inadequate to the removal of more than one
  term at a time.
     To Tschirnhausen is due the introduction of quadratic and
  the suggestion of higher transformations. Without this im
  provement all progress in the theory of transformation would
  have been stopped. The two different quadratic transforma
  tions which he gives for the annihilation of the middle terms
  of a cubic are well-worthy of attention. In the first of them
  (Acta for 1683, p. 206), the equation which connects the roots
  of the original and transformed equations involves first and
  second powers of the former roots, and first powers only of
  the latter; but in the second transformation of a cubic (Ibid.
  p. 207) the case is reversed, and the original roots only enter
  to one dimension, while the roots of the transformed equation
  enter to two. To Tschirnhausen must be given a very ex
  alted position among the cultivators of the theory of equations.
     Elevation of degree from elimination would seem to impose
 insuperable obstacles to any material extension of Tschirn
 hausen’s views. However, by a combination of the indeter
 minate method with that of Tschirnhausen, Mr. Jerrard has
 overcome this difficulty; and as one of his earliest results, I
 may mention his transformation of the general equation of the
Jifth degree to a trinomial form. Mr. Jerrard has shown how
 to annihilate any three of its four middle terms. It is true
 that in the transformations of Tschirnhausen the transformed
 equations are indeterminate; but then no more indeterminate
 quantities are introduced than there are conditions to satisfy.
 The transformed equations of Mr. Jerrard are indeterminate 2.
 in another sense; they involve more disposable quantities than
 the number of conditions to be satisfied by the coefficients of
 the transformed equation. The difference between Tschirn
 hausen’s and the modern method of determining the roots of
 the original cubic, when those of the transformed are known,
 will be seen on comparing the course pursued at p. 206 of the
 Acta (1683) with that given at pp. 27–29 of Mr. Jerrard’s Re
 searches, and subsequently extended (Ibid. pp. 36–39). As to
 the eliminations requisite for the formation of the transformed
 equation, they may either be performed directly, or may be
 made to depend upon the theory of symmetric functions; and
 in the latter case, a knowledge of the number of the roots of
 a given equation is taken for granted. In effecting the trans
 formation above alluded to of the equation of the fifth degree,
 the principal difficulty consists in forming the new equation;
 that once done, the difficulty of giving the required form to
 its coefficients is not great. In its application to this trans
 formation, my method (of vanishing groups) only requires us

360     Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
to assume an expression consisting of four terms for the pur
pose of representing the root of the transformed equation.
Every diminution of the number of the terms of this expres
sion very greatly facilitates the formation of the transformed
equation.
   A purely indirect method of transformation is that which I
sent through you to the Philosophical Magazine, and which
will be found at pp. 383–384 of the twenty-sixth volume of that
work. It proceeds by modifying the roots at once.
   3. On our knowledge of the number of the roots of a given
equation is founded much of the theory of algebraic equations;
so that it becomes absolutely necessary that a demonstration
that the number of its roots equals the number of its dimen
sions should be found in every work treating of the subject.
So far as the algebraic theory is concerned, the demonstration
of Cauchy, of the existence of a root of an equation, is perhaps
the preferable one.
   4. The number of the roots of an equation once known to
be in general the same as the index of its dimensions, the
combination of the theory of symmetric functions with that of
equations at once ensues. By means of this combination, the
elimination requisite in the transformation of algebraic equa
tions is greatly facilitated. An instance of this occurs in the
improvements effected by Sir J. W. Lubbock in the processes
of Bezout, and in Mr. Jerrard's eliminations.           The latter
mathematician has made an important advance in this branch
of science, by preserving the notation unaltered in the case
where different terms of a symmetric function become identical.
   We thus see that indirect methods of elimination may be
preferable to direct ones; and the same theory of symmetric
functions which enables us to employ them with effect, is
equally essential to the efficiency of the (indirect) general me
thod of solving equations given by Lagrange. It is not my
intention to enter into the subject of the finite solution of equa
tions of the fifth degree; but, on the development of Lagrange's
method in such a case, there is much information to be ob
tained from a paper by Sir W. R. Hamilton (Transactions
of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xix. pp. 329–376) on the
 Formulae of Professor Badano.
   5. The rule of Descartes (or more properly perhaps of
 Harriot) enables us to ascertain the greatest number of posi
tive or of negative (real) roots that can possibly enter into a
given equation. The number of unreal roots is capable of
being infallibly ascertained by the criterion of Sturm ; but the
labour which its application requires is a serious objection (e).
   (e). This objection was, I believe, first made in the Phil. Mag.

   with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics.            361
vol. viii. pp. 408-409. Analysts were so enraptured with the theore
tical beauty of Sturm’s criterion, that some time elapsed before they
thought of testing its practical value—the only special value, indeed,
to which the author made the least pretension. So far is it deficient
in this respect, that it has not in the hands of any one whose pur
suits lead him to resolve numerical equations, been able to supersede
the method of Budan, indirect and sometimes unsatisfactory as this
is admitted on all hands to be.      Seldom, however, has so small a
degree of scientific service been so brilliantly rewarded; for the
French Academy elected him one of their own august body; and
the Royal Society awarded him a Royal Medal. Sturm, however,
has earned for himself a name of more enduring honour by his other
researches, than future times will accord to him for this once-eulo
gised criterion.
The same remark applies to that of Fourier and Lagrange.
I fully agree with the view that you have taken of this subject
in the last edition of Hutton's Course, and with your annend
ment of the criterion of De Gua, which forms a very pretty
corollary to the rule of signs.       The criterion of Budan is well
worthy of attention (f).
   (f). The criterion of Budan in the form in which he himself
presented it, is entirely useless; and I am bold to say that it would
not have attracted the least notice but for the form in which Mr.
Horner arranged the algorithm and explained the principle of it.
However (to use the language of Mr. Horner with respect to the
criterion of De Gua), the employment of the method is more effective
than might at first sight appear. For instance, under one aspect,
an application of the Hornerian transformation to the reciprocal
 equation is often effective, as is shown by Mr. Christie, Phil. Mag.
vol. xxi. p. 96; and other methods might be suggested but for the
 space they would occupy. I believe that those mathematicians who
 employ themselves on numerical solutions in this country, inva
riably employ Budan's criterion (either immediately or modified)—
 availing themselves, however, where possible from the occurrence
 of zero-coefficients in the transformees, of De Gua's as an auxiliary.
   The drawback upon Sturm’s method arises from the uncouth,
inartificial and laborious process of finding the common measure of
two integer functions of w.       The mere oeconomy of space and of
writing by a different arrangement of the work and by the use of
detached coefficients, which I first gave in the “Solutions of the
Questions in Hutton's Course" (1839), is altogether insufficient to
render the process a practicable one, except in very special cases.
The same may be said of Professor De Morgan's mode of working,
which is a little different from mine (Penny Cycl. art. INvolu
TION). Professor Young, in his “Dissertations” and in his “Theory
of Equations,” has given a method of taking two steps of the pro
cess at once, which is a material improvement.     It is, however, only
by the employment of some totally new consideration (I ought, per
haps, to say some new principle) as to the formation of those func

362 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
tions which occur in Sturm’s process, that we can look with any
degree of hope to obtaining the means of rendering Sturm’s criterion
of practical usefulness.
    Some very interesting discussions connected with this subject
may be consulted with advantage in Professor Young’s “Researches
on the Imaginary Roots of Numerical Equations” (1844). Those
founded on taking away the terms of the direct and reciprocal
equations by transformation are peculiarly elegant; and the entire
treatise bears witness to the justice with which the author's high
 scientific character is accorded to him by mathematicians in general.
 Perhaps I ought to add that a very faithful translation of Sturm's
Mémoire was published by Mr. W. H. Spiller, in 4to, 1837.
    6. On the subject of the limits within which the roots of
equations lie I shall make a few comments further on.
    7. Among those who have devised processes for determining
the numerical values of the roots of equations, the first place
must be given entirely and without reservation to Horner.
The extension of the approximative principle involved in the
extraction of the square root to the general solution of equations
was, it is true, arrived at by Vieta; but it is only by combining
that principle with an easy process that we can derive much
practical benefit from it. Practically speaking, the whole
method of approximation is due to Horner, for his process
alone renders it a working instrument. One splendid result
of his labours in this field was his invention of synthetic di
vision, which constitutes a radical, material, and important
improvement of one of the elementary processes of algebra,
and presents the curious spectacle of a simplification of such
a kind overlooked for centuries. For appropriate and simple
investigations of synthetic division science is indebted to you,
as she is for your zealous and unintermitting enforcement of
the views and rights of its illustrious inventor (g).
    (g). I am by no means sure that my mode of investigating the
synthetic division is more simple than Mr. Horner's, in any other
sense than that it is more elementary, and on that account better
adapted to the purposes of instruction. Of the two modes which
I have given, that first offered (Hutton's Course by Dr. Gregory,
11th ed. 1835) is found by experience to be the more easily com
prehended by young students: whilst as an investigation, in the
stricter sense of the term, that printed in the Mathematician (vol. i.
p. 74) seems to me the preferable one. A different method (but
which led to nearly the same praxis in reference to the single
purpose of transforming equations, though it was inapplicable to
many other important purposes which the synthetic division can
be employed te effect) was proposed a little after the synthetic divi
sion was made known by Mr. Peter Nicholson.         This method has
been repeatedly given in Nicholson and Rowbottom's Algebra, which

   with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics.           363
has gone through eight or perhaps nine editions; and it has been
recently reproduced by Mr. Christie in his Algebra for the use of
the Royal Military Academy, 1844.
   Mr. Horner first arrived at the method by considerations founded
on the doctrine of recurring series; and he was so well satisfied
with the investigation as he first gave it in a paper sent to the
Royal Society in 1823, that he never attempted any change. It is
easy to see, however, that a common principle runs through his in
vestigation and mine; though there may be very little in either
method to suggest the other. My own, indeed, occurred to me
almost momentarily, in the midst of my professional duties, at a time
when they included that subject.
   I feel it necessary once for all to say, that as far as regards the
subject of numerical equations, I have never had any object in view
further than to facilitate the operations of resolution and mainly to
render the remarkable methods of my deceased friend more gene
rally accessible and more facile in practice. As the possessor of
Mr. Horner's papers, I feel it to be due alike to my own honour
and to Mr. Horner's memory, never to publish anything of my own
on the subject.                            -
   Another method of approximation is that by recurring series,
a subject treated by Euler and other able mathematicians, and
to which Fourier has contributed considerable extensions.
This method is of great importance in the solution of equations
with unreal roots.
   It is not my intention to discuss at any length the different
methods that have been proposed for the numerical solution
of equations; but that of Mr. Weddle appears to be deser
ving of mention, as one of those which is likely to be generally
and permanently adopted in those cases for which it is more
peculiarly adapted.
    The series by which Murphy expresses a root (Theory of
Equations, art. 64, pp. 83–84) of an equation is most remark
able, not only in itself and for the process by which it is de
rived, but also for its principle of derivation, which is capable
of application in a variety of other cases.
    The principal treatises on the theory of equations in the
English language are those of Murphy, Hymers, Young, and
Stevenson.
    That of Murphy abounds in traces of the great genius of
that lamented analyst. I have just alluded to an interesting
feature of his work: amongst the many others I shall content
 myself with citing his discussion of the theorems of Fourier
respecting the solution of equations by recurring series. Ad
mitting the originality of the view taken by the latter philo
sopher, Murphy shows that he is incorrect in his details, and
supplies the necessary corrections.

  364 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations,
     If we put the subject of actual and practical numerical so
 lution out of the question, the work of Dr. Hymers is a most
 useful and excellent one. It devotes some space to the question
  of the limits of the roots, an inquiry of importance, inasmuch
 as it assists us in obtaining a first approximation. I observe
 that you prefer the method of trying the factors of the
 absolute term as an initial experiment (Hutton, p. 234) (h).
 Would it not be as well if the concluding chapter of Dr.
 Hymers’ work were removed to the end of that which treats of
 algebraic (rigorous) solution, and the connexion between the
 ordinary methods and that of Lagrange explicitly exhibited?
     (h). This is not quite the way in which I wished to be under
 stood : for I was then speaking of any proposed equation, that
 might contain integer roots, from which it is always desirable in the
 outset to clear it. When this is done, the method of superior and
 inferior limits will sometimes effect our purpose readily; though it
 is often so wide of the mark as to become practically inconvenient,
 if not absolutely useless.   I know of no infallible rule that can be
applied: and when I was a good deal accustomed to such com
putations, I found it to be most convenient to try the effect of dimi
nishing the roots by unit-transformations for a step or two; and if
this did not much alter the coefficients, to employ a similar process
with tens or hundreds, as the case may seem to require. If the
changes of the coefficients with a unit-transformation were great,
the use of ‘l or '01 as the quantities by which the roots were dimi
nished, always led with tolerable facility to the desired information.
    When, however, the coefficients are large, especially “the abso
lute term,” the employment of the reciprocal equation for this
purpose will be convenient: and in all cases, attention to punc
tuation (after the manner that numbers are “pointed off” for the
extraction of the square and cube roots) will greatly facilitate this
initial inquiry.   It is, however, unnecessary to say more upon such
a question, where, after all, our mode of proceeding is essentially
a tentative one.
    So far as the question of numerical solution is concerned,
the work of our friend Professor Young is without a rival.
In it the method of Horner is fully developed, and lucid and
laboriously calculated examples serve to exhibit it in all its real
utility (i). In the subject of algebraic equations, Mr. Young
    (i). It should have been added, that the Very Reverend the Dean
of Ely has also given Horner's process in his elaborate and most
valuable treatise on algebra; and that Dr. James Thompson of
Glasgow has also done the same in an elementary work on the same
subject. An improvement in the process of synthetic division has
also been given by the latter gentleman; and one very analogous
to it, but a little different in form, had been previously given by
Professor Christie in his Algebra, already mentioned. That promising

   with Mr. T. S. Davies's Notes on some of the Topics. 365
and able young analyst, Mr. Weddle, has also published a method
of solving numerical equations, as far as the evolution of the figures
of the root is concerned, which, like Horner's, is a thing per se. It
has, moreover, no one principle or idea in common with Horner's
method; and, of course, there can be nothing in common as to the
modes of investigation. Horner's consecutive corrections are addends
to the root already evolved: Weddle's are factors of it. Horner
uses as many columns as there are units in the dimension of the
equation : Weddle only employs the columns that have coefficients
in the given equation different from zero. Horner's is the briefer
and more manageable where the terms of the equation are nu
merous and the figures of the root required to be many; Weddle's
when the terms are few and the figures of the root not required to
be numerous. Weddle's may be benefited as to applicability by
such processes as Mr. Jerrard's for diminishing the number of terms
of the equation (if, indeed, the actual labour of doing this would
not more than counterbalance the opposite advantage): but such
transformations would not subserve Horner's process in the slightest
degree.
   §: the   valuable contributions of Professor De Morgan to the
illustration of Horner's process, and of his earnest enforcement of
its merits on all occasions, I ought to express the very high estimate
that I form. It would however only be “to gild refined gold” to
attempt that expression; and I need only refer to his articles in the
Penny Cyclopaedia and its Supplement, and to his paper in the Com
panion to the Almanac and the recent edition of his Elements of
Arithmetic.
has given a quadratic transformation, of which, if I recollect
right, there is no example in the treatises of Dr. Hymers or
Mr. Stevenson, and to which I think there is but one ap
proach in that of Murphy—I mean in his remarks on Sir J.
W. Lubbock's improvements in Bezout's processes. I think
that it was Professor Young who first introduced Sturm’s
theorem into this country; he has introduced considerable
improvements into its prairis. Upon this subject I concur
with the note at p. v. of the preface to your Hutton.
   The treatise of Mr. Stevenson is a very elegant one. Its
author has given what I conceive to be a very proper and
prominent position to Cauchy’s demonstration of the existence
of a root of an algebraic equation, from which the existence
of n roots may be arrived at without much difficulty (j).
   (j). Of the works enumerated by Mr. Cockle I am not disposed to
offer any general opinion; but I may remark, that Mr. Young's is
the only one amongst them which even professes to aim at giving
the actual practice of solution. Whatever other merits the several
works may have (and each has its merits), they are of an algebraical
 rather than of a numerical character : whilst in Young's, the alge

 866 Mr. J. Cockle's Analysis of the Theory of Equations.
braical theory itself is more fully developed than in any of the others
—and with quite as much skill and elegance.
    If I may be permitted to offer a few suggestions in connection
 with future inquiries on equations, they would be of the following
kind :-
    1. That the algebraic investigation should be as little cramped as
 possible by reference to the object of solving the numerical equa
 tions. The general properties of equations are of high interest and
 furnish exercise for transcendent skill, independently of all col
lateral practical applications of the results obtained. Any attempt
 to keep in view simultaneously two distinct purposes is calculated
 to frustrate the accomplishment of each. From the cornucopia (to
 adopt a happy metaphor of Sir John Herschel on another subject)
of results obtained by the algebraical investigation, some property
may fall out, that would effect all that is required in the numerical
investigation. Numerical aims, however, only clog the wings of the
general algebraic investigator; and if numerical solution shall be
benefited by such means, it will be only accidentally so—like
 Girard's spherical excess in the geodetical problem.
    2. That the attention of those who aim at the numerical solution
should be directed to obtaining more simple means (I mean less
laborious) of accomplishing the following purposes:—
    (2). Finding the equal roots.
    (3). Finding the limits between which the several roots lie
without transforming the equation and without the substitution of
particular numbers in any equation, either the original or any one
derived from it by any process whatever.
    (y). An infallible criterion whether the roots lying within a given
interval be real or imaginary—however closely the real ones may
approach to each other, and however small the value of 3 may be
in the expression 2+ 34/~I when they are imaginary.
   (3). The relations between the limiting values of an imaginary
pair, and the real and imaginary parts of that pair. “The real
part may lie in the positive region and yet the pair be indicated in
the negative region.”—Young, Researches, p. 54.
    (s). Supposing the roots of the given equation to be represented
by 2,-E<U+017F>l, and when the equation is of an odd degree (2n+1) we
introduce the new root 2, -a, and denote the corresponding odd
one by 2, + x, we shall have the equation converted into one per
haps better adapted to examination. If we can form two subsidiary
equations, one involving all the as and the other all the 6s; and
if we can moreover discover any criterion by which the proper assort
ment of as and 3s can be effected, the complete numerical solution
will be within our reach. It must be remarked that the 3s only
appear of even powers in the substitution, and hence we should get
at once a knowledge whether they involved the symbol w/-T.
   The method of Lagrange involves both the as and the 3s in one
expression, and possibly the proposal (e) may be supposed to be
mixed up in the method of that distinguished analyst; but to be
really effective, some method of separating the two parts of each

            Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.                   367
root is essential.   If we can effect this, we shall not only be able to
tell which roots are imaginary, but also to assign their values, if
such a term may be allowed in speaking of imaginaries.
   A very interesting discussion of the analogy between the methods
of Lagrange and Sturm, by Mr. R. Leslie Ellis, will be found in the
Cambridge Mathematical Journal, vol. ii. pp. 256–258.
   To the depression of equations and one or two other topics,
I do not think it desirable that these remarks should extend.

           the two diametral and circular sections, or the mean
semiaxis of the ellipsoid, which is also the radius of that con

constant and given, and if we still conceive the symbol p to
denote a variable vector, drawn from the centre of the ellip
soid as an origin, the equation (84.) will then express that this
vector p terminates in a point which is contained on a given
plane parallel to that one of the two cyclic planes of the ellip
soid which has for its equation
                    xp +px=0, (28.), art.44;
while the equation (85.) will express that the same vector p
terminates also on a given spheric surface, of which the vector
of the centre (drawn from the same centre of the ellipsoid) is
x, and of which the radius is =b. The system of the two
equations, (84), and (85.), expresses therefore that, for any
given value of the auxiliary vector A, or for any given value
of the scalar coefficient h in the formula (86.), the termi
nation of the vector p is contained on the circumference of
a given circle, which is the mutual intersection of the plane
(84.) and of the sphere (85.). And the equation (83.) of the
ellipsoid, as being derived, or at least derivable, by elimination
of A, from that system of equations (84.) and (85.), is thus seen
to express the known theorem, that the surface of an ellipsoid
may be regarded as the locus of a certain system of circular
circumferences, of which the planes are parallel to a fixed plane
of diametral and circular section.
   57. One set of the known circular sections of the ellipsoid,
in planes parallel to one of the two cyclic planes, may there
fore be assigned in this manner, as the result of a very simple
calculation; and the other set of such known circular sections,
parallel to the other cyclic plane, may be symbolically deter
mined, with equal facility, as the result of an entirely similar
process of calculation with quaternions. For if, instead of
                                                                    |

plane of the ellipsoid for which we have seen that
                     p-Hpi =0, (25.), art.44;
while the latter equation, namely (90.), is that of a new sphere,
with the same radius b as before, but with u for the vector of
its centre: which sphere (90.) determines, by its intersection
with the plane (89.), a new circle as the locus of the termina

equations (84.), (85.); which agrees with the known proper

  finite straight line as A, B ; that is, on the axis of that circum
  scribed cylinder of revolution which has been considered in
  former articles. The vectors of the points D, E, in the same
  construction of the ellipsoid, (if drawn from its centre as their
  origin,) having been seen to be respectively r—x and p, (com
  pare article 40,) the equation
                       ap+px=0 (16), art. 41,
  combined with (84.) and (86.), gives for their product the ex
  pressions:
                     (a –x)|p=x(-x)=h(-x)”; . . . (102.)
  and in general if two pairs of co-initial vectors, as here a -x, p,
  and A, 1–4, give, when respectively multiplied, one common
  scalar product, they terminate on four concircular points: the
  four points D, E, L, B are therefore contained on the circum
  ference of one common circle: and consequently the point L
  may be found by an elementary construction, derived from this
  simple calculation with quaternions, namely as the second
  point of intersection of the circle BDE with the straight line
  AB (which is situated in the plane of that circle). Again, the
  equations (85.) and (90.) give
-                           T(p—x)=T(p—p.); . . . . (103.)
  therefore the point E of the ellipsoid is the vertex of an isosceles
  triangle, constructed on LM as base; and the point M may thus
  be found as the intersection of the same straight line AB or AL,
  with a circle described round the point E as centre, and having
  its radius =EL=b- the mean semiaxis of the ellipsoid. When
  the two points L and M have thus been found, the third point
  N can then be deduced from them, in an equally simple geo
  metrical manner, by drawing parallels LN, MN to the sides
  Ac, Bc of the generating triangle ABC, from which the ellipsoid
  itself has been constructed; these sides LN, MN, of the new
  and variable triangle LMN, will thus be parallel to the two
  cyclic normals of the ellipsoid; and the foregoing analysis
  shows that they will be portions of the axes of the two circles,
  which are contained upon the surface of that ellipsoid, and
  pass through the point E on that surface: while the point N,
  of intersection of those two axes, is the centre of that common
  sphere (97.), which contains both those two circular sections.
   It is evident that this common sphere must touch the ellipsoid
  at E, since it is itself touched at that point by the two distinct
  tangents to the two circular sections of the surface; and hence
  we might infer that the semidiameter NE or #–p of the sphere,
  of which the length r has been assigned in the formula (99.),

and which is terminated at the point N by the plane of the
generating triangle, must coincide in direction with the normal
 y to the ellipsoid : of which latter normal the direction may
 thus be found by a simple geometrical construction, and an
 expression for it be obtained without the employment of dif
 ferentials. But to show that this geometrical result agrees
 with the symbolical expression already found for v, by means
 of differentials and quaternions, we have only to substitute, on
 the one hand, in the expression (98.) for £, the following values
 for h and h', derived from (84.), (86.), and from (89.), (91.):
                       _*P+P* . h'=

which has served to determine the normal vector of proximity
v, may be thus written:
            (x*—")°v= (–2)*p-H (xp_{-px) + x(p + p.); . (105.)

the results that had been previously obtained.

then one of the lately cited forms of the equation of the ellip
soid, namely the equation
                  T(p +px)= x*—iº (9.), art. 38,
takes easily, by the rules of this calculus, the new but analo
gous form :
                      T('p +px)= x*— ". . . . . . (109.)
The perfect similarity of these two forms, (9.) and (109.),
renders it evident that all the conclusions which have been
deduced from the one form can, with suitable and easy modi
fications, be deduced from the other also.        Thus if we still
regard the centre A as the origin of vectors, and treat '—x'
and —x' as the vectors of two new fixed points B' and c', we
may consider AB'c' as a new generating triangle, and may de
rive from it the same ellipsoid as before, by a geometrical pro
cess of generation or construction, which is similar in all re
spects to the process already assigned. (See the Numbers of

indeed are parallel by (107.) to the two old sides Ac and CB,
or to x and l, must have the directions of the two cyclic nor
mals; and the third new side, AB', or '—x', must be the axis
of a second cylinder of revolution, circumscribed round the same
ellipsoid. If we determine on this new axis two new points,

analogous to the recently considered vectors A and u, and

the common value of these three quotients being a new scalar,
but ; being still the same vector as before, namely that vector
which terminates in the point N, where the normal to the sur
face at E meets the common plane of the new and old gene
rating triangles, or the plane of the greatest and least axes of
the ellipsoid. It is easy hence to infer that the new variable tri
angle L'M'N is similar to the new generating triangle AB'c', and
similarly situated in the same fixed plane therewith ; and that
the sides L'N, M'N, having respectively the same directions as Ac',
B'c', have likewise the same directions as BC, AC, and therefore
also as MN, LN, or else directions opposite to these; in such a
manner that the two straight lines, L'M, M'L, must cross each
other in the point N. But these two lines may be regarded
as the diagonals of a certain quadrilateral inscribed in a circle,
namely the plane quadrilateral L'M'ML; of which the four cor
ners are, by (85.), (90.), and (111.), at one common and con
stant distance = b, from the variable point E of the ellipsoid.
If then we assume it as known that the vector bºy, which is in
direction opposite and is in length reciprocal to the perpen
dicular let fall from the centre A on the tangent plane at E,
must terminate in a point F on the surface of another ellipsoid,
reciprocal (in a well-known sense) to that former ellipsoid
which contains the point E itself, or the termination of the
vector p ; we may combine the recent results, so as to obtain
the following geometrical construction*, which serves to gene

sphere.
   61. Let then a sphere of constant magnitude, with centre E,
move so that it always intersects two fixed and mutually inter
secting straight lines, AB, AB', in four points L, M, L', M', of
which L and M are on AB, while L' and M' are on AB'; and let
one diagonal LM', of the inscribed quadrilateral LMM'L', be
constantly parallel to a third fixed line Ac, which will oblige
the other diagonal ML' of the same quadrilateral to move pa
rallel to a fourth fixed line Ac'. Let N be the point in which
the diagonals intersect, and draw AF equal and parallel to EN ;
so that AENF is a parallelogram: then the locus of the centre E
of the moving sphere is one ellipsoid, and the locus of the oppo
site corner F of the parallelogram is another ellipsoid reciprocal
thereto. These two ellipsoids have a common centre A, and
a common mean axis, which is equal to the diameter of the
moving sphere, and is a mean proportional between the great
est axis of either ellipsoid and the least axis of the other, of
which two last-mentioned axes the directions coincide.         Two
sides AE, AF, of the parallelogram AENF, are thus two semi
diameters which may be regarded as mutually reciprocal, one
of the one ellipsoid, and the other of the other: but because
they fall at opposite sides of the principal plane (containing
the four fixed lines and the greatest and least axes of the ellip
soids), it may be proper to call them, more fully, opposite re
ciprocal semidiameters; and to call the points E and F, in which
they terminate, opposite reciprocal points. The two other sides
EN, FN, of the same variable parallelogram, are the normals to
the two ellipsoids, meeting each other in the point N, upon
the same principal plane. In that plane, the two former fixed
lines, AB, AB', are the aares of two cylinders of revolution, cir
cumscribed about the first ellipsoid; and the two latter fixed
lines, AC, AC', are the two cyclic normals of the same first ellip
soid: while the diagonals, LM', ML', of the inscribed quadri
lateral in the construction, are the aves of the two circles on
 the surface of that first ellipsoid, which circles pass through the
point E, that is through the centre of the moving sphere; and
the intersection N of those two diagonals is the centre of an
other sphere, which cuts the first ellipsoid in the system of
those two circles: all which is easily adapted, by suitable in
terchanges, to the other or reciprocal ellipsoid, and flows with
facility from the quaternion equations above given.

     an elevated point, accessible or inaccessible, fia'ed or moveable,

  GEODESICAL                and astronomical operations very fre
        quently require the knowledge of the distance of a remote
 object. If the object be fixed, the ordinary processes of trigo
 nometry readily lead to the desired result. It is only neces
 sary to determine a base, and to measure, from each of its ex
 tremities, the angle between the other extremity and the object;
 we thus obtain the value of two angles and of the adjacent
 side, from which the triangle is easily resolved.
     But for the case in which the distant object is in motion,-
 a case of great importance, and which occurs in several stra
 tegical and cosmological problems, the operation is by no
 means so simple. It would be necessary first to measure a
 straight line, more or less extended, and to station at its ex
 tremities two observers, who at the same instant should direct
 the telescopes of their theodolites to the same point of the
object. When the point is simultaneously visible from the two
 stations, and the chronometers compared, and when above all
 the object preserves exactly its form, or only changes it imper
ceptibly, it is conceivable that this method may succeed; and
 the result will be more exact as the readings are repeated at
 shorter intervals, in order to lessen the probable errors by .
 means. But when these different circumstances do not exist,
 when there is only a single observer, or the object varies in
 appearance, or is not visible at the same time from both ex
 tremities of the base, then the execution of the process becomes
 impossible.
     Such are the objections which may be made to the method
proposed by M. Pouillett for estimating the height of the clouds,
a problem which has already attracted the attention of several
eminent philosophers, such as James Bernoullif, Brices, Lam
 bert||, and more recently M. Arago". The following is the
 method which I propose for its solution.

   Let us select in a motionless cloud, or in one which does not
move with too great velocity, any point N, fig. 1, distinguishable
                                 Fig. l
by its colour or peculiar form. Let us place ourselves on an
elevated point P, on the summit of a hill or a tower, or even
at the window of the upper story of a house. Let us have
under us a reflecting plane MM', such as a tranquil surface
of water or mercury, or a large horizontal glass. The angle
of incidence of a luminous ray which strikes a mirror being
equal to the angle of reflexion, it will suffice to determine the
angle d formed by the ray which reaches the eye directly from
the point N, with the ray PI which reaches it by reflexion in
I, and to estimate the length PI, in order to solve the problem.
   In fact, calling e the angle formed by the reflected ray PI
with the vertical PS, which passes through the centre of the
instrument with which the angle is taken, it is evident that the
angle l contained by the incident and reflected rays =2e. The
two angles d and l being known, it only remains to measure PI.
As it might be difficult to determine                   P
precisely the point I of the reflecting                 A.
surface, we may turn the telescope                   A \

   It is sufficient in practice to employ a circle placed vertically
and furnished with a tube without lenses. A metallic plate,
blackened and pierced at its centre with a small hole, serves
instead of an eye-glass. The tube, the interior of which is
likewise black, is furnished with cross wires, and a sufficient
length is given it to admit only the useful rays, and not those
which are reflected by objects surrounding the point which
is observed. The reflecting surface may be a pond, a lake, a
large sheet of water or mercury, &c.
   Beside its simplicity, the process which I have described,
and which evidently applies in the same cases as the other
methods which have been proposed, appears to me to offer
some advantages over them. It is absolutely independent of
the presence of the sun above the horizon. The larger the
base to be measured PI, the greater will be the approxima
tion. If the point N is only slowly moved, we may employ
Borda's method for the repetition of the angles, and thus limit
more nearly their exact value: we may, moreover, observe at
short intervals of time, and determine the velocity of transla
tion of the object,-a circumstance which it is often useful to
ascertain. We remark, lastly, that there is no longer any
possibility for a single observer to confound the point of vision
with other surrounding points. Now this confusion frequently
occurs in the case of a fleeting cloud, and which requires less
time to lose its form than is required, in M. Pouillet’s method,
for two observers to regain their post and observe after having
met to make their arrangements.
   If the wind or any other cause prevents the employment of
a liquid as the mirror, a very smooth silvered glass might be
substituted, of as large dimensions as possible, and be placed
horizontally by means of levels or screws, or thin wedges.

Results of Astronomical Observations made during the years 1834,
   1835, 1836, 1837, 1838, at the Cape of Good Hope; being the
   Completion of a Telescopic Survey of the whole Surface of the visible
   Heavens, commenced in 1825. By Sir John F. W. HERscHEL,
   Bart., K.H., &c. &c. London: Smith, Elder and Co. 1847.
A*      many of our readers may not have had an opportunity of
       perusing the exceedingly important and interesting volume
recently published under the above title, we propose to make a few
extracts from it for the purpose of giving them an idea of its prin
cipal contents. Where it may appear desirable (having regard to
our narrow limits) to condense or abridge, we shall make it a rule to
adhere as closely as may be to the language of the author.
   In his Introduction, the author states that the present work com
pletes a review of the sidereal heavens which he commenced in 1825,
with the object of re-examining the nebulae and clusters of stars dis
covered by Sir William Herschel in his Sweeps of the Heavens, and
described in three catalogues published in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1786, 1789 and 1802. The result of the re-examination
was given in a paper printed in the Phil. Trans. for 1833, in the
form of a catalogue arranged in the order of right ascension, and

containing 2306 nebulae and clusters, of which 1781 are identical
with objects occurring in Sir W. Herschel's catalogues or in other
works, and the remaining 525 are new. Besides nebulae and clus
ters, which were the special objects of attention, there were observed
in the course of the review between 3000 and 4000 double stars, of
all classes and orders, the positions of which, accompanied with a
great number of highly interesting remarks descriptive of their ap
pearance or peculiarities, were given in six catalogues which have
been published in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society.
Having completed this review, and having acquired during the eight
years' practice sufficient mastery of the instrument (a reflecting
telescope of 18+ inches clear aperture, and 20 feet in focal length),
and of the delicate process of polishing the specula, and being more
over strongly incited by the peculiar interest of the subject, he re
solved to attempt a completion of the survey by extending it to the
whole surface of the heavens. For this purpose it was necessary to
transport the instruments into the other hemisphere; and the Cape
of Good Hope was selected as the most convenient and eligible
station.
    Sir John, accompanied by his family, and carrying with him the
 20-foot reflector above alluded to, an achromatic telescope of seven
feet in focal length mounted as an equatorial, and other astronomical
 apparatus, sailed from Portsmouth for the Cape in the East India
 Company's ship, the Mount Stewart Elphinstone, on the 13th of
 November 1833, and arrived in Table Bay on the 15th of January
 1834. Having disembarked his apparatus (which was found not to
 have sustained the slightest injury), his first care was to seek out a
 residence in a suitable locality. This he fortunately succeeded in
 speedily finding at the mansion of a Dutch proprietor, at a distance
 of about six miles from Cape Town. The place, which bears the
 name of Feldhuysen or Feldhausen, is charmingly situated on the
 last slope at the base of the Table Mountain, and was well-sheltered
 from dust, and also from the winds which at some seasons prevail there
 with great violence. All his preparations were made and the tele
 scope set up by the end of February, and on the night of the 5th of
 March he commenced a regular course of sweeping".              Shortly after
 a building was begun for the reception of the equatorial, for which he
 had carried out with him a moveable roof constructed in England, and
 on the 2nd of May the instrument was brought into approximate ad
 justment, and a series of micrometrical measures of southern double
 stars was commenced. The great reflector stood of course in the
 open air; and his whole establishment was within an enclosure sur
 rounded by trees, but commanding a tolerably near approach to the
 horizon on all sides, excepting the western, where the nearer vicinity
 of the trees shut out a part of the sky.
     The exact geographical position of Feldhausen (which, like Rhodes
 or Huen, is destined to be an object of interest to the astronomers of
 all future ages) is in latitude 33°58'56".55 S., and longitude 22" 46"
  . * This term is used by the author to designate the system of observation

 9*. 11 from Greenwich, as determined by a triangulation connecting
 it with the Royal Observatory at the Cape. The altitude was found,
 by barometric measurement, to be about 142 feet above the mean
 sea level at Table Bay.
    For the purpose of working the sweeping and other mechanical
 movements of the reflector and executing necessary repairs, Sir John
 engaged the services of an attendant, who, besides possessing the
 qualifications of a ready mechanic, had acquired considerable expe
 rience in the management of the instrument during the review of the
 northern heavens. With the exception of this indispensable aid,
 “the whole of the observations, as well as the entire work of re
 ducing, arranging, and preparing them for the press,” were executed
 by the author himself. We risk little in asserting that the annals
 of astronomy afford no more remarkable example of the patience of
 the observer and computer united with the highest order of genius
 than that which is furnished by the present volume.
    Sir John left the Cape about the end of January 1838, having
 passed four years and a few days in the colony. Making every
 allowance for the energy, skill and experience of the observer, so
 great a multitude of difficult observations (not merely for ascertain
ing the places of the various objects which came under review, but
their peculiarities of aspect and physical structure for which attem
tive and repeated examination was frequently necessary) could not
possibly have been accumulated in so short a period of time except
ing under tolerably favourable conditions. The climate of the Cape,
he observes, must be regarded as on the whole favourable for astro
nomical observations, though there are some drawbacks. In the hot
season, from October to March, the nights are for the most part su
perb; but in the vicinity of the mountains the south wind frequently
brings with it a belt of clouds, extending many miles from the hills,
and cutting off the view of the sky. Very often too, the excessive
heat and dryness of the plains gives rise to a disturbance of the opti
cal tranquillity of the air, and greatly impairs distinct vision; the
images of the stars being in some cases violently dilated, and con
verted into ill-defined nebulous balls or puffs of 10" or 15" in dia
meter; in others forming round pellets of 3" or 4" in diameter, unlike
spurious discs, and rather resembling planetary nebulae; while on a
few occasions the appearances have been very perplexing, and such
as there is difficulty in accounting for on any optical principle what
ever. In the cooler months, from May to October inclusive, and
particularly in June and July, the finest opportunities occur; the
state of the atmosphere is in these months habitually good, and im
perfect vision is rather the exception than the rule. The best nights
occur after the heavy rains, which fall at this season, have ceased for
a day or two. On these occasions hardly any limit is set to magni
fying power except what the aberrations of the specula necessitate.
Among the phaenomena incidental to the climate he makes mention
of a “nebulous haze,” which comes and disappears very suddenly,
and of which the effect is to convert every star of the 9th magnitude
and upwards into a “nebulous star,” i. e. a well-defined star sur

                     Notices respecting New Books.                   381
rounded by a nebulous photosphere of greater or less extent, accord
ing to its brightness. He also notices, as a peculiarity of the climate
which gave occasion to frequent remark, the great opacity of cloud
as compared with that which prevails in this country.
   The climate was found to have a much more prejudicial effect on
the metallic specula than had been anticipated. He had provided him
self with three mirrors (each of 18} inches in clear diameter of polished
surface), but fortunately he had taken the precaution also to carry
out with him the polishing apparatus, and he soon found that the
operation was very much more frequently required than in England.
At first some slight imperfections of surface, induced by exposure,
were tolerated from an apprehension that in a climate so much warmer
difficulties would arise in hitting the proper temperature of the po
lishing material; but confidence in this respect being once restored,
and practice constantly improving, he soon became fastidious, “and
on detection of the slightest dimness on any part of the surface the
metal was at once remanded to the polisher.” It is scarcely necessary
to add that the polisher was Sir John himself. To no other hands
than his own could that delicate operation have been entrusted.
    The “Introduction,” from which the preceding details are taken,
concludes with the following statement:—
    “It remains to say something as to the mode of introducing this
work into the world. To the munificent destination of His Grace, the
late Duke of Northumberland, of a large sum in aid of its publica
tion, it owes its appearance as a single and separate work, instead
 of a series of unconnected memoirs scattered over the volumes of
 academical bodies. The lamented decease of that illustrious noble
 man prevented his witnessing its final completion. His liberal in
 tentions however have been fully carried out by the worthy successor
 to his titles and his spirit; whose kind and gracious interest in it, I
 should be wanting in all proper feeling, were I to omit this opportu
 nity of acknowledging.”                                        -
    The contents of the volume are arranged under seven chapters,
 which are headed as follows:—
    I. Of the Nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere.
    II. Of the Double Stars in the Southern Hemisphere.
    III. Of Astrometry, or the Numerical Expression of the Apparent
 Magnitude of the Stars.
    IV. Of the Distribution of Stars, and of the Constitution of the
 Galaxy in the Southern Hemisphere.
    V. Observations of Halley's Comet, with Remarks on its Physical
 Condition, and that of Comets in general.
    VI. Observations of the Satellites of Saturn.
    VII. Observations of the Solar Spots.
    There are besides four short appendices, and the work is illustrated
 by seventeen beautiful plates, giving representations of the more re
 markable objects from drawings made by the author himself, who
 thus appears to include among his other accomplishments the skill
  of a first-rate artist. These delineations, it may be proper to observe,
 have an object beyond the ordinary purposes of illustration. They

 are executed with extreme care and accuracy, and with the view of
enabling future astronomers, by comparing the present representa
tions with the actual appearances of the objects some ages hence, to
determine whether they remain permanently the same, or are gra
 dually undergoing changes in their physical condition.
    Chap. I. Of the Nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere.—The subject
 of this chapter is a catalogue of the nebulae and clusters of stars,
containing the reduced results of all the observations of each object
which occurred in the regular course of sweeping, in which either
the place of the object was taken, or any particular in its appear
ance or physical character noted, without any selection of good, or
suppression of discordant observations whatever. In its arrangement
and construction it is similar in every particular to the catalogue of
Northern Nebulae and Clusters printed in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1833, and is reduced to the same epoch, namely the be
ginning of 1830. The Introduction contains general observations
respecting the mode of observing and registering the observations,
the explanation of the abbreviations, &c.      The whole number of
nebulae and clusters is 1708.      Of these 89 are identical with ob
jects formerly observed by Sir John himself at Slough; 135 are con
tained in Sir William Herschel's catalogues; 9 are Messier's, and
206 have been identified (though with considerable doubt in many
cases) with objects observed by Mr. Dunlop. The remaining 1269
are a new acquisition to astronomy.
   In the “Remarks on the Catalogue,” Sir John first considers the
degree of precision which may be ascribed to the place of an object
determined by a single observation; a great number of them having
been observed only once. As it is found that the cases are compa
ratively rare in which two observations of the same object differ by a
whole minute in NPD, or by a quantity in RA, which when con
verted into space would give the same amount of discordance in the
direction of the parallel, he infers that, with the exception of large
clusters having no centrally situated remarkable star, and large ill
defined or irregularly shaped nebulae, the error of a single obser
vation (taking the error at half the discordance) is in general within
half a minute of a degree. As to errors of reading and reduction,
it is presumed, from the care that was taken and the re-examina
tions made, that they are very unfrequent. The reductions were
carefully re-examined whenever there appeared the smallest ground
for suspicion.
   He then proceeds to explain the figures and drawings to which
reference is made in the catalogue, and to give detailed descriptions
of some of the more remarkable objects; discussing, incidentally,
the presumptions of a change of state afforded by comparison of their
present appearances with former descriptions and drawings. He
also describes the method he followed in laying down the mono
graphs, and determining the positions of the stars visible in the ne
bulae.   The usual process was as follows.      The differences of RA
and NPD of the principal stars were taken with the equatorial mi
crometer. Adopting these as a basis of projection, the more conspi
                                                                       l

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   383
cuous of the remaining ones were determined from them by trian
gulation;—the angles being measured with the position micrometer
of the twenty-foot reflector, and projected on the chart by means of
a protractor.     From the stars thus laid down by triangulation,
others depending on eye-drafts were then inserted in the chart;
and, finally, the differences in RA and NPD were read off from
the chart by means of diagonal scales, and the whole entered in
a catalogue. The nebulae were then worked in upon the chart ac
cording to the united evidence of all the drawings and diagrams. An
idea will be given of the immense labour bestowed on these drawings
by stating, for a few cases, the number of small stars within their
boundaries whose places were approximately determined. In the
 monograph of the nebula marked h. 2941, the number of stars laid
 down is 105; in h. 3722, the number is 186; in the cluster h. 3435,
 110; in the nebula about 8 Orionis, 150; and so on.
    We have no room to enter into details respecting the objects
 figured in the six plates which belong to this chapter, and compres
 sion or abridgement is scarcely possible. We shall therefore content
 ourselves with a brief allusion to the two principal ones:—the great
 nebula in the sword-handle of Orion, and that about the star y Argüs.
The former of these objects was described by Sir John in 1824 (Mem.
 R. Astron. Society, vol. ii.), and subsequently by Dr. Lamont of
 Munich, as also by Rondoni, a Roman artist, and by the astronomer
 De Vico.     He observes,—
    “It may be supposed that in a situation so favourable for viewing
 this magnificent object as the Cape, where it passes the meridian at
 an altitude of 60°, with the additional advantage of a sky of perfect
 purity, and of mirrors in a constant course of repolishing, I should
 eagerly seize the opportunity to re-examine my earlier delineation
 of it, with a view to the detection of change, the correction of error,
 and the observation of further particulars as to its form, extent and
 structure which had escaped previous observation.” The first glance at
 the object, under these favourable circumstances, showed a multitude
 of nebulous branches, convolutions, and other details of which he had
 not before had the least suspicion. Great pains were accordingly
 taken in the delineation of the figure here given. He observes that
 although a comparison of it with the former representations might
  convey an impression of great and rapid changes in the nebula, he is
  far from participating in such an impression, and is disposed to think
  that the disagreements in his own two drawings, though confessedly
  great, are not more so than may be attributed to inexperience in the
  case of the earlier one, the greater care bestowed on the latter, and
  above all to the advantage of local situation, and the very great supe
  riority in respect both of light and of defining power in the telescope
  at the latter period. There is only one particular on which he is at
  all inclined to insist as evidence of change—and this refers to the
  situation and form of one of the branches of the nebula.
     The other nebula to which we have adverted—that about the star
  * Argüs—is a far more extensive object. The space which it occu
  pies in the figure extends in right ascension from—3” 45° to +3* 0°

 384                 Notices respecting New Books.
 from the principal star, and in polar distance from –24' to +44',
 comprising in the whole an area of almost exactly a square degree.
 “It would be impossible by verbal description to give any just idea
 of the capricious forms and irregular gradations of light affected by
 the different branches and appendages of this nebula. Nor is it easy
 for language to convey a full impression of the beauty and sublimity
 of the spectacle it affords when viewed in a sweep, ushered in as it
 is by so glorious and innumerable a procession of stars, to which it
 forms a sort of climax, justifying expressions, which, though I find
 them written in my Journal in the excitement of the moment, would
 be thought extravagant if transferred to these pages. . In fact, it is
 impossible for any one, with the least spark of astronomical enthu
 siasm about him, to pass soberly in review, with a powerful telescope
 and in a fine night, that portion of the southern sky which is com
 prised between 6” and 13" of RA and from 146° to 149° NPD,
 such are the variety and interest of the objects he will encounter,
 and such the dazzling richness of the starry ground on which they
 are represented to his gaze.”—P. 38.
    The star w Argüs, which is surrounded by this magnificent nebula,
 is itself an object of no ordinary interest, on account of the singular
 changes in lustre it appears to have undergone. In Halley's cata
 logue (1677) it is set down as a star of the 4th magnitude; in the
 catalogues of Lacaille, Brisbane, Johnson, Fallows, and Taylor, as of
 the 2nd. Sir John had himself been accustomed to regard it as of
the 2nd, or at most as a small star of the 1st.     On the 16th of De
cember 1837, he was astonished by seeing it appear as one of the
very brightest of the 1st magnitude. “It exceeded c. Orionis, and
the only star (Sirius and Canopus excepted) which could at all be
compared with it was Rigel, which it somewhat surpassed.” On the
28th of December it far surpassed Rigel, and equalled a Centauri;
after the beginning of January it began to fall off. From subsequent
observations made by Mr. Maclear at the Cape, it appears that in
March 1843 it was superior to Canopus. About the 19th of that
month it began again to decrease. On the 3rd of January 1845 it
is described by Mr. Maclear as being again much larger than Cano
pus. Sir John asks—“What origin can we ascribe to these sudden
flashes and relapses 2    What conclusions are we to draw as to the
comfort or habitability of a system depending for its light and heat on
so uncertain a source f *
    A general catalogue is given of the stars known to exist within
the limits of RA and PD which bound the monograph chart of
this singular object. They amount to no fewer than 1216.
    After this follows the “Reduced Observations of Nebulae and
Clusters of Stars.” The catalogue occupies 78 pages, and gives
the following particulars:–1st, the author's number; 2nd, the
synonym; 3rd, the RA for 1830; 4th, NPD for 1830; 5th,
description, remarks, &c.; and 6th, the number of the sweep. By
means of the abbreviations we have already alluded to, the descrip
tions are generally given in a very small space, frequently in a single
lime. Many of the objects described are extremely remarkable. ,

                     Notices respecting New Books.                    385
      The catalogue is followed by a chapter on the law of Distribution
  of Nebulae and Clusters over the surface of the Heavens.           After
  giving a table showing the number of these objects observed in each
  hour of RA in the northern catalogue, the author observes, “It is
  evident from this that the great mass of the nebulae visible in our
  latitudes is accumulated upon the 6 hours of RA between 9h and
  15°; on both sides of which the falling off is rapid, and after 15h
  very sudden; while within the 6 hours in question the condensation
  increases to a very marked maximum between the hours 12 and 13.”
  (Between 12" and 13" the number in the catalogue is 441; between
  15* and 16" it is only 42.) In order however to obtain a better
  view of the mode in which they are grouped, and a measure of their
  condensation, he projects them on a chart, adopting a mode of pro
<U+017F> jection by which equal areas on the sphere are represented by equal
  areas on the chart. On this principle he constructed charts repre
  senting the northern and southern hemispheres divided into zones
  of 3° in breadth or polar distance, and into hours of RA (subdi
  vided into quarters), on which he laid down the nebulae from the
  contents of both catalogues, so as to obtain a coup-d'acil of their
  distribution over the whole heavens. The principal conclusions
  arrived at by this laborious mode of proceeding are the following:—
     “1st. The distribution of the nebulae is not, like that of the Milky
  Way, in a zone or band encircling the heavens, or if such a band
  can be at all traced out, it is with so many interruptions, and so
  faintly marked out through by far the greater part of its circum
  ference, that its existence as such can be hardly more than suspected.
      “2ndly. One-third of the whole nebulous contents of the heavens
  are congregated in a broad irregular patch, occupying about one
  eighth of the whole surface of the sphere; chiefly (indeed almost
  entirely) situated in the northern hemisphere, and occupying the
  constellations Leo, Leo Minor, the body, tail, and hind legs of
   Ursa Major, the nose of the Camelopard, and the point of the tail
y of Draco, Canes Venatici, Coma, the preceding leg of Bootes, and the
  head, wings, and shoulder of Virgo.
      “3rdly. Within this area there are several local centres of accu
  mulation where the nebulae are exceedingly crowded, viz. 1st, from
  59° to 62° of NPD in the 13th hour of RA between the northern
  part of Coma and the fore legs of Chara, as also (in the same hour)
  from 72° to 78° NPD between the palm branch and the northern
  wing of Virgo; and again, in the same hour, from 80° to 87° NPD
  in the northern wing and breast of Virgo. Northward the nebulous
  area terminates almost abruptly with a very rich patch between the
  nose of the Camelopard and the tail of Draco.      The line of greatest
  condensation connecting these most condensed patches is irregular
   and wavy, without appearance of reference to any one particular
   centre, and the shading off, though patchy, is on the whole gra
   dual.”—P. 135.
      After some further remarks on the distribution of the nebulae in
   the northern hemisphere, he thus proceeds:—
      “In the southern a much greater uniformity of distribution pre

  vails. If we except the two Nubeculae (which are full of nebulae,
   and the greater part of which is even richer in objects of that class
  than the densest portion of the northern group), the general character
  of this hemisphere is that of alternating patches of nebulae and va
  cuities of greater or lesser extent, some of the latter however being
  very extensive. In one of these vacuities, in which comparatively
  few nebulae occur, the south pole is situated, having one nebula,
  however, within half a degree of it (as the north pole has also one
  within five or six minutes).    This barren region extends nearly 15°
  on all sides of the pole, and immediately on its borders occurs the
  smaller nubecula.
     “One of the most remarkable features in the southern nebulous
  system is the extraordinary display of finely resolved and resolvable
  globular clusters which occurs between 16” 45" and 19" in RA in
  the region occupied by Corona Australis, the body and head of Sagit
 tarius, the tail of Scorpio, with part of Telescopium and Ara. Here,
 in a circular space of 18° in radius, we find collected no less than
  thirty of these beautiful and exquisite objects. This is certainly
 something beyond a mere accidental coincidence. Are we to sup
 pose that in this direction the visual ray encounters some branch of
 the general nebulous system nearer to us than the rest? Or are we
 to connect it with the very peculiar structure of the Milky Way in
 this particular part of its course, which is here unlike in its consti
 tution to any other portion of that zone, and which passes dia
 metrically across the circular area in question ? It can hardly be
 doubted that some at least of these objects belong to and form a part
 of the Milky Way.
    “The general conclusion which may be drawn from this survey,
 however, is, that the nebulous system is distinct from the sidereal,
 though involving, and perhaps, to a certain extent, intermixed with
 the latter. The great nebulous constellation in the northern hemi
 sphere, which I have called the region of Virgo, being regarded as
 the main body of this system, and subtending at our point of view
 an angle of 80° or 90°, it is evident that, supposing its form to
 approach to the spherical, our distance from its centre must be con
 siderably less than its own diameter, so that our system may very
 well be regarded as placed somewhat beyond the borders of its
 denser portion, yet involved among its outlying members, or forming
 an element of some one of its protuberances or branches of which the
individuals are the sporadic nebulae confusedly scattered over the
 general surface of the heavens, and of which the prolongation in a
direction towards the constellation Pisces may give rise to the appa
rently denser grouping of the nebulae in that region.”—P. 136.
    The author next treats of the “Classification of Nebulae.” He
observes that “the distinction between nebulae and clusters of stars
must depend on two very different considerations:—1st, on the
power of our instrument to distinguish the very minute individuals
of which a resolvable cluster, or one entirely composed of stars, may
consist; and 2ndly, on the idea we attach to the word ‘nebulous,’
that is to say, on the distinction which we conceive to exist between
                                                                    <U+017F>
                                                                    |

objects physically nebulous and objects only optically so. An object
really composed of discrete stars may appear nebulous either because
it consists of stars so small as to be separately indiscernible by the
light of the telescope, or of stars so close as to be incapable of being
separated by its defining and magnifying powers, and under different
degrees of instrumental imperfection such an object may offer any
variety of appearance.” Hence the distinction between nebulae pro
perly so called, and those which we are to consider as certainly or
very probably clusters of stars, can never become a permanent ground
of classification. Their degree of resolvability, however, connected
as it is with the absolute brightness of their constituent stars, and
their distance from us, must always form an important character in
their description. He further observes that when sensible objects
possess no qualities but such as are common to them all, and differ
only in the greater or less degree in which those qualities are present
in them, the only classification they admit is a classificatio per gradus.
From these considerations he considers it sufficient to divide the
whole nebulous system into three great classes:—I. Regular Nebulae;
II. Irregular Nebulae; III. Irregular Clusters.             Those of the first
class are described under five different characters, and in each cha
racter he recognises five degrees, two extreme and three medial.
 The characters and degrees forming the system of sub-classification,
are arranged in a particular order as follows:—
 sº         Magnitude.   Brightness.   Roundness.   Condensation. Resolvability.
    1.     Great.        Lucid.       Circular.   | Stellate.     Discrete.
    2.     Large.        Bright.      Round.        Nebular.      Resolvable.
    3.     Middle-sized. Faint.       Oval.         Concentrate.  Granulate.
    4.     Small.        Dim.         Elongate.     Graduating.   Mottled.
    5.     Minute.       Obscure.     Linear.       Discoid.      Milky.
   By giving to the first five numerical digits an absolute value de
noting the degree, and a value depending on position denoting the
character, the description of the nebula is rendered very compendious.
Thus the combination I. 32155 expresses “A Regular Nebula,
Middle-sized, Bright, Circular, Discoid, Milky.” The utility of this
system, he remarks, “in affording in a very small compass a good
deal of information respecting the physical (or optical) characters of
a nebula, in thus rendering possible a general descriptive catalogue
of convenient magnitude for reference, will, I am disposed to think,
be found considerable.” The sub-classification, it will be observed,
is founded entirely on the optical aspect of the nebulae, without
reference to any notions we may entertain of their intimate nature.
   This first chapter concludes with a description of the Magellanic
clouds—the Nubeculae Major and Minor. The general appearance
of the two objects to the naked eye, on a clear night, and in the
absence of the light of the moon, is described to be “that of pretty
conspicuous nebulous patches of about the same intensity with some
of the brighter portions of the Milky Way.” In a paper published
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1828, representations, which

are there stated to be from very correct drawings, are given of
their appearance; but it would seem very unsuccessfully, for Sir
John observes that if the drawings in question were telescopic repre
sentations, he is unable to reconcile them with his own observations
as regards the greater part of the details; and if they were eye-drafts,
“they certainly tend to convey such a conception of their appear
ance as must inevitably create a sentiment of disappointment in the
mind of any one who, having his imagination excited by represen
tations so striking and extraordinary, is presented for the first time
with a view of the real objects.”
   The Nubecula Minor is situated between the parallels of 162° and
 165° NPD, and between the meridians of Oh 28m and 1 h 15m RA.
It is of a generally round form to the unaided eye; in the telescope
the most conspicuous and resolvable region appears to be somewhat
to the south of its middle.    It is situated in one of the most barren
regions of the heavens, and the access to it on all sides is described
as being “through a desert.” Neither with the naked eye nor with
the telescope is any connection to be traced either with the greater
Nubecula or with the Milky Way. An idea of its general character
and appearance is conveyed in the following note:–“ Re-examined
by the side motion the whole cloud in detail and in general. The
main body is resolved, but barely. I see the stars with the left eye.
It is not like the stippled ground of the sky. The borders fade away
quite insensibly, and are less or not at all resolved. The body of the
cloud does not congregate much into knots; and altogether it is in no
way a striking object apart from the nebulae and clusters.”—P. 145.
   The Nubecula Major is situated between the parallels of 156° and
162° NPD, and the meridians of 4° 40' and 6° 0' in RA.           “Like
the Minor it consists partly of large tracts and ill-defined patches of
irresolvable nebulae, and of nebulosity in every stage of resolution up
to perfectly resolved stars like the Milky Way, as also of regular and
irregular nebulae properly so called, of globular clusters in every
stage of resolvability, and of clustering groups sufficiently insulated
and condensed to come under the designation of clusters of stars.
In the number and variety of these objects, and in general complexity
of structure, it far surpasses the lesser Nubecula.”       The concen
tration of the objects is such as to very far exceed anything to be
met with in any other region of the heavens. “Even the most
crowded parts of the stratum of Virgo in the wing of that constel
lation, or in Coma Berenices, offer nothing approaching to it. It is
evident from this, and from the mixture of stars and unresolved
nebulosity which probably might be resolved with a higher optical
power, that the Nubeculae are to be regarded as systems sui generis,
and which have no analogues in our hemisphere.”
   “The immediate neighbourhood of the Nubecula Major is some
what less barren of stars than the Minor, but it is by no means rich,
nor does any part of the Milky Way whatever form any certain and
conspicuous junction with, or include it. . . . . I have encountered
nothing that I could set down as diffused nebulosity anywhere in the
neighbourhood of either Nubecula.”—P. 147.

              The excessive complexity of detail in this singular object baffled
           every attempt to delineate the whole or any large portion of it by the
           aid of the telescope. Hewas desirous of giving a correct and magnified
           drawing of both Nubeculae; and to this end he took the place, with
           the equatorial, of every star visible in that instrument down to the
           10th magnitude, in both objects, with a view to the formation of
           detailed charts to serve as the groundwork of the drawings. This
           very laborious operation was satisfactorily executed, but the exe
           cution of the drawings proved to be beyond his unassisted power,
           and he was obliged, though with regret, to rest content with having
           prepared the way for the more successful operations of some other
           astronomer, to whom he recommends the completion of a work at
           once so interesting in its performance and instructive in its result.
              Catalogues of the objects (stars, nebulae and clusters), observed in
           both Nubeculae, including those observed with the 20-foot reflector
           as well as the equatorial, are given. In the Nubecula Minor the
           number is 244; in the Major 919. They are reduced by clock and
           index errors obtained from stars occurring in the zones, and, as in
           the other catalogue, the epoch is 1830. Numerous as are the objects
           whose places are thus for the first time determined and recorded, the
           author does not regard his work as more than a commencement, and
           he calls it, simply, a “First approximation towards a Catalogue of
           Objects in the Magellanic Clouds . . preparatory to the Construction
           of Charts of the Nubeculae, and to the future execution of Drawings
           of them in detail.”

   Jan. 6, 1848–' On Terrestrial Magnetism.”            By William A.
Norton, A.M., M.A.P.S., Professor of Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy in Delaware College, United States of America. Com
municated by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
   The object of the author in the present memoir is to show that,
by adopting certain fundamental conceptions with respect to the
terrestrial magnetic forces, the magnetic may be deduced from the
thermal elements of the earth. The following are the propositions
which he considers he has established by his inquiries.
   1. All the magnetic elements of any place on the earth may be
deduced from the thermal elements of that place; and all the great
features of the distribution of the earth's magnetism may be theore
tically derived from certain prominent features in the distribution of
its heat.
   2. Of the magnetic elements, the horizontal intensity is nearly
proportional to the mean temperature, as measured by Fahrenheit's
thermometer; the vertical intensity is nearly proportional to the
difference between the mean temperatures, at two points situated at
equal distances north and south of the place, in a direction perpen
dicular to the isothermal line ; and, in general, the direction of the
needle is nearly at right angles to the isothermal line, while the pre
cise courses of the inflected line, to which it is perpendicular, may
be deduced from Sir David Brewster's formula for the temperature,
by differentiating and putting the differential equal to zero.
   3. As a consequence, the laws of the terrestrial distribution of the
physical principles of magnetism and heat must be nearly the same;
and these principles themselves must have towards one another the
most intimate physical relations.                     -
   4. The principle of terrestrial magnetism, in as far as the pheno
mena of the magnetic needle are concerned, must be confined to the
earth's surface, or to a comparatively thin stratum of the mass of
the earth.
   5. The mathematical theory of terrestrial magnetism which has
been under discussion must be true in all its essential features.
   6. We may derive the magnetic elements by very simple formulae,

 and with an accuracy equal to that of Gauss’s formulae, from a very
 small number of magnetic data determined by observation, and the
 mean annual temperature of the place.
    Jan. 13.-“On the Disruptive Discharge of accumulated Elec
 tricity, and the Proximate Cause of Lightning.” By Isham Baggs,
 Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
    The author proposes to inquire into the principal causes of the
 violent and disruptive union of opposite electricities which consti
 tutes the electric discharge; and to apply the knowledge thus gained
 to the explanation of natural phenomena, and the further proof of
 the identity of frictional and voltaic electricities. He describes two
 instruments which he employed for the purpose of regulating the
 discharges of a Leyden jar, or battery, by adjusting with precision
 the distances between two brass balls, forming a communication
 between the inner and outer coatings; allowing of their being
 charged only to a limited degree of intensity, by carrying off all the
 electricity beyond that extent; and thus guarding the glass from
 the dangers of fracture from an excess of charge. He is led to the
 conclusion, that with a given dialectric, such as glass, the limit to
the intensity of the charge it can receive varies directly as the cube
 of its thickness, being in the compound ratio of the resistance it
presents to the discharge, which is simply as the thickness, and of
the square of the distance of the two charged surfaces, such being
the law of electric action.
   When a number of insulated Leyden jars, arranged in a consecu
tive series by connecting the outer coating of each with the inner
coating of the next, is charged by means of an electrical machine,
the tension of the charge diminishes in each jar as they follow in the
series, that of the terminal jar being exceedingly small. On the other
hand, when each jar has been charged separately in the same manner
and to an equal extent, and then quickly arranged in a series, the
jars not touching one another, but the knobs connected with the
inner coating of each jar, after the first, being placed at a certain
distance from the outer coating of the preceding jar, which in such
an arrangement is charged with an electricity of an opposite kind to
that of the knob adjacent to it, the author found that the tension of
the electricities was greatly augmented, giving rise to violent ex
plosions whenever a discharge occurred.          He considers a battery
thus constituted as bearing the same relation to a single Leyden jar
as the voltaic pile does to a single galvanic circle ; and as affording
in like manner the means of exalting, to any assignable degree, the
electric tension. Adopting the views of Mr. Crosse as to the con
stitution of a thunder-cloud, namely, that it is formed of a number
of concentric zones of electricity, alternately positive and negative,
the central one having the highest intensity, and the tension dimi
nishing in the successive zones surrounding the innermost, till it
became inappreciable in the one most remote; the author considers
this condition of the cloud to be analogous to that of the battery
above described, and the phenomena of the former to receive com
plete illustration from the experimental results obtained with the
latter.

tions.” By Thomas Andrews, M.D., M.R.I.A., Vice-President of
Queen's College, Belfast, &c. Communicated by Michael Faraday,
Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S. &c.
   In a paper which was published in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1844, the author deduced from the experimental inquiry there
recorded the general law, that when one base displaces another from
any of its neutral combinations with an acid, the heat evolved or
abstracted is always the same, whatever that acid element may be,
provided the bases are the same. Extending a similar inquiry to
salts with metallic bases, he establishes, as the result of the investi
gation of which an account is given in the present paper, the ge
neral principle that when an equivalent of one and the same metal
replaces another in a solution of any of its salts of the same order,
the heat developed is, with the same metals, constantly the same,
the expression “of a solution of the same order” being understood
to mean a solution in which the same precipitate is produced by the
addition of an alkali, or, on one view of the composition of such
salts, in which the metal exists in the same state of oxidation. The
metallic salts, in the precipitation of which by other metals the
evolved heat was ascertained, were those of copper precipitated by
zinc, iron or lead; of silver, precipitated by zinc or copper; and of
lead, mercury, and platinum precipitated by zinc: and the acid ele
ments were either the sulphuric, hydrochloric, acetic or formic acids.
From the last series of experiments the author deduces, that if three
metals A, B, and C, be so related that A is capable of displacing B
and C from their combinations, and also B capable of displacing C,
then the heat developed in the substitution of A for C will be equal
to that developed in the substitution of A for B added to that deve
loped in the substitution of B for C; and a similar rule may be ap
plied to any number of metals similarly related.

 ACTION OF NITRIC ACID ON BRUCIA.             BY M. A.U.G. LAURENT.
   T is well known to chemists that brucia, when treated with nitric
    acid, becomes of a very intense red colour.      Some time since,
M. Gerhardt, on examining this phaenomenon attentively, observed
that there was disengaged at common temperatures, a gaseous body
slightly soluble in water, which had a very decided smell of apples, and
burnt with a yellowish flame, accompanied with nitrous vapours.
For want of material M. Gerhardt did not continue his observations;
nevertheless he concluded from them that the gas disengaged from
brucia is nitrous aether.
   M. Liebig has repeated this experiment, and expresses himself as
follows in the miserable diatribe which he has aimed at us –“ The
production of nitrous aether by a body which contains neither alco
hol nor aether appears to me as remarkable as it is important in the
history of aethereal combinations, on which account I undertook to
repeat the experiments of M. Gerhardt. I condensed a portion of .
the gas which is disengaged from the brucia, and obtained a liquid

which was immiscible with water, was more dense than dilute nitric
acid, and boiled at from 158° to 167°F.”
   Not being able to conceive how a gaseous body at common tem
peratures could yield a liquid which boils only at 158° to 167°F.,
I resolved in my turn to repeat the experiment of M. Gerhardt.
   I operated on 15 to 20 grammes of brucia. After having passed
the gas over lime, I condensed it in a U-shaped tube, having at its
curvature a small tube terminated by a bulb ; by the help of a mix
ture of ice and salt I obtained about 1 gramme of a very fluid liquid,
which was lighter than water, and had a strong smell of apples.        I
slowly distilled this liquid, almost to the last drop, at a temperature
approaching 50°F., and without making it boil; I then submitted it
to analysis; 0:550 gr. of the substance yielded 0-553 of carbonic
acid and 0.290 of water. Nitrous aether contains—

   The hydrogen and carbon are precisely in the same proportions as
in nitrous aether. As to the loss, it is easily understood, when the
smallness of the quantity of the liquid which I possessed, and the
difficulties attendant upon the analysis of so volatile a substance, are
considered.
   Nitrogen was disengaged during the whole of the operations.
Though the relations which exist between the composition, the
atomic weight and boiling-points have been but slightly considered,
it will be readily seen to be impossible that a substance which does
not contain more than 29 to 30 per cent. of carbon and 6 of hydro
gen, should contain more than 1 atom of nitrogen; for if we double
the formula by putting either C4 H10 or Hº, or H8; Nº O4 or O', a
similar combination would have a boiling-point much higher than
50° or 60° F.
   This experiment has also been repeated by M. Fournet, who also
obtained a liquid possessing all the properties of nitrous aether.—

             ON CACOTHEI.I.N.       BY M. AUG, LAURENT.
   When nitric acid has ceased to act upon brucia at common tem
peratures, it deposits a crystalline substance of a fine orange-yellow
colour, which the author has named cacothelin.        It is insoluble in

    The colour of this substance and the action of heat upon it prove
 that it contains nitrous acid, and that the formula is probably
 Cºl Hº X* Nº O6. Treated with ammonia it immediately dissolves
 in it, and gives a yellow liquid, which by ebullition becomes first
 green and afterwards brown, and is a new base insoluble in water
 or alcohol, but still contains nitrous acid. It dissolves immediately
in hydrochloric acid, and this solution forms a yellow gelatinous
 precipitate; with ammonia and bichloride of platina it gives an
orange-red precipitate, the colour of which is heightened considerably
by drying; when it is perfectly dry the colour is so deep as to appear
perfectly black, with golden-green reflexion. If it be moistened
with a drop of alcohol, its orange-red colour is restored.
    If it be very strongly dried in a porcelain capsule, it assumes a
rich rose tint mixed with blue; a drop of alcohol restores its orange
red colour. This platina salt dissolves in hot sulphuric acid, and
gives it a fine rose colour, which at a higher temperature becomes
lilac-blue. When calcined it decomposes, giving sparks, and leaving
about 23 per cent. of platina.
   The action of nitric acid upon brucia has been recently again
examined in the laboratory of Giessen. There has been found at
length a very volatile liquid, containing as much carbon as nitrous
aether, but more hydrogen. Nevertheless, observes M. Laurent, they
will not give way, which, he adds, is readily conceivable.—Ann. de

ON A NEW METHOD OF ESTIMATING ARSENIC, ANTIMONY AND
                         TIN.     BY PROF. H. ROSE.
   Chloride of ammonium can be usefully employed in analytical in
vestigations, from its property of decomposing several oxides at a
high temperature and forming with the metals highly volatile chlo
rides. The experiments frequently give far more accurate results,
in the shortest time and with the least trouble, than have hitherto
been obtained by the usual methods of analysis.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             395
   It is well known what difficulties accompany the separation of the
acids of arsenic and of antimony, as likewise that of the peroxide of
tin, from bases. In general these metallic acids are separated from
the solutions of most of their salts in hydrochloric acid, or to which
hydrochloric acid has been added, by sulphuretted hydrogen, as
sulphurets, and the base in the filtered liquid determined in the state
of chloride. If the latter happens to be one which is easily decom
posed at an elevated temperature, and not volatile or only so at a
very high temperature, the liquid, which is frequently very con
siderable in quantity, has to be evaporated to dryness, and the resi
due ignited more or less strongly. Every one accustomed to ana
lytical investigations must be sufficiently well acquainted with the
inconveniences which accompany the evaporation of large quantities
of liquids containing small amounts of alkaline salts, which have to
be determined quantitatively.                           -
   The difficulties attending such an investigation become greater
when the salt of the metallic acid is not at all, or very sparingly,
soluble in water and in hydrochloric acid, or one which is easily
decomposed. Now this is frequently the case with a salt of this
class when it has been heated to redness, which is requisite in deter
mining the amount of water directly.
   All these difficulties may in many cases be avoided by the use of
chloride of ammonium. Suppose we have a salt of one of these
metallic acids with an alkaline base to examine, it is only requisite
to mix it, after having ignited and weighed it in the finely-pulverized
state, with from five to eight times the quantity of pure powdered
chloride of ammonium, and to heat the mixture in a small porcelain
crucible which may be covered with a concave platinum lid, over an
Argand lamp until the whole of the chloride of ammonium is vola
tilized.   The alkali is left behind in the state of chloride, the quan
tity of which may be very accurately determined. So long as chlo
ride of ammonium is volatilized, the temperature is so low that none
of the alkaline chloride can escape.      As soon as the ammoniacal
salt is driven off, the temperature is moderated, so that the residue
in the porcelain crucible does not fuse. After weighing, it is mixed
with a fresh quantity of chloride of ammonium and again heated, in
order to see whether the weight of the residue remains constant or
is diminished, in which latter case the treatment with chloride of
ammonium must be repeated. Sometimes, owing to the access of
air, the platinum lid is coated with a film of the metallic acid, espe
cially with peroxide of tin when stannates are examined. In this
case, the lid, in the subsequent ignition, is covered with a little of
the ammoniacal salt.
   I will here describe some experiments which have been made b
M. Weber:-0-609 grim. of ignited arseniate of soda, 2NaO + AsO3,
afforded, after being once treated with five times the amount of
chloride of ammonium, 0.455 grim. chloride of sodium. The weight
remained the same after repeating the treatment with chloride of
ammonium. The quantity of chloride of sodium corresponds to 35-46
per cent. soda in the salt; the theoretical quantity is 35-18.

 396          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    1-048 grm. antimoniate of soda (NaO SbO3 + 7HO), the amount
 of soda in which, according to Fremy's analysis, is 11.9 per cent,
 afforded, after five ignitions with chloride of ammonium, a constant
 weight of 0.429 grm. chloride of sodium, which corresponds to 12:58
 per cent. of soda; the salt had been dried for a length of time at
 212°, and it is possible that it had lost some of its water of crystalli
zation.
    Stannate of Potash.--This salt had been precipitated by alcohol
 from the solution of the peroxide of tin in hydrate of potash, washed
 with alcohol, then dissolved in water and evaporated.          It formed,
 after drying under the air-pump over sulphuric acid, a gummy mass,
 which again easily dissolved in water; it contained the b-modifica
 tion of the oxide of tin.     According to an examination after the
 usual method, the salt dried at 212° consisted, in 100 parts, of
           8734 peroxide of tin. . . . . . . . . . 1867 oxygen.

            4°64 water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4°11
 According to this the composition of the salt is KO-F7SnO2+3HO.
The acid metastannate of potash is, according to Fremy, KO +
6SnO2 + 5HO. It is possible therefore that the salt prepared by
me contained a quantity of a still more acid salt mixed with it.
    Of the salt used for the above analysis, 1:013 grm. was mixed
with 5 times the amount of chloride of ammonium and heated to
redness; this was repeated twice with smaller quantities of chloride
of ammonium, when the weight of the residue no longer varied;
0-131 grm. chloride of potassium was obtained, corresponding to
8-09 per cent. of potash. All the chlorides obtained dissolved en
tirely in water, and when tested did not exhibit the least trace of
the metallic acids.    The use, however, of chloride of ammonium in
analytical chemistry is not restricted to the compounds above men
tioned; it is capable of considerable extension, as I intend to point
out in a subsequent paper.—From the Chemical Gazette for April 15,
1848.
                  ON A REAGENT FOR STRYCHNIA,
   In 1843 M. Marchand described the remarkable and perfectly cha
racteristic property possessed by strychnia of giving a magnificent
blue colour, passing quickly to violet, and lastly to yellow, when
triturated with peroxide of lead, and a few drops of concentrated
sulphuric acid, containing Tºodth of its weight of nitric acid. Since the
period above-mentioned several chemists have examined this reaction,
and M. Herzog has proposed to omit the nitric acid as useless; an
other chemist proposes to substitute peroxide of manganese for
peroxide of lead, and M. Otto prefers bichromate of potash to these
oxides, which, according to him, gives rise to a much finer violet
colour, and to a certain extent this is certainly the case.
   M. Marchand proposes certain objections to these omissions and
substitutions, and demonstrates that the reagents which he has pro
posed are the best suited to the purpose.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             397
   First, the nitric acid added in the proportion of Tºdth to the
sulphuric acid is not useless, as stated by M. Herzog; for by its
influence the series of colours is produced much more readily and
sensibly than when it is omitted. M. Marchand states that he was
aware that strychnia yielded a fine blue colour by the action of pure
sulphuric acid and peroxide of lead only; but that it is almost im
possible to perceive the red and yellow colours, which are readily
perceptible in the conditions described by him ; and the author adds
that he never said or believed, as supposed by M. Herzog, that
strychnia, when placed in the circumstances described, might serve
as a reagent for nitric acid.
   As to the substitution of peroxide of manganese for that of lead,
the author has only one objection to make, which is that the salts of
manganese sometimes possessing a red colour, there can be no cer
tainty that the series of colours obtained belongs properly to the
substance supposed to be strychnia, since one of the reagents em
ployed may itself give rise to one of the colours indicated.
    The same is the case with the bichromate of potash recommended
by M. Otto. This salt produces by its solution in sulphuric acid a
yellow or green colour, and it follows that the series of colours indi
cated by M. Marchand is diminished by at least one colour, and
 sometimes by two, the yellow and the red, and consequently the
reaction is far from being complete.
    The method of employing M. Marchand’s process is that of tritu
rating the strychnia with peroxide of lead and concentrated sulphuric
 acid containing 1 per cent. of nitric acid; by this process the colours
 obtained are blue, becoming rapidly violet, then gradually red, and
 lastly, after some hours, it assumes a delicate yellow colour.—Journ.
 de Ch. Méd., Avril 1848.
      ON THE     PRESENCE OF SELENIUM         IN THE    IODIDE OF
                               POTASSIUM.
    M. de Trez, when acting upon a solution of protiodide of mercury
 and iodide of potassium by acids, perceived a smell of sulphuretted
 hydrogen during the operation; he subsequently discovered that the
 smell arose from hydroselenic acid, the odour of which strongly re
 sembles that of hydrosulphuric acid.
    The selenium exists in the iodide of potassium in the state of sele
 niate of potash. To determine the presence of this substance M. de
 Trez advises an acid to be added to the solution of the iodide, and to
 receive the gas disengaged in a solution of acetate of lead.       The
 grayish-black precipitate which is formed in this case being col
 lected, washed and dried, is to be introduced into a glass tube, the
 bent extremity of which is to be immersed in a bottle containing
 distilled water; through the other end of the tube a current of
 chlorine gas is to be passed; as soon as the tube is heated by char
 coal, a liquid of a deep yellow colour flows into the receiver; this is
 followed by whitish vapours, which condense in the cool part of the
 tube, and when this is heated the vapours pass into the receiver, and

398           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
are dissolved in the water; the liquor then contains selenious acid
and hydrochloric acid resulting from the decomposition of the proto
and deuto-chloride of selenium in water.
   On the addition of hydrochloric acid, and then sulphite of ammo
nia, this salt is decomposed by the hydrochloric acid, and the sul
phurous acid which is set free precipitates the selenium in the state
of a grayish powder, which afterwards becomes yellowish-white.
   M. Trez thinks that the seleniate of potash may either have been
fraudulently added, or that it was extracted with the iodine.—Journ.
de Ch. Méd., Avril 1848.
ON TRANSPARENT AND OPAKE ARSENIOUS ACID.                  B.Y. M. BUSSY.
   It is well known that arsenious acid exists in the different states
above-mentioned, and also that the transparent variety becomes
opake ; it has been stated that the former is less soluble in water
than the latter. By performing experiments to determine this point,
M. Bussy has arrived at the following conclusions :—
   1st. That the transparent acid, far from being less soluble than
the opake, as stated by several chemists, is, on the contrary, much
more so; the difference is nearly as 3 to 1, at the temperature of about
55° F.; thus a litre of water which dissolves 40 grammes of the
transparent acid dissolves only 12 to 13 grammes of the opake.
   2nd. That the transparent acid dissolves much more rapidly than
the opake.
   3rd. That neither of these acids possesses a perfectly constant
degree of solubility.
   4th. That the opake acid is converted into the transparent by
long-continued boiling in water, that is to say, it acquires the same
degree of solubility as the transparent acid, which is such that 100
grammes of acid dissolve in a litre of water at 212°.
   5th. That under the influence of water and a low temperature the
transparent is converted into the opake acid.
   6th. That the mixture of the two varieties of acid in the same
solution explains the anomalies observed in the solubility of arsenious
acid.
   7th. That division which facilitates the solution of the opake
arsenious acid without increasing its solubility, considerably dimi
mishes that of the transparent acid, and to such an extent, that the
latter, reduced to fine powder and levigated, is not sensibly more
soluble in the cold than the opake acid; this effect undoubtedly re
sults from a transformation which it undergoes, either at the moment
of pulverizing, or of its contact with water.
   8th. That the acid which has become opake by the slow trans
formation of the transparent, by the action of ammonia, and the acid
crystallized in water, are similarly acted upon by water, and appear to
belong to the same variety.
   9th. That under the influence of dilute hydrochloric acid, the
opake acid dissolves more slowly than the transparent; this circum
stance, which modifies the nature of the products formed during

                           Meteorological Observations.                                                  399
    solution, explains why the phaenomena observed by M. Henri Rose
     during the crystallization of the transparent acid, are not in general
     so intense in the solution of the opake acid.
        10th. That the difference which has been observed in the action
    of the two arsenious acids on the tincture of litmus is merely appa
    rent.—Journ. de Chim. Méd., Fevrier 1848.

 LIV. On the Decomposition and Dispersion of Light within
    Solid and Fluid Bodies. By Sir DAVID BREwsTER, K.H.,
    D.C.L., F.R.S., and V.P.R.S. Edin.”
                              [With a Plate.]
      AUYt, and other mineralogists, observed the two colours
        which are visible in .# varieties of fluor-spar. He
 regarded the two tints as complementary, and explained them,
as he did every other analogous phaenomenon, by a reference
to the colours of thin plates. In describing a species of di
chroism noticed by Dr. Prouti in the purpurates of ammonia
and potash, Sir John Herschel ascribes the green reflected
lighty “to some peculiar conformation of the green surfaces
producing what may be best termed a superficial colour, or
one analogous to the colour of thin plates, and striated or
dotted surfaces.” And he adds—“A remarkable example of
such superficial colour, differing from the transmitted tints, is
met with in the green fluor of Alston Moor, which, on its
surfaces, whether natural or artificial, exhibits in certain lights
a deep blue tint, not to be removed by any polishing.”
    Having, many years ago, found the same property in the
Derbyshire fluor-spars, I was led to study it with particular
attention; and in 1838 I communicated the results of my
observations to the British Association at Newcastle||. In
every specimen in which the colour in question exists, I found
it to arise from internal, and not from superficial reflexion. In
an extensive series of experiments on the absorption of light
by the aqueous and alcoholic solutions of the colouring matter
of plants, I found this property of internal dispersion in thirty
or forty of these solutions. The most remarkable of these

  402 Sir D. Brewster on the Decomposition and Dispersion
  was the alcoholic solution of the colouring matter of the leaves
  of the common laurel. At first its colour is a bright green,
  afterwards changing into a fine olive colour; but in all its
  stages it disperses light of a brilliant blood-red colour, which
  forms a striking contrast with the transmitted tint. After a
  long exposure to light, the transmitted tint almost wholly
  disappears, while the dispersed light retains its red colour*.
  Another very remarkable example of internal dispersion,
  pointed out to me by Mr. Schunck, is exhibited in an alkaline
  or in an alcoholic solution of a resinous powder produced from
  orcine by contact with the oxygen of the air. Its colour by
  transmitted light is reddish brown, and the light which it di
  sperses is of an exceedingly rich green colour.                -
     Since these experiments were made, my attention has been
  called to two interesting papers by Sir John Herschel in the
  last part of the Philosophical Transactions; the one on a case
 of super<U+017F>icial colour presented by a homogeneous liquid internally
 colourless, and the other on the epipolic (or superficial) dispersion
 of light; and as these papers contain results incompatible with
 those which I had previously published, I found it necessary
 to resume the investigation of the subject.
     The two papers now referred to are chiefly occupied with a
 description of the phaenomena of coloured dispersion, as ex
 hibited in a diluted solution of sulphate of quinine in weak
 sulphuric acid. Owing to the solution being nearly colourless
 by transmitted light, the general phaenomenon is very beau
 tiful. The line of bright blue light dispersed by the stratum
 of fluid immediately beneath the surface of incidence, and
 about the fiftieth of an inch thick, appears to be confined to
 that stratum; and it is in this respect only that the phaeno
 menon differs from that which is exhibited by fluor-spar and
 the vegetable solutions which I have mentioned.
            1. On the Internal Dispersion of Fluor-Spar.
     There are many varieties of fluor-spar in which no disper
 sion of the intromitted light takes place. It does not exist in
    * I showed this experiment in 1836, at Lacock Abbey, to Mr. FoxTalbot,
 and several members of the British Association. At the meeting of the
 British Association at Manchester, in 1842, a friend handed to me, in the
sectional meeting, a “solution of stramonium in aether,” which dispersed a
bright green light. I described the phaenomenon to the meeting, and it is
noticed in the Transactions of the Sections, p. 14. Upon making the so
lution myself, I cannot obtain the same tints, either from the stalk or the
dried leaves of the plant. The solution of the leaves disperses a brilliant
red tint, like that mentioned in the text. The solution put into my hands
must therefore have been one of the seeds of stramonium, or of some other
substance possessing internal dispersion in a high degree.
                                                                            |

             of Light within Solid and Fluid Bodies.           403
the yellow, red, and bright blue varieties which I have examined.
It occurs chiefly in the green fluor from Alston Moor, and in
several pink and bluish-yellow varieties from Derbyshire. In
order to observe the phaenomena of dispersion most distinctly,
I transmit a condensed beam of the sun's light through the
specimen when partially covered with black wax or black
velvet. In some specimens, the intromitted beam is partially
dispersed in a fine blue tint from every part of the solid which
it traverses; but in other specimens, which are composed of
strata of different colours, parallel to the faces of the cube, a
very different and a very instructive phaenomenon is displayed.
The intromitted beam ABC, fig. 1, Plate V., is crossed with
bands of dispersed light of ãº, colours and of different
intensities. In one case, a pink light was dispersed from the
stratum close to the surface of incidence; from the next stra
tum there was no dispersion at all; this was followed by a
narrow stratum, which dispersed a bright whitish light; then
succeeded a stratum of non-dispersing fluor, and alternately
dispersing and non-dispersing strata, scattering the fine blue
light which has already been mentioned.
   These results, which I have shown to different persons, are
incompatible with those obtained by Sir John Herschel with
the very same variety of fluor-spar. He regards the blue
dispersed light as strictly an epipolic or super<U+017F>ºcial tint, so
superficial, indeed, “that it might be referred to a peculiar
texture of the surface, the result of crystallization, were it not
that it appears equally on a surface artificially cut and po
lished *.” Were I to hazard a conjecture respecting the cause
of this difference in our results, I would ascribe it to the dif
ferent degrees of light in which the observations were made.
While I used a condensed beam of the sun's light, Sir John
Herschel seems to have employed chiefly the ordinary light of
day. In studying the phaenomena in the solution of quinine,
he “exposed it to strong daylight or sunshine;” and in an
other experiment, which pre-eminently required a powerful
illumination, he “directed a sunbeam downwards on the sur
face, by total reflexion from the base of a prism,” which was
in reality inferior to the ordinary sun's light. In the case of
fluor-spar, however, he states that the epipolic colour is seen
in perfection when “exposed to daylight at a window.” In
such a feeble light I could not have seen the phaenomena I
have described; and it is owing chiefly to the intensity of the
 light which I employed, that I have been enabled to place it
 beyond a doubt that the blue light dispersed by fluor-spar is
 reflected from every part of the interior of the crystal, and is
                * Philosophical Transactions, 1845, p. 143.

404      Sir D. Brewster on the Decomposition and Dispersion
not produced by any action either strictly or partially super
ficial, or solely by any stratum near the surface.
    Sir John Herschel mentions that the green fluor-spar of
Alston Moor is the only solid in which he has observed an
epipolic tint. It is the only mineral in which I have found
an internal dispersion, excepting, of course, the minerals which
exhibit the analogous phaenomena of opalescence and chatoy
ance; but I have found several glasses which possess it, one
in particular of a yellow colour, which disperses a brilliant
green light, and another of a bright pink colour, which also
disperses a green light, and a third of an orange colour, which
disperses rays of a whitish-green colour. In these cases, the
glass has a decided colour of its own; but I have found many
specimens, both of colourless plate and colourless flint-glass,
which disperse a beautiful green light.
  2. On the Internal Dispersion of the Solution of Sulphate of
                                   Quinine.
    Sir John Herschel describes the epipolic dispersion of this
solution as “occupying a very narrow parallelogram, having
a breadth of about a fiftieth of an inch, of a vivid and nearly
uniform blue colour over its whole breadth”;” but upon
 “directing a sunbeam downwards on the surface, by total re
flexion from the base of a prism, a feeble blue gleam was
observed to extend downwards below this vivid line to nearly
 half an inch from the surface, thus leaving it doubtful whether
 some small amount of dispersion may not be effected in the
 interior of the medium at appreciable depths.” By using
 condensed solar light, this doubt is immediately removed, and
 the phaenomenon ranks itself as one of internal dispersion,
 differing only in the law of its intensity from those which I
 have already described. In the one the dispersible rays are
 thrown gradually, in the other quickly, from the intromitted
 beam,_-a phaenomenon to a great extent identical with what .
 takes place in the analogous phaenomena of absorption.
    If the dispersing action of the solution were rigorously con
 fined to a stratum the fiftieth of an inch thick, it would have
 followed of necessity, that “an epipolized beam of light (mean
 ing thereby a beam which has been once transmitted through
 a quiniferous solution, and undergone its dispersing action) is
    * The best method of seeing this experiment, is to take the solution into
 the open air, where the whole light of a blue sky can fall upon its surface.
 I have in this way seen the blue line perfectly luminous at that stage of a
 December twilight when there was not light enough to read by.             I con
 sider, therefore, the light of the sky as peculiarly susceptible of this species
 of dispersion.                                                               º
                                   -

             of Light within Solid and Fluid Bodies.          405
incapable of further undergoing epipolic dispersion;” but as
the dispersing action is not thus limited, that conclusion must
be incorrect.    Sir John Herschel, indeed, has deduced this
result from direct experiment with a plate of glass immersed
vertically in a quiniferous solution. In this case he could
perceive no trace of colour, either at the ingress or egress of
the epipolized beam which was incident upon the plate. Sir
John does not mention the distance of the plate from the epi
polizing stratum. If the distance was small, we are confident,
from direct experiment, that the blue tint would have been
seen; but if the distance was considerable, then the beam,
incident upon the glass, must have been previously shorn of
all its dispersible rays.
   In examining the blue rays themselves, Sir John found that
they consisted of a “small per-centage of rays, extending over
a great range of refrangibility.” They formed, however, a
continuous spectrum deprived of the less refrangible red,
nearly of the whole orange, and all the yellow ; a rich and
broad band of fine green light, slightly fringed with red, passed
into a copious indigo and violet without the intermediate blue.
   The comparatively feeble light of the dispersed blue rays
renders it difficult to ascertain their susceptibility of being a
second time dispersed. Sir John Herschel could not obtain
any indication of this susceptibility; but we have no doubt
that, with condensed light, their second dispersion will be
discovered: and we are led to this opinion by the fact, that
 Sir John believed that the epipolic dispersion takes place in
all directions, and therefore expected to discover a second
dispersion under circumstances in which, according to my
experiments, it could not be found.           -
    Sir John has clearly shown, that the light is dispersed out
 wards as well as laterally; but as he was conversant only with
 the phaenomena of a narrow blue line, and had not seen the
 blue cone of rays dispersed from the cone of condensed light,
 he could not be aware of the changes which take place in its
 colour while the eye passes from the azimuth of 90° to that
 of 100°.
    These changes are very decided, and will be understood
 from fig. 2, in which MNOP is a horizontal section of the
 vessel containing the solution; RR' a beam of solar light in
 cident upon an achromatic lens LL, and condensed into the
 luminous cone ACB. . Now, the blue colour produced by the
 first stratum, next to the side AB, is exceedingly strong, and
 that which occupies the rest of the cone ACB comparatively
 faint. When we view the bright blue stratum in the direction
 NM, or in the azimuth of 90°, the tint is very brilliant, because

406 Sir D. Brewster on the Decomposition and Dispersion
the eye receives all the blue rays dispersed by the whole length
AB of the stratum ; whereas, when we view it in the direction
R'C, in the azimuth of 0°, we only see the tint corresponding
to the thickness of the stratum. The tint, however, is, in reality,
a maximum in the azimuth of 0°, and gradually diminishes till
it ceases in the azimuth of 180°, or in the direction CR'.
    If we now immerse in the fluid a plate of colourless glass,
whose section is DE, so as to receive the beam ABED, we shall
find that there is no peculiar dispersion, as Sir John Herschel
observed, either at its surface of incidence or emergence.
Hence he concluded that the epipolized beam ABED “is in
capable of undergoing further epipolic dispersion; ” and that
having thus “lost a property which it originally possessed, it
could not therefore be considered qualitatively as the same
light.”
  *Now,       in using a condensed beam of light, as we have
done, we find that the whole cone ABC, even when two inches
long, and with a December sun, disperses the blue light, and
the stratum behind the glass plate DE nearly as much as the
stratum before it.         In fluor-spar and in the other fluids I have
mentioned, this is still more strikingly the case”, and hence
neither of the conclusions drawn by Sir John Herschel are
admissible.
    The following appear to me to be the deductions which the
experiments actually authorize:—
    1. A beam of light which has suffered dispersion by the
 action of a solid or fluid body (that is, an epipolized beam), is
capable of further undergoing epipolic dispersion, provided
 the thickness of the medium is not so great as to have dispersed
 all the dispersible rays.
    2. When such a medium is thus rendered incapable of
 dispersing more light, it is not because it has lost a property
 which it originally possessed, but because it is deprived of all
 the dispersible rays which it contained.
    It is no doubt an interesting fact, that a small number of
 differently coloured rays, constituting blue light by their mix
 ture, should possess this property of being dispersed, while
   * In one of these experiments, a piece of green fluor from Alston Moor,
 when immersed in the quiniferous solution, dispersed a fine violet blue light,
 at the distance of three-fourths of an inch from its surface. In another
 experiment, a beam of light that had been dispersed in the solution of qui
 mine, again suffered dispersion at two inches distance from the surface of a
 piece of Derbyshire fluor.
    A beam of light that has passed through the esculine solution disperses
 blue light, but not copiously, when transmitted through the quinine solution;
 but the beam that has passed through quinine is copiously dispersed when
 transmitted through esculine.
                                                                                .

             of Light within Solid and Fluid Bodies,           407
 other rays of the same refrangibility are either less dispersible,
 or apparently indispersible, by the same medium; but the
 fact will appear less surprising and anomalous when we advert
 to certain phaenomena of absorption in which the same pro
 perty is displayed.
    The difference between the absorption and the internal
 dispersion of light is simply this. In the one case the portion
 of light withdrawn from the intromitted beam is eatinguished
and invisible, and in the other dispersed and visible; and we
 may compare the two classes of phaenomena, by supposing that
the light extinguished by absorption is rendered visible as if by
dispersion.     Now it is a remarkable fact, that almost the whole
of the blue light absorbed by the mineral called native orpi
ment is extinguished during the passage of the light through
the first stratum, whose thickness is less than the fiftieth of an
inch; and hence it is that the thinnest slice of this substance
has nearly as deep a yellow colour as the thickest. Were the
absorbed blue rays to become visible by dispersion, we should
actually see a more striking example of epipolism, or dispersion
confined to the first stratum, than in the quiniferous solution.
Even the condensation of the beam would not in this case give
us a blue cone of light.
   The analysis of the blue line, indeed, would indicate a dif
ference between the two phaenomena. It would show that
the blue light was derived chiefly from the violet, indigo, and
blue spaces, and but partially from the green, yellow, orange
and red, having appropriated the whole of the more refran
gible rays, and but a very small portion of the less refrangible
ones; whereas the blue light from the quiniferous solution is
derived almost in equal proportions from all the coloured
spaces excepting the least refrangible, red. The limitation
of the rays capable of absorption, like the limitation of the
dispersible rays in the quiniferous solution, is shown in the
action of various bodies on the spectrum. Such bodies change
the colour of certain spaces in the spectrum, without continuing
to absorb the residual rays; that is, when the absorbable rays
are removed by a certain thickness of the body, an additional
thickness operates very feebly, as in the quiniferous solution,
in altering the colour of the residual beam.
   I have pointed out these analogies between the phaenomena
of absorption and dispersion to meet the case of the bright
blue line in the quiniferous solutions. The dispersion of fluor
spar, and of the glasses and vegetable solutions already de
scribed, is of a different character. In fluor-spar the dispersion
effected by the first stratum is by no means very abundant;
and the intromitted beam, even after passing through one or

408 Sir D. Brewster on the Decomposition and Dispersion
more undispersing strata, is dispersed nearly as copiously as
before. In the glasses and in the vegetable solutions there
are no peculiarities which require explanation, excepting those
which arise from the absorption of the dispersed beam in pass
ing through the coloured medium.
   When the phaenomena of internal dispersion are exhibited
in coloured fluids and solids, the influence of absorption upon
the dispersed light is very interesting. Previous to its di
spersion, the light has the same colour as the transmitted light;
were it to emerge at that point of its path, and when viewed
at an azimuth above 90°, a portion of the dispersed light has
that colour. The quantity of light possessing this colour in
creases between the azimuth of 90° and 180°.            In order to
see this effect disembarrassed from another influence, we must
make the intromitted beam parallel to the surface of the fluid
or solid, so as just to graze it. In this way the dispersed light
is not changed in its passage to the eye after dispersion. When
the beam passes through the coloured medium without this
precaution, it again suffers absorption proportional to the
thickness of the coloured substance through which it has
passed, and sometimes disappears altogether. This effect is
finely seen in the darker solutions, which disperse a brilliant
red, or a brilliant green light; the colour of the former be
coming yellowish-green and whitish, while that of the latter
becomes whitish-yellow.
           3. On the Polarization of Dispersed Light.
   As the dispersed light is turned from its path by reflexion,
and is reflected at angles proper for polarizing it, its partial po
larization at least might have been anticipated. Sir John Her
schel viewed it through a tourmaline, and states that no signs of
polarization were perceived in it; but his method of obtaining
the blue line from light diverging from a large area of the sky,
and therefore reflected at various angles far above and far
below the polarizing angle, rendered it impracticable to detect
its state of polarization. The method which I adopted, of
using a narrow cylindrical beam of strong light, affording a
bright dispersed beam more than an inch in length, enabled
me to discover its polarization, and to investigate its pecu
liarities.
   Upon examining the blue beam in the quiniferous solution
with an analysing rhomb of calcareous spar, I found that a
considerable part of it, consisting chiefly of the less refrangible
portion of its rays, was polarized in the plane of reflexion;
while the more refrangible of its rays, constituting an intensely
blue beam, had a different state of polarization.

              of Light within Solid and Fluid Bodies.                      409
   This insulation of the bluer rays greatly increased the beauty
of the phaenomenon, and promised to throw some light upon
its cause.     I was therefore anxious to ascertain their state of
polarization, which was not indicated by the analysing rhomb.
    With this view I transmitted through the solution a strong
beam of polarized light, and was surprised to find that the blue
beam, which it yielded by dispersion, retained the same in
tensity in every position of the analysing prism, and therefore
possesses a quaquaversus polarization, such as that which light
receives when transmitted through a congeries of minute
doubly refracting crystals, having their axes in all possible
directions.
    In making the same experiment with other dispersing fluids
and solids, I found some in which the whole beam was com
pletely polarized in the plane of reflexion, and others in which
it exhibited solely a quaquaversus polarization; but as these
experiments indicate new processes in the decomposition and
polarization of light, which require a more extended analysis,
I shall resume the subject in a separate communication, con
tenting myself at present with a general account of the more
important facts, and the results to which they lead.
    Having transmitted a condensed beam of light through an
alcoholic solution of the leaves of the common laurel, or of
tea, either green or black, I found that the bright red beam
which it dispersed, possessed, like the blue one in the quini
ferous solution, a quaquaversus polarization, a small portion
of the light being polarized in the plane of reflexion. The
green beam dispersed by the preparation of orcine has the same
properties, the white portion of it disappearing and reappearing
during the revolution of the analysing rhomb. In the aqueous
solution of esculine", the dispersed pencil consists of two finely
contrasted pencils; the one whitish and polarized in the plane
of reflexion, and the other a very deep blue, having quaqua
versus polarization. The white pencil is more intense than
the blue one, which is the very reverse of what takes place in
the solution of quinine.          The alcoholic solution of the seeds
of the Colchicum autumnale gives a bright and copious green
beam of dispersed light, which consists of two pencils, one
whitish and polarized in the plane of reflexion, and the other
bright green, with a quaquaversus polarization. The same
property is possessed by a solution of guaiacum in alcohol,
which disperses, by the stratum chiefly near its surface, a
beautful violet light; and also by an alcoholic solution of sul
phate of strychnine, which disperses a green light, after it has
   * In the alcoholic solution of esculine, the faint-blue approaches to violet.
The polarization is like that in quinine.

 410      Sir D. Brewster on the Decomposition and Dispersion
 stood for some days. The same property is possessed by almost
 all the oils, in some of which the dispersed light is exceedingly
  beautiful, varying from a pale green to a blue tint.
     The polarization of the dispersed beam in one plane, namely
  in the plane of reflexion, is exhibited in several fluids and solids.
  It is very marked in the bile of the ox, which disperses an olive
  green light; in a solution of gum-myrrh in alcohol diluted
  with water, which disperses a bright white beam; and in an
 orange-coloured glass, which disperses a pale greenish beam.
     In many fluid solutions, the beam with a quaquaversus po
 larization is very intense, when compared with the faint pencil
 which is polarized in the plane of reflexion; but in a specimen
 of yellow Bohemian glass, which gives a copious and brilliant
 green beam by dispersion, the whole of the beam possesses a
 quaquaversus polarization.
     When we view the dispersed beam in different azimuths,
 some very interesting phaenomena present themselves to our
 notice. In general, the colour of the dispersed light suffers a
 considerable change, passing, between the azimuths of 90° and
  180°, from the colour of the dispersed beam to the colour of
 the transmitted beam. This effect is finely seen in the alco
 holic solution of tea, where the brilliant red light passes into
 an olive tint; but it is still more remarkable in a mixture of
prussian blue and water. The dispersed beam is polarized in
 the plane of reflexion. It is bluish in the azimuth of 90°;
pinkish about the azimuth of 100°; greenish in that of 120°;
 bluish in azimuth 150°; and again pinkish in azimuth 170°.
 These three last tints may be all seen at the same time.
    Such are the general phaenomena of internal dispersion, a
 subject which promises to throw some light on the constitution
 of those solid and fluid bodies by which it is produced. The
 apparently superficial dispersion in the quinine solution, to
 which Sir John Herschel has given the name of epipolism, is
 obviously a single case of the general phaenomenon, in which
 the ordinates of the curve of dispersion diminish rapidly after
 the light has entered the stratum nearest the surface; while
the real epipolism, which he ascribes to fluor-spar, so far from
being an action of the surface, is much less so than that of the
quiniferous solution, and entirely similar in its character to
that which is produced by the fluids and solids which I have
examined,
    The phaenomenon of internal dispersion, when considered
merely as a case of reflexion and polarization, possesses much
novelty and interest. If the exciting beam, as we may call it,
is cylindrical, we have before us an experiment, in which the
phaenomena of cylindrical reflewion and cylindrical polariza
                                   r

            of Light within Solid and Fluid Bodies.            4, 11
tion are at once exhibited to us. The innumerable reflecting
surfaces, receiving the intromitted beam at all possible angles,
reflect the incident light in all possible directions, so that the
eye, wherever it is placed, sees the beam as if it were self
luminous; and while the eye is made to revolve in a circle
round the cylindrical beam, it receives a pencil of polarized
light—polarized in a plane passing through the eye and the
axis of the cylinder; or, what is the same thing, a thousand
spectators viewing this beam in the same azimuth, but in di
rections differently inclined to the horizon, would all see
exactly the same phaenomena of reflexion and polarization |
4. On the Causes of the Internal Decomposition and Dispersion
                             of Light.
    In imperfectly crystallized minerals, such as particular spe
cimens of adularia, chrysoberyl, opal and supphire, the white
and coloured opalescence, and the asterial radiations, have been
shown to arise from minute vacuities, or from open spaces with
crystallized sides, or from narrow pipes, or linear spaces parallel
 to the edges of the primitive or secondary forms of the mineral.
 In tabasheer, where the vacuities contain air, which we can
 expel and send back at pleasure, a fine blue light is dispersed,
 depending no doubt on the size of the vacuities. In a very
 remarkable specimen of calcareous spar, crowded with hemi
 trope veins, I have observed a copious internal dispersion
produced by the reflexion of light at the different surfaces,
 which, though in optical contact, have different degrees of
 extraordinary refraction.
    All these phaenomena, however, are essentially different
 from those which form the subject of this paper, with the ex
 ception of the placnomena of fluor-spar, in so far at least as
 they are the result of imperfect crystallization. The epipolism
 which Sir John Herschel ascribes to this mineral, or its internal
 dispersion, according to my experiments, does not belong to
 the species, but only to particular varieties, and not even to
 the variety, but merely to particular parts of it; it is therefore
 the result of unequal or imperfect crystallization. The nucleus
 is perfect, a coating supervenes, having a different tint by
 transmitted light, and dispersing a fine blue light, and so on
 through a succession of strata,  ãº.         differently coloured
 lights, and separated by non-dispersing spaces. An extra
 neous element, therefore, depending on the state of the solu
 tion, has been successively introduced into the crystal; and if
 it had the same refractive and dispersive power as the fluor
 spar, it could not reflect any portion of the intromitted beam.
 But if there is any difference in the mean refraction, or in the

412       On the Decomposition and Dispersion of Light.
dispersive power, or if the difference consists merely in the
unequal length of certain portions of the two spectra, then in
all these cases light will be dispersed by the extraneous ele
ment. If, for example, we place a film of oil of cassia between
two prisms of flint glass, the light reflected from the film will
be blue. The index of refraction for certain of the red rays is
the same in the glass and in the oil, and consequently none
of these rays enter into the reflected pencil, which must there
fore be blue, whatever be the inclination of the incident rays.
If we now suppose this film of oil to be solidified, and dissemi
nated in infinitely small atoms through flint glass, or a fluid
that has the same action as the glass upon light, we should
have the phaenomenon of a blue dispersion*.
    A beam of blue light thus produced should be polarized at
the polarizing angle, and partially polarized at other angles;
and if this is not its character, we must look for some cause
by which it has been counteracted. We have already seen
that, in the Bohemian yellow glass, none of the light is polar
ized by reflexion; and that in the quiniferous solution only a
part of it is so polarized, the whole pencil in the one case, and
the residual pencil in the other, having a quaquaversus polar
ization. This effect cannot be the result of an opposite po
larization by the refraction of the dispersed light at the surfaces
of the reflecting particles, because such an action would only
reduce the amount of polarization by reflexion; and I have
found by direct experiment, namely, by making the blue light
pass through different thicknesses of the fluid, that such an
effect is not produced. Unless, therefore, we suppose that
this quaquaversus polarization is a new property of light, pro
duced by a peculiar action of certain solid and fluid bodies,
we are driven to the conclusion, no less remarkable, that it is
produced by an infinite number of doubly refracting crystals,
having their axes of double refraction lying in every possible
direction, and therefore reflecting from their posterior surfaces
a pencil of light with quaquaversus polarization.

LV. Remarks on a Paper by the Rev. Brice Bronwin, On the
   Solution of a particular Differential Equation. By GEoRGE
   Boole, Esq.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
THE current         Number (April) of the Philosophical Ma
       gazine contains a paper by the Rev. Brice Bronwin, On
the Solution of a particular Differential Equation, upon which
I beg leave to offer a few remarks. Mr. Bronwin is pleased to
consider his researches as supplementary to an investigation of
my own, which was published in the Cambridge Mathematical
Journal, New Series, Jan. 1847, and he is led by them to dis
pute the accuracy of certain conclusions at which I had arrived.
My immediate design in the present communication, is to show
that these conclusions are, on the contrary, perfectly lawful;
but in doing this, I must ask permission to make such accom
panying observations as may render it unnecessary for me to
trouble you, under any circumstances, with another letter on
the subject.
    It will not be irrelevant to premise, that the original design
of my investigation was to integrate the equation of Laplace's
functions in such a form as would permit the calculation of
their actual values. This object I had previously attempted
 by a method which I have given in the Philosophical Trans
 actions for 1844, part 2, On a General Method in Analysis.
 That method is founded on the proposition, that every linear
 differential equation and every linear equation in finite differ
 ences, whose coefficients are rational functions of a, can be
 reduced to the form
                 fºr(r)u +f(t)ou +f,(a)pºu... =X,        . . (1.)
 w and p being operative functions, which satisfy the conditions
                 Tpu=p(T + 1)u, f(r)P” =f(m)p”.
    It may be mentioned, that the integrable forms of a differ
 ential equation of this description can be determined in various
 cases, and especially in this, viz. when the equation has but
 two terms in its first member. Now the equation of Laplace's
 functions, treated according to the above method, was found
 to have three terms in its first member; nor was it included
 in those other forms of the same kind, the integrability of
  which I had at that time ascertained.
     It occurred to me, therefore, to devise an analogous form
 of the differential equation, in which the operating symbol r
  should be replaced by two symbols ºrn, ºr, and I was led to
  consider the equation
                         wnt, u+qpu-0, . . . . . . (2.)

414            Mr. G. Boole on the Solution of a
in which ra, ra, and p satisfy the conditions
                  Trnpu-pirm.4-111,   Tnpu =Pºn+1tl
                  Tmºr, u-Tarm u +a(n-m)pu
(Mr. Bronwin has changed p into A and q into p). Of the
above equation I assigned two complete forms of solution, and
I showed that Laplace's equation might be treated as a very
particular example of the more general problem thus intro
duced. But at this stage of the inquiry, a transformation
suggested itself to me by which Laplace's equation was made
to satisfy the condition to which I had previously failed to
subject it. This led to a resumption of the prior method, and
to the complete accomplishment of all that I at first contem
plated (Cambridge Mathematical Journal, New Series, vol. i.
p. 10). It led also to the abandonment of any further re
searches on the equation (2.). What had been accomplished
was, however, published in the same journal, Jan. 1847. It
is this unfinished episode in the investigation, if I may be
allowed the expression, which Mr. Bronwin has undertaken
to complete; and it is to the correction of some misapprehen
sions which I venture to think that he has formed as to the
principles upon which such investigations are to be conducted,
that I am here desirous of contributing.
   Mr. Bronwin rightly apprehends that the solution of the
general equation
                        wn tra u +qpu-X
would be
         -
        *=7m-£17m.42                =- 1 -1

but he conceives that I have erred in rejecting the inverse       *
                                                                    !

                         -1       -1        -1
                       *mir-1" mir-2      "ºn
in the particular case of X=0. He asserts that it is always
necessary to retain such inverse factors, and to determine the
values of the arbitrary constants by final substitution in the
original equation; and he adduces, by way of illustration, the
equation
                            d2
                  (1–4%)    # +p(p-1)us=0.
   There are here involved, if I am not deceived, both a false
analogy and an erroneous principle. First, the equation
adduced is not analogous to the one which was under consi
deration, and it is not solved by an analogous process. The
relative position of the direct and the inverse factors of opera
tion in the one case, is the reverse of what it is in the other.

  Secondly, it is quite within the province of theory to determine
  how the superfluous constants of the solution of a differential
  equation shall be disposed of.--to decide which of the opera
  ting factors must be retained, and which of them may be re
 jected. It was upon a theoretical consideration that I decided
  upon placing certain elements of the solution at which I arrived,
  in the latter class; but instead of enforcing that consideration
  here, I prefer to prove the correctness of the conclusion to
  which it led me, by exhibiting the result in a purely quanti
  tative form. It will be interesting to show how, in a case of
 more than ordinary difficulty, the conclusions of theory may
 be practically verified. For the laws which govern the appli
 cation of the inverse factors, in connexion with the more
 general method already adverted to, I must refer, in illustra
 tion of the above remarks, to the original memoir in the Phi
 losophical Transactions, p. 249.
    Let us then first consider the solution
                -                            -1.-1          -1

 in which all the factors are retained.                                    -
    Since Top =pri, we have r1=p-'rºp, and by induction,
 wn =p-"Top", from which we readily obtain
                       -  - -    -        -             +r – a –?   -1     m + r.

 Again, since tra -p-"Top", we have on inversion
                               - 1 - ... -n_-1 on
                             ºr *=p T“ro p".
Lastly, reducing in this way the remaining inverse factors, we
have
             -    -            - I - --       •)/ºr-1,0\r-t-1,m-l.

and substituting these forms in the general solution, there
results

Now the forms of to and p employed in my paper were
                                    d

                      p(t)=    *:#2 +bt+c.
Hence we have

   In this equation let us replace p(t) by its value    º:  +bt+c,
and integrate the result in a series. We shall thus find

Now since the values of cp_i range from co to cº, i. e. from
p=1 to p-r-t-1, after which they vanish, it follows from the
above that the values of Ap will be arbitrary up to A, 11, after
which they will be formed from the preceding coefficients by
a law whose expression is

the inverse factors T., T., , ... "...' in the symbolical so

tion (3.) is also general and not particular; and that while the
arbitrary constants introduced by the inverse factors ºr, 'T.,

must be retained, those which are introduced by the other in
verse factors may indifferently be retained or rejected. There are
two or perhaps three distinct fallacies in Mr. Bronwin's reason
ings on these points; but the remarks already offered,—offered,
 I trust, in no captious spirit,-may be deemed sufficient.
    It is indeed with sincere pleasure that I quit a topic, upon
which, had my reputation alone been concerned, I would
willingly have been spared the necessity of writing, and ac
knowledge that upon some other points Mr. Bronwin has
added to the completeness of the investigation. To each of
the two cases already determined, he has added another form
 of solution ; and the value which he has assigned to tra, though
not quite the most general+, is much more general than the one
which I had contented myself with employing.
    It is further but just to Mr. Bronwin to remark, that in
questions like that which he has undertaken to examine, farmore
than the ordinary caution which the mathematician is bound
to exercise appears to be demanded. A settled conviction
 that there is no anomaly which may not be explained, no ex
ception but which may and which ought to be referred to some
governing principle, with the corresponding habit of patient
research and cautious inference, is essential to the success of
this class of speculations. Dismissing, however, the more
immediate subject of these comments, I cannot but observe
upon the fact as somewhat remarkable, that in pure mathe
matics, controversy and misunderstanding should be so rife,
as for some years they appear to have been. It would, I con
ceive, be interesting to inquire into the causes of a state of
things which, judging a priori, we should so little expect. One
reason is undoubtedly to be found in the unmeasured capabi
lities of the modern analysis for the expression of general
theorems, and in the practically frequent employment of ana
logy and induction, especially as suggestive aids, in contra
distinction to the purely deductive processes and more limited
conclusions of the ancient geometry. But it may be doubted
whether this is a sufficient explanation of the fact in question.
A far more influential cause is, I believe, to be found in
the almost entire absence of any direct study of the laws of
correct reasoning in connexion with the practical discipline of
modern science. But this is a topic which I do not venture
upon the present occasion more fully to discuss,

Theº are many interesting scraps of minor information
      respecting Mathematics and its cultivators, contained in
letters and stray papers, which it is desirable to preserve;
either as affecting the characters of the men or explaining the
circumstances attending their discoveries and publication. A
few such have fallen in my way at different times; and if you
think them adapted to the pages of your Magazine, I shall now
and then send a few, as you can find room for them.
   I shall in all cases state the sources of my information, and
where the documents are deposited; so that the extracts may
be hereafter verified by any one who shall feel desirous of
doing so. Possibly some of your readers who may take an
interest in the minutiae of scientific history, may be induced
also to contribute anything of a similar kind that may fall in
their way.
   My first set of extracts will be made from a series of letters
addressed by different mathematicians to the celebrated pub
lisher, John Nourse of the Strand, which were placed in my
hands by Mr. Maynard (of Earl's Court, Leicester Square),
and which, when fully examined, will be returned to him.
Meanwhile, he has allowed me to make this or any other use
of them that I may think proper.
   These letters place Nourse in a very estimable light as a
liberal patron of mathematical authors; and they prove that
he was well-versed in the science in which he principally
dealt—not “the mere merchant of other men's brains.”
   Amongst the letters are twenty-seven from Dr. Robert
Simson, commencing in 1751 and terminating in 1768, the
year before the Doctor's death. They mainly relate to the
Euclide and the Loci Plani.        From these I shall send a few
extracts for your next number; for as this introductory notice
will take up some space, there would scarcely be room in the
present one. On this account, I shall now give a copy of a
letter from the son of the great MacLaurin to Nourse, respect
ing one of those vulgar attempts to render eminent men ridi
culous (even where there was not the least ground for the
story) which were so common in the last century. Even
within the last few months this story has been repeated in one
at least (probably in more) of our periodicals. Most likely
the story was originally a hoax upon Goldsmith.

of the Earth that you are the publisher of that work, and as
the author is dead, to you I must complain of a most injurious
though not scandalous misrepresentation of my deceased
father, which is to be found in it, vol. ii. p. 91. There t'other
day happening accidentally to take up the book, I to my
astonishment read the following passage:—‘For one person
to yawn is sufficient to set all the rest of the company a yawn
ing. A ridiculous instance of this was commonly practised
upon the famous MacLaurin, one of the Professors at Edin
burgh. He was very subject to have his jaw dislocated, so
that when he opened his mouth wider than ordinary, or when
he yawned, he could not shut it again. In the midst of his
harangues, therefore, if any of his pupils began to be tired of
his lecture, he had only to gape or yawn and the Professor
instantly caught the sympathetic affection, so that he thus
continued to stand speechless, with his mouth wide open, till
his servant from the next room was called in to set his jaw
again.”

tuous than this description, at the same time nothing can be
more false, as hundreds of the most respectable persons in
England can attest. Mr. MacLaurin had no such defect,

any other philosopher hitherto has been) a man of a handsome
person, elegant manners, and graceful delivery. It is very
hard therefore that he should be thus held forth as an object
of laughter and contempt in a book which, from the nature of
the subject and supposed merit of the author, will probably
reach posterity, and be dispersed thro’ the World in different

     The letter itself appears (from the folding) to have been
 placed in a cover, and there is no superscription or direction.
 Though, therefore, I have supposed that it was addressed to
 Nourse, I have no other ground for such an opinion than that
 it was found amongst a mass of letters which were so addressed.
 My own impression is that Andrew Millar was the early pub
 lisher of Goldsmith's work, though I have no means of con
 sulting a copy of a date antecedent to this letter. There
 are, at all events, no other letters to Millar amongst these :
 and the chief difficulty is to conjecture how a letter addressed
 to one publisher should get amongst those of his neighbour;
 especially as no very friendly feeling existed between the pub
 lishers, nor much of sympathy between the scientific and
 literary classes of that period.

    Esq., M.A. of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Barrister-at
    Law of the Middle Temple+.
 AT      page 129 of a memoir referred to below f, Murphy has
        given a rule by means of which we may express in the
form of a series a root of any equation containing only positive
and integer powers of the unknown quantity. In this memoir
there is no allusion to any prior discovery of the rule; and
Murphy subsequentlyi refers to the process without mention
of any other writer in connexion with it, and appears to regard
himself as its originator. The rule seems to have been hi
therto attributed to him S, and I have fallen into the same
error at page 363 of the present volume of this Journal||. It

   | Among the defects of my paper here referred to, are the having omitted
to make mention of the name of Wandermonde, the great rival of Lagrange in
the department of science there discussed, and also of Simpson's (subsidiary)
and Professor J. R. Young's (indirect) solution of a biquadratic. And Mr.
Davies has requested me to say, that from the haste with which his notes
on my paper were written, he omitted to refer to a very neat and elegant

will however be found that Lagrange had long before arrived
at the same result.       In his memoir cited below *, the last-men
tioned illustrious analyst expresses the root of such an equa
tion as that above alluded to by means of the same (logarithmic)
process as that employed in the derivation of the rule of
Murphy. Although the results of Lagrange and Murphy are
identical, yet the great <U+017F>ame of the latter philosopher is fixed
upon too sure a basis to be in the slightest degree shaken,
even when we shall have restored this discovery to him to
whom it is justly due. This is not the place to dwell on the
relative lengths to which those two analysts have pushed their
researches in this direction. I may observe, that my atten
tion was attracted to the memoir of Lagrange by seeing it
 referred to by Garnier at page 353 of his Analyse (Paris,
 1814), but my leaving town on circuit and other circumstances
 prevented me from noticing it till now.

printed in the Mathematician, vols. i. and ii.; a paper to which Mr. Davies
considers it important to direct the attention of every one who takes in

   The coldest day was the 4th of August, when the mean of
the twenty-four hours was 55°-95; the hottest was the 31st of
December, which averaged 71°09.
   The last fire-fly was seen on the 10th of May, when the
twenty-four hours' average temperature was 60°87, and the
minimum was 50°-8. The first fire-fly appeared on the 25th
of July, of which the lowest temperature was 52°1, and the
mean 61°1.
   The large South-American swallow (Andorinha) was first
seen on the 15th of September, when the mean temperature
was 65°56, and the lowest 56°8.
   The American robin (Sabea) commenced its song on the
12th of August, when the average temperature was 61°1, and
the minimum 55°8. About the same time also the humming
bird ceased its low monotonous chant, which during the cold
season might have been heard from every low-sheltered bush
on the open grounds (Campos) between Gongo and Cattas

LIX. On the Heat disengaged during the Combination of
   Bodies with Oxygen and Chlorine. By THoMAS ANDREws,
   M.D., M.It.I.A., Vice-President of Queen's College, Belfast.
                      [Continued from p. 339.]
                § III. Combinations of Chlorine.
 MQ. of the experiments to           be described in this section
        were performed with dry chlorine gas. The combining
substance, included in a hermetically sealed and very fragile
glass ball, was first introduced into the glass vessel destined to
contain the gas. The latter was then filled by displacement with
pure and dry chlorine, and was afterwards closed by a dry
cork, which was traversed by a small glass tube terminating ex
ternally in a capillary point. After the chlorine had attained
the temperature of the external air, the capillary orifice was
hermetically sealed. During this period the surface of the
cork was attached by the chlorine; but careful experiments
proved that the amount of gas afterwards absorbed by the
cork was quite insignificant, at least during the length of time
occupied by the experiment.
   The glass vessel thus prepared was introduced into another
of copper, which served as a calorimeter, and was similar to
that employed in the experiments on the combination of the
gases, but of smaller size. The calorimeter was suspended,
as before, in a cylindrical vessel of tin plate. The tempera
ture of the water in the calorimeter was taken before intro
ducing the apparatus into the rotating cylinder. The whole
apparatus was then quickly shaken in order to rupture the
glass ball, and immediately placed in the rotating cylinder, in
which it was agitated for five minutes and a half. After the
final temperature had been observed, the agitation was re
peated for one minute more, and the experiment was not con
sidered accurate unless the thermometer afterwards indicated
a slight loss of heat.    Finally, the glass vessel was inverted
under water, the capillary point of the tube broken, and the
weight of the water that rushed in (the levels having been
duly adjusted) ascertained. The residual air did not, in
general, amount to more than one or two per cent. of the
whole, and was in all cases free from the slightest odour of
chlorine.                                     -
   The determination of the heat evolved during the combina
tion of potassium with chlorine involved experimental diffi
culties, which for some time appeared likely to prove insupe
rable, but were finally overcome by the employment of a some
what novel form of apparatus. The chief source of difficulty
arose from the intensity of the heat produced by the combi
                                º                              4

          On the Heat disengaged during Combination.             427
nation, which was such that no glass vessel could resist it
without breaking. Having formerly observed that chlorine
gas, if perfectly dry, has not the slightest action in the cold on
copper or zinc, it occurred to me that the experiment might
perhaps succeed, if a brass vessel were substituted for the glass
one to contain the chlorine. On making the trial with the
requisite precautions, it succeeded perfectly. The chlorine
must, however, be dried with the greatest care, and the lid of the
brass vessel closed by ground metallic surfaces without the inter
position of leather. The apparatus is represented in Plate III.
fig. 6. The lid b has attached to it two copper tubes, by means
of which the vessel is filled with chlorine. It is fixed in its place
by means of the coupling screw c. As soon as the air has been
swept away by the current of chlorine, the ends of the copper
tubes are closed by small pins of the same metal, which are
secured in their places by caoutchouc covers. While filling
the brass vessel with gas, two similar glass vessels were con
nected with it, one on each side, so as to be filled by the
same stream of gas; and the purity of the chlorine contained
in the intermediate brass vessel was ascertained by analysing
the gas in the other two vessels.
   The combining substance was in all cases employed in con
siderable excess; and from the constant agitation, the whole
of the chlorine entered into combination in the course of a
very short time.
   The formula deduced from direct observation to express
the correction required in this apparatus for the heating and
cooling influence of the air, during m minutes (a, as before,
being the difference between the temperature of the apparatus
and of the air), was the following:
                       V= Em(a + 0°-5).0°.01.
   In applying this formula, it was assumed that the apparatus
was at the initial temperature during one minute, and at the
final temperature during three minutes.

   The compound formed was the solid perchloride, PCls,
accompanied by a small quantity of the terchloride, P Cls.

considered to be imperfect approximations.

   As dry chlorine gas has no action upon zinc at ordinary tem
peratures, it was necessary to introduce a little water into the
vessel in which the reaction took place. In the experiment,
however, when thus arranged, two distinct sources of heat
existed; one, the combination of the zinc and chlorine, the
other, the solution of the compound formed. To determine
the amount of the latter, an independent experiment was made;
and by subtracting it from the whole quantity of heat at first
obtained, there remained the increment of temperature due to
the chemical combination. A small quantity of subchloride
of zinc was always formed by the action of the excess of zinc

upon the solution. This would tend to render the results a
little too high; but its precise effect I had no means of ascer
taining. The quantity of chlorine which entered into combi
nation in each experiment, was determined by precipitating
the solution (previously acidulated with nitric acid to dissolve
the subchloride) by nitrate of silver and weighing the chloride
of silver. The apparatus was considerably larger than that
employed in the foregoing experiments. In the next table, M
designates the weight of the chloride of silver.

being deducted from the mean number 1589, there remains

       Combination of Bodies with Orygen and Chlorine.         433
    From a cursory inspection of the above numbers, it will be
 evident that the quantities of heat evolved during the combi
 nation of different metals with chlorine or oxygen are very
 different, varying, in the case of the compounds of chlorine,
 from 13008 to 31 14 units for each equivalent of chlorine. On
 the other hand, there is a general resemblance between the
 amounts of heat obtained when the same metal combines with
 oxygen and chlorine. Thus iron yields 4134 units with oxygen,
 4072 with chlorine; antimony, 3817 with oxygen (Dulong),
 3804 with chlorine; tin, 4230 with oxygen, 3966 with chlo
 rine. In the case of zinc there is less agreement, and in that
 of copper, the results differ considerably; but this may per
haps arise from the compounds of chlorine with those metals
 being obtained after each experiment in the state of aqueous
solutions. The determination of the heat evolved during the
combustion of potassium in oxygen gas would throw much
light on this question. The only non-metallic element ex
amined is phosphorus, and it gave nearly twice as much heat
in combining with oxygen as with chlorine.
   It may be interesting to inquire whether the thermal effects
described in the foregoing extract can be connected with those
obtained when compounds formed of the same bodies react upon
one another by the moist way. Such a comparison is difficult
and liable to much uncertainty, from the many intermediate
reactions that occur during the formation of these compounds.
But there are two cases that admit to some extent of this
comparison, and it may be interesting briefly to refer to them.
   I have elsewhere shown, that when one and the same base
displaces another from any of its neutral combinations, the
same development of heat occurs”; and in a paper lately read
before the Royal Society, I have endeavoured to extend a
similar principle to the substitutions of metals for one another,
and have also measured the quantities of heat evolved in many
reactions of this kind. For my present object, it is only ne
cessary to refer to two of these results, viz. the heat due to the
substitution of an equivalent of oxide of zinc for oxide of cop
per (353 units), and that due to a like substitution of metallic
zinc for metallic copper (3435 units). Now on the common
view of the constitution of salts and of their solutions, the heat
evolved during the precipitation of metallic copper by zinc
should be equal to the difference of the quantities of heat dis
engaged during the combination of zinc and copper respec
tively with oxygen, added to the heat due to the substitution
of oxide of zinc for oxide of copper.       This assumes the truth
of the principle (which I have in other inquiries endeavoured
             * Philosophical Transactions for 1844, p. 21.

434 Mr. E. L. Garbett's Description of some Parhelia
 to illustrate, and is indeed almost self evident), that when, in
 the course of any chemical reaction, the constituents of a com
 pound are separated from one another, there is a quantity of
 heat thereby absorbed, equal to that which would have been
evolved if the same substances had entered into combination.

                                                          3325
 This number 3325 should, therefore, represent the heat due to
the substitution of metallic zinc for copper. The result actu
ally obtained by direct experiment was 3435, an excellent
approximation when all the varying circumstances of the par
ticular experiments are taken into consideration.
   On the other hand, in the combination of chlorine with zinc
and copper, we have—
                            Compound dry.       Compound in solution.

                                2504.                2858
    Neither of these numbers agrees with that first given for
the heat produced by the substitution of zinc for copper. The
thermal effects are therefore not favourable to the hypothesis
that the metallic chlorides exist, as such, in solution.
    In making these observations, I do not wish to attach to
them more importance than they deserve. I am fully aware
of the uncertainty of conclusions derived from a new and dif
ficult inquiry. But as the heat developed in chemical reac
tions may be taken as a measure of the forces brought into
play, I deemed it proper to refer to the foregoing cases, if only
for the purpose of directing attention to the intimate relations
which inquiries of this kind have with some of the most inter
esting questions of molecular chemistry.

centre of the isle of Portsea, on the 29th of March last.

   The first exhibition was seen in great perfection at half-past
10 A.M., when it was first pointed out to me; and as it was
then declining in brilliancy, and continued to do so, till its
disappearance soon after 11, it is probable that it might have
appeared much earlier, and attained its greatest distinctness
before I saw it. The most conspicuous and beautiful part
of this phaenomenon was a well-defined narrow white band,
passing horizontally through the sun's disc, and continued
entirely round the sky, but apparently preserving everywhere
the same altitude as the sun, or about 40°.          In the annexed
figure this band is represented by the large outer circle, and in

486     Mr. E. L. Garbett’s Description of some Parhelia
the scene of the phaenomenon; but it will of course be under
stood that each spectator saw only his own halos and parhelia,
as each one sees only his own rainbow.
    Having no means of angular measurement, I cannot be
certain that the pole of this large circle was exactly in the
zenith, but it appeared to be so; and in that case, as it always
passed through the sun, its diameter would necessarily vary
with his altitude, and would be about 102° when I first saw
it, and 98° when it vanished. The width of this band seemed
no greater than the sun's diameter, or half a degree, its upper
and lower edges being well-defined, though there was a faint
light diffused beyond them, as if the intensity throughout the
whole width of the band varied something like the ordinates
of such a curve as A (fig. 4), where it is plain that, at the two
points of contrary flexure, the rapid change of intensity would
give the effect of sharply defined edges, though the light con
tinued to diminish beyond them, making the whole breadth
of the band perhaps 13° or 2°; but the width of the conspi
cuous central part was only equal to the sun's diameter.
    There was no trace of colour in this band, and its absolute
brightness might possibly have been equal throughout its
whole circuit; but this could not be estimated; for owing to
the varying contrast afforded by the background of sky, the
band necessarily appeared to grow more and more distinct as
 it receded from the glare of the sun, till, on the opposite or
 N.N.W. side, it stood out in bold relief from the bluest part
of the sky, and it was difficult not to refer this to a gradation
in the intensity of the luminous band itself.
    The two curves of largest radius in fig. 1 represent two
other luminous bands which were much fainter, and accord
ingly disappeared much sooner than any other part of the phae
 nomenon. These bands diverged from the sun, passed over
 head as in Plate IV. fig. 2, and met again at the opposite point of
 the large white circle, where, by their intersection with it, they
 formed a knot of nebulous light, rather brighter perhaps than
 would have resulted from the mere crossing of the three lu
 minous bands, but hardly bright or definite enough to deserve
 the name of a mock-sun.        The two arcs last mentioned were
 most distinct where they approached the zenith; and here
 their distance apart seemed to the naked eye about three
 fifths of the diameter of the large circle, or about 60°. From
 these points they diminished in brightness each way, quickly
 as they approached the sun, but more slowly as they ap
  proached their other intersection, below which they could still
  be traced for a few degrees, while, on the other hand, they
  could not be traced below the sun.         These bands seemed
                                                                     :

           seen at Portsea on the 29th of March 1848.         437
rather wider than the large circle; and their edges, instead of
being sharp and colourless, were slightly fringed on the outer
or convex side with red, and on the inner side with violet;
and these coloured margins, which were not visible near the
sun, became more decided the further they receded from him,
as if the bands were formed by the overlapping of innumerable
spectra having their red ends directed exactly from the sun;
so that by their combination they would render each band
white where it had the same direction as the spectra, but more
and more coloured as it became more oblique to them; its
central line however being white throughout its length. The
knot at the triple intersection was also colourless.
   A fourth luminous arc was formed immediately over the
sun, but not concentric with him, like the common halo. The
distance of its vertex from him was indeed the same as the
radius of an ordinary halo, or about 23°; but this curve was
described with a longer radius, its centre being, as shown in
the figures, some degrees below the sun, if indeed it was not,
as I sometimes thought, a portion of an ellipse with its long
axis horizontal; and I had afterwards an opportunity of con
vincing myself that this eccentricity was not a mere perspective
deception. This arc was brighter and lasted longer than the
large horizontal circle, though it was not so much noticed b
most spectators from its inconvenient nearness to the sun. }.
consisted of all the prismatic colours arranged with the red
underneath or next the sun.     The colours were much more
decided than those of the common halo, though not quite so
positive as those of the primary rainbow, but much brighter
than either, especially at the summit of the arch, from whence
its intensity rapidly declined each way, so that it could not
be traced quite down to its intersections with the large circle.
There was no particular appearance where it crossed the
other arcs.
   The only remaining feature of this first exhibition consisted
of two detached single spectra or mock-suns, placed at equal
distances to the right and left of the real sun, and on the white
horizontal circle; but what I thought very strange, they were
not at its intersections with the coloured eccentric arch, but
rather nearer the sun. I thought at first that they might be
at the places where an ordinary halo would have crossed the
horizontal circle; but neither was this the case; for in the
afternoon, when such a halo appeared, these spectra were left
outside its circumference, and independent alike of the common
and the eccentric halo. These spectra had their red sides
next the sun, and their colours were as positive, though not
so bright, as those of the eccentric arch.

488    Mr. E. L. Garbett’s Description of some Parhelia
   Below these phaenomena and near the horizon were faint
traces of two other coloured arcs, which, however, were so
much more distinct in the second display, that they might be
regarded as belonging to it exclusively.
   All these appearances gradually faded, till soon after 11 A.M.
they had completely vanished. A little before 1 P.M. how
ever, I was surprised to find the large horizontal circle reap
pearing; and though it never regained its former distinctness,
there were some other appearances different from those of the
morning, but equally complex. These are represented in
fig. 3, projected in the same manner as fig. 2, so as to admit
of a comparison with it. The two faint arcs of large radius
passing near the zenith, were never seen in this second display,
nor yet the white parhelion at their intersection; but the two
coloured parhelia next the sun were much brighter than in
the morning, and the coloured arch over the sun became so
bright toward its vertex as to be painful to the naked eye.
This increased brilliancy seemed to arise from the coalescence
of this arch with another, which was concentric with the sun,
likea common halo, and surrounded him at apparently the usual
distance of 23°. Its appearance therefore corrected two errors
into which I might otherwise have fallen. It showed that the
eccentricity of the other coloured arch was real, and not an
effect of perspective, and also that the two prismatic mock
i. were independent, and not formed by an intersection of
 alos.
   It will be observed that this circular halo, though complete,
was by no means regular, but strongest at the upper and lower
parts, from whence it declined in brilliancy till it was hardly per
ceptible at the sides, where it crossed the horizontal circle. Its
summit exactly coincided with that of the eccentric arch, so
that their overlapping produced a dazzling brilliancy at that
part; and as the colours of both arcs were arranged in the
same order (the red inwards), they were not altered by their
combination.
   The inner edge of both these halos was, as usual, the only
one sharply defined; the outer limits of both died away gra
dually; and at their common vertex, the light often appeared
to graduate upwards with the curious rayed or hairy appear
ance shown in the figure, reminding one of the representation
of an auroral arch, in miniature. A similar appearance, but
inverted, was also seen below the foot of the circular halo,
where it seemed to touch the summit of another very luminous
but ill-defined arch, or rather nebulous mass of light, the
upper limit of which was arched, but which graduated down
wards with the bearded appearance shown in the figure. This
                                                                    f

            seen at Portsea on the 29th of March 1848.          439
 imperfect arc was colourless, but the brightest part of the whole
 exhibition, except the common summit of the two coloured
 arches.
     At equal distances to the right and left of these phaenomena,
 and much nearer the horizon, were the two fragments of co
 loured arcs faintly seen in the morning, but which now became
 as distinct as common secondary rainbows, which they greatly
 resembled in breadth and colour, except that the order of
 their colours was like that of the primary rainbow, the red
 being on the convex side, which was next the sun, as shown
 in the figure. These arcs, though very faint, lasted as long
 as any of the others.
    The large white circle was in the afternoon very irregular
in its intensity, owing to many light cirrous i. crossing
 it, some of which had the effect of extinguishing it, while
others, on the contrary, rendered it more luminous, but always
less distinct, causing it often to spread upwards and downwards
with a bearded appearance like that already described; and
wherever this appearance was seen, the rays or hairs were
exactly vertical.
    There was however always an increase in the light of this
horizontal band where it approached the outer sides of the
two prismatic mock-suns, so as to give the idea of white tails
proceeding from them on the side furthest from the sun.
There was also, as long as the phaenomenon lasted, a very
definite concentration of light much brighter than the rest of
the circle, at a spot which seemed about 120° of azimuth to the
left of the sun, so that another such focus corresponding to it
on the opposite side would nearly have divided the circle into
three equal parts; but of this last mock-sun I could never
catch a glimpse, though the other continued distinct enough
for more than half an hour.
    It may be observed, that these phaenomena occurred pre
cisely at the time of a most remarkable change in the weather,
especially in the temperature, which for the previous few
days had been such as is usually felt at this season; but the
29th of March was the first of a series of five days which
excited general surprise, as being some of the warmest ever
known #. the season. On this day the sun was unusually
powerful, but the sky a very pale blue. The wind was, at
Portsea, S. by E., in which direction there were no clouds,
but light cirri overhead, and a very regular wall of cumuli
about 5° high round the northern horizon. The barometer
was at 29-8 and rising. Though the parhelia gradually va
nished, the common circular      . seemed rather to       increase.
The following morning was wet; but at 11, when it became

440    Mr. E. L. Garbett's Description of some Parhelia
very clear, at Brighton there was a common halo, by far the
finest I ever saw, but no traces of any other arcs. On the
afternoon in London there was still a faint halo, but on the
next day nothing remarkable.
                          II. Remarks.
   The extreme variety and complexity of phaenomena of this
kind render it difficult to determine the peculiar structure
requisite in the atmosphere to produce them. If the common
halo can only be satisfactorily accounted for by the supposition
of innumerable crystals of ice turned in all possible directions,
the present phaenomenon requires us to suppose all these
crystals turned in one direction, or at least having all their
aires parallel. This is plain from the fixed relation which all
the appearances bore to the horizon and zenith, as well as to
the sun.
   Let us take, for instance, the case of the most conspicuous
feature, which happens also to be that which admits of the
simplest explanation, viz. the white horizontal circle. All the
rays by which this was seen had the same inclination to the
horizon as the direct solar rays (or some of them, viz. those
coming from some part of the sun's disc). Moreover, the absence
of colour showed that these rays had either suffered no refrac
tion, or equal and opposite amounts of refraction, so that their
change of direction could be due only to reflexion. Now in
order that a reflected ray may retain the same inclination to
the horizon that it had before reflexion, it is plain that the
reflecting surface must be vertical, though it may be turned
towards any azimuth. The appearance of this circle therefore
requires us to suppose innumerable reflecting surfaces turned
to all possible azimuths, but all of them truly vertical. This
would be the case if the air contained innumerable prisms of
ice, having all their axes vertical, but their sides turned in all
directions. All the light reflected from these sides, without
entering the prisms, would contribute to form the white circle
above described.    And this would also be the case with that
light which entered the prism and suffered an internal re
flexion from the opposite side, provided it passed out again
through a vertical face; for though the two refractions might
not always compensate each other horizontally, so as to pro
duce no change of azimuth in the ray, yet they would always
compensate each other vertically, so that the ray would suffer
no change of inclination, and consequently no dispersion into
colours in a vertical plane: and its dispersion horizontally
would not impair the achromatism of the appearance; for if

           seen at Portsea on the 29th of March 1848.         44 l
the circle were composed of innumerable horizontal spectra
overlapping each other, it would still be colourless.
   If we further trace the light that passes through two vertical
sides of these prisms without suffering reflexion, we shall see
that it emerges with no change of inclination, but with a
change of azimuth depending chiefly on the inclination of the
two refracting faces to each other. Now prisms of ice are
either three- or six-sided. In either case, the two faces through
which the light passes can only be either parallel or inclined
60° to each other: when parallel they will produce no refrac
tion, and when inclined 60°, a refraction never less than 23°,
but sometimes a few degrees greater. Hence the common
halo of 46° in internal diameter, produced when these prisms
are turned in all directions, so as to refract in all possible
planes that pass through the sun. But when the prisms are
all parallel, as we have supposed, they can refract in only two
directions, so that all the light which would otherwise form
the halo will be collected at two opposite points of its circum
ference; and if all the axes of the prisms be vertical, the only
portions of the halo that will be visible will be those to the
right and left of the sun, and on the horizontal circle passing
through his disc: hence the two single spectra or mock-suns,
which formed so striking a part of this display. Nor is there
any difficulty in understanding why these spectra were not
exactly on the circumference of the common halo (see fig. 4),
but rather further from the sun. This was a necessary con
sequence of the plane of refraction being inclined to the axes
of the prisms, the effect of which was to render their refracting
angle virtually greater than 60°, and the refraction therefore
greater than 23°. In the formation of the common halo, this
cause must also operate in a great number of the prisms; for
if they lie in all directions, the refraction cannot always take
place in a plane perpendicular to the prism's axis. This is
generally $ºji popular explanations of the theory of
the halo, and hence arises a discrepancy that has often puzzled
the writer, between that theory and the appearance itself; for
whoever regards a common halo, will see that it is not, as
theoretically described, a luminous ring or band of definite
breadth like the rainbow, but only the boundary between a
less luminous and a more luminous space. The whole sky
outside this boundary is brighter than within it, though this
brightness rapidly diminishes from the circle outwards. If
we regard it as a luminous ring, therefore, only its inner edge
is defined, and only on this edge is there any appearance of
colour, viz. red, orange, yellow, and then white, with perhaps
a very faint tinge of green; but beyond the yellow, or the

 442 Mr. E. L. Garbett's Description of some Parhelia
 point of maximum brilliancy, there is no other decided colour,
 and the colourless light dies away so gradually that it is im
 possible to assign its outer limit. This is by no means then a
 complete spectrum, like the rainbow.
     Now if we consider that the prisms producing the halo may,
 owing to their various positions, produce various amounts of
 refraction, but in no case less than a certain amount, this limit
 being about 23°, but different for the different colours; if we
 further remember, that the nearer a prism may be to this
 limiting position which gives the least refraction, the more
 slowly will the amount of refraction change with the change of
 position; and further, that (for more causes than one) the
 more refraction any prism may produce, the less light will it
 transmit;--we shall see that if a halo were formed by homo
 geneous light coming from a source of no appreciable size,
 such as a star, the circle of maximum brilliancy would be at
 its inner edge, from whence the light would diminish outwards
 as the ordinates of some curve very concave, something like B,
 fig. 4, which curve being cut out and placed on the blackened
 rim of a wheel, with its broader end towards the axis, would, on
                                  Fig. 4.
being rapidly revolved, give the appearance of such a halo”.
But if the light came from a source whose diameter was about
30', such as the sun, the inner diameter of the halo would be
diminished by about 30', and the circle of greatest brilliancy,
   * Light figures placed on a dark wheel and made to revolve in this man
ner afford a good means of illustrating a large number of optical facts
besides the composition of colours. To make the results obvious, the
figures should be repeated as many times as the circumference of the wheel
will contain them.

           seen at Portsea on the 29th of March 1848.         443
remaining where it was, would be 15' from the inner edge;
which edge, however, would still be very sharply defined, for
the light would diminish towards it like the ordinates of some
such curve as C (fig. 4), so that the halo would resemble that
formed by placing C on a black wheel, and making it revolve
instead of B. Finally, when the light is not homogeneous
but white, and comes from a source of 30' diameter, innume
rable halos are formed, each resembling that last described, but
all having different radii, the red least and the violet greatest.
To imitate this effect, therefore, take several such figures as
C (say seven, painted with the seven principal colours), and
place them on the black wheel at different distances from its
axle, as in fig. D. This arrangement, when revolving, would
give nearly the appearance of the common halo; though to
give it exactly, would require an infinite number of such
figures, at distances and with colours, intermediate between
 R and O, between O and Y, &c.
   In this way the difference between the colours of the halo
and those of the rainbow may be well shown. For it is plain
that if a rainbow were formed by homogeneous light coming
from a star, or a physical point, the bow would be a mere
physical line. Let the light come from a source of 30' dia
meter, and the homogeneous bow will be 30' broad, and its
intensity will vary from side to side according to the ordinates
of a circle. Such a bow may be seen by turning a black wheel,
on which are one or more equal circular discs of colour, at
equal distances from the axle. Both the edges of such a bow
will be well-defined. Now to imitate the bow formed by
white light, the discs must have various colours, and be placed
at unequal distances from the axle, as at E (fig. 4), the imita
tion being more exact, the larger the number of discs having
different tints and distances, provided they be all confined to
a ring no wider than about three and a half times their own
diameter (for the primary, or six times for the secondary bow).
   In the same way, a figure or repetition of figures like A,
placed at equal distances from the axle of the wheel, will on
revolving give the appearance of the large horizontal band in
the phaenomena above described; and a number of complete
spectra arranged as at F, will produce the effect of one of the
bands of large radius near the zenith in figs. 1 and 2.
    As all the effects above stated, in the case of a halo, must
take place equally in that of the lateral mock-suns, which are
in fact merely detached portions of a very intense halo, this
explains why they appear to have colourless tails directed
from the sun, and fading gradually as they recede from him.

 444      Mr. E. L. Garbett’s Description of some Parhelia
     If all the icy prisms contained in the air have their axes
 truly parallel, it is plain that these phaenomena will be unac
 companied by any ordinary halo; as in the first of the displays
 above described: but if a portion of the crystals be dispersed
 by the wind, or a cessation of the cause (electrical induction,
 or whatever it might be) that kept them in their polar state,
 the portion so scattered would, by refracting in all directions,
 produce a circular halo in addition to the former appearances;
 as actually happened in the afternoon display: but as long as
 this scattering was not complete, so as to turn the prisms in
 all directions equally, the halo would not be equally luminous
 throughout, but as shown in fig. 3. On the following day,
 however, all vestiges of a polar arrangement had disappeared,
 and the refraction being performed equally in all directions,
 produced a regular halo of greatly increased splendour, but
 without any of the other appearances.
    We have as yet spoken only of the light reflected and re
 fracted by the sides of the icy prisms; but it is plain that their
 ends, whether flat, or terminated by pyramids or any other
 forms, must produce effects of a similar kind, but more com
 plicated; and to their action we must refer the various other
 arcs and parhelia described and figured above, and differently
 in every different account of such phaenomena. If we con
 sider in how many different ways a prismatic crystal may be
 terminated, from a flat face to the most complex pyramids, or
the tables and still more complex forms observed in snow and
rime, we shall indeed find no difficulty in believing, that hardly
any two displays of parhelia agree in the form and arrange
ment of their circles and arcs, except so far as regards the
white horizontal circle and the two spectra with tails, on the
right and left of the sun, which seem to be common to all
accounts of these phaenomena; as they must be if due, as we
have suggested, to the action of the invariable sides of the
prisms, independently of their ends.                -
    It would doubtless be possible, from the description of one
of these exhibitions, to determine the precise form of both the
upper and lower ends of the icy crystals which produced it;
or, conversely, to determine what appearances would be pro
duced in an atmosphere charged with crystals of a given form.
Both these problems, however, would be very laborious; but
there is a way of solving the second of them by experiment,
which I think will serve to show very clearly the rationale of
these appearances.
   Suppose that in a dark room we have a large white hemi
spherical surface, placed like a basin, with its edge horizontal,
and in the centre of its concavity we suspend from above a
small prismatic crystal of any kind, with its axis vertical. This

           seen at Portsea on the 29th of March 1848.          445
crystal should be of ice, to imitate truly the effects observed in
nature; but for merely showing the principle of these effects,
any crystal of nearly similar shape, one of quartz for instance,
will answer the purpose, though from its higher refractive
power it will produce different curves from those produced
by an ice crystal of the same shape.                 -
   Now if we admit into this arrangement a very small sun
beam, barely large enough to illuminate the whole of the
crystal and nothing else, a portion of this beam, either passing
by the edges of the crystal or through two parallel faces of it,
will continue its course unaltered, and fall on the same spot
of the basin as if no crystal had intervened. We will call this
spot the direct image. Now the faces of the crystal will, by
reflexion and refraction (even omitting the consideration of
its double refraction), divide the remainder of the light into
several beams of various intensities, according as they have, or
have not, suffered one or more partial reflexions. These beams
proceeding to various parts of the basin, will there paint va
rious spots, some white and others coloured, according as they
have been formed by reflexion or by refraction, or both. Now
to see all the positions of these spots, arising from all possible
positions of the crystal (with its axis vertical), we have only to
turn it round on its axis, and if we then mark with a pencil the
path of each moving spot, we shall obtain curves similar to the
 various bands and halos seen in these phaenomena, and having
the same positions with regard to the direct image and the edge
of the basin, that the actual appearances have with regard to the
sun and the horizon. Some of the spots will remain stationary
or nearly so, and these will correspond with the places of the
mock-suns. The whole appearance however might be exhi
bited to the eye far more correctly, by making the crystal
revolve round its vertical axis rapidly, so that the spots being
seen in all parts of their track at once, will appear as curves,
 and the whole hemispherical surface will then form an inverted
 representation of the sky during these phaenomena, the various
 parhelia and bands being seen in their true colours, and with
 their true gradations of intensity. If the crystal have three
 or six vertical sides, it will on revolving always produce the
 white horizontal circle passing through the sun, and the two
 coloured mock-suns with tails. The rest of the appearances
 will vary with the form of the upper and lower terminations
 of the crystal.                     -
    The common halo cannot be imitated in this way, for this
 would require the crystal to revolve in every direction at once;
 but if we substitute for the crystal a small globe of water, then
 (provided the sun's altitude be below 42°) the primary and

446        Prof. De Morgan on the Additions made to the
secondary rainbows will be formed; inverted, of course, but in
their true positions with regard to the direct solar image, and
the horizon or edge of the basin, and in this case no rotation
is necessary.
    In these experiments, a single globule or crystal turns the
various coloured rays into certain definite directions, which
are obviously exactly opposite to those directions in which
such rays will arrive from an innumerable assemblage of such
drops or crystals (illuminated by parallel sunbeams) towards
any single point, such as the spectator's eye. The experiments
therefore produce an exact inversion of all those figures that
would be seen by an eye placed in or near such an assemblage,
and explain most clearly the production of the rainbow by an
atmosphere loaded with watery globules;–of the halo when it
is charged with icy prisms turned in all directions;—and of
 the various kinds of parhelion when all the prisms have their
axes in one direction.
LXI. On the Additions made to the Second Edition of the
      Commercium Epistolicum. By Prof. Dr. MoRGAN +.
TH:          Commercium Epistolicum is the work which contains
        the final elaboration of the charge made by Newton's
friends in England against Leibnitz, in which the latter is
accused in many places of taking his differential Calculus from
the Flurions of the former. It is an ea-partet statement to
which no answer was returned, and which was said by its par
tizans, and by Newton himself, to be unanswerable. The first
edition, then, the one which Leibnitz had the option of seeing
and answering, is a document in the case which no editor
could possess a right to alter, whether by addition or diminu
tion. That any variations, inserted in a reprint, whether for
explanation or reinforcement, ought to have been separated and
distinctly described as new, is too obvious to need proof. As
the laws of literary honour are now understood, any alteration
made to pass as part of the original publication, would be
looked upon as fraudulent if it served a purpose, and as most
   * Communicated by the Author.
   t. It bears so much the form of the report of a judicial investigation and
finding, that most subsequent writers have considered it as such. I believe I
have sufficiently shown that it was never intended for anything but an er
parte statement. See the Philosophical Transactions for 1846, p. 107, and
the life of Newton in Knight's British Worthies. The Committee, had it
been a jury, would now be considered as having been packed: but as
composed of agents and counsel, it was a very different thing. Nevertheless
there was some unfairness in the judicial form of the report with which the
publication ends.

        Second Edition of the Commercium Epistolicum. 447
improper even if it were not material. Those however who are
acquainted with the bibliographical habits of the beginning of
the last century, will not hastily impute wilful unfairness even
to such additions and suppressions as some of those I shall
have to describe.
   Various circumstances not necessary to recount, and know
ledge of those bibliographical habits among them, made me
think it desirable to compare the second edition of the Com
mercium Epistolicum with the first. The latter is extremely
scarce, the copy which belonged to Cavendish being, I believe,
the only one brought to the hammer for many years: the
former is comparatively common. Having borrowed a copy
of the first edition from the library of the Royal Society, I
made a close collation of the two editions, and found, as I
thought likely, that several additions, upwards of twenty in
number, had been made, some of them important. I drew
up an account of these, and transmitted it to the Royal
Society, by which I was informed, after the usual interval,
that it was not intended to print the communication. One of
my reasons for sending it to the Royal Society was the obvious
one, namely, that the memory of Leibnitz has a peculiar claim
upon that body for reparation of many wrongs. One of them,
as I now make known, I believe for the first time, was the
falsification of a record in a matter affecting his character,
done under the name of the Society. I hold that the Royal
Society of this day is the same scientific corporation which
existed more than a century ago, deriving honour from the
recollections of its former history, and therefore morally liable
to make amends for former errors. Within about eighteen
months of each other I presented two papers; the first in
tended to protect the memory of Newton against an imputa
tion which, from oversight of historians, might have been cast,
but was not, and incidentally to clear the Royal Society itself
from the charge of packing a jury: the second intended to
point out and repair a small portion of the wrong which actu
ally was done under the name of the Society to Leibnitz. The
first was printed, the second was archived. It is then the duty
and pleasure of the Society to guard the fame of Newton, not
only from what has been, but what might be, said against it;
but it is affirmed to be either not its duty or not its pleasure
to repair the effect of falsifications made in a publication issued
under its name, when the sufferer, if any, must be Leibnitz.
    Having presented that second paper (which, after the first,
 I could not but do, seeing that to have offered it elsewhere
would have looked like an assumption that the Society would
act as it has done), I cannot omit notice of the fact; nor,

 448       Prof. De Morgan on the Additions made to the
 noting the fact, can I do less than enter a protest. I must
 notice the fact, because, with reference to the paper decently
 interred at Somerset House, but exhumable at pleasure of any
 Fellow of the Society, it is necessary that I should announce
 that the present communication is altogether rewritten, with
 out my even + seeing the former one.
    It is obvious that, from the moment when the fact of inter
 polation is known, the second edition can be no longer cited.
 But as the scarcity of the first (of which only a few copies
 were printed, and those all distributed as presents,-it was
very scarce even in 1715) makes the citation of it almost im
possible, the remedy is to publish a full account of all the
variations.       This I do, excepting of course alterations of re
ference, and excepting also trifling changes of idiom, to mend
the Latin, such as altering an indicative into a subjunctive, and
the like.
    The first edition f was published in 1712. Leibnitz died
in 1716. The second edition exists with twof title pages,
one of 1722, the other of 1725, but both from the same type.
Something which cannot now be explained occurred in the
printing. Sheet K ends with page 144, but L begins with a
second page 129; and this wrong paging is continued to the
end of M, after which N begins with 177, as it would have
done if there had been no interruption. In the Ad Lectorem,
page 169 is referred to, which does not exist: that which
should have been 169 is the second 153, and there the matter
is found to which reference was made.
 • * I am quite aware that the Society would have allowed me to copy it,
if I had been so inclined.

        Second Edition of the Commercium Epistolicum.          449
     With the new Ad Lectorem, the Recensio taken from the
 Philosophical Transactions, the reprint of John Bernoulli's
 letter and the comments on it, I have nothing to do; this is
 all avowedly new matter. The reprint commences with the
 old title-page, the words typis Pearsonianis being omitted.
 The variations are as follows: the first paging being that of
 the first edition, the second of the second.
    I. (12, 80). The following note is added: “* N.B. eddem
 sensu quo Newtonus utitur symbolo           #|Limitius     utitur
 Symbolo S      #”      Interpreting this note in the sense of all
 the rest, it implies of course that Leibnitz took Newton's mean
 ing and adapted it to a new symbol. This is not correct in
 any particular; for Newton’s symbol merely means “area to
 the ordinate aa : 64a,” while Leibnitz's symbol means the sum
 of differentials or integral. And moreover Leibnitz does not
 use the symbol Sy but Sydr, involving a very different idea.
 Neither is it pretended that Leibnitz, before publication of his
system, ever saw the letter on which this note is written, or
 any other which contains the symbol above given.
    II. (18, 90). All the words in the note from “Eadem ex
plicatur” to “Anno 1669° are new. The new editors un
dertake to assert that a method, which Newton only alludes
to, must have been the method in the fifth proposition of the
book on Quadratures. That is to say, those who in their
new Ad Lectorem, construe Leibnitz's silence as an admission
of everything, make him admit one proposition more. This
remark of course may be made throughout.
    III. (19,91). This note is new : “Leibnitius scribit da; pro
ovel or 1, d: pro ov vel oy.” Another unfairness of the same
sort as in (I.). It is not pretended that Leibnitz ever saw
this letter, or any other in which a +o is written for a ; but
under the assertion that Leibnitz saw certain letters, the new
editors exaggerate the prevailing fallacy of the old ones,
namely, the assumption of the right to bring any letters forward
as proving that what Leibnitz had in common with them must
have been taken from them. Those who remember the rational
protest which the English made against the editors of the
Leipsic Acts (January 1705), for using words implying substi
tution instead of independent adoption, when describing what
Newton had done, and the lame answer which was made to
that protest, will recognise a parallel in the conduct of both
sets of editors, new and old, of the Commercium Epistolicum.
   IV. (22, 96). The note is new. Gregory states that he
had derived a method of tangents from that of Barrow; on
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 32. No. 217. June 1848.        2 G

450      Prof. De Morgan on the Additions made to the
which the new editors say, “Hinc innotuit Methodum Tan
gentium Gregorii et Slusii ex methodo Barrovii consequi.”
Here consequi, as to Gregory, means by his statement, that
his knowledge of his own method came from his knowledge of
Barrow's; and there is every appearance of the word being
intended to apply in the same manner to Slusius.
   V. (29, 103). The note is new. It is immaterial, and merely
amounts to reminding the reader that several is at least two.
   VI. (30, 105). The following note is new. “* Sc. in trac
tatu quem Newtonus scripsit Anno 1671. Missum autem fuit
Apographum hujus Epistolae ad Tscurnhausium mense Maio
1675, et ad Leibnitium mense Junio 1676.”          The assertion
about Leibnitz will presently occur more definitely.        How
the fact was known with reference to Tschirnhausen is not
stated.
   VII. (37, 113). The first sentence of the note, consisting of
the three words “Imo observata fuit,” is new. Slight as the
matter is, the general tendency of the additions to bring out the
unfairness of the original, and to convert hints into assertions,
is curiously exemplified. The reader will see that the meaning
of the addition is as follows:–Leibnitz says it is wonderful that
Pascal did not notice, that when the binomial coefficients are set
down in rows, the columns are the triangular, pyramidal, &c.
(or what were also called figurate) numbers. The note of the
old editors says in effect, “He did not exactly notice this, but
still you are not much in advance of Pascal, for the latter did
note a very remarkable property of these columns, which is
known to belong to the figurate numbers.” But the words
added by the new editors turn the note into “He did notice
it, and you are not at all in advance of Pascal, for, &c.”
Leibnitz was quite right, and the more so from Pascal's know
ledge of the property. Both the original and the augmented
 notes are unmerited comments on the modest remark by which
 Leibnitz accompanies his natural expression of wonder, “Sed
 est profecto casus quidam in inveniendo, qui non semper
 maximisingeniis maxima, sed saepe etiam mediocribus non
 nulla offert.”
    VIII. (37, 114 and 115).     One of the connecting comments
 runs thus in the two editions.

     It is particularly to be noted, that the additions make it
appear that new access had been obtained to the stores of the
Royal Society; and this shows, on the one hand, that the
new edition * came from the Society, and on the other, that
there is pro tanto evidence for the facts stated. The new
editors have prefixed to the extract from the letter of July 15
the first words of the letter, “Diu est quod nullas a me ha
buisti literas.”
     With regard to the assertion about Leibnitz, first made
after his death, that up to 1673 he had concerned himself with
 arithmetic only, and from that time applied himself togeometry,
 it is founded upon his having first corresponded on arithmetic
 and afterwards on geometry. It was intended to prejudice
 his cause, by producing the impression that at the time of his
 announcement of the differential Calculus he was but a new
 student of the higher analysis. With the statement, however,
 I have nothing to do here, except to note the unfairness of
 printing it as if he had been challenged to deny it during his
 life, and had not done so. Remembering how nearly the life
 of Leibnitz was absorbed injurisprudence, politics, history and
 metaphysics, and how little of it remained for mathematics,
 remembering also the uniform manner in which Leibnitz's
 later declarations of this press of occupation were treated as
 evasion,--it would have been fairer if one of the earlier decla
 rations, made before any question arose, had been inserted by
 the original editors from the first of these two letters, “In
 cumbunt enim mihi labores quidem inter se plane diversi;
 quos partim Principes a me exigunt, partim Amici. Unde
 parum temporis restat quod inquisitioni Naturae, et contem
 plationibus Mathematicis impendere possim.”
     * This, I believe, was never doubted, though the names of the editors
  have never been published that I know of. Another fact is, that the dia
  grams of the second edition are from the same wood-blocks as those of the
  first, which certainly were the property of the Society. Biot attributes the
  publication to Newton himself, of which there is no proof. Newton may
  have suggested or approved a second edition; but that he should take any
  part in its preparation, at the age of ºgº.
                                       2 G 2
                                                     is very unlikely.

452     Prof. De Morgan on the Additions made to the
   IX. (43, 123). The note “N.B. In hoc . . . . impressae" is
new.    It is not material.
   X. (45, 125). The first sentence of the extract, “Duarum
tibi literarum debitor, rogo ne sequius interpreteris silentium
meum, soleo enim interrumpi nonnunquam, et haec studia per
intervalla tractare,” is the insertion of the new editors, who
may have been desirous to clear the old ones of the suppres
sion to which I alluded above.
   XI. (46, 127). In “Hoc anno cum D. Gregorius anno su
periore ad finem vergente emortuus esset,” the five words anno
. ... vergente are new.
   XII. (47, 128). In the following comment the bracketed
parts are new :—                                  -
   “In hac Collectione habetur [Epistola superius impressa
Gregorii ad Collins 5 Sept. 1670. Habetur et] Epistola supe
rius impressa, quo (sic; qua in original) Gregorius Quadra
turam praedictam Arithmeticam initio Anni 1671 cum D.
Collins communicavit: Habetur et Epistola D. Newtoni ad
D. Collins, 10 Decemb. 1672 data, et superius impressa, in qua
Newtonus se Methodum generalem habere dicit ducendi Tan
gentes, quadrandi Curvilineas, et similia peragendi; et Me
thodum   ‘.         ducendi Tangentes exponit: quam Metho
dum D. Leibnitius differentialem postea vocavit. [Haec Col
lectio ad D. Leibnitium missa fuit 26 Junii 1676].”
   With this must be joined the addition presently marked
XVIII., announcing the date at which Collins died. . The
second addition above is the most unjustifiable of all, as being
the most important. In fact, this one addition makes the
second edition of the Commercium Epistolicum a very different
thing from the first, as I shall proceed to show.
   Look at the final report of the Committee, and it will ap
pear that two distinct points are enunciated and declared to
be sustained by the evidence printed before that report: first,
that Newton had his method at an early date; secondly, that
Newton's method had been communicated to Leibnitz. With
the first I have here nothing to do. The second point is sum
med up by saying, that Leibnitz had no other differential me
thod except that of Mouton “before his letter of [the] 21st of
June 1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton's
letter, of [the] 10th of December 1672 had been sent to Paris
to be communicated to him; and above four years after Mr.
Collins began to communicate that letter to his correspond
ents; in which letter the method of Fluxions was sufficiently
describ'd to any intelligent person.” The bracketed words
are additions.
   Look back at the evidence which is meant to support this

         Second Edition of the Commercium Epistolicum. 453
  assertion, and it will appear that a parcel is said to exist in the
  handwriting of Collins with this title, “Excerpta ex D. Gre
  gorii Epistolis cum D. Leibnitio communicanda, tibique post
  quam perlegerit ille reddenda.” The party addressed is Olden
  burg. Not one word is said of any date at which the parcel was
  sent; and this defect the new editors supply in the second addi
  tion to the paragraph above. Suppose Collins never to have ful
  filled his intention of sending this parcel, and all presumption
  raised in the report against the originality of Leibnitz disap
  pears. The importance and the unfairness of the addition
  will now be clearly seen.
     Where did the new editors get this date? Had it existed
  in the handwriting of Collins or Oldenburg, they would have
 gladly certified it, according to their usual practice. I suspect
  they saw that the next communication from Oldenburg to
  Leibnitz was marked (49, 131) as having been forwarded to
  Leibnitz” on the 26th of June; and jumped (might I not
 almost say sneaked) to a conclusion, that the parcel was for
 warded at the same time, and announced the conclusion with
 out grounds. Observe that the letter of advice, which was
 part of this parcel, written to Oldenburg by Collins, is given
 without date by the original editors, and no date is supplied
 by the new ones. They always give dates in other cases.
     I have looked carefully through the original edition, and I
 find that every letter is fully dated except four: and that of
 the four exceptions, one is dated by year and month (the day
 being omitted); one is Collins's copy of one of his own letters,
 and the editors seem to be inclined to take Collins's full date
 as that of the copy (I should take it of course to be that of the
 letter); one is Keill’s letter to Leibnitz, written by order of
 the Society, which is only dated as to when it was read to the
 Society, Keill being left to put the date of transmission after
wards. One remains wholly undated, and without any account
of the reason why; and that one is the letter on which the
whole turns. Everything depends on Collins sending a cer
 tain letter to Oldenburg, with other letters which the first
directs him to send on to Leibnitz; and that first letter is the
only one in the whole book of the date of which nothing is
said.
    Collins was an accomptant, a writer on book-keeping, an
immense correspondent, one of that class who are usually
rather pedantic than otherwise about dates, dockets, and direc
tions.     We are left to believe, first, that he did not date this
   * Leibnitz, in his answer, acknowledges letters of the 26th of July : but
between Junii and Julii the difference is so slight, that we may suspect a
printer’s or writer's error. It is not of much consequence.

454       Prof. De Morgan on the Additions made to the
letter; secondly, that having marked the parcel as containing
letters from Gregory, he inserted one of Newton without any
notice, either on the parcel or in the letter of advice.
    I have called this collectio a parcel, presuming it to have
consisted of detached papers. Had it been otherwise, the
Committee would certainly have noted the unity of the material;
they would have seen that it established Newton's letter as a
constituent part of the communication, in spite of the title only
mentioning Gregory. They must have seen that their evidence
on this point was singularly uncircumstantial : they must
have known that their report on the date of transmission was
wholly unsupported, even by assertion. It is impossible to
 suppose that they did not look for and mention all attainable
facts tending to authenticate their final conclusion. Moreover,
 the old editors mention two species of papers as written by
 Collins; collectio and schediasma, Had they used the first
 word only, it might have been judged possible that they would
 apply it to a number of extracts, all on one paper. But, seeing
 that they use both words, and both for collections of copies or
 extracts, surely the first must have meant a parcel of papers,
 and the second a parcel of extracts on one paper.
     Connected with this parcel, is their suppression of the ma
 terial fact of the time at which Collins died, which was sup
 plied by the new editors (see XVIII.). He died in 1682, and
 his papers were examined in 1712. Where they had been
 during these thirty years the Committee do not state, nor how
 and when they came into the possession of the Royal Society.
 If, as I think sufficiently established, we are to call the Col
 lectio a parcel of detached papers, then we are called upon to
 believe, as a matter of course, that Collins's executors tied up
 the voluminous papers which they examined in the same par
  cels as were untied, and that the same luck attended this one
  parcel at least, during thirty years. This is but poor founda
  tion for a charge of plagiarism.
     Further, we are to suppose that Newton, in his celebrated
  epistola posterior, written to be sent to Leibnitz, wrapped up
  his method of fluxions in a cipher, though he knew that Col
  lins had been for four years communicating on all sides, and
  to Leibnitz himself, a letter in which that method “was suffi
  ciently described to any intelligent person.”
     XIII. (71, 149 of the wrong paging). The words in the
  note “Et Newtonus . . . . p. 105” are new.
     XIV. (72, 150 of the wrong paging). The words in the
  note “et per Epistolam .... 34” are new.
     XV., (74, 153 of the wrong paging). The note is new.
     XVI. (86, 189). The note “f Surdos indices D. Leibnitius

        Second Edition of the Commercium Epistolicum. 455
 in Epistola sequente mutavit in fluentes, et inde natus est cal
 culus exponentialis” is new. The insinuation is of a piece
 with the rest.
    XVII. (95, 202). Leibnitz announces a theorem to which
 the old editors append the following note: “t Rogatur D.
 Leibnitius ut hoc Theorema lucem tandem videat.”        The new
 editors suppress this note, apparently as thinking it useless to
 make the request of Leibnitz after he was dead. This is
 something in their favour, as to motive: it shows that their
incorrect notions of a reprint acted both ways. So far as not
 answering the challenge would leave Leibnitz under the im
 putation of having boasted of what he could not do, and
 thereby diminish the probability of his having been original in
what he said he did do, so far they abandoned an advantage.
    XVIII. (97, 205). In the summary of events the bracketed
words are new : “Brevi postea, Autumno scilicet anni 1677,
mors Oldenburgi huic literarum Commercio finem imposuit.
Deinde anno 1682 [Collins mortuus est, et] Acta eruditorum
 Lipsiae primum edita sunt,” &c.
    I have before pointed out (see XII.) the effect of this inser
tion. The occurrence of the death of Oldenburg, followed
by the very date of that of Collins, must have suggested the
mention of the death of the latter.    I am afraid the omission
must be considered as an advised suppression by the original
editors.
    XIX. (100, 210). The last sentence of the note, “Et Pel
lius cui hae series ignotae non erant, cum Leibnitio de seriebus
verba habuit.”     The new editors did not like to lose a chance.
   XX. (101, 211).      The words in the note “Alteras Newtoni
olim acceperat ab Oldenburgo” are new.
   XXI. (108, 222). In the third note the word Corollarium
is altered in the second edition into Scholium.
   I shall now mention a matter in which the two editions
closely agree, but which, I think, has escaped notice. The
report of the Committee is English, with a Latin translation in
the form of foot notes for the use of foreigners. Two decided
mistranslations occur, of which I should pass over the first, if
it were not that the Committee have a right to such presump
tion as it will afford that the second was carelessness or over
#!"       The first is as follows:—“ and compar'd those of
   r. Gregory with one another, and with Copies of some of
them taken in the Hand of Mr. Collins,” is rendered by
“Literas autem quae Gregorium praese ferebant auctorem,
ipsius esse cognovimus fide Collinii, quinonnullas earum Gre
gorio assignatas manu sua exscripserat.” The second is as
follows:– “In which Letter the Method of Fluxions was suffi

456          On the Law of the Nutrition of Animals.
ciently describ'd to any intelligent Person,” is rendered by
“In hac autem Epistola Methodus Fluxionum idoneo harum
rerum cognitori evidenter satis describitur.” If not from
carelessness, this version arises from an intention, that no
foreigner might see the assertion that Newton had written on
Fluxions to the comprehension of any intelligent person, ma
thematician or not. Perhaps some may think that the word
intelligent had not then obtained its modern signification of
general power of understanding. Perhaps it had not, quite :
but that the thing was monstrous, even at the time, is made
evident by a contemporary writer, who certainly did not strain
at gnats, finding this rendering rather too much of a camel.
Raphson it was who, in his history of Fluxions (printed both
in English and Latin), showed his power of going all lengths
by declaring his belief that Leibnitz had discovered Newton's
cipher (which we all know was not a cipher, being only the
letters of a sentence placed in alphabetic order), and thereby
discovered fluxions. But rather than print the assertion about
an intelligent person, he adopted the Latin as the original,
and printed an English translation of his own, in which,
instead of “to any intelligent person,” we read “to any proper
judge of these matters.”
    The more the whole matter is looked into from its beginning
to its end, the more will the evidences of reckless injustice
thicken about the inquirer. The Newtonian partizan may
find a poor consolation in balancing the sins of a like character
committed by the opposite party against those of his own.
But all who do not allow a set-off to be pleaded in matters
of right and wrong will, I think, if they look for themselves,
find it necessary to disavow the cause and the conduct, and
to regret the consequences.

ON       the farm of Boussingault at Bechelbronn, in order to
        ascertain the quantity of milk produced, seven cows
were subjected to an accurate series of experiments extending
over a whole year. They received daily 30 pounds of hay,
or of those roots similar in composition, and yielded together

             On the Law of the Nutrition of Animals.                  457
8788 maass (3837 quarts). The time during which they sup
plied milk was 3024 days. This gives as a mean 4.1 maass
(1.8 qt.) daily for each cow. But the quantity of milk varies
very much; for in the months of July and August they yielded
above 6 maass (2.64 qts.), while in February and March they
gave only about 2% maass (1.1 qt.).                 From observations of a
similar nature, made however upon only one cow, the average
daily quantity of milk yielded was 3.7 maass (1.63 qt.). If we
take 24 maass (1:097 qt.) as the lowest quantity, and 7 maass
(3-073 qts.) as the highest, we get daily, for one cow, from
10-3 lbs. to 29 lbs. of milk, which contain—
         4-69 oz. troy to 13:04 oz. butter.
         7-08 ... ... 20:02 oz. sugar of milk and sol. salts.

Total 19765        ...     ...     55.24 oz. solid matter.
   In reference to the influence which the food has upon the
quantity of milk, all farmers know that cows give most milk
with green food and less with hay, &c. In other respects the
influence of the food is not so great as might be expected.
    Boussingault and Le Bel agree upon this point, at least so
far as concerns the quantity of milk”. Dr. R. D. Thomson,
on the contrary, draws from similar and equally extensive
experiments the conclusion, that the quantity of milk and
butter increases in proportion to the quantity of nitrogen
(contained in the plastic matter) of the food. He has drawn
this conclusion from experiments upon two cows durin
periods of five days. His results are shown in the following
table, in which grass is the only exception't.

    The milk consists of water, 87°19; butter, 3.70; sugar,
 4-35; caseine, 4:16; sol. salts, 0-15; insol. salts, 0-44. The
 constituents of the butter are oil,86°3; caseine,09; water, 12-8.
    The fact that not merely the quantity of milk but also that
 of the butter increases with the amount of mitrogenous matter
 in the food (that is, with the proportion of plastic nourishment),
 is worthy of notice; for from the absence of nitrogen in the
 butter, we should be apt to expect the contrary. Playfair, in
 his experiments, has certainly inferred this; for according to
 him, those substances which do not contain nitrogen (potatoes,
 &c.), yield milk rich in butter, and rest (stall-feeding) acts in
 the same way; while if the animal be allowed to feed on poor
 pasture, where it must move about a good deal, it yields milk
 rich in caseine. But his experiments are continued for such
 short periods, that important conclusions cannot be deduced
 from them.            From Dr. Thomson's observations, we find that
 if a cow always receives the same kind of food, the quantity
 of milk gradually decreases; but if its diet be changed, it
 rapidly increases. A frequent change of diet is therefore
 advantageous... He has also established the rule, that the
 quantity of milk obtained from a cow is greater in the morning
 than in the evening.

   From this table it appears, that an animal taking exercise
should be supplied with food formed upon the same princi
ples as the first-mentioned six; and that in proportion to the
exertion, the closer should be the relation between the ingre
dients.-TR.]
    In order to judge of the values of different kinds of food for
practical purposes, it must first be ascertained in what relation
the blood-forming or nutritive constituents stand to the calo
rifiant. The kind of food must also vary with age, kind of
employment, way of living, climate, &c. With the highest
probability we may predicate, that a man in an employment
demanding great mental activity will require, in addition to a
greater proportional amount of bodily rest, that the calorifiant
 and blood-forming constituents should be in a different pro
 portion in the food, to that of the man whose employment
 *:::      great bodily activity.
      homson has traced out a very simple and ingenious method
 of supplying this defect in our knowledge. He ascertains the
 weight and composition of the food given in a certain time, as
 also that of the excrement thrown out.              From both factors he
 is enabled to calculate the quantity of food assimilated, as also
 the relation of the calorifiant to the blood-forming constitu
 ents. He found that a cow, stall-fed, assimilated daily 15:28 lbs.
 of rye-grass, which contained 1:56 lbs. of blood-forming and
 13:00 lbs. of calorifiant matter. They thus stand in the rela
 tion of 1 to 8%, a proportion which, it is highly probable, is
 much more nearly related in man, as the relation in the various
 kinds of farinaceous food is about 1 to 5 or 1 to 6. We know

 460            On the Law of the Nutrition of Animals.
with certainty that in the infant the relation, as in milk, must
be 1 to 24.
    A company of soldiers were fed on flesh, bread, vegetables,
legumes, beer, brandy, fat, &c.; and from the experiments
made on these by Liebig, the relation of the blood-forming
to the calorifiant matter in the food may be accurately deter
mined. By ascertaining the amount of food taken and the
excrement thrown out, the quantity of food assimilated may be
deterimined, as also the above-mentioned relation. In this
manner the following results were obtained:— Relation of the
                                                               blood-forming to

    As this number 4-7 is calculated from experiments made
on persons who undergo considerable bodily exercise, it will
increase” in those whose employment is sedentary. Although
these numbers are not absolutely correct, some important
conclusions may be drawn from them.
    It is evident that the relation 1 to 4-7 is almost exactly that
which exists naturally in the various kinds of grain. Those
barbarous nations which live entirely on flesh, receive a large
excess of blood-forming matter, which may be counterbalanced
either by the addition of calorifiant matter, or by increased
bodily exercise. On the contrary, the poorer classes amongst
us are obliged to live on the cheapest food they can obtain, such
as potatoes, &c.t, which are one half poorer in blood-form
ing or nutritive matter than the different kinds of grain. In
the first case nature has only to get rid of an excess; but in
the latter she has to supply a deficiency, which must be done
by bread, milk, &c. It must be evident to every one that this
way of living is unnatural in the extreme. A person living
   * The word in the original is “vermindern;" but in the present case it
is obvious that the author means the reverse of diminution.
   t “The previous views,” says Dr. Thomson (on Food, p. 173), “suffi
ciently explain the experiments which have been made upon cows, in which
the result was unfavourable when they were fed on potatoes and beetroot
in considerable quantities, as both of these substances contain an excess of
calorifiant matter. It is well-known to feeders of cattle, that an animal
fed on large quantities of potatoes is liable to such complaints as affections
of the skin, and also to loss of weight. These consequently, it may be
readily inferred, arise from the want of the proper balance between the
elements of the food.”—TR.

               Dr. R. Hare on Electrical Phaenomena.                    461
 entirely on potatoes may be said to be on the brink of a pre
 cipice without a single inch of ground before him, where the
 only safety lies in retreat. Its disadvantages may be shown
 in three different ways:—1st. It leads to imperfect bodily
 strength and unsoundness of health. 2nd. To increased
 mortality and shortness of life. 3rd. To loss of energy and
 to a kind of stupidity, and want of interest in everything but
 what concerns the merest animal interests. A country in this
 state is always ripe for rebellion, and ready to join in every
insurrection.
     From the above remarks, it would appear that the manu
 facture of brandy from potatoes is a separation of the excess
 of calorifiant matter, whilst the residue contains all the blood
 forming constituents. It is mixed with the gluten of the malt,
 and thus forms a half-soluble food.            In order however that it
 may suit the nature of ruminating animals, straw or some such
food should be added to it. As potatoes contain about one
part of albumen for ten of starch, the half of the starch may
 be converted into spirit, while the remainder will consist of a
 mixture having the nutritive and calorifiant constituents in
 the same proportion as in grain (1 : 5).

   * Agreeably to Faraday's researches and general experience, we have
reason to believe that all particles of matter are endowed with one or the
other of two species of   º:        This word polarity conveys the idea that
two terminations in each particle are respectively endowed with forces
which are analogous, but contrary in their nature; so that of any two
homogeneous particles, the similar poles repel each other, while the dis
similar attract; likewise when freely suspended they take a certain posi
tion relatively to each other, and on due proximity, the opposite polar
forces, counteracting each other, appear to be extinct. . When deranged
from this natural state of reciprocal neutralization, their liberated poles
react with the particles of adjacent bodies, or those in the surrounding
medium. Under these circumstances, any body which may be constituted
of the particles thus reacting, is said to be polarized, or in a state of
polarization.

462 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
fluid from the positive to the negative surface requisite for its
accomplishment, a current having a velocity exceeding two
hundred thousand miles in a second would be necessary.
     2. The only causes for the velocity of an electric current,
according to Franklin, are the repulsion between the particles
of the electric fluid of which it has been assumed to consist,
and the attraction between those particles and other matter.
These forces are alleged to concur in distributing the sup
posed fluid throughout space, whether otherwise void, or
partially occupied by conducting solids or fluids. Hence,
 when between two or more spaces, surfaces, or conducting
 masses, there is an unequal distribution of the electric fluid,
 the equilibrium is restored whenever a communication is
 opened by means of a sufficiently conducting medium.
 Agreeably to this view of the subject, there seems to be a
 resemblance between the supposed effort of the electrical fluid
 to attain a state of equable diffusion, and that which would
 exist in the case of a gas confined in adjoining receivers, so as
 to be more dense within one than within the other; for, how
 ever the subtilty of the supposed electric fluid may exceed
 that of any gas, there seems to be an analogy as respects the
 processes of diffusion which must prevail. But on opening a
 communication between cavities in which any aeriform fluid
 exists in different degrees of condensation, the density must
 lessen in one cavity and augment in the other, with a rapidity
 which must diminish gradually, and become evanescent with
 the difference of pressure by which it is induced. Far from
  taking place in an analogous manner, electrical discharges are
 effected with an extreme suddenness, the whole of the re
  dundancy being discharged at once, in a mode more like the
 flight of a bullet projected with infinite velocity, than that of
  aIn jet     gradually varying in celerity from a maximum to a
      1111 in u<U+017F>in,
       3. So far, in fact, is an electrical discharge from displaying
   the features which belong to the reaction of a condensed elastic
   fluid, that, agreeably to the observations of our distinguished
   countryman Henry, the result is more like the vibrations of
   a spring, which, in striving to regain its normal position, goes
   beyond it. The first discharge between the surfaces of a
   Leyden jar is not productive .# a perfect equilibrium. The
   transfer of different polarities goes beyond the point of re
   ciprocal neutralization, producing a state, to a small extent,
   the opposite of that at first existing; and hence a refluent
   discharge ensues, opposite in direction to the primary one.
   But even this does not produce an equilibrium, so that a
   third effort is made. These alternate discharges were detected

                 Franklin, Dufay and Ampère.                   463
by means of the magnetism imparted to needles exposed in
coils of copper wire”.
   4. Supposing one or more rows of electrical particles,
forming such a filament of electricity as must occupy the space
within a wire of great length, to be made the medium of dis
charge to a Leyden jar; agreeably to the hypothesis of one fluid,
the electrical filament must be attracted at one end of the
wire, and propelled at the other, as soon as its terminations
are brought into due communication with the coatings of the
jar. Yet the influence of the oppositely charged surfaces of
the jar cannot be conceived to extend to those portions of
the electricity which are remote from the points of contact,
until they be reached by a succession of vibrations. Hence
it is inconceivable that every particle in the filament of electric
matter can be made at the same time to move, so as to con
stitute a current having the necessary velocity and volume to
transfer, instantaneously, the electricity requisite to constitute
 a charge. Even the transmission of the impulses, in such an
 infinitesimal of time, seems to be inconceivable.
    5. In reply to these objections, it has been urged by the
 Franklinians, that a conductor being replete with electricity,
 as soon as this fluid should be moved at one end, it ought to
 move at the other. This might be true of a fluid if incom
 pressible, but could not hold good were it elastic. A bell
 wire moves at both ends when pulled only at one; but this
 would not ensue were a cord of gum elastic substituted for
 the wire.
    6. But if the flow of one fluid with the enormous velocity
 inferred be difficult to conceive, still more must it be incom
 prehensible that two fluids can rush with similar celerity from
 each surface of the jar, in opposite directions, through the
 narrow channel afforded by a wire, especially as they are
 alleged to exercise an intense affinity; so that it is only by a
 series of decompositions and recompositions that they can pass
 each other. That, agreeably to the theory of Dufay, equi
 valent portions of the resinous and vitreous fluids must ex
 change places during an electrical discharge, will appear
 evident from the following considerations:—
    7. One surface being redundant with vitreous and deficient
 commensurately of resinous electricity, and the other redun
 dant with the resinous and deficient of the vitreous fluid, it is
 inevitable that to restore the equilibrium, there must be a
 simultaneous transfer of each redundancy to the surface
  wherein there is a deficiency of it to be supplied. If, after
 decomposing a large portion of the neutral compound pre

464 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
viously existing on the surfaces of the jar, and transferring
the ingredients severally in opposite directions so as to cause
each to exist in excess upon the surface assigned to it, it were
necessary that the redundancies thus originated should be
neutralized by meeting in the discharging rod, neither surface
could recover its quota of the electrical ingredient of which it
must have been deprived agreeably to the premises.
   8. This calls to mind the fact, that no evidence has been
adduced of the existence of any tertium quid, arising from the
union of the supposed electricities, founded on any property
displayed by their resulting combination in the neutral state.
It must, if it exist, constitute an anomalous matter, destitute
of all properties, and of the existence of which we have no
evidence, besides that founded on the appearance and dis
appearance of its alleged ingredients.
   9. But however plausibly the discharges consequent to
making a conducting communication from one j mass
or surface to another mass or surface in an opposite state,
may be ascribed to accumulations either of one or of two
fluids; neither, according to one theory nor the other, is it
possible to account satisfactorily for the stationary magnetism
with which steel may be endowed, nor the transitory magnet
ism or dynamic power of induction acquired by wires trans
mitting galvanic discharges.
   10. For the most plausible effort which has been made for
the purpose of reconciling the phaenomena of electro-magnetism
with the theory of two fluids, or with that of one fluid, so far
as these theories are convertible, we are indebted to Ampère.
   11. According to the hypothesis advanced by this eminent
philosopher, the difference between a magnetized and an
electrified body is not attributable to any diversity in the
imponderable matter to which their properties are respectively
due, but to a difference in the actual state or distribution of
that matter. Statical polarity is the consequence of the un
equal distribution of the two electric fluids whose existence
he assumes; while magnetical polarity is the consequence
merely of the motion of those fluids, which in magnets are
supposed to gyrate in opposite directions about each particle
of the mass. These gyrations are conceived to take place
only in planes at right angles to the axis of the magnet; so
that in a straight magnet the planes of the orbits must be
parallel to each other”.
    12. The aggregate effect of all the minute vortices of the
electrical fluids, in any one plane, bounded by the lateral

and used indifferently to avoid monotony.

surfaces of the magnet, is equivalent externally to one vortex,
since in either case every electric particle on that surface
will so move as to describe tangents to a circle drawn about
the axis of the magnet. When the electrical vortices of the
pole of one magnet conflict in their direction with those of
another, as when similar magnetic poles are approximated,
repulsion ensues; but if the vortices are coincident in direction,
as when dissimilar poles are near, attraction takes place. When
a current through a galvanized wire” concurs in direction
with the magnetic vortices, as above described, attraction
ensues; repulsion resulting when it does not so concur.
Hence the magnet, if moveable, will strive to assume a posi
tion in which its electrical currents will not conflict with those
of the wire on one side more than on the other: also the wire,
if moveable, will tend so to arrange itself as to produce the
same result, which can arrive only when the needle is at right
angles to the wire, and its sides consequently equidistant
therefrom.
    13. Electric currents will produce magnetic vortices, and,
reciprocally, magnetic vortices will produce electric currents.
Hence the magnetism imparted to iron by galvanized spirals,
and the Faradian currents produced by magnetized iron
within spirals not galvanized.
    14. Ampère's theory has, in a high degree, the usual fault
of substituting one mystery for another; but, on the other
hand, it has, in an equally high extent, the only merit to which
any theory can make an indisputable claim: I mean, that of
associating facts so as to make them more easy to comprehend
and to remember, enabling us by analogy to foresee results,
and thus affording a clue in our investigations. Evidently,
the author of this theory was guided by it, in his highly in
teresting and instructive contrivances; and Professor Henry
ascribes his success in improving the electro-magnet, to the
theoretic clue which he had received from Ampère.
    15. Nevertheless, the postulates on which this Amperian
hypothesis is founded, appear to me unreasonable. They
require us to concede that about every atom of a permanent
 magnet a process is going on, analogous to that generally
 admitted to exist in a galvanic circuit, where two fluids pass
 each other in a common channel by a series of decompositions
 and recompositions (7). In the galvanic circuit this process
 is sustained by chemical reaction; but without any co-endu
 ring cause, how is it to be sustained permanently in a magnet?
 Is it reasonable to assume that the heterogeneous constituents

466 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of

   16. In cases of complex affinity, where four particles, A B
C D, are united into two compounds A B, C D, it is easy to
conceive that, in obedience to a stronger affinity, A shall
combine with C, and B with D: but, without any extraneous
agency, wherefore, in any one compound, should a particle A
quit one particle B, in order to unite with another particle of
the same kind; or wherefore should any one, B, quit one A,
in order to combine with another A 2
    17. That such a process should take place in consequence
of the inductive agency of a similar process already established
in a magnet or galvanized wire were difficult to believe; but
it would seem utterly incredible that the most transient in
fluence of such induction should be productive of such per
manent electrolytic gyration as has been above specified.
 Moreover, it is inconceivable that the particles of any matter
should, as required by this hypothesis, merely by being put into
 motion, acquire a power of reciprocal repulsion or attraction
of which it were otherwise destitute.
    18. The vortices being assumed to take place about each
atom, cannot severally occupy an area of greater diameter
than can exist between the centres of any two atoms. Of
course, the gyratory force exercised about the surface of a
 magnet by the aggregate movements of the vortices, cannot
extend beyond the surface more than half the diameter of one
 of the minute areas of gyration alluded to. Wherefore, then,
do these gyrations, when similar in direction, from their con
 currence approach each other; when dissimilar in direction
 from contrariety, move away, even when situated comparatively
at a great distance?
    19. I should consider Ampère's theory as more reasonable,
were it founded upon the existence of one fluid; since, in that
case, vortices might be imagined without the necessity of
supposing an endless and unaccountable separation and re
union of two sets of particles; not only devoid of any pro
perty capable of sustaining their alleged opposite gyrations,
but actually endowed with an intense reciprocal attraction
which must render such gyrations impossible. But even if
grounded on the idea of one fluid, this celebrated hypothesis
does not seem to me to account for the phaenomena which it
was intended to explain. If distinct portions of any fluid do
not attract or repel each other when at rest, wherefore should
they either attract or repel each other when in motion?
Evidently mere motion can generate neither attraction nor
repulsion. Bodies projected horizontally gravitate with the S.
                                                                 s

same intensity, and consequently, in any given time, fall to
the earth through the same perpendicular distance, whether
moving with the celerity of a cannon-ball, or undergoing no
impulse excepting those arising from their own unresisted
weights.
    20. The objections which are thus shown to be applicable
in the case of liquids, of which the neighbouring particles are
destitute of the reaction requisite to produce the phaenomena
requiring explanation, must operate with still greater force
where aethereal fluids are in question, of which the properties
are positively irreconcileable with the phaenomena. According
both to Franklin and Dufay, bodies, when similarly electrified,
should repel each other; yet in point of fact, collateral wires,
when subjected to similar voltaic discharges, and of course
similarly electrified, become reciprocally attractive, while
such wires, when dissimilarly electrified by currents which
are not analogous, become reciprocally repulsive.
    21. Agreeably to Ampère, an iron bar, situated within a
coil of wire subjected to a galvanic current, is magnetized,
because the current in the wire is productive of an electrical
whirlpool about every particle of the metal. When the iron
 is soft, the magnetism, and of course the gyrations of which
 its magnetism consists by the premises, cease for the most
 part as soon as the circuit through the coil is broken; but
 when the iron is in the more rigid state of hardened steel, the
 gyrations continue for any length of time after the exciting
 cause has ceased.
     22. This theory does not explain wherefore the hardening
 of the steel should cause the gyration to be more difficult to
 induce yet more lasting when its induction is effected.      Evi
 dently the metallic particles must take some part in the pro
 cess; since it is dependent for its existence and endurance
 upon their nature and their state. Yet no function is assigned
 to these particles. In fact, it is inconceivable, either that
 they can participate in, or contribute to, the supposed gyration.
     23. The electrical fluid in an iron bar cannot form a vortex
 about each particle, all the vortices turning in one direction,
 without a conflict between those which are contiguous. In
 order not to conflict with each other, the alternate vortices
 would have to turn in different directions, like interlocking
 cog-wheels in machinery. But in that case, if magnetism be
 due to currents, the magneto-inductive influence of one set
  would neutralize that of the other. Again, how can a current,
  excited by a battery in one circuitous conductor, cause, by
  dynamic induction, a current in the opposite direction, through
  another conductor parallel to the first, but insulated there

468 Dr. R. Hare's Olyections to the Theories severally of
from? How can a current of quantity in a ribbon coil” give
rise to one of intensity in a coil of fine wire, rushing of course
with a velocity commensurate with the intensity thus imparted?
    24. From the preceding considerations, and others which
 will be stated, it follows, that it has been erroneously inferred
 that the only difference between galvanic and frictional elec
tricity is dependent on quantity and intensity. It must be
 evident that there is a diversity in the nature of these affections
 of matter, sufficient to create a line of demarcation between
 them.
    25. Having stated my objections to the electrical theories
 heretofore advanced, it may be proper that I should suggest
 any hypothetical views which may appear to me of a cha
 racter to amend or to supersede those to which I have objected.
 But however I may have been emboldened to point out
 defects which have appeared to me to be inherent in the
 theories heretofore accredited, I am far from presuming to
 devise any substitute which will be unobjectionable. I am
 fully aware that there is an obscurity as respects the nature
 and mutual influence of chemical affinity, heat, light, elec
 tricity, magnetism and vitality, which science can only to a
 minute extent dispel.
    26. The hypothesis which I now deem preferable is so
 much indebted to the researches and suggestions of Faraday
 and others, that, were it true, I could claim for myself but a
 small share of the merit of its origination. That sagacious
 electrician employs the following language:—“In the long
 continued course of eaperimental inquiry in which I have been
 engaged, this general result has pressed upon me constantly,
 namely, the necessity of admitting two forces or directions of
jorce combined with the impossibility of separating these two
Jorces or electricities from each other.”—Experimental Re
 searches, 1163.
    27. Subsequently (1244), after citing another proof of the
 inseparability of the two electric forces, he alleges it to be
 “another argument in favour of the view that induction and its
 concomitant phanomena depend upon a polarity of the particles
 of matter l’”

    28. The grounds upon which I venture to advance a theory,
 are as follows:–
    The existence of two heterogeneous polar forces acting in
 opposite directions, and necessarily connate and co-existent,
 yet capable of reciprocal neutralization, agreeably to the

authority of Faraday and others; the polarity of matter in
general, as displayed during the crystallization and vegetation
of salts; also as made evident by Faraday's late researches,
and the experiments and observations of Hunt; the very
small proportion of the space in solids, as in the instance of
potassium and other metals, which can be occupied by the
ponderable atoms; while, agreeably to the researches and
speculations of Faraday (rightly interpreted), the residual
space must be replete with imponderable matter. The ex
periments and inferences of Davy and others, tending to
sanction the idea that an imponderable aethereal fluid must
pervade the creation; the perfect identity of the polarizing
effects, transiently created in a wire by subjection to a galvanic
discharge, with those produced by the permanent polarizing
power of a steel magnet; the utter heterogeneousness of the
powers of galvanic and frictional electricity, as respects ability
to produce sparks before contact, and likewise of the polarities
which they respectively produce; the superficiality of elec
tricity proper during discharge as well as when existing upon
insulated surfaces, as demonstrated by atmospheric electricity
when conveyed by telegraphic wires, agreeably to Henry;
the sounds observed severally by Page, Henry and Marrian,
as being consequent to making and breaking a galvanic circuit
through a conductor, or magnetizing or demagnetizing by
means of surrounding galvanized coils.
Proofs of the existence of an enormous quantity of Imponderable
                        Matter in Metals.
   29. It has been most sagaciously pointed out by Faraday,
that 430 atoms which form a cube of potassium in the
metallic state, must occupy nearly six times as much space as
the same number of similar atoms fill when existing in a cube
of hydrated oxide of potassium of the same size; which, besides
700 metallic atoms, must hold 700 atoms of hydrogen and
1400 of oxygen, in all 2800 atoms; whence it follows that,
in the metallic cube, there must be room for six times as many
atoms as it actually holds.
   30. With all due deference, I am of opinion that this
distinguished philosopher has not been consistent in assuming
that, agreeably to the Newtonian idea of ponderable atoms,
the space in potassium not replete with metal must be vacant;
since, according to facts established by his researches, or re
sulting therefrom, an enormous quantity, both of the causes
of heat and of electricity, exists in metals. Moreover, agree
ably to his recent speculations, those causes must consist of

470 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
material, independent, imponderable matter, occupying the
whole of the space in which their efficacy is perceptible. To
the evolution of the imponderable matter thus associated, the
incandescence of a globule of potassium on contact with water
may be ascribed, since it is the consequence of the displace
ment of such matter by the elements of water which, in re
placing it, converts the metal into the hydrated oxide called
caustic potash.
   31. The existence both of the causes of electricity and heat
in metals, is likewise confirmed by the fact, that the inductive
influence of a magnet is sufficient to cause all the phaenomena
of heat, electrolysis and magnetism, as exemplified by the
magneto-electric machine. The existence of the cause of heat
in metals is also evident from the ignition of an iron rod
when hammered, or the deflagration of wire by the discharge
of a Leyden battery.
   32. The superiority of metals as electrical conductors, may
be the consequence of the pre-eminent abundance of impon
derable matter entering into their composition, as above
alluded to in the case of potassium.
   33. Graham, in his Elements, treating of electricity, alleges
that the “great discoveries of Faraday have completely altered
the aspect of this department of science, and suggests that
all electrical phaenomena whatever involve the presence of
matter.” Unless the distinguished author from whom this
quotation is made intended to restrict the meaning of the
word matter to ponderable matter, there was no novelty in
the idea that electrical phaenomena involve the presence of
matter, since the hypotheses of Franklin and Dufay assume
the existence of one or more imponderable material fluids.
But, on the other hand, if the meaning of the word matter is
only to comprise that which is ponderable, the allegation is
inconsistent with the authority cited. According to the re
searches of Faraday, there is an enormous electrical power in
metals, and according to his speculations, such powers must
be considered as imponderable material principles, pervading
the space within which they prevail, independently of any
ponderable atom acting as a basis for material properties, the
existence of such atoms being represented as questionable.
Electrical Phaenomena attributed to Stationary or Undulatory
                          Polarization.
   34. It having been shown that in electrical discharges there
cannot reasonably be any transfer of matter, so as to justify
the idea of their being effected either by one current or by two
currents, the only alternative seems to be that the phaenomena

                      Franklin, loufay and Ampère.                       471
are due to a progressive affection of the conducting medium,
analogous in its mode of propagation to waves, as in the case
of liquids, or the aërial or aethereal undulations to which sound
and light are ascribed (1, 2, 3, &c. &c.).
    35. The idea intended to be conveyed by the word wave,
as applied in common to the undulatory affections above
mentioned, and that which is conceived to be the cause of the
phaenomena usually ascribed to one or more electrical currents,
requires only that there should be a state of matter, which,
while it may be utterly different from either of those which
constitute the waves of water, light or sound, may, neverthe
less, like either, pass successively from one portion of a mass
to another.
    36. The affection thus designated may be reasonably di
stinguished from other waves as a wave of polarization, since
the wire acts, so long as subjected to the reiterated discharges
of a voltaic series, as if it were converted into innumerable
small magnets, situated like tangents to radii proceeding from
its axis.              -
    37. But if a polarizable medium be requisite to electrical
discharges, since they pass through a space when devoid of
ponderable matter, there must be some imponderable medium
through which they can be effected. Hence we have reason
to infer that there is an imponderable matter existing through
out all space, as well as within conductors, which is more or
less the medium of the opposite waves essential to electric
discharges. Quoting his own language, Davy's experiments
led him to consider “that space (meaning void space), where
there is not an appreciable quantity of this matter (meaning
ponderable matter), is capable of exhibiting electrical phae
nomena:” also that such phaenomena “are produced by a
highly subtile fluid or fluids.” . Moreover, that “it may be
assumed, as in the hypothesis of Hooke, Euler, and Huygens,
that an aethereal matter susceptible of electrical affections fills
all space.”
     38. Agreeably to the suggestions above made, all ponde
 rable matter which is liable to be electrified internally by
electrical discharges, may be considered as consisting of atoms
 composed of imponderable aethereo-electric particles in a state
of combination with ponderable particles, analogous to that
which has been supposed to exist between such particles and
caloric when causing expansion, liquidity or the aëriform
state. Atoms so constituted of aethereal and ponderable par
ticles, may be designated as aethereo-ponderable atoms”.
    * Pouillet suggests that when the passage of a ray of light through glass
is influenced by a powerful magnet, agreeably to the experiments of Faraday,

 472 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
    39. A quiescent charge of frictional electricity only affecting
the superficies of any ponderable mass with which it may be
 associated, and having no influence upon the component
 aethereo-ponderable atoms severally, is not to be ascribed to
 redundancies or deficiencies of the aethereal matter, but to
 different states of polarization produced in different sets of the
 particles of such matter existing about the electrifiable bodies*.
 During the action of an electrical machine, these particles
 are polarized by the opposite polarities transiently induced in
 the surfaces subjected to friction; one set of particles going
 with the electric, the other remaining with the rubber.
    40. The particles thus oppositely polarized, severally divide
 their appropriate polarities with other aethereal matter sur
rounding the conductors, and this, when insulated, is retained
 until a further polarization results from the same process.
 Thus are the aethereo-electric atmospheres respectively sur
 rounding the positive and negative conductors oppositely
 polarized, and consequently charged to the degree which the
 machine is competent to induce. Under these circumstances,
 if a conducting rod be made to form between them a com
 munication, by touching each conductor with one of its ends,
 the polarities of the aethereo-electric atmospheresby which they
 are severally surrounded, propagate themselves, by a wave
 like process, over and more or less through the rod, accord
 ing to its nature and dimensions, so as to meet intermediately,
 and thus produce reciprocal neutralization.
“consistently with the undulatory theory of light, it is the aether of the body
submitted to the experiment which would be modified by the magnetism,
and that it would be very difficult to recognize whether it is modified
without any participation of the ponderable matter with which it is so
intimately connected.” Thus the existence of matter, composed of aethereal
as well as ponderable particles, is sustained by all the evidence which has
been brought to uphold the undulatory theory of light.—L. & E. Phil.
Mag. &c. for 1846, vol. xxviii. page 335.                          -
   * The word statical has been used to designate phaenomena which are
the effects of electricity when at rest, as when accumulated upon conductors
or the surfaces of panes or jars. Phaenomena which are supposed to arise
from electricity in motion (forming a current), are designated as dynamic.
Thus when charging one side of a pane produces the opposite state in the
other, the effect upon the latter is ascribed to statical induction; but when
a discharge of electricity through one wire causes a current in another,
forming an adjacent circuit, the result is ascribed to dynamic induction.
This method of designation is employed whether the alleged current be
owing to electricity generated by friction, as in the case of a machine, or
generated by chemical reaction, as in the case of a galvanic battery. A

from electricity produced by galvano-chemical reaction: for want of a

advantage of being self-explanatory.

                                                                            **

      41. When the oppositely polarizing waves, generated by
  friction as above described, are by means of a conducting
  communication transmitted to the surfaces of a coated pane,
  the two different portions of the electro-aether there existing
  are severally polarized in opposite ways, one being endowed
  with the properties usually called vitreous or positive, the
  other with those usually called resinous or negative. In fact,
  the two polarized atmospheres thus created may be conveni
  ently designated as the “two electricities,” and alluded to in
  the language heretofore employed in treating of phaenomena,
  agreeably to the hypothesis which assumes the existence of
  heterogeneous fluids, instead of heterogeneous polarities.
      42. Of course it will follow that the oppositely polarized
  aethereal atmospheres thus produced, one on each surface of
  the electric which keeps them apart, must exercise towards
  each other an attraction perfectly analogous to that which
  has been supposed to be exercised by the imaginary hetero
  geneous electric fluids of Dufay. The electro-aether “being
   elastic, a condensation over each of the charged surfaces pro
   portionable to the attractive force must ensue; while over
   the surface of an electrified conductor, the similarly polarized
  atoms not being attracted by those in an oppositely polarized
   atmosphere beneath the surface, tend, by their reciprocally
  repulsive reagency, to exist further apart than in a neutral
  state.    Hence the electro-aether, as it exists over the surface
  of an insulated conductor, is rendered rarer, while, as existing
  over the surfaces of charged panes or Leyden jars, it must be
  in a state of condensationt. And consequently, while the
  space perceptibly electrified by the charge of a conductor, for
  equal areas and charging power, is much more extensive than
  the space in which the charge of a coated pane is perceptible,
  the striking distance being likewise much greater; yet upon
  any body successively subjected to a discharge from each, the
  effect will be more potent when produced by means of the
  pane.

474 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
sectional area”, and less upon the extent of surface. The re
ciprocal repulsion of the similarly polarized aethereal particles
must tend always to make them seek the surface, but at the
same time their attraction for the aethereo-ponderable particles
composing the wire has the opposite effect, and tends to
derange these from their normal polar state of quiescence.
Commensurate with the extent in which this state is subverted,
is the resulting heat, electrolytic power, and electro-magnetic
influence.      he phaenomena last mentioned are, however,
secondary effects consequent to the participation of the aethereo
ponderable matter in the undulations resulting from the sta
tical discharge.
   44. Such effects, making allowance for the extreme minute
ness of the time occupied by the process, are probably in all
cases proportional to the degree in which the ponderable
matter is affected, up to the point at which it is dissipated by
deflagration; but the duration of a statical discharge being
almost infinitely minute for any length of coil which can con
veniently be subjected thereto, the electro-magnetic and other
effects of a statical discharge are not commensurate with the
intensity of the affection of the wire.
   45. There is, in fact, this additional reason for the diversity
between the electro-magnetic power of a statical discharge, as
compared with that of the voltaic series: any wire which is
of sufficient length and tenuity to display the maximum power
of deflagration by the former, cannot serve for the same pur
pose in the case of the latter. Moreover, the form of a helix
closely wound, so that the coatings may touch, which is that
most favourable for the reiteration of the magnetic influence
of the circuit upon an iron rod, cannot be adopted in the case
of statical discharges of high intensity, since the proximity of
the circumvolutions would enable the aethereal waves, notwith
standing the interposition of cotton or silk, to cross superfi
cially from one to the other, parallel to the axis of the included
iron, instead of pursuing the circuitous channel afforded by
the helix with the intensity requisite to the polarization of the
ponderable atoms.
The extreme diversity, as respects striking distance, between the

electrical machines, is estimated to be as the relative lengths
of the sparks which proceed from their prime conductors

respectively. Admitting that the relative intensity were
merely as the length of the spark, not as the square of that
length, still there would be an infinite difference between the
intensity of a voltaic series and that of electrical machines, if
measured by this test. Large electrical machines, like that at
the Polytechnic Institution, London, give sparks at twenty
inches and more; while, agreeably to Gassiot's experiments,
a Grove's battery of 320 pairs in full power, would not before
contact give a spark at any distance, however minute. It fol
lows, that, as respects the species of intensity which is indicated
by length of sparks, or striking distance, the difference be
tween the electricity of the most powerful voltaic series and
electrical machines is not to be represented by any degree of
disparity; it proves that galvanism proper and electricity
proper are heterogeneous.
    47. It should be recollected that the intensity of galvanic
action, in a series of 320 pairs, excepting the loss from con
duction, would be to that of one pair as 320 to 1*. Of course,
the striking distance of a battery of one pair would be 320
times less than nothing : 320 below zero.
    48. Wemayinfer that the undulatory polarization of aethereo
ponderable matter is the primary, #. and characteristic
effect of galvanic excitement, in its more energetic modifica
tions; yet, that by peculiar care in securing insulation, as in
the water batteries of Cross and Gassiot, aethereal undulations
may be produced, with the consequent accumulation of aethereal
polarity requisite to give sparks before contact, agreeably to
the experiments of those ingenious philosophers.
    49. Hence it maybe presumed, that during intense aethereo
 ponderable polarization, superficial aethereal waves may always
 be a secondary effect, although the conducting power of the
 reagents requisite to the constitution of powerful galvanic
    • According to Coulomb's experiments, electrical attraction and repulsion
 are inversely as the squares of the distances, and the inductive power of
 statical charges which is produced by those forces, and which precedes and
 determines the length of the resulting spark, must, of course, obey the same
 law.
    If this calculation be correct, the intensity must be as the squares of the
 striking distances, as indicated by sparks.
    It may be urged, that the striking distances, as measured by the length
 of the sparks, is in the compound ratio of the quantity and intensity. As
 to the quantity, however, galvanic sources have always been treated as pre
 eminent in efficacy, so that on that side there could be no disparity. More
 over, I have found that in galvanic apparatus of only one, or even of two
 pairs, as in the calorimotors, the intensity lessened as the surfaces were
 enlarged. By a pair of fifty square feet of zinc surface, a white heat could
 not be produced in a wire of any size, however small. The calorific power of
 such apparatus can only be made evident by the production of a compara
 tively very low temperature, in a comparatively very large mass.

476 Dr. R. Hare’s Objections to the Theories severally of
batteries, is inconsistent with that accumulation of aethereal
polarity which constitutes a statical spark-giving charge.
   50. As all the members forming a voltaic series have to be
discharged in one circuit, the energy of the effort to discharge,
and the velocity of the consequent undulations must be, ceteris
paribus, as the number of members which co-operate to pro
duce the discharge. Of course the more active the aethereo
ponderable waves, the greater must be their efficacy in pro
ducing aethereal waves of polarization as a secondary effect,
agreeably to the suggestions above made (49, 36).
   51. Hence in a battery consisting of one galvanic pair ex
cited by reagents of great chemical energy and conducting
power, the electro-magnetic effects are pre-eminent; while
De Luc's electric columns consisting of several thousands of
minute pairs, feeble as to their chemical and conducting effi
cacy, are pre-eminent for statical spark-giving power (48).
This seems to be quite consistent, since on the one hand, the
waves of polarization must be larger and slower, as the pairs
are bigger and fewer; and on the other hand smaller and
more active, as the pairs are more minute and more numerous.
On the perfect similitude between the Polarity communicated
   to Iron Filings by a Magnetized Steel Bar, and a Galvanized
   Wire.
   52. If by a sieve, or any other means, iron filings be duly
strewed over a paper resting on a bar magnet, they will all
become magnets, so as to arrange themselves in rows like
the links of a chain. Each of the little magnets thus created,
will, at its outermost end, have a polarity similar to that of
the pole (of the magnet) with which it may be affiliated. Of
course the resulting ferruginous rows formed severally by the
two different poles of the bar, will have polarities as opposite
as those of the said poles.
   53. In an analogous mode, if two wires be made the media
of a galvanic discharge, iron filings, under their influence, will
receive a magnetic polarity, arranging themselves about each
wire like so many tangents to as many radii proceeding from
its axis; those magnetized by one wire reacting with such
as are magnetized by the other.
   54. The affections of the ferruginous particles during the
continuance of the current so called, are precisely like those
of the same particles when under the influence of the bar
magnet. . The great discordancy is in the fact, that the influ
ence of the magnet is permanent, while that of the wire is in
debted for existence to a series of oppositely polarizing but
transient impulses which proceed towards the middle of the

                  Franklin, Dufay and Ampère.                  477
circuit from each side, so as to produce reciprocal neutraliza
tion by meeting midway.
   55. The effect upon the filings, as originally pointed out
by GErsted, is precisely such as would arise were the ponde
rable matter of the wire resolved by each impulse into innu
merable little magnets, situated so as to form tangents to as
many radii proceeding from the axis of the wire.
   56. Independently of the filings, the wires react with each
other as if their constitution, during subjection to the discharge,
were such as above supposed. When the discharges through
them concur in direction, they attract, because the left side of
one is next the right side of the other, bringing the opposite
poles of their little magnets into proximity; but when the
discharge is inade in opposite directions, the two right or the
two left sides will be in proximity, and will, by the consequent
approximation of the similar poles of the little magnets, be
productive of repulsion.
    57. From these last-mentioned facts and considerations, it
must be evident that, assuming that there is in a galvanized
wire a derangement of the poles of the constituent aethereo
ponderable particles analogous to that permanently existing
 in magnetized steel, involves no contradiction, no absurdity,
nor any thing but what is consistent with the researches and
inferences of Davy, Faraday, and other eminent investigators
of the phaenomena of nature.
Process by which the Æthereo-ponderable Atoms within a Gal
      vanic Circuit are polarized by the Chemical Reaction.
    58. In order that an aethereo-ponderable particle of oxygen
in any aqueous solution shall unite with an aethereo-ponderable
particle of zinc in a galvanic pair, there must be a partial re
volution of the whole row of aethereo-ponderable zinc atoms,
 with which the atom assailed is catenated by the attractions be
 tween dissimilar poles. Moreover, at the same time that the
 metallic atoms are thus affected, the atoms of water between the
metallic surfaces must undergo a similar movement, by an
 analogous reaction with poles of an opposite character, and
 this movement must extend through the negative plate to the
conductor, by which it communicates with the zinc or electro
 positive plate. When the circuit is open, the power of com
 bination exercised by the zinc and oxygen is inadequate to
produce this movement in the whole chain of atoms, liquid
 and metallic; but as it is indifferent whether any two atoms
 are united with each other, or with any other atoms of the
 same kind, the chemical force easily causes them to exchange.

478 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
partners, as it were, when the whole are made to form a cir
cuitous row in due contiguity.
   59. As we know that during their union with oxygen
metals give out an enormous quantity of heat and electricity,
it is reasonable to suppose that whenever an atom of oxygen
and an atom of zinc jump into union with each other, a wave
is induced in theaethereo-ponderable matter, and that this wave
is sustained by the decompositions and recompositions by
means of which an atom of hydrogen is evolved at the nega
tive plate and probably enabled to assume the aëriform state.
There must at the same time be a communication of wave
polarity by contact of the negative plate with the connecting
wire, by which the positive wave in the wire is induced. Al
though the inherent polarities of the metals are not, agreeably
to this view, the moving power in galvanism, yet they facili
tate, and in some cases induce the exercise of that power, by
enabling it to act at a distance, when otherwise it might re
main inert.
   60. This, I conceive, is shown in the effect of platina sponge
upon a mixture of the gaseous elements of water; also in
Grove's gas battery, by means of which hydrogen and oxygen
gas severally react with water in syphons, so as to cause each
other to condense, without any communication besides that
through the platina, and an electrolytic decomposition and
recomposition extending from one of the aqueous surfaces in
contact with one of the gases, to the other surface in contact
with the other gas.
Difference between Electro-aethereal and Æthereo-ponderable
                          Polarization.
   61. There are two species of electro-polarity which come
under the head of statical electricity. One of these Faraday
illustrates by supposing three bodies, A, B and C, in proxi
mity, but not in contact, when A, being electrified, electrifies
B, and B electrifies C by induction. This Faraday calls an
action of the particles of the bodies concerned, whereas, by
his own premises, it appears to me to be merely a superficial
affection of the masses or of a circumambient aethereal matter.
This species of polarization, to which the insulating power of
air is necessary, affects the superficies of a body only, being
displayed as well by a gilt globe of glass, as a solid globe of
metal. No sensible change appears to be produced in the
ponderable conducting superficies by this inductive superficial
electrification of masses; and of course no magnetism.
   62. When a small image, of which the scalp has been
abundantly furnished with long hair, is electrified, the hairy

                 Franklin, Dufay and Ampère.                  479
filaments extend themselves and move apart, as if actuated by
a repulsive power: also when iron filings are so managed as
to obey the influence of the poles of a powerful magnet (51),
they arrange themselves in a manner resembling that of the
electrified hair. There is, moreover, this additional analogy,
that there is an attraction between two portions of hair differ
ently electrified, like that which arises between filings differ
ently magnetized; yet the properties of the electrified hair
and magnetized filings are, in some respects, utterly dissimilar.
A conducting communication between differently electrified
portions of hair would entirely neutralize the respective elec
trical states; so that all the electrical phaenomena displayed by
them would cease.       Yet such a communication made between
the poles, exciting the filings, by any non-magnetic conductor,
does not in the slightest degree lessen their polar affections
and consequent power of reciprocal influence. Upon the
electrified hair, the proximity or the contact of a steel magnet
has no more effect than would result under like circumstances
from any other metallic mass similarly employed; but by the
approximation, and still more, the contact, of such a magnet,
the affection of the filings may be enhanced, lessened, or nul
 lified, according to the mode of its employment. In the case
of the hair, the affection is superficial, and the requisite char
ging power must be in proportion to the extent of surface. In
the case of the magnetized ferruginous particles, it is the mass
 which is affected, and, catteris paribus, the more metal, the
greater the capacity for magnetic power. In the instance of
the electrified hair, as in every other of frictional excitement,
the electrical power resides in imponderable aethereo-electric
atmospheres which adhere superficially to the masses, being
liable to be unequally distributed upon them in opposite states
 of polarity, consequent to a superficial polarization of the ex
 citing or excited ponderable masses; but in the instance
 of bodies permanently magnetic, or those rendered transiently
 magnetic by galvanic influence, the aethereo-electric matter
 and the ponderable atoms are inferred to be in a state of com
 bination, forming aethereo-ponderable atoms; so that both
 may become parties to the movements and affections of which
 the positive and negative waves consist.
    63. Thus an explanation is afforded of the hitherto myste
 rious diversity of the powers of a gold leaf electroscope and
 galvanoscopes, although both are to a miraculous degree sen
 sitive; the latter to the most feeble galvanic discharge, the
 former to the slightest statical excitement; yet neither is in
 the most minute degree affected by the polarization which
 affects the other.                                              º

480 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
   64. The charge which may exist in a coated pane affords
another exemplification of statical or electro-aethereal polarity.
In this case, according to Faraday, the particles of glass are
thrown into a state of electro-polarity, and are, in fact, par
tially affected as if they belonged to a conductor; so that in
sulators and conductors differ only in the possession in a high
degree by the one, of a susceptibility of which the other is
possessed to an extent barely perceptible. The facts seem to
me only to show, that either an insulator or conductor may
be both affected by the same polarizing force, the transmission
of which the one facilitates, the other prevents. I am under
the impression that it is only by the disruptive process that
electricity passes through glass; of course involving a fracture.
It gets through a pane or jar, not by aid of the vitreous par
ticles, but in despite of their opposing coherence. The glass
in such cases is not liable to be fused, deflagrated, or dissi
pated, as conductors are. It is forced out of the way of the
electrical waves, being incapable of becoming a party to them.
Discharges will take place through a vacuity, rather than
through the thinnest leaf of mica, But if, as Faraday has
alleged, from within a glass flask hermetically sealed, an
electrical charge has been found to escape after a long time,
it proves only that glass is not a perfect insulator, not that
perfect insulation and perfect conduction are different extremes
of the same property. On the contrary, the one is founded
upon a constitution competent to the propagation within it of
the electro-polarizing waves, with miraculous facility, while
the other is founded either on an absolute incapacity, or com
paratively an infinitely small ability to be the medium of their
conveyance. The one extremely retards, the other excessively
expedites its passage through a space otherwise void*.
Competency of a Wire to convey a Galvanic Discharge is as its
   sectional area, while statical discharges of frictional electri
   city preferring the surface are promoted by its extension. Yet
   in proportion as such discharges are heavy, the ability of a
   wire to convey them and its magnetic energy become more
   dependent on its sectional area and less upon extent of sur
  Jace,
   65. Reference has been made to two modes of electrical
conduction, in one of which the efficacy is as the surface; in
the other, as the area of a section of the conductor. Although
glass be substantially a non-conductor, the power of the sur
face of glass when moistened, or gilt, to discharge statical

electro-aether must render the existence of a perfect void impossible.

º,
      Lººkºy
       of THE
university of illMGS,

electricity, is enormous. It has been generally considered,
that as a protection against lightning, the same weight of
metal employed as a pipe, would be more efficacious than in
the usual solid form of a lightning rod; yet this law does not
hold good with respect to galvanic discharges, which are not
expedited by a mere extension of conducting surface. Inde
pendently of the augmentation of conducting power, conse
quent to radiation and contact with the air, the cooling influ
ence of which, according to Davy, promotes galvano-electric
conduction, a metallic ribbon does not convey a galvanic dis
charge better than a wire of similar weight and length 4.
    66. Agreeably to the considerations above stated, the sec
tional area of a conductor remaining the same, in proportion
as any statical accumulation which it may discharge is greater,
the effects are less superficial; and the aethereo-ponderable
atoms are affected more analogously to those exposed to gal
vanic discharges. It is in this way that the discharge of a
Leyden jar imparts magnetic polarization. Thus, on the one
hand, the electro-aethereal matter being polarized and greatly
condensed, combines with and communicates polarization, and
consequently magnetism, to aethereo-ponderable bodies; while,
on the other hand, these, when polarized by galvanic reaction,
and thus rendered magnetic, communicate polarity to the
electro-aether. Hence statical electricity, when produced by
galvanism, and magnetism, when produced by statical electri
city, are secondary effects.
    67. Where a wire is of such dimensions, in proportion to
the charge, as to be heated, ignited, or dispersed by statical
electricity, there seems to be a transitory concentration of the
electric power, which transforms the nature of the reaction,
and an internal wave of electro-ponderable polarization, simi
lar to those of galvano-electricity, is the consequence.
    68. As above observed (31), the current produced by the
magneto-electric machine has all the attributes of the galvano
electric current; yet this is altogether a secondary effect of
the changes of polarity in a keeper, acting upon a wire solely
   * It is well known that Wollaston effected the decomposition of water
by the aid of a powerful electrical machine. Having enclosed platina wires
within glass tubes, these were fused so as to cover the ends. The glass
was afterwards so far removed, by grinding, as to expose minute metallic
points to the liquid. Under these circumstances, the electricity conveyed
by the wires, being prevented from proceeding over them superficially, was
obliged to make its way through the aethereo-ponderable matter of which
metals consist (38). Instead of proving the identity of galvanism with
frictional eletricity (note 39), this experiment shows that in one character
istic at least there is a discordancy. At the same time it may indicate that
aethereal may give rise to aethereo-ponderable undulations.

482 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
by dynamic induction. But i<U+017F>, by mere external influence,
the machine above mentioned can produce within a circuit a
current such as above described, is it unreasonable to suppose
that the common machine, when it acts upon a circuit, may
put into activity the matter existing therein, so as to pro
duce waves of polarization, having the power of those usually
ascribed to a galvano-electrical current?
   69. It has been shown that both reason, and the researches
and suggestions of Faraday, warrant the inference that pon
derable atoms in solids and liquids may be considered as
swimming in an enormous quantity of condensed impondera
ble matter, in which all the particles, whether ponderable or
imponderable, are, in their natural state, held in a certain re
lative position due to the reciprocal attraction of their dissi
milar poles. A galvano-electrified body differs from one in
its ordinary state, in having the relative position of the poles
of its aethereo-ponderable atoms so changed, that their inhe
rent opposite polarities not being productive of reciprocal neu
tralization, a reaction with external bodies ensues.
   70. In statical excitement the affection is superficial as re
spects the ponderable bodies concerned, while in dynamic
excitement the polarities of the whole mass are deranged op
positely at opposite ends of the electrified mass; so that the
oppositely disturbing impulses, proceeding from the poles of
the disturbing apparatus, neutralize each other intermediately.
Supposing the ponderable as well as the imponderable matter
in a perfect conductor to be susceptible of the polar derange
ment, of which an electrified state is thus represented to con
sist, non-conductors to be insusceptible of such polar derange
ment, imperfect conductors may have a constitution inter
mediate between metals and electrics.       When an electrical
discharge is made through any space devoid of air or other
matter, it must then find its way solely by the polarization of
the rare imponderable matter existing therein; and conse
quently its coruscations should be proportionably more dif
fuse, which is actually found to be true; but when gaseous
aethereo-ponderable atoms intervene, they enable competent
waves to exist within a narrower channel, and to attain a
greater intensity. I consider all bodies as insulators which
cause discharges through them to be more difficult than through
a vacuum, and which, by their interposition within a circuit,
can prevent that propagation of the oppositely polarizing un
dulations which would otherwise ensue. This furnishes a good
mean of discrimination between insulators and conductors, the
criterion being, that a discharge ensues more readily as there
is more of the one and less of the other in the way; that the

one leads the waves where they would not go, the other im
pedes their going where they would proceed. Both in the
case of disruptive discharge through air, producing a spark, or
of a deflagrating discharge through wire, causing its explosion,
there is a dispersion of intervening ponderable particles; and
yet there is this manifest discordancy, that in one case the un
dulatory process of transfer is assisted, in the other resisted.
The waves follow the metallic filament with intense attrac
tion, while they strive to get out of the way of those formed
by the aëriform matter, as if repelled. Hence the term dis
ruptive, from dirumpo, to break through, was happily em
ployed by Faraday to designate spark discharges. The zig
zag form of the disruptive spark shows that there is a tendency
in the aëriform particles to turn the waves out of that straight
course, which, if unresisted or facilitated, they would naturally
pursue. On the one hand the aërial filaments being unsuit
able for the conveyance of the electric waves, these are forced
by them out of the normal path, first in one direction, then in
another; while on the other hand, the finest metallic filament
furnishes a channel for the electric waves, so favourable that
this channel is pursued, although the consequent polarization
of the conducting particles be so intense as to make them fly
asunder with explosive violence. Even when a bell wire has
been dissipated by lightning, it has been found to facilitate
and determine the path of the discharge.
    71. The various forms of the electric spark resulting from
varying the gas through which it may be made to pass,
agreeably to the researches of Faraday, is explained by the
supposition that the peculiarities of the spark is partially the
consequence of the polarizability of the gaseous atoms through
which the discharge is made, and varies accordingly in its
appearance.
 Difference between Frictional Electricity and Gahanic does
    not depend on the one being superior as to quantity, the other
    as to intensity, but on the different degrees in which the
    athereo-ponderable atoms of the bodies affected are de
    ranged from their natural state of Neutralized Polarity.
    72. I infer that all magneto-polar charges are attended by
 an affection of ponderable particles; and that the reason why
 the most intense statical charge does not affect a galvanometer,
 is, that it is only when oppositely excited bodies are neutralized
 by the interposition of a conductor, as during a discharge, that
 aethereo-ponderable particles are sufficiently polarized to en
 able them to act upon others in their vicinity, so as to produce
 a polar affection the opposite   ºf their own. In this way dy
                                 2 I 2

484     Dr. R. Hare’s Objections to the Theories severally of
namic induction is consistently explained, by supposing that
the waves of polarization, in passing along one conductor, pro
duce, pari passu, the opposite polarization in the proximate
part of any neighbouring conductor suitably constituted, si
tuated and arranged to allow it to form a part of a circuit.
    73. It is only during the state of the incessant generation
and destruction of what has been called the two electricities,
that the circuit, which is the channel for the passage of the
polarizing waves, is endowed with electro-magnetic powers.
It was, no doubt, in obedience to a perception of this fact,
that CErsted ascribed the magnetism of a galvanized wire to
a conflict of the electricities. Undoubtedly that state of a
conductor in which, by being a part of an electrical circuit, it
becomes enabled to display electro-magnetic powers, is so far
a conflict of the two electricities, as the affections of matter,
which are denominated electrical, consist of two opposite polar
forces, proceeding, agreeably to the language of Faraday, in
opposite directions from each side of the source, and conflict
ing with each other so as to be productive of reciprocal an
nihilation.
    74. That a corpuscular change in conductors is concomi
tant with their subjection to, or emancipation from, a galvanic
current, is proved by an experiment of Henry's, which he
afforded me an opportunity, on one occasion, of witnessing.
I allude to the fact that sound is produced whenever the cir
cuit is suddenly made or suddenly ruptured. By I. P. Mar
rian it has been observed, that a similar result takes place
during the magnetization or demagnetization of iron rods, by
the alternate establishment or arrestation of galvanic dis
charges through wires coiled about them so as to convent each
into an electro-magnet. Mr. Marrian represents the sound
as resembling that produced by striking a rod upon one of
its ends*. Sounds from this source were observed by Dr.
Page in 1838.        See Silliman's Journal for that year, vol.
XXX111,
    75. Thus it appears that there is an analogy between the
state of matter which involves permanent magnetism, and that
which constitutes a galvanic current, so far as this; that either
by one or the other, during either its access or cessation, an
affection of the ponderable particles concerned ensues, suffi
cient to produce sound.
    76. Simultaneously with the production of sounds as above
stated, by the opening or closing of the galvanic circuit through
  * Agreeably to recent experiments of Faraday, the particles of a glass
prism may be so influenced by an electro-magnet as to affect the passage
of polarized light. See Phil. Mag. and Journ, vol. xlv. p. 383, 1844.

 a metallic rod or the coils of an electro-magnet, secondary
  waves are induced, called secondary currents. It seems rea
  sonable to ascribe these waves to the same shifting of the
 poles which produces the sonorific undulations*.
     * These phaenomena excite more interest in consequence of the employ
 ment, for medical purposes, of an apparatus originally contrived by Cal
  lan, but since ingeniously modified by our countryman, Dr. Page, into a
  form which has been designated as the electrotome. A coil of coarse cop
  per wire, covered with cotton, like bonnet wire, is wound about a wooden
  cylinder. Around the coil thus formed, a coil of fine copper wire similarly
  covered is wound, leaving the extremities accessible. One end of the
 coarse coil communicating constantly with one pole of a galvanic battery,
 the other end is left free; so that by scraping with it the teeth of a rasp
 attached to the other pole, a rapid closing and opening of the circuit may
 be effected. Under these circumstances, an observer, holding the ends of
 the fine coil, receives shocks more or less severe, according to the construc
 tion of the battery, the energy of the agents employed to excite it, or the
 total weight and relative dimensions of the coils, as to length and sectional
 area. Agreeably to the received doctrine, the shocks thus produced are
 owing to secondary currents caused by dynamic induction. Agreeably to
 the hypothesis which I have advanced, the atoms of the coarse wire, pola
 rized by waves proceeding from the poles of the battery, induce a corre
 sponding polarization of the atoms of the fine wire; the aggregate polarity in:-
 parted being as the number of atoms in the former to the number of atoms
 in the latter; or (to use an equivalent ratio) as the weight of the coarse
 to the weight of the fine wire. But as on breaking the circuit, through the
 coarse wire, the aethereo-ponderable atoms in both wires resume their neu
 tral positions, while this requires each circuit to be run through within the
 same minute interval, the velocities of their respective waves will be in
 versely as their sectional areas and directly as their lengths; in other words,
 the velocity of the fine wire will be as much greater as the channel which
 it affords is narrower and longer. The cylinder, included within the coils
 as above stated, being removed, a cylindrical space is vacated. If into the
 cavity thus made, iron rods, like knitting needles, be introduced, one after
 the other, while the apparatus is in operation, the shocks increase in seve
 rity as the number augments; so that from being supportable they may be
 rendered intolerable. The shock takes place without the presence of iron,
 but is much increased by its assistance".
    These facts appear to me to justify a surmise, that the aethereo-ponde
rable atoms of iron, in becoming magnetized and demagnetized, co-operate
with the aethereo-ponderable atoms of the copper coils in the induction of
secondary undulations. It is conceived that these may be owing to the in
testinal change, attended by sound, as above stated (73); this being caused
by a sudden approximation of the poles of the atoms, previously moved
apart by the influence of the galvanized coil. But if this sudden coming
together of the previously separated poles of atoms within a magnetized
cylinder of iron can contribute to the energy of secondary waves, it is con
sistent to infer that these waves owe their origin to an analogous approxi
mation of the separated poles of the cupreous atoms, forming the finer coil,
    1 Agreeably to the usual construction, the cylinder about which the
inner coarse wire coil is wound is originally of iron, so that there is as
much of this metal contained as it can hold.      Various contrivances are re
sorted to for the closing and opening of the circuit, which are more inge
nious and convenient than scraping a rasp, as above described.

486 Dr. R. Hare's Objections to the Theories severally of
   77. Within the bodies of animals and vegetables, the
electro-aether may be supposed to exist as an atmosphere sur
rounding the aethereo-ponderable atoms of which their organs
are constituted, so as to occupy all the space which is not
replete with such atoms. Hence a discharge of frictional
electricity may indirectly polarize the whole animal frame, by
producing aethereo-ponderable polarization in the constituent
atoms of the fibres of the nerves and muscles. Probably this
polarization is produced more immediately in the ponderable
solids, by a discharge from a voltaic series, or a wire subjected
to electro- or magneto-dynamic induction. In the latter in
stances the shock is reiterated so rapidly as to appear more
 enduring, while in the former it is more startling and produ
cible at an infinitely greater distance.
    78. Agreeably to Faraday's researches (1485 to 1543),
 there is reason to suppose that in frictional spark discharges,
 the consequent shock, light, and other peculiarities, are in
part owing to waves of aethereo-ponderable polarization indi
 rectly produced in the intervening gaseous matter (71).
                Qf Æthereo-ponderable Deflagration.
    79. It is well known, that between two pieces of charcoal
severally attached, one to the negative, the other to the posi
tive pole of a numerous and well-excited voltaic series, an
arch of flame may be produced by moving them apart after
contact. This phaenomenon evidently depends upon the vola
tilization of the ponderable matter concerned ; since it cannot
be produced before the carbon has been volatilized by contact,
nor by any body besides charcoal, this being the only con
ductor which is sufficiently infusible, and yet duly volatilizable.
 Metals similarly treated fuse at the point of contact and co
here. On separation, after touching, a single spark ensues;
in which the secondary undulations may be created, without the presence
of iron. Of course this reasoning will apply to all cases in which the phae
momena hitherto attributed to Faradian currents are the result of dynamic
induction.                             -
   Thus it appears that the polarization of magnets, and that created and
sustained when a galvanized coil or helix acts upon another in proximity,
have the same relation to galvanic discharges that the charges upon insu
lated surfaces have to their appropriate discharges. The permanent mag
metism of steel seems to have some analogy with the charge upon a coated
pane, while we may consider as analogous with the charges upon insulated
conductors, already adverted to (61, 62), that state of the aethereo-ponde
rable particles (38) of a wire helix, which state, resulting from the influence
of an included magnet, or neighbouring galvanized coil, and being dis
charged on a change of relative position, or breach of the galvanizing cir
cuit, is productive of spark, shock, ignition, or electrolysis, as exemplified
by Callan's coil, Page's electrotome, or the magneto-electric machine.

which, without repetition of contact, cannot be reproduced.
Hence it may be inferred that the carbonaceous vapour is
indispensable to this process, as a medium for the aethereo
ponderable polarizing waves, being soon consumed by the
surrounding atmospheric oxygen. The excrescence upon the
negative charcoal, observed by Silliman, together with the
opposite appearance on the positive charcoal, may be owing
to the lesser affinity for oxygen on the negative side”.
   80. There may be some resemblance imagined between this
luminous discharge between the poles, and that which has
already been designated as disruptive (69); but this flaming
arch discharge does not break through the air, it only usurps
its place gradually, and then sustains this usurpation. It dif
fers from the other as to its cause, so far as galvanic reaction
differs from friction: moreover, it requires a volatilizable, as
well as a polarizable ponderable conducting substance to en
able its appropriate undulations to meet at a mean distance
from the solid polar terminations, whence they respectively
proceed.
   81. The most appropriate designation of the phaenomenon
under consideration, is that of aethereo-ponderable undulatory
deflagration. Under this head, we may not only place the
flaming arch, but likewise the active ignition and dissipation
of fine wire or leaf metal, when attached to one pole, and
made barely to touch the other.
   82. In one of Faraday's experiments, a circuit was com
pleted by subjecting platina points, severally proceeding from
the poles of a voltaic series, while very near to each other, to
the flame of a spirit-lamp. This was ascribed by him to the
rarefaction of the air, but ought, as I think, to be attributed
to the polarizable aethereo-ponderable matter of the flame,
performing the same office as the volatilized carbon in the
flaming arch between charcoal points, to which reference has
been made.
                             Summary.
   From the facts and reasoning which have been above stated,
it is presumed that the following deductions may be consider
ed as highly probable, if not altogether susceptible of demon
stration.
   The theories of Franklin, Dufay and Ampère, are irrecon
cilable with the premises on which they are founded, and with
facts on all sides admitted.                                   -
   A charge of frictional electricity, or that species of electric
excitement which is produced by friction, is not due to any

accumulation, nor to any deficiency either of one or of two
fluids, but to the opposite polarities induced in imponderable
aethereal matter existing throughout space however otherwise
void, and likewise condensed more or less within ponderable
bodies, so as to enter into combination with their particles,
º
rable.
          atoms which may be designated as aethereo-ponde
                            -
   Frictional charges of electricity seek the surfaces of bodies
to which they may be imparted, without sensibly affecting the
aethereo-ponderable matter of which they consist.
   When surfaces thus oppositely charged, or, in other words,
having about them oppositely polarized aethereal atmospheres,
are made to communicate, no current takes place, nor any
transfer of the polarized matter: yet any conductor touching
both atmospheres, furnishes a channel through which the op
posite polarities are reciprocally neutralized by being commu
nicated wave-like to an intermediate point.
   Galvano-electric discharges are likewise effected by waves
of opposite polarization, without any flow of matter meriting
to be called a current.                          -
   But such waves are not propagated superficially through
the purely aethereal medium; they occur in masses formed
both of the aethereal and ponderable matter. If the generation
of frictional electricity, sufficient to influence the gold leaf
electrometer, indicate that there are some purely aethereal
waves caused by the galvano-electric reaction, such waves
arise from the inductive influence of those created in the
aethereo-ponderable matter.
   When the intensity of a frictional discharge is increased
beyond a certain point, the wire remaining the same, its powers
become enfeebled or destroyed by ignition, and ultimately
deflagration: if the diameter of the wire be increased, the sur
face, proportionally augmented, enables more of the aethereal
waves to pass superficially, producing proportionally less
aethereo-ponderable undulation.
   Magnetism, when stationary, as in magnetic needles and
other permanent magnets, appears to be owing to an enduring
polarization of the aethereo-ponderable atoms, like that transi
ently produced by a galvanic discharge. (Note page 461 and
paragraph 68.)
   The magnetism transiently exhibited by a galvanized wire
is due to oppositely polarizing impulses, severally proceeding
wave-like to an intermediate part of the circuit where reci
procal neutralization ensues.
   When magnetism is produced by a frictional discharge
operating upon a conducting wire, it must be deemed a secon

 dary effect, arising from the polarizing influence of the aethereal
 waves upon the aethereo-ponderable atoms of the wire.
    Such waves pass superficially in preference; but when the
 wire is comparatively small, the reaction between the waves
 and aethereo-ponderable atoms becomes sufficiently powerful
 to polarize them, and thus render them competent, for an ex
 tremely minute period of time, to produce all the affections of
 a galvano-electric current, whether of ignition, of electrolysis,
 or magnetization. Thus, as the aethereo-ponderable waves
 produce such as are purely aethereal, so purely aethereal waves
 may produce such as are aethereo-ponderable.
    The polarization of hair upon electrified scalps is supposed
 to be due to a superficial association with the surrounding
 polarized aethereal atoms, while that of iron filings, by a mag
 net or galvanized wire, is conceived to arise from the influence
of polarized aethereo-ponderable atoms, consisting of aethereal
and ponderable matter in a state of combination.
    Faradian discharges are as truly the effects of aethereo
ponderable polarization, as those from an electrified conductor,
or coated surfaces of glass are due to static aethereal polariza
tion (39, 40, 41); last paragraph, note, page 485.
   It is well known that if a rod of iron be included in a coil of coated cop
per wire on making the coil the medium of a voltaic discharge, the wire is
magnetized. Agreeably to a communication from Joule, in the Phil. Mag.
and Journ. for Feb. 1847, the bar is at the same time lengthened without
any augmentation of bulk; so that its other dimensions must be lessened
in proportion to the elongation.
   All these facts tend to prove that a change in the relative position of the
constituent aethereo-ponderable atoms of iron accompanies its magnetiza
tion, either as an immediate cause, or as a collateral effect.
LXIV. Observations on the Elementary Colours of the Spec
   trum, in reply to M. Melloni. By Sir DAVID BREwsTER,
   K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., and V.P.R.S. Edin.*
   T is with considerable reluctance that I have been induced
     to notice the criticisms of M. Melloni, on my Analysis of
the Spectrum, which occupy so large a portion of his paper
published in the Phil. Mag. for April last. Had these criti
cisms emanated from any inferior person, I should have re
garded them as sufficiently refuted by the few remarks which
I made on the analogous observations of Dr. Draper. The
high and well-merited reputation, however, of M. Melloni,
and the singular confidence which he seems to place in his
own results, render it necessary that I should do more than
                     * Communicated by the Author.

490        Sir David Brewster, in Reply to M. Melloni,
merely pronounce them to be incorrect, and to have no real
bearing, even if correct, upon the views which they are
brought forward to overturn.
   M. Melloni asserts that he has repeated my fundamental
experiment, which, he says, “consists, as is well-known, in
interposing between the eye and the spectrum a slip of glass,
deeply coloured by the oxide of cobalt,” &c. &c.; and he goes
on to describe the phaenomena exhibited by a spectrum formed
from the light of a circular aperture, ten millimetres or four
tenths of an inch in diameter, and by means of an equilateral
prism in the position of minimum deviation. I never made
such an experiment, and never would have thought of employing
a spectrum thus produced. The spectrum described by Fraun
hofer was obtained from an aperture one-fiftieth of an inch
wide; Dr. Wollaston used an aperture one-twentieth of an inch,
while M. Melloni uses one twenty-fiftieths, twenty times wider
than Fraunhofer's aperture, and eight times wider than Dr.
Wollaston's In such a spectrum, therefore, the separation of
the colours must have been much less complete than in those
studied by Fraunhofer, Wollaston and myself; and the yellow
and the red rays must have invaded the orange, as observed
by Melloni. As this commixture of rays did not appear when a
narrow stripe” of the prism was used, that is, in his elementary
spectrum, as he calls it, he concludes that my results were owing
to the use of a prism with a wide surface, and that I had there
fore used a complew spectrum.           I should have been ashamed
of my inexperience had I used such an aperture and such a
spectrum as that which Melloni employed; and I can assure
him that he has formed a very low estimate of the time and
labour which I have devoted to these researches, and of the
manner in which they were conducted.
    Dreading, as he justly does, that his own results might be
   * This narrow stripe, a “little more than a millimetre in width,” was
formed in a layer of Indian ink on a face of the prism. As the light was
incident very obliquely on the prism, a millimetre, or the twenty-fifth of an
inch, would be reduced to nearly the fortieth of an inch when multiplied
by the cosine of the angle of incidence. Divergent light passing through so
narrow an aperture, would produce diffraction-fringes injurious to the di
stinctness and purity of Melloni’s elementary spectrum. I have repeated
my experiments with spectra much more distinct and pure than any that
can be produced by the contrivance of our author, and I have obtained
precisely the results contained in my original memoir. These spectra were
formed by the finest glass prisms, both single and compound, and by prisms
of rock salt, so perfectly homogeneous and colourless, that in looking into
the prism the substance of the salt is invisible. I have used prisms with
refracting angles of all magnitudes, and some of them so great that the blue
and violet rays did not emerge from the second surface, and in all the
spectra thus produced I have obtained the very same results.

              on the Elementary Colours of the Spectrum.                 491
affected by the dilatation of the pupil, and the consequent
confusion of vision, M. Melloni repeats the experiment which
he calls mine, but which I disavow, with a square aperture in
place of a circular one. What would Fraunhofer, Wollaston,
and Young think of a spectrum produced from a square aper
ture inscribed in a circle four-tenths of an inch in diameter*!
But waiving this objection, let us examine the experiment
itself. He goes on to say, that he sees “a red rectangle
almost square+, followed by a broad dark zone, and then by
a very brilliant yellow rectangle, of which the longer sides were
directed vertically and parallel to the length of the spectrum f:
there came then a deep indistinct colour, then the blue.” This
yellow rectangle was found to be more elongated horizontally
in the elementary spectrum, or that produced by a narrow
prism, than in the spectrum produced by a wider prism; and
hence Melloni concludes that the increased elongation arises
from the overlapping of the rays produced by the wide prism,
and not from confused vision $, because there is no increase in
a vertical direction. He takes it for granted that I have used
a wide prism, and consequently infers that I studied a spec
trum in which the colours were overlapped. I deny the as
 sumption as well as the inference.
     Viewing the experiments of Melloni by themselves, and
admitting the longitudinal expansion of the luminous rect
angles to be a fact, I ascribe it principally to the width of his
 aperture, and in a secondary degree to irradiation; or it may
 arise from an indistinctness of vision, or from an unusual quan
 tity of filaments floating in the vitreous humour of his eye.
     In describing the colours of his spectrum as altered by
 absorption, he mentions a red rectangle, a dark space, a yellow
 rectangle, then a DEEP INDISTINCT colour, then the blue.
 Now we ask him what he means by a deep indistinct colour?
 Is it yellow, or green, or yellowish-green 2 It must be one of
 these.      If it is yellowish-green or greenish-yellow, then certain
    * “If,” says Dr. Young, “the breadth of the aperture viewed through a
 prism be somewhat increased, each portion encroaches on the neighbouring
 colours and is mixed with them,” &c.—Lect, on Nat. Phil., vol. i. p. 439.
 M. Melloni increased the aperture of Fraunhofer from one-fiftieth to twenty
 fiftieths, and hence he used a mired spectrum.

 a square aperture could only be a square when every ray of light passing
 through that aperture had the same index of refraction.
    # This is to us quite unintelligible; but we presume the author means
 that the yellow rectangle was longer in the direction of the length of the
 spectrum than in a vertical direction.
    § M. Melloni does not seem to be aware that the apparent magnitudes
 of luminous spaces depend upon irradiation, or an expansion of the image
 on the retina, which varies with the degree of illumination.

 4.92      Sir David Brewster, in Reply to M. Melloni,
yellow and green rays which compose it must have the same
refrangibility as I maintain they have. If it is yellow or green,
why not say so? This deep indistinct colour is, doubtless,
neither yellow nor green. We believe, or rather we conjecture
(for we cannot speak with certainty as we do not know pre
cisely what glass he used), that it is a gray, that is, a dirty
white, consisting of red, blue and yellow light, not in such
proportions as to make white light.
    We shall admit, however, for the sake of argument, that
our author's experiments are perfectly correct, and that there
 has been an overlapping of rays in the spectrum which I em
 ployed. The admission would not in the slightest degree
affect my analysis of the spectrum. M. Melloni and Dr.
 Draper cannot surely have read my original memoir in the
 Edinburgh Transactions. Do they know that I have insulated
 a wide beam of white light in the most luminous part of the
 spectrum ? Do they know that I have done this in spectra
 divided by interference into dark and luminous portions where
 there are no lateral rays to invade the portion subjected to
 absorption ? Do they know that I have found green light near
 the line C of Fraunhofer, and considerably within the red
 space? Have they repeated these experiments, or do they
possess an apparatus fitted for their repetition? I believe they
have not; and I am persuaded that the experiments described
in the memoir referred to have not been repeated by any living
philosopher.
    Although I feel no disposition to adduce any new argu
ments in support of opinions which I consider as beyond the
reach of challenge, I am, nevertheless, desirous of stating some
facts, as observed by others, which may influence the views
of those who are not qualified, or who may not have the desire,
to investigate the subject experimentally.
    Dr. Wollaston, in his elegant examination of the spectrum
produced from the light of the sky with an aperture of one
twentieth of an inch, found only four colours, red, yellowish
green, blue and violet. He saw no yellow. Dr. Thomas
Young informs us that “he repeated Dr. Wollaston's very
interesting experiments with perfect success.” He calls Dr.
Wollaston's description of the spectrum the “correction of
the description of the spectrum ;” and he modifies his own
theoretical views by substituting red and green in place of
red, orange and yellow, when treating of the colours which
compose the less refrangible portion of the spectrum *. In
   * Philosophical Transactions, 1802; or Lect. on Nat. Phil., vol. ii.
pp. 637,638.

             on the Elementary Colours of the Spectrum.                 493
elsewhere speaking of Dr.Wollaston's observations, Dr.Young
observes, “Dr. Wollaston has determined the division of the
 spectrum in a much more accurate manner than had been done
before. * * * The spectrum formed in this manner consists of
four colours only, red, green, blue and violet. * * * The colours
differ scarcely at all in quality within their respective limits;
 but they vary in brightness, the greatest intensity of light being
 in that part of the green which is nearest to the red”.”
    Such is the composition of the daylight, or the blue sky, spec
 trum, as we may call it. It has no yellow spacef. But in the
 solar spectrum there is a distinct yellow space of considerable
 breadth lying between the red and green spaces, as clearly de
 fined in the beautiful drawing of Fraunhofer. What then has
 become of this yellow space in the daylight spectrum ? Some
 thing has been absorbed by reflexion from the sky or the clouds
 which has reduced the yellow light to green. This something is
 a portion of red light; because it is demonstrable, and it has
 been maintained by Wollaston and Young, that red and green
 make yellow. Now this yellow space in the solar specºrum,
 made yellowish-green in the daylight spectrum, may in its green
 state be again made yellow<U+017F>, and also yellowish-white and white
 by different absorbents. Hence it follows from Fraunhofer’s,
 and Wollaston's and Young's observations taken by themselves,
 that the quality of the colours of the brightest part of the spec
 trum is changed from yellow to yellowish-green, or green ac
 cording to Dr. Young. And it follows from my observations,
 combined with theirs or when standing alone, that in the same
 part of the spectrum there exist red, yellow, and blue rays of
 the very same refrangibility.
    As M. Melloni does not seem to have read my reply to
 the Astronomer Royal $, I shall merely refer him to it for a
 notice of the experiments made by Sir John Herschel, which
 confirm my analysis of the spectrum. That the quality of
 the colour of the red and orange spaces is altered by absorp
 tion, is clearly proved by a casual experiment of Sir William
  Herschel’s ||. He found that “clear turned brass made the red
 rays appear like orange, and made the orange colour different
 from what it ought to be.”
     Supported by the experiments and observations of such
    * Philosophical Transactions, vol. i. p. 348.
    t I take no notice of the exceedingly narrow line of yellow light which
 Dr. Young speaks of as generally seen at the limit of the red and green, and
 to the mixture of which it is ascribed, because its existence or non-exist
 ence does not affect my argument.

LXV. On the Velocity of Sound, in Reply to the Remarks of
   the Astronomer Royal. By the Rev. J. CHALLIS, M.A.,
   F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy in the University
   of Cambridge*.
     HE mathematical investigation of the velocity of sound
       which I gave in the Philosophical Magazine for last
April, has elicited Remarks from the Astronomer Royal, on
which I must make a few observations, before I proceed to
defend the principles of my investigation against the arguments
which the Astronomer Royal has brought forward.
   The not giving a reason for attaching a negative sign to b%,
was an omission on my part, which Mr. Airy has supplied
exactly according to my views.
   After allowing that the constant b% is admissible and may
be introduced for trial, Mr. Airy adds, “It is accordingly
introduced and tried, and we immediately perceive that if it
has a value different from zero, the result of non-divergence
of vibrations cannot be obtained.     Most reasoners would con
clude, either that such a result is not legitimately to be ex
pected, or that a last trial should be made by supposin
b°=0.” The result of non-divergence of vibrations is .#
by that part of my reasoning which terminates at line 8 of
page 280, in which Mr. Airy “sees no ground for      .#
any important step.” I am not, therefore, chargeable wit
acting differently from “most reasoners” in not coming to the
conclusion that such a result is not to be expected. Respect
ing the case in which bºa 0, which is that of plane-waves, I
propose to speak shortly.
   In the next sentence Mr. Airy goes on to say, “Instead of
this, Professor Challis has recourse to another equation ex
tracted from another memoir, and not demonstrated here,
which he considers more accurate than his equation (4.), and
he then uses this new equation in conjunction with equation (3.),
and thus obtains the startling results to which I have alluded.”

           Astronomer Royal on the Velocity of Sound.               4.95
The results alluded to, viz. the non-divergence of the vibra
tions, and a greater velocity of propagation than the value a,
are obtained by the part of the reasoning terminating, as
already specified, in page 280, before the introduction of the
new equation, which is first mentioned towards the bottom of
page 281. This equation in no way applies, unless the rea
soning be carried beyond the first order of approximation.
    I admit that there is inconvenience in referring to a separate
investigation, contained in another work, and undertaken for
a different purpose; and for this reason, as well as for another
which I shall mention hereafter, I will omit all consideration
of the equation against the introduction of which Mr. Airy
protests. If, however, the results derived from the approxi
mate equations (3.) and (4.) be liable to objection because
those equations are approximate, it will be proper to investi
gate and to use the corresponding exact equations, which I
am prepared to do in the pages of this Journal. The course
of the argument will thus be clear, and equations (3.) and (4.)
will be employed together as “fairly and honestly ” as Mr.
Airy can desire.
    I now maintain that I have proved, supposing b%, or e, to
have a value different from zero, that the waves are non-diver
gent, and that the velocity of propagation is greater than a.
 At the bottom of page 279 of my paper, the following equation
is obtained by reasoning which has not been objected to,

in other words, the waves are non-divergent, and the velocity

    I shall next maintain that e must have a value different from
Zero.
    In p. 277 I have come to a conclusion which has not been
disputed, and which is expressed in these words: “It is thus
shown that the condition that uda + vay-Hwdz be an exact dif
ferential, must be satisfied in a manner which shall equally
apply whatever be the original disturbance of the fluid.” The
supposition that u, v, and w are functions of the distance from
a fixed plane, is one of a general nature, by which udz-Hvdy
 + waz becomes an exact differential, and which, consequently,
is as much entitled to consideration as that which I have
adopted. This is, in fact, the case of plane-waves, and coin
 cides with the supposition that bºa O. If the motion be pa
 rallel to the axis of 2, w=      #.    and the exact equation appli

    Here it is observable that no relation exists between the
points of no velocity and the points of maximum velocity. As
m, t1, and A are arbitrary constants, we may even have
                                   A.
                            mti — 4. = 0,
in which case the points of no velocity are also points of maxi
mum velocity. This is a manifest absurdity. No step, how
ever, of the reasoning by which this result has been obtained
can be controverted. What then is the meaning of it? Clearly
the analysis rejects the supposition of plane-waves, by giving
an integral which admits of no physical interpretation. Plane
waves are thus shown to be physically impossible.
   Another way in which uda-H vay--wdz becomes an exact
differential, is to suppose the velocity to be a function of the
distance from a fixed centre, that is, to suppose the waves to
be spherical. In this case an exact integral is not obtainable.
But it may be shown by an integral of the known approximate
equation

that the analysis rejects this supposition also.    The equation

and putting r—at =c, it follows that a given phase of the wave
is carried with the uniform velocity a, the condensation (s)
varying inversely as the distance r. This conclusion is gene
rally adopted: but a very simple application of the principle
of constancy of mass will prove that it is false. For if a1, a2
be the condensations in spherical shells of indefinitely small
thickness 2, at corresponding parts of the same wave when at
different distances r1, r2, the above-named principle requires
that 2-trºia a should be equal to 2rr”,022, so that r*101=r”,72,
and the condensation varies inversely as the square of the di
stance. The inevitable conclusion from this reasoning is, that
the analysis rejects the supposition of spherical waves.
   There remains the supposition which I have adopted to
satisfy the condition that uda H-vay-Hwaz be an exact differen
tial (d), viz. that J is the product of a function of w and y,

and a function of z and t: according to which, if b^ have a
value different from zero, the waves are neither plane nor
spherical. No incompatibility here presents itself, at least, as
far as to the first order of approximation. We may even ex
plain, on this hypothesis, the contradictions met with in the
other two. For supposing non-divergence to be the normal
condition of waves, a plane-wave, or a spherical wave, is pos
sible only when it is compounded of an unlimited number of
non-diverging waves; and in the case of a spherical wave so
compounded, the variation of condensation is inversely as the
square of the distance from the centre, as we have shown that
it ought to be.
    The argument respecting this third supposition is evidently
incomplete, unless it be proved that no incompatibility is met
with when the reasoning is conducted by exact equations. I
propose in another communication to consider this part of
the subject, which requires a mode of treatment different from
that in my paper on Luminous Rays (Camb. Phil. Trans.,
vol. viii. part 3, p. 865). I have there made use of equation
(A.), not being at the time aware of what is the true interpre
tation of its integral. Consequently the equation which Mr.
Airy has objected to, though not upon a consideration of its
merits, and which I have avoided introducing into this com
munication, is as yet unsupported.
    What I have said above will suffice for an answer to Mr.
 Airy's arguments in paragraphs (3.) and (y.). In the former,
the motion results from two systems of plane-waves propagated
                                                       e

 axis. In the latter, the motion results from systems of plane
 waves also. I have nothing to urge against the mathematical
reasoning : my sole answer is, that plane-waves are physically
 impossible.
      he difficulty respecting the augmentation of the velocity
 of sound by the development of heat, cannot be so summarily
 disposed of as Mr. Airy appears to imagine. I shall perhaps
 succeed better in conveying my meaning by using symbols.

       LXVI. On some New Lines in the Solar Spectrum.
                 By Professor ELIE WARTMANN*.
THE study of the spectrum has long occupied the attention
       of philosophers. As early as 1802 Wollaston made
known the existence of some obscure rays perpendicular to its
length. Twelve years later Fraunhofer again discovered them,
and gave an analysis of them, which is a masterpiece of patience
and skill. We know that he used these lines as extremely
valuable marks for the construction of achromatic refractive
systems. Having been sought for in spectra produced with
different sources of illumination, and with prisms and absorb
ing media of various kind, they have likewise become of con
siderable interest, as affording geometricians an opportunity
of discussing the comparative merits of the theories of light.
   In 1840 I made a series of experiments on the spectrum
with an excellent prism of flint-glass, the last cut by the illus
trious Bavarian optician. These experiments led me to several
results, which I communicated to my pupils and showed to
some amateurs; but I desired to increase their number
before publishing them in a connected form. At present, not
having the apparatus which I employed any longer at my
disposal, it is useless to make further delay. Notwithstanding
their imperfection, I may be allowed to make known some
details that I believe to be new. I extract them briefly from
the note-book of my laboratory, dated April and May 1841.
   “The lecture-room of the Academy of Lausanne having
been darkened, a beam of solar light, thrown by a tinned or
blackened mirror, was made to pass through a vertical slit
of Omm-8 in width.      This beam is refracted in Fraunhofer's
prism fixed in a vertical position at the distance of eight me
tres. Directly behind this instrument is placed an achromatic
theodolite of Om'04 aperture, made at Aarau, or a comet seeker

On 66, and an objective the diameter of which measures
Om'069. The prisin, the refracting angle of which is 45°4' 20",
is arranged in the position of minimum deviation.
    “I thus discovered in the luminous field of the spectrum
projected horizontally, a great number of longitudinal straight
lines, some thicker than others, parallel to each other and to
the length of the spectrum. They are therefore perpendicular
to the transverse rays already known. They are perceptible
before the telescope is drawn out sufficiently for the latter to
be seen distinctly. I rarely succeeded in obtaining a view of
the two systems at once. These longitudinal lines do not
arise from an impurity in the prism or in the glasses of the
telescope, for they appear the same with other refractive ap
paratus. Neither can they be attributed to inequalities in the
 rectilinear margins of the opening, nor to an imperfect state
of the surface of the mirror. But their general aspect depends
upon the size of the aperture, on the distance and the position
of the prism, on the state of the atmosphere, on the height of
 the sun above the horizon, and on the hour of observation.
 It often appeared to me that several of them became displaced
and extinguished, as if the transparency of the air had sud
denly changed. By varying the distance of the eye-glass from
the objective, they are partially, if not all, changed from black
into luminous lines, and vice versá. These appearances, not
having the fixity and the distinctive characters of the lines
figured by Fraunhofer, must be assigned to a different cause.
    “The longitudinal stripes, examined by the help of a very
excellent equilateral prism by Soleil, generally appear so much
the more visible as the aperture is larger. Whether it be of
a circular or rectangular form is of no consequence. By re
 moving the exterior mirror and employing direct light, the
lines are seen to vary in number and position, according as
the naked eye, placed immediately against the prism, moves
parallel to its vertical edges *. These appearances are owing
to the interference of the central rays with those which are
 reflected against the edges of the opening. They disappear
when all reflexion is rendered impossible in this as in the
prism, and when the axis of the eye or of the glass is suitably
directed. They do not change when the light of a lamp is
    * The prism is of such pure flint, that with direct light, in misty weather,
it is possible to see with the naked eye at least sixty of Fraunhofer's lines.
The two marked B and C in the red are perceived very distinctly; but the
bundle H, and especially that which follows it in the violet, are not clear.
The experiment constantly succeeded at six metres, with an aperture of
1 mm.4.

substituted for that of the clouds or of the sun, nor when co
loured media are interposed in the passage of the rays before
or after their dispersion. In short, they may be produced at
will by placing one or two plain mirrors near the extremities
of the aperture made in the shutter, and by giving them a
horizontal inclination of variable extent, such that the brilliant
image which they receive produces a spectrum which is partly
superposed upon that of the direct rays. This well deserves
to be made a class experiment, as a variety of that of the two
mirrors of Fresnel. It is much easier, does not require any
delicate or costly apparatus, and extends simultaneously to all
the monochromatic zones of the spectrum.
    “As the band of light which is admitted into the prism
proceeds from different parts of the sky, it is easy to account
for the changes in the appearance of the longitudinal lines
according to the degree of transparency of the atmosphere.
The modifications which this system undergoes with the
changes of exterior illumination are explained by the unequal
distribution of diurnal light, which, during a state of greater
or less complete serenity of the air, varies with the distance of
the sun from the meridian.
    “These lines of interference have not been mentioned by
any author, at least as far as I can learn.”
    In 1844, M. Ad. Erman seems to have had a glimpse of
the phaenomenon which I had discovered, but attributed it to
the accidental defects of the vessels which he employed, and did
not pay any attention to it *. It is but somewhat recently that
the horizontal bands have become the subject of investigation
by two experimenters, well-located for optical researches,
M. Zantedeschi at Venice, and M. Ragona-Scina in Sicily.
    M. Zantedeschi has published the results of his experi
ments in a separate volume, which has not yet been reviewed
in France. Only a hundred copies of this work having been
printedt, it will not be out of place here to give its conclu
sions, which confirm mine on almost every point.
    “The appearance of the lines of the solar spectrum is
in a necessary relation with the smallness of the aperture,
and with the interval which separates the prism from
it. At a constant distance the transversal lines appear with

the widest aperture, the longitudinal with the smallest, and
the two systems with the mean one. With a constant aper
ture the vertical lines appear at the greatest distance, the ho
rizontal at the smallest, and the double system at the mean
distance. The angle of incidence for the transversal lines
alone, is a little larger than that which gives a distinct vision
of the longitudinal alone. The arrangement of the longitu
dinal lines varies with the distance of the prism from the
aperture. The first transversal as well as longitudinal lines
which begin to appear in the field of the solar spectrum,
are those which, in the entire system, are the most intense
and the widest. In each system the focus of the lines varies
with the size of the aperture. The intensity of the lumi
 nous lines in each of the three systems is greater than that of
 the remainder of the field of the solar spectrum: this is what
 Fraunhofer discovered for the transversal lines.    The state of
the atmosphere modifies the focal distance of the longitudinal
as well as of the transversal lines.   This state also influences
the position, number, size and force of the longitudinal and
transversal lines. To each system of lines corresponds an
aperture, which is best suited for its being projected most
distinctly.
    “Fraunhofer refers the cause of the black lines to the nature
of the light. With him, the spectrum was a means of verifying
 the identity or diversity of the light emanating from different
 sources. Herschel ascribes the origin of it to the positive
 absence of luminous rays, whether in the act of their develop
 ment, or by absorption in the media which they have to pass
 through. This opinion is very nearly the same as that enter
 tained by Brewster and Erman. The former considers that
 the rays which are defective are absorbed by the gases pro
 duced in the combustion which engenders the light, or by the
 media through which they must pass. The latter is of opinion
 that the medium traversed by the luminous ray separates it
 into two or into several parts, each of which is retarded in a
 different manner; on this account he distinguishes simple and
 double interference.
    “All these opinions appear to me to be defective, although
 they all seem to have a true side. Fraunhofer refers the entire
 phaenomenon to the nature of the luminous ray alone; Her
 schel, Brewster, and Erman to the simple influence of the
 different media interposed. But in these phaenomena, the
 apparatus itself which is used for the experiment plays an
 important part. It is now a well-proved fact, that the appear
 ances of the spectrum vary with the size of the aperture and
 the interval which separates it from the prism, the nature and

                       in the Solar Spectrum.                   503
dimensions of this and its distance from the screen.            The
whole of these circumstances necessarily leads me to admit,
that these appearances of the luminous spectrum are produced
by the different distribution of the rays, caused by the different
media which they have to pass through. The monochromatic
light of the lateral spectra, the production of such different
lines by the simple variation of the distance of projection, the
transformation of the systems of lines into forms so varied by
the alteration of size of the aperture through which the light
is admitted, the increase of tints in the obscure lines, and the
strengthening of the luminous ones, are, in my opinion, so
many clear proofs of variations in the reflexion, refraction, and
dispersion of light, I do not thereby wish to deny that any
ray is extinguished by absorption or by interference, but only
to show that these two acts, such as they are considered in the
undulatory system, are not causes really sufficient to produce
the phaenomena of the luminous spectrum. It cannot be ab
sorption; for if the black lines are really produced by absorbed
rays, and not by rays differently distributed, it is impossible that
the increase or decrease of the black tints should always be
accompanied by an analogous variation in the intensity of the
luminous lines, and the thickening or attenuation of the black
lines always by the enlargement or diminution of the lumi
nous lines. The large systems of obscure lines produced by
nitrous gas and by the vapours of iodine, are traversed in their
centre by a zone of very bright light three or four millimetres
wide. The systems of uniform and excessively fine lines pre
sent a tranquil light, which is spread equally throughout the
height of the spectrum, so as not to be remarked by an eye
not accustomed to similar researches.        It cannot be interfe
rence; for in the space or in the line itself, where rays which
should go on increasing the intensity of light should meet,
this still shows itself diminished or extinguished : the lines are
sometimes luminous, white, sometimes coloured, sometimes of
a more or less perfect black. I have verified this phaenomenon
some hundreds of times. It entirely upsets and destroys the
doctrine of interference, as I shall show in a future communi
cation, in which I intend to make known the rest of my ob
servations.
   “I said that the solar spectrum is the most exquisite
photoscope known. The following are some of the experi
ments in support of this assertion. Before the aperture,
which was two millimetres wide, I placed a bottle of the
purest white crystal with parallel sides. No line appeared in
the solar spectrum on the screen placed at 2:39 metres from
the prism. The bottle was at 0” 1 from that, and the projec

504.         Prof. E. Wartmann on some New Lines
tion of the spectrum was 0"16 in length and 0.055 in height.
I ought also to notice that the flat sides of the bottle were five
millim. thick, and at 0”043 distant from each other.                    I in
troduced into it some crystals of iodine, which I caused to
 pass slowly into the state of vapour. The bottle was placed on
 some sand, and it was heated by means of some incandescent
charcoal placed on the sheet of iron, which sustained it as well
 as the sand. As soon as the vaporization of the iodine had
 begun, some excessively thin and ill-defined lines appeared in
 the field of the spectrum. By increasing the quantity of
 vapour, this spectrum appeared covered with thousands of
 longitudinal, exceedingly fine black lines; by degrees they
 united in a system of large and small, accompanied by some
 which were luminous, and at last they divided into two ex
 cessively black systems, one superior, the other inferior, se
 parated by a zone of intense light five millim. in width. After
 the fire had been removed, the vapour of iodine returned by
 degrees to the solid state, and the two black systems were subdi
 vided as well as the luminous band. I have observed perfectly
 similar phaenomena with nitrous gas. It is wonderful to see
 some thousands of longitudinallipes in constant motion, owing
 to variations of temperature”. . . . I have thus convinced my
 self of the existence of the two following facts:—1, the internal
 motion of the vapours, as well as that of the translation of the
 vessel, produce an indescribable variety in the distribution of
 the black and luminous lines; 2, rarefaction of the gases causes
 a subdivision of the black lines, condensation unites or in
 creases these lines. All this is in perfect harmony with the
variations produced by the atmosphere. When a subtle veil
 of vapour suspended in the upper regions merely softens the
 intensity of the azure of our sky, the spectrum presents some
 excessively fine longitudinal lines in its field, so fine that the
 eye, not aware of their existence, is unable to perceive them.
 The lines marked q in my figure have several times presented
the phaenomenon of their separation and reunion, accompanied
by the successive appearance or disappearance of an interposed
luminous line.       These variations were observed for more than
ten days, during which the state of the atmosphere constantly
varied; and I have also always detected changes in the focal
distancet.”
   * The author does not appear to have paid any attention to the move
ments of the heated air around his prism.
   t Those who may consult the work from which we have translated the
preceding lines, will perhaps not consider as out of place some critical notes
on the chapter which now occupies us. In the first place, the simplified
method employed by the author in order to project his lines upon a screen,
is due to M. de Haldat, who described it as early as 1838 in the Mémoires

                             in the Solar Spectrum.                          505
     M. Zantedeschi's publication has induced Prof. Ragona
  Scina of Palermo to extend this new field of inquiries. The
 following are some of the principal results which he has made
 known”. The horizontal and vertical lines may be perceived
 by placing a small Galilean telescope against a prism lighted
 by an aperture of Omm-33. The principal of them may even be
 seen by the naked eye. They likewise exist in the ordinary
  and extraordinary spectra which a doubly refracting body
 produces. The horizontal lines may be obtained without the
 help of a prism, by examining obliquely across a biconcave
 lens the interval which had remained bright between the two
  shutters of a window closed to within a decimetre+. , Lastly,
  the system of horizontal lines is submitted to an hourly perio
  dical return, whilst that of Fraunhofer's lines is perfectly
  fixed. This assertion is contrary to that of M. Zantedeschi.
     M. Ragona endeavours to explain the lines of Fraunhofer
 by attributing them to the encroachment of the four simple
 colours, red, yellow, blue and green. M. Zantedeschi speedily
 acknowledged himself of this opinion, and also explained, by
 the reciprocal influence of the luminous rays, his longitudinal
 lines<U+017F>. This is proved, according to him, by their appearing
 so much the more distinct the narrower and longer the spec
 trum is; whilst the contrary conditions favour the visibility of
 de l'Académie Royale des Sciences de Nancy. We know that Cooper had
 announced the existence of a visible brightness beyond the red rays (Pro
 ceedings of the Royal Society of London, vol. iv. p. 146). The Venetian
 Professor has not only verified the fact, but he also thinks that he has found
 an analogous appendage at the opposite extremity. Moreover, the discovery
 of an extension in the solar spectrum, beyond the violet, is due to Sir John
 Herschel. He made it as early as 1819, whilst repeating some experiments
 on the polarized rings with Biot's apparatus; but he did not describe it till
 1840, in his beautiful memoir On the Chemical Action of the Rays of the
 Solar Spectrum on preparations of Silver and other Substances, in the Phi
 losophical Transactions. In the $56, entitled “Extension of the Visible
 Prismatic Spectrum, a new Prismatic Colour,” he says expressly that there
 exists, beyond the violet, some luminous rays of a different colour from that of
 the different bands of the spectrum, and which is of a lavender-gray. M.
 Zantedesahi owes to the sky of Venice, which is much more propitious than
 that of Collingwood, the possibility of studying this extension of coloration
 in detail, which will no doubt be of some importance in the question of the
 real number of simple colours, and to which I called attention in my me
 moir on Daltonism (Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, vol. iv. p. 156). Lastly,
 the author mentions the existence of tints of bright blue, visible above
 and below some prismatic zones of a horizontally projected spectrum, and
 he proposes calling these tints secondary spectra. But this denomina
tion cannot be adopted, since it has for a long time been applied to the
spectra produced by a prism achromatized for the extreme rays.

506        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
the transversal lines. Strange as may seem M. Ragona's
theory, it deserves examination; but I confess that that of the
Venetian Professor appears to me to be very obscure. To
explain the encroachments of the coloured bands in the lon
gitudinal direction, we must admit that the spectrum is double,
and that its elements overlap at right angles. The too great
brevity of the author, which is limited to the paragraph above
quoted, does not allow us to suppose that such is his opinion.
Moreover, these lines, far from constituting a fact opposed to
the theory of undulations, are, on the contrary, an interesting
confirmation of its truth.
LXVII. Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
   March 31, 1848. By JAMEs GLAISHER, Esq., of the Royal
   Observatory, Greenwich%.
 IN the February Number of your Magazine you did me the
      favour to insert my remarks upon the weather during the
quarter ending December 31, 1847. The weather of the
past quarter has been as unusual as that of the preceding, and
some account of it may probably interest your readers.
   The quarterly meteorological returns for the past quarter
furnished to the Registrar-General have been obtained from
thirty-five different places, situated between the longitudes of
5° 18' W. and 0° 16' E.; and between the latitudes of 50° and
55°.    These observations have been all rigorously examined
and reduced by myself, and their results are worthy the at
tention of meteorologists. The following are the particulars
of the weather during the quarter ending March 31, 1848.
   The weather during the past quarter has been remarkable
in many respects. The daily temperature of the air has for
the most part been above the average, yet there was a period
of exceedingly cold weather between the 20th and 28th of
January; the departures from the average on the 26th, 27th,
and 28th, were 12°8, 10°8, and 16° respectively. The tem
perature then suddenly increased to 6°5 above the average
on the 30th; and for the most part the daily values after
wards exceeded those of the average, or differed very little
from them.
   It may perhaps tend to clearness if I speak of each subject
of investigation separately.
   The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich—
   For the month of January was 34°6, which is 1°7 above
that of 1842, 4°5, 3°7, 9°1, and 0°-5 below those in the
years 1842 to 1847 respectively; or it is 8°8 below the ave
rage of these six years.
                 * Communicated by the Author.

              during the Quarter ending March 31, 1848.          507
       For the month of February was 43°4, which is 2°-6, 7°4,
    8°2, 10°.7 above those of the years 1842 to 1845 respectively,
    O’5 below that in 1846, and 8°-0 below that of 1847; or it is
    2°6 above the average of these six years.
       For the month of March was 43°-8, which is 1° 1 below
    that of 1842, O'9, 2°-8, 8°-6, 0°-5 and 2°8 above those of the
. . years 1843 to 1847 respectively; or it is 2°3 above the ave
    rage of these six years.
       The mean value for the quarter was 40°-6; that for 1841
    was 38°4; for 1842 was 39°5; for 1843 was 39°.6; for 1844
    was 38°5; for 1845 was 35°4; for 1846 was 43°6; and for
    1847 was 37°2; so that the excess for this quarter above the
    corresponding quarter in the years 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844,
    1845 and 1847, were 2°2, 1° 1, 19-0, 2°. 1, 5°2, and 3°4 re
    spectively; the only year between 1841 and 1847 whose mean
    temperature for this period exceeded that of the present year
    was 1846; the excess of the period in this year exceeded that
    of the corresponding period of 1848 by 3°0. The average
    value for this quarter from the seven preceding years was
    38°9, so that the mean temperature of the air for the past
    quarter exceeds that of the corresponding quarter in the seven
    preceding years by 1°7. This excess is remarkable, from
    the circumstance of the mean temperature of the preceding
    quarter being in excess to the large amount of 3°4, so that
    the temperature of the period between 1847, September 30,
    and 1847, March 31, exceeds the average by 2°55.
       The mean temperature of the evaporation at Greenwich—
       For the month of January was 32°6, which is 4°7 below
    that for the preceding six years.
       For the month of February was 41°6, which is 5°8 above
    that for the preceding six years.
       For the month of March was 41°-6, which is 2°2 above
     that for the preceding six years.
       The mean value for the quarter was 38°6, which is 1°l
     above that for the corresponding period of the preceding six
    years.
        The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich—
        For the month of January was 31°7, which is 1°7 above
     that for 1842, 5°-6, 4° 4, 4° 2, 9°1, and 12.9 below those of
     the years 1843 to 1847 respectively; or it is 3°9 below the
     average of these six years.
        For the month of February was 38°8, which is 0°4, 5°4,
     7°0, 10°.3 above those of the years 1842 to 1845, 1%. 1 below
     that of 1846, and 7°8 above that of the year 1847; or it is 5°0
     above the average for these years.
        For the month of March was 38°5, which is 2°-2 and 0°4
     below those of the years 1842 and 1843, 1°9, 8°5, 0°2, and

 508        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
 5°-0 above those of the years 1844 to 1847 respectively; or it
 is 2°2 above the average value for these six years.
    The mean value for the quarter was 36°3, which is 1°1
 above the average for the six preceding years.
     The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the
 quarter was 2.7 grains, which is of the same value as that of
 the average for the six preceding years.
    The additional weight of water required to saturate a cubic
 foot of air was 0-47 grain; the average for the six preceding
years was 0.36 grain.
    The mean degree of humidity of the atmosphere for January
was 0.837, for February was 0.864, and for March was 0.839;
these values being less than the average for the six preceding
years by 0.077, 0.029, and 0.002 respectively; the value for
the quarter was 0.846, which is 0.036 less than the average
for these years.
    The mean elastic force of vapour for the quarter was 0-230   -
inch, which is 0.006 inch above the average for the six pre
ceding years.
    The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich for
January was 29-816 inches, for February was 29'517 inches,
and for March was 29'505 inches; these values are 0.057 inch
above, 0.199 inch below, and 0.256 inch below respectively, the
averages for the seven preceding years. The mean value for
the quarter was 29-618 inches, which is 0-132 inch below the
average for these years. The readings of the barometer
during the greater part of the quarter were remarkable, and
will be spoken of presently.
    The average weight of a cubic foot of air under the average
temperature, humidity and pressure, was 545 grains; the ave
rage for the six preceding years was 549 grains.
    The rain fallen at Greenwich in January was 1-2 inch;
in February was 2.6 inches; and in March was 3.1 inches;
the average values for the seven preceding years were
1.9 inch, 1.6 inch, and 1.4 inch respectively. The total
amount fallen in the quarter was 7-9 inches, which is 3-0
inches greater than the average for the years 1841 to 1847.
I shall presently speak of this large amount of rain.
    The temperature of the Thames water was 39°3 by day, and
37°-0 by night. The water, on an average, was 2°4 warmer
than the air.
    The horizontal movement of the air was about 168 miles
daily, being somewhat more than its average value.
    The highest and lowest readings of the thermometer in air at
the height of four feet above the ground, and protected as
much as possible from the effects of radiation and rain, were
71°5 and 15°8.

           during the Quarter ending March 31, 1848.           509
   The average daily range of the readings of the thermometer
in air at the height of four feet, was 11° 1, which is 0°.8 greater
than the average range for the seven preceding years.
   In January the readings of the thermometer on grass were at
or below 32° on twenty-seven nights, and the lowest reading
was 12°5. In February it was at or below 32° on fourteen
nights, and the lowest reading was 20°. In March it was at
or below 32° on twenty-one nights, and the lowest reading
was 18°. These low readings have generally taken place at
times when the sky has suddenly become clear, and for the
most part their periods of continuance have been short, as
the amount of clear sky at night during the quarter has been
small. The observer at Durham says, that on the night of
January 19, the reading of a thermometer on grass fell below
Zero.
   The mean amount of cloud for the quarter was such as to
cover upon the average four-fifths of the whole sky. The
amount of cloud during the period from 1847, November 30,
to 1848, March 31, was larger than in any period of equal
length for many years.
   In the last report I spoke of the smallness of the amount
of the electricity which had existed in the air at Greenwich
during the quarter ending 1847, December 31. In conse
quence of this remark, Francis Ronalds, Esq., the Director
of the Observatory at Kew, communicated with me, and he
has kindly lent the original Electrical Observations made at
that Observatory, both in that quarter and in the one just
ended. By an examination of this journal, it appears that
during the quarter ending December 31, 1847, the electricity
of the atmosphere was never in a neutral state at Kew, ex
cepting for the short period of time in its transmission from the
one to the other state. The situation of the Observatory is in
the Old Deer Park, at Richmond, and near the river Thames.
   The electricity during the past quarter at Greenwich has
been about its usual amount at this period of the year. At
 Kew the amount has been at all times very much larger than
at Greenwich, and there does not appear to have been any
period during which the instruments were unaffected.
    During the quarter there were five exhibitions of the aurora
borealis, which occurred on the following days, viz. February
 20, 22, March 19, 20, and 31. At these times the magnets
 were disturbed.
    The approximate mean monthly temperatures for other
places besides Greenwich are shown in the tables printed in
 the Registrar-General’s quarterly report, and they differ from
 those at Greenwich by small quantities only ; those places
 situated south of Greenwich being somewhat higher, and

510         Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
those situated north of Greenwich being lower than at Green
wich, according to the difference of latitude and elevation.
   The mean monthly temperatures of the places in Cornwall
and Devonshire, in each of these three months, were above
those of other places. At Exeter, however, the values were
intermediate between those at places situated within these
counties, and those situated out of them in the same latitude.
   On March 29 a remarkable solar halo was seen from many
places in England, and in the Isles of Wight, Guernsey, and
Jersey. This halo, with its accompanying parhelia *, was well
seen, and the descriptions of the phaenomena from different
localities agree better with each other than is usually the case
with these optical phaenomena. The following are the prin
cipal facts:—
    1st. A coloured circle, whose diameter was 22°, the centre
of which was occupied by the sun; seen by all the observers.
    2nd. A colourless circle, whose diameter was 22°, the
centre of which was situated a little to the east of the sun;
seen by the observers at Guernsey and the Isle of Wight.
    3rd. A coloured arc of a circle, of which the sun occupied
the centre, whose diameter was 44°; seen at Oxford.
   4th. A large white brilliant circle, whose centre was the
zenith, passing through the sun; seen by all the observers.
   5th. There were on this circle four parhelia, two of them a
little beyond the first-mentioned circle, at its intersections with
the large white horizontal circle; these were seen by most of
the observers.
   6th. There were two parhelia opposite to the sun, the one
above, the other below him, at the intersections of the 1st and
2nd described circles; seen at Guernsey.
    7th. The 5th and 6th parhelia were white; they were placed
on the circumzenithal circle, as near as I can tell, at the points
 of intersections of a circle with a radius of 90°, with the sun
 for its centre; these were seen at Christchurch.
    8th. At the culminating point of the first-mentioned circle
 there was a bright and coloured arc, which was concave
towards the sun; this was seen at Christchurch and Oxford.
    9th. The observer at Guernseyt saw four arcs of circles,
 one situated on either side of the two first-mentioned parhelia,
 one below the parhelia mentioned in No. 6, and one near
 the parhelia situated on the circumzenithal circle in the N.E.;
 these arcs were convex towards the sun.
    10th. There were two coloured arcs of circles, convex
   [* For a description of this halo with its accompanying parhelia, as seen at
Portsea, see p. 434 of the present volume of this Journal.—ED. Phil. Mag.]
   t The appearance of the halo, as seen at Guernsey, was engraved in the
Illustrated London News of April 8, 1848.

              during the Quarter ending March 31, 1848.                                   511
towards the sun, and situated at the distance of 22° from the
circle first mentioned, the one S.E., and the other S.W. of
the sun; the latter of these was seen at Christchurch, and
both were seen at the Isle of Wight.
    At Stone, near Aylesbury, the observer saw some phaeno
mena at 3h P.M., different in some respects from those seen by
the other observers.
    1st. The upper part of the circle of 22° radius, of which the
sun occupied the centre, was seen, and the colours were vivid.
    2nd. There were segments of two circles, about 95° in ex
tent, whose diameters were both 22°, and which cut each other
vertically above the sun.                                                    -
    3rd. These segments terminated at the distance of about
 14° on each side of the sun, and at these points there were two
 bright and luminous mock suns. The one on the W. was
accompanied by a bright and long ray of light. The phaeno
 mena were visible during two hours, and an elaborate drawing
was made of the appearances.
    The whole of the papers and drawings are deposited in the
archives of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.
    The following meteorological observations made at the
 Royal Observatory at about the time of the appearance of the
 halo, are published by permission of the Astronomer Royal.

512        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
   From the circumstance of the increasing temperature during
the continuance of the halo, both evaporation and the ascend
ing current of air were increasing, and they would be at about
their maxima at about 3" P.M.     From the numbers in the 5th
column, it seems the temperature of the dew-point was be
coming less as the temperature was increasing, so that the
ascending current not only carried with it all the water then
evaporating, but also some of that which had evaporated pre
viously. It seems, therefore, highly probable, that at the time
of the appearance of the halo the largest quantity of water
was mixed with the air in its locality, and also, as at this place
the temperature of the air during the day was without change,
and probably below the freezing-point of water, that the de
gree of humidity was at the time at a maximum value.
   As this halo is one of the best ever observed, and it seems
to have been dependent upon the humid state of the air, it is
very desirable that observations of the dry and wet bulb ther
mometers taken at about the time, should be collected toge
ther from different places, and I should be glad if such were
forwarded to me.
   The reading of the barometer during the months of Fe
bruary and March have been remarkable for large fluctuations.
Although I have detailed them in the Registrar-General’s
weekly reports for these months, it is desirable to mention them
here also. On February 1, at 6" A.M., the reading was 29.505
inches; this increased to 30-274 inches by February 3, at 9" A.M.
The reading decreased day by day till the 10th, at midnight,
when it was 28'598 inches; it then turned to increase, which,
during the 11th, amounted to one inch nearly; and at noon, on
the 13th, the reading was 29.944 inches, when it turned to
decrease. On the 15th, at 3h P.M., it was 29.373 inches. On
the 18th, at 9" A.M., it was 30°333 inches, being the highest
during the month. On the 20th, at noon, it was 29-288
inches, which increased to 29-618 inches at midnight, and
continued to increase slowly afterwards till the 21st at 9" A.M.,
when the reading was 29-684 inches, after which it decreased.
On the 23rd, at 6h A.M., it was 28:888 inches; at midnight it
was 29:229 inches; shortly after this it decreased, and con
tinued to decrease till the 26th at 9h 45m A.M., when the re
markably low reading of 28.299 inches took place, a reading
lower than that of the 18th by 2-034 inches; it then turned
to increase, but did not pass the point 29 inches till midnight
on the 27th, and reached only to 29.343 inches on the 29th
at 9" A.M., when it again began to decrease, and by 6" P.M.
again decreased below 29 inches. On March 1st, at 9h A.M.,
the reading was 28°530 inches; it then turned to increase,
which during the 2nd amounted to half an inch nearly.          On

                                            -
           during the Quarter ending March 31, 1848.         513
the 4th, at 6h A.M., the reading was 30-070 inches; on the 5th,
at 6" P.M., it was 29-658 inches; on the 8th, at 9h A.M., it was
30:147 inches, which was the highest value reached during
the month. Early in the morning of the 11th, the reading
passed below 29 inches, and decreased to 28:582 inches by
11* A.M. on the 12th.     Between this time and the 14th, at
midnight, the reading increased to 29-716 inches; it then
turned to decrease, and passed the point 29 inches on the 19th
at 6" P.M., and to 28-680 inches by 6h A.M. on the 21st; at
midnight, on this day, the reading was 29-330 inches, the in
crease in the previous 12 hours having been as large as 0.79
inch; after this time the reading slowly increased to 30-000
inches by the 25th at 9h A.M. Between this time and the end
of the month, the lowest reading was 29.540 inches at mid
night on the 27th.
   Between February 9 and March 21, the reading of the
barometer was below 29 inches on parts of sixteen days; nine
of these were in February, and seven were in March. The
average reading for the whole day was below 29 inches on
ten of these days, viz. on February 9, 10, 25, 26, 27, March
1, 11, 12, 20 and 21.
   I have examined the readings of the barometer on every
day since 1800, and I find the average number of instances
in one year that these readings have been below 29 inches on
parts of a day, at the height of 150 feet, is seven. In the
years 1829 and 1832 there was no instance of the barometer
reading so low as 29 inches. In the year 1809 there were
thirteen such instances, six of which were in December. In
1816 there were sixteen cases, seven of which were in January.
In 1817 there were seventeen cases, six of which were in
March. In 1820 there were seventeen cases, twelve of which
were in October. In 1823 there were twenty. In 1824 and
1825 there were fourteen in each year; in the latter year there
were eight in November. In 1836 there were thirteen instances,
nine of which occurred in February and March ; and in
1845 there were thirteen.     Therefore there has not been any
similar instance in this century of such a succession of low
readings, as sixteen cases out of forty days. The year whose
corresponding period most nearly resembles that of the pre
sent year in these particulars, is 1836.
   The mean reading of the barometer for February and
March was 29'51 inches, being less than the mean value of
any consecutive two months in this century, with the solitary
exception of the same two months in the year 1836, whose
mean barometer reading was somewhat below that of the pre
sent year.

514       Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
   Usually a period of many years passes between two read
ings of the barometer so low as 28-3 inches. In the last
quarter I spoke of the remarkably low reading of 28'383
inches as occurring on December 7 at 3" A.M.; it will be seen
from the preceding accounts, that on February 26, at 9" 45"
A.M., the reading was lower than that in the preceding Decem
ber, being 28.299 inches. This circumstance, in addition to
the other successive low readings, render this period one of
the most remarkable in a meteorological point of view; and
an investigation of the several successive barometrical waves
would be highly instructive. The returns I have received do
not enable me to indicate the direction of motion of a single
wave. The observer at Stonyhurst says, “On February 27,
at 1" P.M., the reading of the barometer was the lowest during
the quarter, being 28. 140 inches; and during the period be
tween February 22 and March 1, the reading was always
below 28:8 inches.”
   The observer at Latimer says, “On February 3, at 9" A.M.,
the reading was 30.048 inches; on the 10th, at 3" P.M., it
was 28-556 inches; on the 18th, at 9h A.M., it was 30-182
inches; on the 26th, at 9h A.M., it was 28-096 inches; on the
29th, at 9h A.M., it was 29' 108 inches; on March 1, at 9"
A.M., it was 28:455 inches; on March 8, at 9" A.M., it was
29'974 inches; and on March 12, at 9h A.M., it was 28°442
inches.”
   The observer at Cardington says, “The following extremely
low readings of the barometer have taken place. On Febru
ary 12, at 9" A.M., it was 28-63 inches; on the 26th, at noon,
it was 28.63 inches; on March 1, at 9h A.M., it was 28-64
inches; on the 12th, at 9" A.M., it was 28.63 inches; and on
the 21st, at 9" A.M., it was 28-74 inches.”
   It appears, therefore, that the great fluctuations of the read
ings of the barometer have been general.
   The unusual meteorological character of the period which
we have just experienced, together with its influence on the
public health, makes it an object of general interest to trace
the cause of so remarkable a phaenomenon. To enable per
sons who have time at their disposal for this investigation, I
have detailed the principal meteorological facts for England
for the period, and which may be briefly mentioned as exhi
biting an excess of temperature for the six months ending 1848,
March 31, of 2°55 upon the average for the same period from
the seven preceding years, an excess remarkable both for
its amount and continuance. During the past quarter, the
amount of water mixed with the air has been about its average
value, although in consequence of the high temperature, the

            during the Quarter ending March 31, 1848.       515
 humidity of the air has been less. We have had an unusual
 prevalence of S.W., W.S.W., and S.S.W. winds at this sea
 son, when they are usually replaced by dry and cold N. and
 N.E. winds. The air has been in frequent rapid motion, and
 during the period between January 22 and March 4, it passed
 over Greenwich at the rate of 220 miles daily.
   The barometer readings have been remarkable for great
 and frequent oscillations and very low readings, exhibiting a
difference in these particulars from any period since the year
 1800 (records previous to this date I have not examined).
 The amount of rain in March was very nearly double its usual
amount; and that for the quarter exceeds the average, reck
oned from 1815 to the present time, by 2% inches. The
water-sodden state of the soil, in many parts, has prevented
wheat-sowing and preparing the land at the proper season.
The observer at Leeds says, “The rivers in the West Riding
of Yorkshire have been much swollen during February and
 March, and farming operations have, as far as relates to out
door work, been completely at a stand. Horned cattle and
sheep have suffered severely from disease of the lungs.” The
year whose corresponding period most nearly resembles that
of the present, is 1836. From the preceding remarks, it will
be seen that the weather during the past quarter has been as
unusual as that of the preceding.
   To the report of the Registrar-General are appended the
monthly values at every station, from which the average values
for the quarter have been determined, and which are contained
in the following table.
   From the numbers in the first column it seems that the vo
lume of dry air was the same at all parts of the country. The
mean of all these results is 29'512 inches, and this value may
be considered as the pressure of dry air for England during
the quarter ending March 31, 1848.          -
   From the numbers in the second column, we find for the
quarter ending March 31, 1848, that the mean temperature of
the air for the counties of Cornwall and Devonshire was 42°1,
and for the remaining places, excepting Brighton, Liverpool
and Whitehaven, was 38°-9.
   The average daily range of the temperature of the air in
Cornwall and Devonshire was 9°:2; at Brighton, Liverpool
and Whitehaven, was 6°.7; that at Brighton was 5°1 only,
and seems to be too small; at places situated between the
latitudes of 51° and 53° was 11°0, except at London, where
the range was 8°9 only; and at all places N. of 53°, was
10°-3.

Latimer, Leeds, Beckington, Aylesbury, &c., and the least
occurred at Brighton, Liverpool, Scarva, Torquay, &c.
   The highest reading during the quarter was at Greenwich
and Lewisham, which was 71°5, and the lowest was at Dur
ham, which was 8°8. The extreme range of temperature in
England, during the quarter, was therefore 67°7.
   The average quarterly range of the reading of the thermo
meter in Cornwall and Devonshire was 35°6; at Brighton,
Liverpool and Whitehaven, was 38°1; at those places situ
ated between the latitudes of 51° and 52° was 51°3; and be
tween the latitudes of 52° and 55° was 48°3.
   The mean direction of the wind was S.W.        At Exeter it
was N., but this is probably wrong.
   From the numbers in the ninth column, the distribution of
cloud seems to have been the same in amount nearly at all
parts of the country, and such as to have covered about three
fourths of the sky. The actual amount I believe to have been
  reater than three-fourths.
   The fall of rain during the quarter has greatly exceeded
the average amount for the season, and it has fallen on a
greater number of days than usual. At Highfield House, it
fell on 71 days; at Helston, on 67; at Leeds, on 63; at Fal
mouth, Truro and Saffron Walden, each 60.        The places at
which rain fell on the least number of days were Hereford,
Durham, Thwaite, Newcastle, &c. The places at which the
largest falls have taken place, are Whitehaven, Stonyhurst,
Truro, Falmouth, Helston, Derby, Newcastle, &c.; and the
places where the fall has been the least in amount, are Wal
worth, Cardington, Saffron Walden, &c.; generally the fall
has been much smaller on the east coast than on the west coast.
The average amount for the quarter in Cornwall and Devon
shire was 12 inches, at places situated between 51° and 53°
was 8-2 inches, and at places N. of 53° was 10:7 inches.
    Columns 12 to 16 contain the mean hygrometrical results,
and they are as nearly identical as can be expected from un
compared instruments. At Beckington the air seems to have
been near saturation.      At Hartwell the results cannot be
correct; these instruments, however, are to be shortly com
pared with standards. At Leeds the results are evidently
erroneous; the instruments here are to be replaced by new
ones. Omitting the results from these places, we find that the
mean weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air for England (ex
cepting Cornwall and Devonshire) in the quarter ending
March 31, 1848, was 2.7 grains. The mean additional weight
required to saturate a cubic foot of air in the quarter ending
 March 31, 1848, was 0.3 grain. The mean degree of hu

518                Notices respecting New Books.
midity in the quarter ending March 31, 1848, was 0-888.
The mean amount of vapour mixed with the air would have
produced water, if all had been precipitated at one time on
the surface of the earth, to the depth of (in the quarter endin
March 31, 1848) 3.25 inches. And these values for ë.;
and Devonshire were 2.7 grains; 0.5 grain; O'863 grain; and
3-6 inches.
   The results from the station in Ireland, depending on the
temperature of the air, the direction of the wind, and the
amount of clouds, agree with those in England at the same
latitude; but the results which depend on the humidity of the
air and the amount of rain, exhibit an excess over those in
England, and the daily and monthly ranges of the readings
of the thermometer are less than those in England.

 new nebulae, or the determination of the places of those already
 known, the detection and measurement of double stars was regarded
 as of subordinate interest, and allowed to interfere as little as possible
 with what was looked upon as the main inquiry. When nebulae were
 expected, and especially on new ground, little leisure was afforded
 for any minute examination of stars; but in regions which had been
 already examined, or where nebulae were thinly scattered, stars down
 to the sixth or seventh magnitude were seldom dismissed till they
 had undergone the application of one or more of the diaphragms.
 To have executed a regular review of the southern heavens with the
 20-foot reflector, for the purpose of detecting close double stars,
 would have required at least two additional years, probably more.
 When double stars occurred they were of course always taken, and
 a measured angle of position secured as accurate as a single rapid
 setting of the wires afforded; but excepting in special circumstances
 no close examination was made, unless some suspicion, excited under
 the ordinary sweeping power (180), induced an application of high
 magnifying powers, and in such cases it would occasionally happen
 that a long and pertinacious scrutiny took place.

   This system of observing, he thinks, may probably account in
some degree for the comparative deficiency in the catalogue of double
stars of the first or closest class, i.e. stars of which it can be con
fidently asserted that the angular distance of the individuals is under
2".    But he states, that independently of such drawbacks, although
he has no direct statistical facts to bear out the assertion, he cannot
help putting on record “a strong impression that the extra-tropical
part of the southern hemisphere is really poorer in very close double
stars than the northern, at least in those regions of it which come
to be observed on the meridian in the best seasons for definition.
The almost total absence of objects of this description from the Cata
logue in the last six hours of right ascension is the more striking, as
these are precisely the best hours for definition, coming to be ob
served from June to October, when the atmosphere is in the most
favourable condition.” Under circumstances of the best possible de
finition, when the discs were reduced to mere points, and when it
was hardly possible that an interval from centre to centre of mode
rately unequal stars exceeding three-fourths of a second, or at all
events a whole second, could escape detection, remarks of the fol
lowing kind stand recorded in the Journal:—“July 23, 1835. The
extreme paucity, or rather total absence of close double stars in the
late sweeps, in such wonderful nights and such perfect action of the
instrument, is really surprising.”—“July 24. I begin to think I shall
never see another close double star. It is wonderful how entirely
devoid of these objects are all the last sweeps, and that in the finest
picked opportunities for detecting them. It is a remarkable feature.
Eo ipso notantur quod non videntur.”—P. 166.
   The present chapter contains two Catalogues:—I. Reduced Ob
servations of Double Stars made with the 20-foot Reflector; and
II. Micrometrical Measures of Double Stars with the 7-foot Equa
torial. To the last is appended a Synopsis of the Results of the
Micrometrical Measures, and a Comparison of Angles of Position
taken with the two instruments; and the chapter concludes with
some “Special Remarks on particular Double Stars in the foregoing
Catalogues.”
   The first Catalogue includes 2103 stars, not found marked as
double in former Catalogues, and interspersed with which are a large
number which had been noted by previous observers.            The new
double stars are numbered (in continuation of the lists formerly given
by the author) from 3347 to 5449, both inclusive. Among them are
a few respecting whose double nature, owing to their extreme close
ness, doubts may be entertained. “The unnumbered stars occur for
the most part in Struve's Catalogue; some are noticed as double in the
Brisbane Catalogue, and a considerable number are identifiable with
objects described in Mr. Dunlop's Catalogue of 253 double stars, pub
lished in the third volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical
Society.” The Catalogue likewise includes such double stars (not
previously noted by other observers) as were encountered in the
course of an examination, with the equatorial, of the Brisbane Stars,
as well as those which occurred in the partial and imperfect execution

of a series of zone observations with that instrument, which he found
it impossible to carry out. In its arrangement the Catalogue is similar
to the Catalogues of double stars previously communicated by the
author to the Royal Astronomical Society. It consists of nine co
lumns, the first containing the reference-number prefixed to the
new double stars; the second and third the RA and NPD, reduced
to 1830; the fourth the angles of position; the fifth the estimated
distances; the sixth the magnitudes; the seventh notes made at the
time of the observation; the eighth references to other Catalogues
with which the stars in this may have been identified, either as single
or double stars; and ninth, the number of the sweep.         The Cata
logue occupies seventy-two pages.
    With respect to the angles of position, it is remarked that “they
are by no means to be regarded as of equal authority with the results
of an equal number of measures taken with the equatorial, for several
reasons. 1st. They are for the most part much less deliberately taken.
2nd. When taken with care, and when time has been allowed for a
repetition of measures, a peculiar bias of judgement seems in some
cases to have influenced them, which makes it necessary to be cau
tious in combining them with the equatorial measures of the same
stars. This is, no doubt, partly owing to the different position of the
person and head of the observer at the two instruments—in the one
case looking down, in the other up. To this we must add the dif
ference of inversions due to the optical construction of the two instru
ments; the achromatic operating a complete, and the reflector only
a semi-inversion. Owing to this cause the situation of the line of
junction of the two stars observed on the meridian will stand in a
 different relation to the optical bias of the eye habitually used for
observing, and thus angles obtained with the two instruments will
cease to be comparable.      As a general principle, indeed, it may be
borne in mind that no measured angle of position of a double star,
no matter with what instrument taken, can be considered free from
bias, unless their line of junction lie in the principal section of the
eye, and unless the diurnal motion be either eliminated by clock
work, or by a perfectly equable movement given by hand, a condition
tolerably well satisfied in my observations with the equatorial, by
long practice in the use of the right ascension handle, but which the
construction of the reflector rendered it almost impossible to fulfil
with any degree of exactness.”—P. 168.
    In respect of the estimated distances of the component stars, Sir
John observes, that he considers them in general too small in the
closer stars; “they are also affected by the apparent size, neatness
of definition, &c. of the stars, and are of course in a very high de
gree vague and precarious, serving for little more than general clas
sification.”
    In the Introduction to the Micrometrical Measures with the 7-foot
equatorial, some particulars are given respecting the instrument, the
building in which it was placed, and the construction of the revolving
roof. No alteration was made in the mode of mounting the instru
ment, excepting a change in the length of the polar axis necessary
                   /*

to adapt it to a different latitude; and the movement necessary for
following a star in the act of measurement was communicated, as
previously, not by a clock-work mechanism, but by a screw move
ment worked by a long handle and a Hook's joint.         As respects the
micrometer, its readings of position are stated to have been always
unexceptionable, but in regard of the distances the case was far
otherwise.    “The inherent defect of the instrument (a very costly
one), that of the hitching of the parallel spider's threads in the act of
crossing, could never be fairly overcome. It was in vain that, pre
viously to quitting England, it was placed in the maker's hands for
the express purpose of remedying this annoying evil.        For a while,
indeed, it performed satisfactorily, but the mischief soon recurred,
and grew at length so obvious a source of error, that already in
October 1834, I began occasionally to substitute for the system of
measures by cross zeros, with the spider lines, that of an absolute
zero, with one-sided measures between the inner edges of two thick
parallel wires, which have been added to the system of wires in the
micrometer, and which could be brought into the centre of the field
by the screws, to the exclusion of the spider-threads.” But this was
a less eligible mode of measurement, and gave rise to a great deal of
trouble; nevertheless, as the evil with the spider-threads continued
to increase, in April 1835 they were removed, and from this time till
June 1836 the thick wires were alone used in the measurement of
distances.    The micrometer was then refitted by Mr. Maclear, with
a pair of beautifully even and delicate threads of the Bermuda spider.
“These went on very well for some time, but in April 1837 the hitch
ing was again remarked, and from this time to the conclusion of the
observations continued a more or less frequent source of annoyance.”
   The measures of distance taken with the thick wires, when com
pared with those observed with the spider-lines, exhibit a systematic
disagreement, in consequence of which a correction must be applied
before the results by the two methods can be compared. To facili
tate the reduction, a table is computed, which gives the correction
for each second of distance from 2" to 110".         The tabular correc
tions are applied to all the measurements with the thick wires, as
part of the reductions.
   The results set down in the Catalogue are the means of the several
measures, and weights are attached, depending on the number and
presumed goodness of the observations. “Individual measures are
in no case given, excepting under some remarkable circumstance, or
if, as sometimes happens, only a single measure was procured. To
have done so would have entailed an immense mass of printing,
without any corresponding advantage.”
    “Appended to the micrometrical measures registered as the results
of single nights’ observations, is a synoptic view of the general mean
results reduced to mean epochs.”
    The Catalogue of Micrometrical Measures is arranged in ten co
lumns, giving the following particulars:—1st, the index number;
 2nd, the synonyms; 3rd and 4th, the RA and NPD for 1830; 5th
 and 6th, the angle of position and weight or value attributed; 7th

   522               Notices respecting New Books.
  and 8th, the distance and value attributed; 9th, the magnitude; and
  10th, the date of the observation. The number of stars is 1802. The
  Catalogue occupies sixteen pages, the accompanying notes eleven
  pages, and the Synoptic Table seven pages.
     The author then institutes a comparison between the angles of
  position measured with the 7-foot equatorial and the 20-foot reflector.
  He states that on comparing the results given by the two instruments,
  “material discordances will be found in a great many instances, such
  as cannot be wholly accounted for either by the comparatively greater
  attention to precision in this respect in the equatorial measures, and
  the greater time and care bestowed on them, or by the greater num
  ber of measures actually taken with the latter instrument. It is true
  that several cases of great disagreement may be perfectly well ac
 counted for in this way, when the closeness of the stars measured,
 their inequality, and even the difficulty of seeing them at all with
 the smaller instrument, are taken into account. But on subjecting
 the matter to a more particular examination, it becomes very evident
 that these causes alone are not sufficient to account for the discor
 dances, and that there exists a systematic bias, from whatever cause
 arising, which has affected all the 20-foot measurements (as com
 pared with the equatorial)—and that differently according to the dif
ferent direction of the small star with respect to the large one. What
 is more singular, and indeed, so far as I see, unaccountable, is, that
 neither the amount nor direction of this bias is the same for all the
 four quadrants of position; nor is it even the same in the same direc
 tion for positions differing by 180°.” From a comparison of results
 given by both instruments he constructs a table of reductions for
 every 10°, from 0° to 360°, exhibiting what may be called the bias
 correction to the positions measured with the 20-foot instrument, by
 the application of which a much better general accordance, and an
 even distribution of positive and negative errors were produced. He
 also remarks, that on examining with care all the cases of comparison,
 he found no distinct ground for concluding that either the magnitude
of the stars or the angular distances (when well seen and well sepa
rated) exercised any systematic influence on the angles, or on the
amount of the bias-correction.
    The details given on this subject are extremely interesting, from
their bearing on certain phaenomena of vision not yet well under
stood.    They also show how much caution is necessary in the com
parison of observations of so delicate a kind when made with different
instruments, or in a different manner; and they give a lively idea
of the numerous difficulties which were encountered in carrying out
the undertaking to a successful issue—difficulties of a harassing and
perplexing kind, which only a practical astronomer can fully appre
ciate.
    The “Special Remarks” on the measures of particular double
stars in the two Catalogues, with which the chapter concludes, relate
principally to the evidence of angular movement furnished by the
comparison of the observations. About twenty-two objects are re
marked on, but we shall confine our extracts to the two which may

be regarded as the most interesting in the present state of our know
ledge, namely, y Virginis, and a Centauri,-the former deriving its
interest from the circumstance of its being a revolving double star
which has recently been observed to pass through an important phase
of its revolution, and from the pains that have been taken to deter
mine its orbit; and the second from its being, with a single excep
tion, the only star whose distance from our system has been deter
mined with a degree of evidence which astronomers seem disposed
to regard as satisfactory and conclusive.
    The double star y Virginis was one of the first which was recog
nized as forming a revolving system, and the orbital motion is so
 considerable that the greater part of a revolution has been described
 since the relative situation of the two component stars in respect of
 the fixed circles of the sphere—the angle of position as it is called—
 was first determined. And no sooner was the fact of the revolving
 motion of the companion-star established, than it became a matter
 of the utmost interest to determine whether the motion is performed
 in an elliptic orbit, because on the solution of this question depends
 that of another, which must be regarded as one of the most interest
 ing within the range of theoretical astronomy, mamely, whether the
 Newtonian law of gravitation which governs the motions of the bodies
 belonging to the solar system prevails also among the distant stars.
    From angles of position measured by various astronomers, inclu
 ding one by Bradley in 1718, and another by Mayer in 1756, and
 assuming the Newtonian law, Sir John Herschel had computed the
 elements of an elliptic orbit in a paper communicated to the Royal
 Astronomical Society, and printed in Vol. V. of their Memoirs, which
 appeared in 1833; and in Volume VI. of the same series he gave the
 results of a second calculation of the elliptic elements, in which some
 more recent measures were included. According to the latter calcula
 tion the periodic time of revolution was about 629 tropical years, and
  the epoch of the perihelion passage the middle of the year 1834. He
  also predicted that the appulse of the two stars would prove so close
  as to cause them to appear as a single star in all but the most pow
  erful and perfect telescopes under the most favourable circumstances.
  The passage did not take place till near the middle of 1836, but the
  other part of the prediction was fully verified, the star having been
  observed for some time by Sir John himself at the Cape, and by
  Captain Smyth at Bedford, as completely round.       Sir John remarks,
  that in no part of the interval from 1835'971 to 1837-545 “was it
  possible to observe any certain elongation of the united discs with
  the 7-foot equatorial capable of being in the smallest degree relied
  on as a measure.” During the year 1836 and part of 1837 the star
  was frequently observed in the 20-foot reflector, and though an elon
  gation was sometimes fancied, the general conclusion was that the
  star was single, and perfectly round.
     Observations made subsequently to the publication of Sir J. Her
  schel's paper above referred to, showed that his elements were inca
  pable of representing the motion of the stars far beyond the limits
  for which they had been calculated; but the question having attracted

 524.               Notices respecting New Books.
much attention, various other orbits have been computed,—by Mädler,
Encke, Henderson, and Hind, and again by Sir John himself,-all re
presenting, with more or less accuracy, the observations made use of,
but differing very considerably in some respects, particularly in the
period of revolution. In the present work the periodic time is reduced
 from 629 to 182' 12 years.    Mädler's last orbit (he has calculated
four) gives 148.78 years for the periodic time, and Henderson found
 143-44 years. Sir John remarks, “Comparing the orbits which seem
entitled to most reliance, it appears certain that the eccentricity lies
between 0.855 and 0-880, the inclination between 23° and 27°, the
perihelion epoch between 1836-20 and 1836:45, and the period be
tween 140 and 190 years”.”—P. 299.
    Notwithstanding all the labour which has been expended on this
remarkable binary star, considerable doubt still remains as to the
accuracy of the computed elements, a circumstance indeed which
might be expected when we take into account the uncertainty of even
the apparently best measures. On projecting the positions measured
by different observers, for the purpose of inter-comparison, it was
apparent that those of Struve, from 1828'38 to 1834-38, could not
possibly be used with the rest of the series. “A curve drawn through
the points representing these observations separates itself gradually
and systematically from that which expresses with the utmost con
sistency and regularity the general course of the movement, as deduced
from all the other authorities, the amount of deviation reaching no
less than 9°, after which it ceases abruptly; the subsequent results
of Struve's measurements, as well as those previous to 1828, being
in good accordance with all the rest, on their whole evidence, as so
represented.”—P. 295. Sir John further states, in a note, that he
had received a series of observations from Mr. Mädler, which, when
projected separately, exhibit a systematic and regularly increasing
deviation from the projection of Mr. Dawes's and Captain Smyth's
observations of the very same nature as was exhibited by Struve's
Dorpat observations. “Facts of this kind,” he observes, “go to
prove that full confidence cannot yet be placed in any micrometrical
measures, even of position angles and in the case of easy stars (as
this is once more become); and they lead us to insist on the neces
sity of an immense accumulation of observations from a variety of
observers, and unremittingly continued for a series of years, as the
only ground of hope for the attainment of accurate elements of this
or any other double star.”—P. 299.
   The star a Centauri is “a superb double star, beyond all question
the most striking object of the kind in the heavens.” The component
stars are both of a high ruddy or orange colour, though that of the
smaller is of a somewhat more sombre or brownish cast. Together
they constitute a star which, to the naked eye, is equal or somewhat
   * For further information respecting y Virginis the reader may be re.
ferred to the second volume of Smyth's Cycle of Celestial Objects. The
first volume of the same work contains a very interesting letter from the
late Professor Henderson, explaining the method by which he deduced the
orbit from the observations.

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   525
superior in lustre to Arcturus. All observers are agreed in regarding
the principal star as of the first magnitude. Lacaille and others
down to Sir John Herschel have estimated the smaller star as of
the fourth. Sir John says his habitual judgement has inclined him
rather to the first than the second magnitude, and he is disposed to
assign to it a magnitude which may be deemed indifferently either
a very low first or a very high second. And he accounts for the very
different estimates given of its magnitude by former observers to the
known fact (whatever the cause may be) that the apparent inequality
of two stars seen at once in the same field of view diminishes as the
light of the telescope is greater.
   Among the circumstances which render this star remarkable, one
is its very great proper motion, which, according to the determination
of the late Professor Henderson, amounts to 3".58 in a year, in the
arc of a great circle. This circumstance affords in the first place a
very strong presumption that the two stars are physically connected;
for the chances may be regarded as almost infinite against the agree
ment of the proper motions of two independent stars, both in quantity
and direction; and that such agreement exists in the present case in
both respects is manifest, for if the motion of translation through
space were not common to the two stars, the one would, in the cen
tury which has elapsed since the observations of Lacaille, have left
the other behind nearly 5' in arc.
   But the existence of a large proper motion affords also a primd facie
reason for presuming the relatively greater proximity of the star to
the earth, by which the apparent motion, whether referred to the star
or to the translation of the solar system, would be increased.      The
presumption of proximity thus arising has been confirmed in the
present instance by Professor Henderson, who deduced from his
meridional observations made at the Cape an annual parallax amount
ing to about 1" of arc.    It is this circumstance which renders & Cen
tauri an object of so much interest to astronomers, for with the
exception of 61 Cygni (also double), there is no star whose distance
can be regarded as determined with the same certainty; and in the
case of the latter, the parallax, as found by Bessel, scarcely exceeds
one-third of a second.
   The micrometrical measures of a Centauri give no decided evi
dence of angular motion. Sir John however observes, that there can
be no doubt that the distance between the two stars has gone on
steadily increasing since 1822 at least. The small amount of varia
tion in the angle of position shows that the plane of the orbital mo
tion (supposing such to exist) passes nearly, but not quite, through
our system, while its actual tendency to increase exemplifies the
general law of increase of angular velocity with diminution of
distance.    He finds also, from a comparison of measures, that
the major axis of the orbit must materially exceed 24"; whence,
taking the coefficient of parallax at the amount given by Henderson,
it will follow that the real diameter of the relative orbit of the com
panion-star cannot be so small as that of the orbit of Saturn, and
exceeds in all probability that of the orbit of Uranus.

526                   Notices respecting New Books.
   Having mentioned 61 Cygni as the only other star for which a
sensible parallax can at the present time be regarded as established
with reasonable certainty, we may transcribe the following note:–
“It is impossible not to be struck with the parallel which obtains,
in a great many physical particulars, between the two double stars
& Centauri and 61 Cygni. Both consist of nearly equal stars, which
in both cases are of a colour strongly verging to red. Both have
very unusually large proper motions. Both have measurable amounts
of parallax ; and both are clearly binary systems of unusually large
apparent angular dimensions.”—P. 302.

   It is probable that few of our readers take the trouble of looking
closely into the elementary works that are annually issued for popular
instruction.     It is not an inviting occupation; and men who read
chiefly for the purpose of adding to their previous knowledge, do not
expect to derive advantage from compositions of this class. Neither
have we the least intention to urge such a practice; and it is with
some reluctance that we have entered upon our present task of calling
attention to one or two of them. As long as the public reads for
mere amusement, whether the fictions that please them be literary
or scientific, we should consider it beyond our province to discuss
the character of the works which furnish that amusement.            It
appears to us pretty much the same whether a concourse of well
dressed people frequent the opera-house, the legitimate theatre, or
the lecture-theatre of the Polytechnic Institution :-they are pleased,
and thereby better prepared for the next day's contest with the re
alities of life.
   With works relative to the subjects of our very early studies
(viewing our studies as a portion of real education) we are brought
into somewhat closer contact; yet still there is a limit to our func
tions, even under this aspect. From this limit we now depart, viz.
from the commencement of Geometry as a science. Even in this case
it is only under peculiar circumstances that we should interfere:—
when, in fact, a work comes before us that appears calculated to faci
litate the study by means of some real improvement in the develop
ment; or else when works are obtruded on the public of a pernicious
tendency, and supported by social influences that are likely to gain
for them a diffusion to which their intrinsic qualities do not entitle
them.
   Since “general education ” has become a political stalking-horse,
and the Government has laid the foundation for carrying out the
principle of “centralisation” in educating the people, there have

been several speculations made in the composition of works of an
elementary class, under the hope of the publisher's or author's influ
ence with the Educational Board being able to get them enforced by
an “Order in Council,” upon all the schools that receive aid from the
Parliamentary Fund. If our general education is to be thus con
trolled, and class-books are to be forced upon the public, it surely
becomes important that the books selected for that purpose should
be such as judicious and scientific men can approve; and not such as
are alone recommended by their price, or by the influence of their
authors with the subordinate functionaries of the Government.        We
hope that it will be rendered imperative upon the Educational Board
to appoint a commission of competent persons to decide upon the
works that shall be used in these schools; if, indeed, any such books
shall be forced upon the public by such authority, a step the wis
dom of which we strongly question. In sporting phrase, the two
works at the head of this review are the present “favourites,” and
“betting upon them is nearly equal.” It is not, then, for any in
trinsic merit they possess that we notice them at all; for in this re
spect they would be classed with the thousand-and-one abortions
that annually issue from the British press in this soi-disant “educated
age,” and they might therefore be allowed to     sink into oblivion with
the mass to which they belong.
   But when it is contemplated to give to one or other of these works
a peculiar patent (the patent of a forced sale), it becomes necessary
to analyse them with some degree of care; and under the conviction
that the Government would commit a grave mistake and a great
wrong by such an adoption of them, we feel ourselves bound to draw
the attention of our readers to the character of the works, in order
to enlist their cooperation in the prevention of a design fraught with
so much real injury to the fundamental principles of science in this
country.
   Mr. Bell tells us that his “Treatise on Geometry consists of the
usual six elementary books,” &c.; and states, further on, that their
“basis is Euclid's Elements of Geometry, as given in the improved
editions of Simson and Playfair.” He also tells us that “there
are several improvements in this edition of the six books;” that
“many additional and useful definitions have been added, which tend
to improve the language of geometry in respect to conciseness and
precision;” that “several propositions have been inserted, as being
valuable on account of their practical utility;” and that “numerous
scholia have been added, explanatory of the utility or connection of
some of the propositions.”
   Did the execution correspond to the professions of the author, this
would be no ordinary book.      The numberless logical blunders com
mitted by those who, year after year, and age after age, have under
taken the “improvement” of Euclid's Elements, would operate as a
warning to men of sound geometrical knowledge, not to be too rash
in identifying every change with an improvement.        We are bold to
 say that every change which Mr. Bell's temerity has led him to
propose, is a deterioration of the “Elements,” and a perversion of

528                Notices respecting New Books.
the essential principles of geometrical logic.   We may indeed say of
it, “whatever is good is not new, and whatever is new is not good.”
Even when he appropriates an idea, he mangles it in the expression;
as for instance in his remarks upon “mathematical taste” (Pref. xi.),
taken from Lawson, or his description of “Analysis” (p. 205), imi
tated from Leslie. Nor are his appropriations of particular processes
of demonstration materially different in their characteristic features.
    Supposing, however, that we divest this edition of all its super
fluities, and view it as a bare treatise on Geometry, we do not deem
it a safe one to follow; inasmuch as the author having adventured
upon changes in the text, and finding in his addenda the most un
questionable evidences of his heterodoxy in respect to the principles
of geometry, we should feel no confidence (without an entire collation
and careful examination of all the steps) that some of the “improve
ments” which would invalidate the argument had not been made
even here. The price we know is a temptation to schoolmasters;
but he who adopts this edition without complete assurance of its
not being vitiated, is false to the trust reposed in him. We express
no decided opinion as to the extent to which Mr. Bell has carried his
“improvements” of the general text, though we could quote a few
instances of such that we think ought to open the eyes of even offi
cial personages. We will rather turn, then, to the parts which are
professedly Mr. Bell's own contributions to Geometry; and we do
it in confidence of showing that this gentleman and his employers
were alike incompetent to presume upon any “improvements” upon
the Elements of Euclid—at least if the most complete ignorance of
the ordinary terms of geometrical science be any proof.
   First, then, his definitions. There grew up with the renovated
science of the mediaeval period, a practice of seeming to be systematic;
and this was especially evinced by an attempt to define every term.
Thus, mathematics, geometry, algebra, mechanics, and every other
branch of science was described by some circumlocutory phrases;
and this was called “definition!” Such definitions are vicious: they
are always either defective from their involving terms that have them
selves not been defined, or insignificant from their not expressing
the defined subject at all. The usual definition of mechanics falls
under the first head, from its involving the word “force;” and that
of geometry under the second, from its conveying no descriptive idea
whatever. Archimedes, we believe, attempted no definition of me
chanics; and Euclid, we are sure, attempted none of geometry.
Mr. Bell's “improvements,” however, do not go to the exclusion of
such inane practices from our books, but to the “addition of many
useful definitions.” Let us see how far a few of these fulfill his pro
mise—that they “tend to improve the language of geometry in re
spect to conciseness and precision.”
   DEF. l. “Mathematics is that branch of science which treats of
Measurable Quantity.”
    Now the “conciseness” of this passage consists of two counter
parts :--the interpolation of the metaphorical term “branch,” which
is altogether superfluous, and the elision of the term that would
                           2–

                   Notices respecting New Books.                    529
bring number into the domain of mathematics. Its “precision” con
sists in suggesting an erroneous idea of the essential character of
one-half of mathematical science, and never at all referring to the
other half. The idea of “measure" is never brought under any
aspect into theoretical geometry, such as that of Euclid; all idea of
number (and hence of algebra) is excluded from mathematics in this
definition; and it is not true that we actually measure all the quan
tities that become the subjects of mathematical investigation—as
forces, heat, &c.
   DEF. 2. “Geometry is a branch of mathematics which treats of
that species of quantity called magnitude.”
   Here again the “precision” depends upon the definition of mag
nitude: whilst its conciseness consists of the needless interpolations
of the “branch " and the “species of quantity;” and of the total
omission of two out of three of the essential characters of geometrical
magnitude, species and position.
   DEF. 3. “Magnitudes are of one, two, or three dimensions; as lines,
surfaces and solids. They have no material existence, but they may
be represented by diagrams.”
   The first part of this is “concise ’’ enough certainly; of its “pre
cision " we must leave our readers to judge, keeping in mind that
the term “dimension ” has not been defined.
   Respecting the latter part, we scarcely see how the statement of
“mathematics treating of measurable quantities,” and this branch
of mathematics treating of things which have “no material exist
ence,” are to be considered as “tending to precision of geometrical
language,” or even to precision of idea. Neither do we understand
the precision of the language which tells us that immaterial exist
ences may be “represented by diagrams.” It seems not altogether
unlike a ghost upon canvass.
   DEF. 4. “That branch of geometry which refers to magnitudes
described upon a plane, is called Plane Geometry.”
   Indeed! What, then, did the ancients call a “a solid problem *"
In our own simplicity, we have always believed that plane geometry
was the geometry which involved only the straight line and circle;
and that every problem which involved any other curve than the
circle was called a solid problem. We have never till now heard
that the conic sections (to say nothing of the higher classes of curves,
transcendental and all) were comprised by geometers in plane geo
metry. Were we to admit that Mr. Bell had any right to change
the signification of a term so universally employed in one sense to
suit his penchant for “improvement,” we should still consider his re
presentation of his own being the usual meaning, as a discreditable
imposition upon his readers.
   Mr. Bell's definition of a point is that of Professor Jardine, first
published by Playfair. It has been much eulogised: but we are not
disposed to discuss it here. We may, however, state that we con
sider the definition of Euclid to be more in keeping with Euclid's
general idea of his own system than the amended one. We would
only suggest that this definition harmonizes but strangely with Mr.
    Phil. Mag. S. 3. No. 218. Suppl. Vol. 32.          2M

530                 Notices respecting New Books.
Bell's previous definitions of mathematics and geometry; except, in
deed, he means to say that position is “a mensurable quantity,” and
yet not one of the objects of geometrical conception. Even then it
would be difficult to understand how this quantity which has no mag
 nitude is to be measured; except, again, its immateriality should aid
its mensuration.
    His definition of a line is Euclid's : but he deduces from it as a
 corollary (without showing any reason for his deduction), that “the
 extremities of a line are points; and the intersections [plural in
 the text] of one line with another are points.” Yet in the next line
 he defines straightlines as those which “cannot coincide in two points
 without coinciding altogether.” Out of this “definition ” he extracts
 Euclid's tenth axiom ; and likewise the corollary to Euclid's eleventh
 proposition as given in Simson. By what process he extracts them,
 he has not, however, condescended to inform us. It would appear that
 Mr. Bell's conceptions of the character of an axiom, a corollary, and
 a definition are all equally muddy and confused. We will try to
 ascertain presently: but we must first finish his first page.
    DEFs. 4, 5, 6. “A crooked or broken line is composed of two or
 more straight lines.
     “A line of which no part is a straight line, is called a curved line,
 a curve line or curve.
     “A convex or concave line is such that it cannot be cut by a
 straight line in more than two points; the concavity of the inter
 cepted portion is turned towards the straight line, and the converity.
 from it.”
    We have always understood the word “crooked ” to be a vulgar
 term to express that a thing was not straight, without specifying in
 what way it “divaricated from rectilinearity.” A “crooked stick”
 is generally “bowed ” (scientifically speaking, according to Mr. Bell,
 curved); a “crooked temper” is on the contrary often very “angular,”
 and sometimes “flies off at a tangent.”       A “shepherdess's crook”
is a long staff with a graceful bow at the top; a “crooked spine" is
 a portion of an inscribed polygon of a thousand sides; and a “crooked
 path in life" is one composed of ten thousand “doublings,” a few rec
 tilinear but of erratic directions, and among which some are as com
 plicated in their “doublings” as the wreath of roses which Guido
 Grandi presented to the Royal Society a century and a half ago.
 This, we suppose, is one of the “precise ’’ contributions made by
 Mr. Bell to the Geometry of Euclid, and to the intellectual progress
 of the “rising generation ” of England.         We cannot, still, bring
 ourselves to think that this is anything more than a piece of sheer
 vulgarism in reference to the study of geometry.
    Is Mr. Bell quite sure of the fact that a curve line cannot be cut by
a straight line in more points than two 2 If his assertion be correct,
let our geometry be reformed; and let his celebrated countryman,
Maclaurin, be called to account for leading even his Scottish com
patriots astray on this subject. Let Newton too be arraigned, and
Des Cartes put in the pillory. Let the mathematical world no longer
labour under the hallucination that a curve of the nth degree may

                     Notices respecting New Books.                   531
  be cut by a straight line in n points' Mr. Bell has pronounced
  his veto upon its being cut in more than two: and we must bow, on
  Governmental authority, to his decision,--that such shall, in all after
  times, be the mathematical creed of England.
     It would also seem, that besides a curve line we are to admit an
  other class of lines, the “convex " and the “concave’’ line: whilst
  it would appear that a curve line is neither the one nor the other.
  The usual mathematical criterion of convexity and concavity is to be
  laid aside (viz. the position of the centre of curvature with respect
 to the tangent), and the words “from" and “towards” with respect
 to some unspecified secant, are by some hocus-pocus system of think
 ing, to do the business for us which in the dark ages now closing
 have been only effected by means of a second differential. The mil
 lenium of science is, surely, dawning upon us at last !
     We have not picked out subjects of comment, in the shape of
 isolated passages taken apart from their explanatory context: we
 have taken a single page, and that the opening one, which in a work
 of science is the key to the whole system. We have discussed the
 first specimen that offered itself of Mr. Bell's peculiar excellence in
 “concise and precise ’ didactic composition; and our readers, should
 they (unlike the actors in the Hampden controversy) take the trouble
to read the book itself, will find that our's is no garbled version of
Mr. Bell's mathematical heterodoxy. From such a foundation in
science, what sort of a structure can be raised?        We sympathise
with the future youth of England who may have this book “to get
up; ” and we sympathize, too, with the future schoolmaster of
England who may be compelled for the sake of the “government
grant” to submit to
                    “......... rear the tender thought
                    And teach the young idea how to shoot."
    We might close here: but still it appears necessary to exhibit his
views on other matters of a still wider range than the mere defini
tions of terms.
    His idea of a PRoPosition (p. 6) is, that “it is a portion of
science, and is a theorem, a problem or a lemma.”
    Geometers, however, class propositions differently from Mr. Bell,
and substitute the “porism” for his “ lemma.” The office of a
lemma, like that of a corollary, has been altogether perverted amongst
these “improvements.”
    “A THEoREM is a truth which is established by a demonstration.”
Nothing of the kind: a theorem is a theorem independently of its
demonstration, and would be such, had no demonstration ever been
given of it. A theorem merely states that if certain conditions be
fulfilled, certain relations amongst the component parts must exist.
The name has reference to the form of the proposition only.
    “A PROBLEM either proposes something to be effected, as the
construction of a figure; or it is a question that requires solution.”
    A distinction without a difference: further than this—that the
latter form is vague as to both the§ “question” and “solution.”

532                 Notices respecting New Books.
It is rarely, if ever, used in pure geometry, except by very ignorant
or very careless writers.
    “A LEMMA ’—this requires modification to pass muster; and
more especially to justify the previous classification of theorems,
problems and lemmas.
    “A Hypothesis is a fact assumed without proof, either in the
enunciation of a proposition, or in the course of a demonstration.”
    Let him who can, interpret this:—we cannot. Mr. Bell seems to
have attempted to give a definition which should apply to what is
called an hypothesis in mathematics and to those notions which have
borne the same name in physics:—A good illustration of the old
English proverb respecting “two stools.”
    “A corolLARY is a consequence easily deduced from one or more
propositions.”
    The ancients understood a corollary to be a distinct and separate
enunciation of some property which was discovered, or contained in,
the demonstration of another proposition. The moderms use the
word more loosely; and we will give Mr. Bell the advantage of the
practice.
    “A scholium is a remark on one or more propositions, which
explains their application, connection, limitation, extension, or some
other important circumstance in their nature.”
    The ancient geometers had no scholia in this or any other sense.
The “connections and limitations” were parts of the actual solu
tion; and are known amongst geometers worthy of the name, in
modern times, under the general title of “determinations.” The
mere statement of particular circumstances relating to the history
or collateral relations of particular propositions was introduced by
the commentators of the middle ages. The slovenly practice of
throwing out mere hints about those determinations and limitations
which are partly seen and partly guessed at, amongst modern writers
deserves to be strongly condemned, whether they take the form of
corollaries or of scholia. They, however, enter more largely than
usual into Mr. Bell’s “improvements:” but whether it be intended
 for “conciseness” or “precision ” we do not pretend to determine.
    “A DEMonstration is a process of reasoning, and is either direct
or indirect. A direct demonstration is a regular process of reasoning
 from the premises to the conclusion. An indirect demonstration
 establishes a proposition, by proving that any hypothesis contrary to
it, is contradictory or absurd.”
    Here, unfortunately, the terms “premises,” “conclusion,” “pro
 position” and “process of reasoning” are employed pretty much as
 if the words had been showered out of a pepper-box, or made up of
 printers’ pie, to take their chance of a possible meaning. The same
 confusion runs through the following:—
    “The DATA or PREMIses of a proposition are the relations or con
 ditions granted or given, from which new relations are to be deduced,
or a construction to be effected.”
    The “or” in this passage has either the force of signifying that
the words or phrases on each side of it are identical in signification;

                     Notices respecting New Books.                          533
or that the leading terms refer to the problem and the subsequent to
the theorem:—both being propositions. The first supposition is
too novel a mode of interpretation, we should suppose, even for
Mr. Bell in his rage for “improvements in conciseness and precision:”
and we will, for the sake of trying to make something out of it, se
parate the definition into its two cases.
   “The data of a problem are the          “The premises of a theorem
relations granted, from which new       are the conditions given, from
relations are to be deduced.”           which a construction is to be
                                        effected.”
   Was there ever such monstrous absurdity palmed upon a govern
ment, and that government call it geometry P. But this is not all :
though we must hasten forward.
   “Synthetic geometry, or the ordinary didactic method, affords in the gra
dual exposition of geometrical truth, excellent specimens cf the most clear
and satisfactory reasoning; and that branch of it called geometrical analysis,
affords, in addition, examples of the resolution of truth into its simple elemen
tary principles. But analytical geometry and the other analytical branches of
the science º       the best examples of the resolution of compler questions—
a process which must be effected before the conditions can be comprised in
symbolical expressions; they [who? or what?] also accustom the mind to
comprehensive views, and afford excellent specimens of subtle reasoning;
º    exercise the mind in the interpretations of the final result.”—Preface,
p. 9.
    Geometrical analysis a “branch" of geometrical synthesis : Why
not geometrical synthesis a “branch” of geometrical analysis? Not
only the ancients, but the moderns without a single exception, till
Mr. Bell created one, have considered analysis and synthesis to be
co-ordinate with each other. This new “northern-light” has de
creed that the ancients and moderns were alike wrong: that the term
synthesis shall no longer be considered to signify “composition,”
nor analysis “resolution.”         D'Alembert, indeed, introduced the
general use of the term analysis to signify algebraic resolution, from
the fact, that the majority of algebraic processes was analytical ;
and in conformity with his view, the works in which geometry
was treated by means of algebra after the fashion of Des Cartes,
were called treatises on analytical geometry. Then Mr. Bell, who is
evidently as confined in his reading as he is confused in his thinking,
comes forward with a grand discrimination between synthetic geo
metry and analytical geometry: which we venture to predict will by
some future Montucla eternalize his memory as a splendid instance of
ignorant temerity and impudent self-sufficiency. The entire para
graph is one tissue of blunders and mis-statements, that would be
unpardonable in a mere boy who had received a respectable course
of elementary mathematical instruction. Nor does his description of
geometrical analysis in the body of the work itself at all redeem him
from the charge.
   “Def of GeoMETRical ANALysis.-In the method of Geometrical Ana
lysis, the process of demonstration follows an order the reverse of that ob
served in the ordinary Synthetic Method. The latter method proceeds

 534                  Notices respecting New Books.
 from established principles, and, by a chain of reasoning deduces new prin
 ciples from these ; the former proceeds from the principles that are to be
 established considered as known, and from these, taken as premises, arrives,
 by reversing the chain of reasoning, at known principles. The latter
 method is the didactic method used in communicating instruction; the
 former is rather employed in the discovery of truth.”—P. 205.
    It may be as well to remark, once for all, that though the descrip
 tion of geometrical analysis given by Pappus does certainly admit
 (rather by implication than by direct statements) of the belief that the
 ancients did apply the analytical method to the discovery of the de
 monstration of theorems, yet its principal use was to trace the re
 lations between the data and quaesita of problems, so as to deduce a
 method of constructing them.          We may likewise inform Mr. Bell,
 and such as him (if indeed such there be), that the details of an
 analytical process in the two cases had so great a dissimilarity in
 everything but the one general idea, as to be incapable of description
 in the same form of expression. The analysis of a theorem indeed
 differs but little from Euclid's reductio ad absurdum :—merely, in fact,
 in assuming the conclusion to be true instead of false. The reason
ing ended in the deduction of a known truth, instead of the contra
diction of one. As, however, Mr. Pott's has very clearly explained
the analysis of theorems and of problems in the Appendix to his
Euclid (8vo ed.), we shall refer to that valuable tract instead of
quoting it at length here.
    We shall only quote two other examples of Mr. Bell's method of
improving geometry. Concise enough they are: but the “perspi
cuity” is beyond our power of detecting.
   “Def. PLANE Loci. If the position of a point is determined by certain
conditions; also, if every point in some line, and no other point, fulfill
these conditions, the line is said to be a locus of the point.
   “As a simple illustration of a locus, consider that of a point which is
always equally distant from a given point. This is obviously a circle, whose
radius is equal to that distance. So the locus of a point which is always
equally distant from a given straight line, is a line parallel to it, and at a
distance equal to the given distance."—P. 207.
   “ Def. Poris Ms.-A porism is a proposition of an indeterminate nature,
such that an indefinite number of quantities must fulfill the same conditions.
As a simple example of a porism, let it be required to find a point such, that
all straight lines drawn from it to the circumference of a given circle shall
be equal. This point is evidently the centre of the circle. Problems of
loci and porisms are in many cases convertible. The preceding problem be
comes a problem of the latter [form PJ kind when the centre is given, and
it is required to find the locus of all the points that are at a given distance
from it.”—P. 208.
    Mr. Bell is not the only one who has blundered about the
“ porisms;” but he is, we think, the only one who has blundered
quite so egregiously. His description amounts to nothing, except a
complete proof that he does not understand what a porism is. But
supposing that he understood the subject ever so well, can anybody
but himself think that the two definitions quoted above (plane loci
and porisms) are adequate to give a learner the slightest conception

                     Notices respecting New Books.                     535
  of the mode, to use Mr. Bell's expression, of “solving problems of
  loci and porisms?” He indeed puts down thirteen loci, either theo
  rems or problems, as “Exercises,” and three porisms; all clearly
  taken from Leslie's Geometrical Analysis: but not a single example
 of the method, or a single hint for the student's guidance, is vouch
 safed. And this is Messrs. Chambers's “Geometry for the People !”
 This book is one of the candidates for being adopted by the Educa
 tional Committee of the Privy Councill!
     We had almost forgotten the rival work, Mr. Tate's; and, for
 tunately, it will require much less space to give it all the notice it de
 serves. He makes no parade of “improving Euclid's Elements” like
 Mr. Bell, nor does he flourish about analysis and synthesis, or plane
 loci and porisms. His preface is candour itself; and there is no possi
 bility of supposing him to be apparently aiming at one thing, and
 really aiming at another. He simply, with a passing compliment,
 consigns Euclid to oblivion, and “to persons who are already mathe
 maticians” (Pref. p. vii.); and he supplies a substitute founded on the
 principles of “common sense,” “graphic interest,” “tracing the
 origin of our ideas in geometry,” the use of instruments, the evidence
 of sight and touch, and an endless amount of that kind of jargon
 which old ladies call “twaddle.” As to the “artificial verbiage of
 a technical logic,” and the “tedious verbiage of a rigorous demon
 stration,” they are left for the amusement of those who have nothing
better to do than to become “mathematicians,” and “who can enter
into its metaphysical subtleties.”
    Mr. Tate seems to understand the constitution and practice of de
partmental boards, in respect to books, very clearly. He knows full
well that the influence of a preface is wonderful upon the people who
usually sit at those boards; and, indeed, that the book itself is
scarcely ever looked into for the verification of the professions made
in the preface. Now Mr. Tate's English composition is very far
above mediocrity; and his prefaces are in general very elaborately
and ably written. The present, however, is not the best of them
that we have seen; but there was this difficulty in the way. He
had a delicate part to play in persuading our hypothetical Board,
that though Euclid's Elements possessed every other perfection that
could be named, yet the all-important one of being adapted to the
requirements of the Board was wanting in Euclid, and completely
fulfilled in Tate.   Euclid is enshrouded in his own clouds of great
ness and vastness of conception, such that every-day people cannot
read him : but Tate shines with his own bright, steady, familiar
light, so that “he who runs may read,” and he who reads cannot fail
to understand 1 Mr. Tate is modesty personified—modesty denuded
of all conventional investiture. However, let him speak for himself
with respect to Euclid.
   “However, it must be conceded, that whatever may be its excellences
as a book of reference to the mathematician, its defects, as an initiatory
system of geometry, are too apparent to admit of even an apology. A great
book is, in many respects, a great evil; the very elements constituting its
greatness, its refinement and comprehensiveness, tend to throw over it

536                  Notices respecting New Books.
an air of mystery and dignity, which distracts and overawes the uninitiated
student, in the place of giving him that encouragement and sympathy, which
he certainly requires, in his first feeble efforts in the pursuit of abstract
knowledge. The geometry of Euclid is a highly artificial system, which
can only be read, thoroughly, by a person who is already a mathematician,
and who can enter into its metaphysical subtleties, and beautiful yet operose
demonstrations. The principle of motion gives a simplicity and clearness
to many geometrical conceptions, but from an imagined inconsistency in
the use of such a method, Euclid employs it neither for the purpose of
demonstration nor illustration. The method of superposition, which in
reality lies at the very basis of geometrical demonstration, and, in many
cases, gives a graphic interest to an investigation, is employed in the fourth
proposition of his first book, and then, as if ashamed of the lowly origin of
geometry, he scarcely uses it afterwards. Many of his problems are solved
by methods which are never used in practice; for example, when a given
portion is to be cut off from a straight line, instead of supposing the given
portion to be simply transferred to, or placed upon the straight line, &c.,
which we really do in practice, Euclid must describe circle after circle, in
order to accomplish the problem. The doctrine of similar triangles is, un
questionably, one of the most important propositions in the whole range of
geometry, yet the student is not permitted to understand this proposition,
until he has gone through the fifth book, which, to a large class of students,
must for ever remain a sealed book. It is desirable that practical men
should comprehend the leading propositions in solid geometry; but Eu
clid's method of treating this subject is so operose and refined as to place
it beyond the reach of persons whose time for study is limited, or whose
mathematical talents are not of a superior order.”—Preface, pp. vii. viii.
    Now we have no hesitation in saying (and we say it to those who
are able to judge whether we are right or not) that there is not one
single assertion in this long extract which is not directly false, or
else so gross a perversion of the truth as to be false under the ordi
nary meaning of the terms employed. We do not think the perver
sion was deliberate, but the result of total misconception : a perver
sion of the intellect rather than of the moral sense.         He is an enthu
 siast in the cause of “common sense;” and he has only exercised

     The author, under whose immediate superintendence the whole of
 the magnetical and meteorological observations taken at the Royal
 Observatory at Greenwich have been conducted, by direction of

 various tabular results deduced from the meteorological observations,
 reserving for future notice those deduced from the magnetical series.
 His chief object has been to determine the corrections which are
 applicable to the results obtained by different observers at various
 times, so as to render them comparable with one another.            The
 barometrical and thermometrical observations here recorded have
 been made at every hour of Gottingen mean solar time, during the
 whole of five years, namely, from the end of 1840 to that of 1845.
 The mean of each hour represents the results deduced from about
 150 observations; those for each month represent about 1800 ob
 servations; and those for the year represent upwards of 21,000 ob
 servations of each element.
    Tables are given representing the excess of the mean value of each
 element at every hour of observation, in every month, above the mean
 value for the month; and also the mean of the numbers so found,
 arranged for the different years, and likewise for the same hours in
 every month. The numbers were then laid down on paper, as ordi
 mates to a curve of which the times were the abscissae, and a curve
 passed through, or very near each point; and the ordinates at every
 Greenwich hour were measured from that curve, and their values
 given in a table. The accordance of the results thus obtained for
 the same hours in the same months of the different years is very
close and satisfactory; and shows that observers may obtain very
valuable approximate results, by taking a comparatively small num
ber of observations in each day at hours by no means inconvenient
in ordinary life, furnishing a close approximation to the mean and
extreme values, as well as to the diurnal and annual variations of
atmospherical phenomena.
   March 9 and 16.—“Report of Experiments made on the Tides in
the Irish Sea; on the similarity of the Tidal phenomena of the Irish
and English Channels; and on the importance of extending the ex
periments round the Land's-End and up the English Channel.”
Embodied in a letter to the Hydrographer, by Captain F. W.
Beechey, R.N., F.R.S. Communicated by G. B. Airy, Esq., F.R.S.,
Astronomer Royal.
   The author commences by stating, that the set of the tides in the
Irish Sea had always been misunderstood, owing to the disposition
to associate the turn of the stream with the rise and fall of the water
on the shore. This misapprehension, in a channel varying so much
in its times of high water, could not fail to produce much mischief;
and to this cause may be ascribed, in all probability, a large proportion
of the wrecks in Caernarvon Bay.
   The present inquiry has dispelled these errors, and has furnished
science with some new and interesting facts.        It has shown that,
notwithstanding the variety of times of high water, the turn of the
stream throughout the north and south Channels occurs at the same
hour, and that this time happens to coincide with the times of high
and low water at Morecombe Bay, a place remarkable as being the
spot where the streams coming round the opposite extremities of
Ireland finally unite. These experiments, taken in connexion with

                               Royal Society.                        539
those of the Ordnance made at the suggestion of Professor Airy,
show that there are two spots in the Irish Sea, in one of which the
stream runs with considerable rapidity, without there being any rise
or fall of the water, and in the other the water rises and falls without
having any perceptible stream ; that the same stream makes high and
low water in different parts of the channel at the same time; and
that during certain portions of the tide, the stream, opposing the
wave, runs up an ascent of one foot in three miles, with a velocity of
three miles an hour.
   The author then enters minutely into the course of the stream;
shows that the point of union of the streams from the opposite chan
nels takes place on a line drawn from Carlingford through Peel in the
Isle of Man on to Morecombe Bay; and concludes his remarks on
this part of the subject, by adverting to the great benefit navigation
will derive from the present inquiry.
   The author then notices a chart of lines of equal range of tide,
which has been compiled partly from the ranges published by the
Royal Society”, and partly from observations made on the present
occasion; and has annexed a tablet, by the aid of which the seaman
will be able to compare his soundings taken at any time of the tide
with the depths marked upon the Admiralty charts.
   Next follows the mention of a feature in the motion of the tide
wave, which Captain Beechey thinks has hitherto escaped observation;
viz. that the upper portions of the water fall quicker than the lower,
or in other words, that the half-tide level does not coincide with the
place of the water at the half-tide interval; that this difference in
the Bristol Channel amounts to as much as four feett, and that the
law seems to be applicable to all the tides of the Irish Sea S.
   We are next presented with a table (No. 5) exhibiting the various
curves assumed by the tide-wave, and with the durations of the ebb
and flood at each place.
   Having explained these observations in the Irish Sea, the author
proceeds to apply to the tides of the English Channel the law which
he found to regulate the stream of the Irish Channel, availing himself
of the observations of Captain M. White and others for this purpose.
There was no difficulty in adapting the rule in the upper part of the
Channel; but below the contraction of the strait, the apparent dis
cordance was so great, that nothing but a reliance on the general
accuracy of the observations prevented the inquiry being abandoned.
   It seemed that the streams are operated upon by two great forces,
acting in opposition to each other; viz. that there is a great offing
stream setting along the western side of the British Isles, and flowing
in opposition to the tides of the Channel above the contraction, turn
ing the stream with greater or less effect as the site is near to, or
removed from, the points of influence. By pursuing this idea, it was
immediately seen that the observations in the English Channel re
spond to it; and then applying it to the offing of the Irish Sea, and
considering that channel to comprise within its limits the Bristol
    * Philosophical Transactions, 1836, part 1.  † Table X.

Channel, as the English Channel does the Gulf of St. Malo, it was
found that the observations there also fully bear out the idea. So
that there was afterwards but little difficulty in tracing the course of
the water, and bringing into order what before appeared to be all
confusion.                 -
   The author then traces the great similarity of tidal phenomena
of the two channels, and proceeds to describe them. For this pur
pose he considers the Irish Channel as extending from a line con
necting the Land's End with Cape Clear to the end of its tidal stream,
or virtual head of the tide at Peel; and the English Channel from a
line joining the Land's End and Ushant, to the end of its tidal stream
off Dungeness. With these preliminary lines, he shows that both
channels receive their tides from the Atlantic, and that they each
flow up until met by counter-streams; that from the outer limit of
the English Channel to the virtual head of its tide the distance is
262 geographical miles; and in the Irish Channel, from its entrance
to the virtual head of its tide, it is 265 miles.
   In both channels there is a contraction about midway; by Cape
La Hague in the one, and by St. David's Head in the other, and at
nearly the same distance from the entrance. In both cases this con
traction is the commencement of the regular stream, the time of the
movement of which is regulated by the vertical movement of the
water at the virtual head of the channel; situated in both cases 145
miles above the contraction, and the actual time of this change,
or Vulgar Establishment, is the same in both cases, Below the con
traction of the strait, in both cases the stream varies its direction
according to the preponderance of force exerted over it by the offing
stream.    In both cases, between the contraction and the southern
horn of the channel, there is a deep estuary (the Bristol Channel and
the Gulf of St. Malo) in which the times of high water are nearly
the same, and where, in both, the streams, meeting in the channel,
pour their waters into these gulfs, and in both raise the tide to the
extraordinary elevation of forty-seven feet.      From the Land's End
to the meeting of these streams in one case is seventy-five miles, and
in the other the same.
   In one channel, at Courtown, a little way above the contraction,
and at 150 miles from the entrance, there is little or no rise of the
water; and in the other, about Swanage, at the same distance from
the entrance, there is but a small rise of tide also (five feet at springs).
In both cases these spots are the node or hinge of the tide-wave, on
either side of which the times of high water are reversed.              And
again, near the virtual head of the tide, in both cases there is an in
creased elevation of the water on the south-east side of the channel
of about one-third of the column; the rise at Liverpool being thirty
one feet, and at Cayeux thirty-four feet
   The author traces a further identity in the progress of the tide
wave along the sides of both channels opposite to that of the node.
In the first part of the channel the wave in each travels at about
fifty miles per hour; in the next, just above the node, this rate is
brought down to about thirty miles per hour in one, and to sixteen

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              541
miles in the other; it then in both becomes accelerated, and attains
to about seventy-six miles per hour.
   Lastly, the author observes that the node or hinge of the tide,
placed by Professor Whewell (in his papers on the Tides) in the
North Sea, is situated at the same distance nearly from the head of
the tide off Dungeness, as the node near Swanage is on the opposite
side of it; and that in the Irish Channel, at the same distance nearly
as the node at Courtown is from the head of the tide off Peel, there
is a similar spot of no rise recently observed by Captain Robinson.
   The author concludes this paper by urging a further investigation
of the tidal phenomena of the English Channel, on the ground of the
great advantage navigation, as well as science in general, would de
rive from such an examination.                             -

   ON THE ADVANTAGE OF ELECTROTYPING DAGUERREOTYPE

rTh;       following simple experiment, demonstrating the advantages
       of electrotyping Daguerreotype plates, may be interesting to
many of your readers, but more especially to amateurs in that beau
tiful art.
   Purity of silver for the plates has always been much insisted on ;
and of the various means that have been resorted to to obtain this,
the battery process offers the most simple as well as the most satis
factory means of accomplishing it.
   Prepare a plate for silvering; but in the place of depositing elec
trotype silver over the whole face of the plate, only permit the de
posit to take place over one-half, by immersing the plate only half
way in the decomposition trough. [With a one quart Smee's battery,
one minute will be sufficient.]     Finish the plate afterwards on re
moving it from the battery in the usual way, as when preparing it
to receive the sensitive coating; and when “cross buffed,” it will
be perceived, on examining the surface, how much blacker and more
brilliant is the polish on the electrotyped silver half, the remaining
half appearing by contrast quite greasy. The importance of this
depth of black will at once be appreciated, when it is remembered
that it is the black burnish of the silver which forms the dark por
tions or blacks of the Daguerreotype picture. If the plate thus
prepared be now made sensitive and placed in the camera, it will be
found that the electrotype half has also an advantage in sensitiveness,

the same result.

        ON THE ACIDS OF PINES.          BY M. AUG. LAURENT.
   Pinic and sylvic acids were first analysed by M. Rose, who gave as
their formula C40 Hº O4, their salts being represented by C40 H6+
O++ M2 O.       More recently M. Liebig has shown that sylvic acid
contains C40H80 O*, and M. Laurent states he has found that pinic
acid has the same formula.
   M. Laurent, on examining six or seven years since the resin which
flows from the Pinus maritima of the heaths of Bordeaux, met with
a new acid which he called pimaric acid, and which possesses the
same composition as the preceding. When pimaric acid is distilled
in vacuo, it is converted into pyromaric acid, without change of com
position; and eventually this same acid, when crystallized and left to
itself, undergoes an isomeric modification, and is converted into
amorphous uncrystallizable pimaric acid.
   The salts of all these acids are represented by the following for
 mula, C40 Hºo O' + Mº O, which does not agree with opinions en
 tertained by the author and M. Gerhardt.
    These salts should contain, either C40 H38 M2 O4, or C40 H62 M2
 O”; the salts examined by MM. Rose and Laurent are those of sil
ver and lead. As it would have been difficult in a fresh analysis of
 these salts to determine whether they contain Hº O more or less, the
 author endeavoured to ascertain whether the preceding acids, on
 combining with anhydrous oxides, did or did not disengage water.
 For this purpose pulverized sylvic and pimaric acids were mixed with
 recently fused and pulverized litharge. The mixture, introduced into
 a glass drying vessel, was heated in a current of dry air; a small
 quantity of water, amounting to about one-third of an atom, was
 disengaged. Presuming that the contact of the acid and the oxide
 was not sufficient, a little aether was poured on the mixture, and it
 was heated to 284°F.
       1.000 gramme of fused pimaric acid lost 0.028 of water.
       1'000 gramme of fused sylvic acid lost 0-034 of water.
       1'000 gramme of fused pimaric acid, heated alone to 284°F., lost
         1 milligramme.
       1'000 gramme of fused sylvic acid, heated alone to 284°F., lost
         2 milligrammes,

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               543
the loss should have been 3:00. The salts of the preceding acids
ought to be represented by C40 Hºs M2 O*, or by C20 H29 M O2.
   It is stated in chemical works, that sylvic acid crystallizes in four
sided tables, and as pyromaric acid crystallizes in isosceles triangular
tables, the author has considered it as a different acid from the pre
ceding; but having an opportunity of seeing sylvic acid, the author
found it possessing the same form as pyromaric acid, and M. Mit
scherlich made the same observation.
   Pimaric acid is the natural acid which flows from Pinus mari
tima. When it is heated for the purpose of separating the oil of
turpentine, a resin remains which is usually a mixture of pimaric
and sylvic acids. As to amorphous pimaric acid, it is possibly iden
tical with pinic acid, if the latter be actually uncrystallizable in
alcohol.
   It becomes then requisite to examine the resins which flow from
other species of pines, to determine whether they contain pimaric or
sylvic acid, or whether the latter is not a product of the action of
heat upon the former.         As to pinic acid, it must also be examined
whether it exists in the fresh resins of the pines, or whether it is
derived from a modification of pimaric acid, by the agency of time.
   It is to be remembered that crystallized pimaric acid is con
verted either into amorphous acid, or pinic acid by the influence of
time, whereas the acid which has been fused undergoes no modifica
tion. When pimaric acid is very pure, it may partly crystallize,
after having been fused ; if ten grammes be operated on, it assumes
a granular appearance like sugar; when a smaller quantity is em
ployed, it remains transparent and vitreous on cooling.
   The author states, that the acid which crystallizes from alcohol,
dissolves in about ten times its weight of this liquid, whereas the
same acid, when fused and then powdered, immediately dissolves in
its own volume of alcohol, but almost directly separates from it, and
becomes the crystallized modification, soluble in 10 parts of alcohol.
   Pimaric acid, crystallized by fusion, acts with alcohol nearly in
the same way as the acid which has been crystallized in it.
   Nitromaric Acid.—M. Laurent formerly gave the name of azomaric
acid to a product which he obtained by treating pimaric acid with
boiling nitric acid for a long time; and he has repeated the experi
ment, continuing the ebullition for only seven or eight minutes. The
product washed with water, then dissolved in alcohol and precipi
tated by water, gave by analysis similar results to those obtained in
the first operation:—

   This acid is yellow, amorphous and resinous; by heat it softens,
fuses and decomposes. Its ammoniacal salt, which is very soluble,
dries in transparent plates of an orange-red colour; the salt of lead,
which is slightly soluble in alcohol, contains 32-8 to 33°4 of lead.

    As the salt of lead deflagrates slightly when heated, and as the
 nitromarates are yellow, the nitrogen must be in the state of hypo
 nitric acid NO2 = X. Nitromaric acid then becomes C*H*X" O*,
 derived from C* H56 OS.

                              Nitromaric acid C10 H52 X* O2+ O.6 bibasic.
     It appears that under the influence of nitric acid, pimaric acid first
 exchanges H* for O2, then absorbs two more atoms of oxygen, be
 coming bibasic maric acid (hypothetical). The latter afterwards ex
 changes H* for its equivalent X’, and is converted into nitromaric
 acid.    The preceding formulae, unfolded, become

                 ACTION OF ZINC ON SELENIOUS ACID.
     M. Woehler remarks, that zinc does not act with selenious acid as
  it does with sulphurous; some selenium is reduced, and there is
  obtained an acidulous selenite of zinc.                      The solution of this salt,
  when evaporated in vacuo, yields large yellow crystals, which are
  modified rhombic prisms. It yielded by analysis,'—

      This salt is unalterable by the air, very soluble in water, and has
  a strong acid reaction: when heated the solution becomes turbid,
  selenious acid is disengaged, and a colourless neutral powder of sele
  nite of zinc is deposited, which by long boiling redissolves.—Journ.
