I.  The Foundations of Dynamics. By OLIVER LoDGE, F.R.S.,
     Professor of Physics in University College, Liverpool*.
                   PART    I.—The Nature of Arioms.
 IT has is a matter of congratulation with me that a critic who
            devoted so much thought to Newton's laws of motion
and similar fundamental doctrines should have begun a dis
cussion of my papers on the subject of Energy; and               I  shall
willingly consider his objections in order to see what modifi
cations, if any, should be made in my original statements.
#.
 But Dr. MacGregor's temporary attitude towards Physical
             is exhibited rather strikingly in a treatise on “The
   undamental Hypotheses of Abstract Dynamics,” which he
   ublished as a Presidential Address to a section of the Royal
   ociety of Canada (Transactions 1892). Hence, before replying
 to his criticisms on my writings, as made in your February
 issue, page 134,     I should like to make a few general observa
 tions  suggested    by  this other deliverance of his, so as to indi
 cate what seem to me the rather different points of view from
 which we, or if not we some other writers, approach these
 fundamental doctrines of Mechanics and Physics.               The dif
 ference in attitude may be briefly summarised thus:—Some
 philosophers seek to advance truth by detecting or inventing
 complications in what was apparently simple ; whereas others

it contains an element of truth it has reference to no personal
detail, as it seems to me, but to a difference in type; and                                                                         I

 very highest order who are above classification, may be said

 categories*.      Each type of mind performs                 service, and                            its

     The well-known other objection, that a statement of the first
law is unnecessary because it is only a special case of the second,
rests on a different footing. Thomson and Tait have pointed out
that it acts as a definition of equal intervals of time.           Prof.
 MacGregor denies that the first law gives us any more useful
definition of time than the second does; but seeing that every
clock is an attempt at a uniform mover, and that the second
law is concerned with the more complex notion of accelera
tion rather than with the simple idea of velocity,               do not                                   I

10                              Prof. Oliver Lodge on
 can be dissected bit by bit without ceasing to be a system
 within the scope of the first law, it follows that no stress can
contain an unbalanced force or couple.
   If the law be doubted for the case of a pair of bodies attract
ing each other from a distance, Newton says” (virtually):—
Jam the bodies apart with a rigid obstacle, then you have re
duced their action to contact action; and since you have a
balanced stress at each point of contact, and likewise between
the ends of the introduced obstacle, it follows that the attract
ing forces of the distant bodies are also balanced.
   Now Dr. MacGregor's objections are (1) that Newton’s
proof only aims at extending the law from contact action to
actions across a distance, while for contact action he is con
tent to assume it as an axiom or to verify it by experiment;
and (2) that the proof breaks down for a particle or single
 body which cannot be analysed into parts.
    It is quite possible that Newton thought it best to state his
 third law as an axiom ; because the fact that the centre of
mass of a complex system of bodies obeys the first law is
hardly an experience that can be confidently appealed            even                        to,
though       all
              the bodies are       contact. That fact and the third
                                       in
law are intimately connected, but whichever           the simpler had

tion from it.      Thus the centre of mass statement follows
from the third law, and           very likely Newton preferred
                                       so                                                               to

the operations of Life), it will be very well to overhaul our

     The Conservationof Energy and Universal Contact-action.
   The ground is now clear, I think, for a reply to Professor
MacGregor's criticism, as made in the Phil. Mag. (vol. xxxv.
p. 134) for February 1893; and incidentally I may hope to
answer or at least discuss the matter with some other critics,
notably Mr. Heaviside in his paper in the Phil. Trans. 1892.
   The first objection is that in my definition of energy                                                      I
assume the ordinary law of conservation, because           sa                                       I
in an early paper (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1879, viii. p. 278), “When
ever work is done upon a body, an effect is produced in it
which is found to increase the working-power of that body
(by an amount not greater than the work done); hence this
effect is called energy, and it is measured by the quantity of
work done in producing it.”          “The words ‘is found,’” says
Dr. MacGregor, “indicate an appeal to experience.” Most
true, so they do.      My position is this:—Before making any
definition it is desirable and only civil to show the reasonable
                               statement out without preamble
                                                                                                             or a or

the body in which it was generated, it still exists in other
bodies in undiminished quantity, and so is capable of trans
ference and retransference, by means of activity, and activity
alone, for ever.
    But how is such a wide-sweeping statement to be justified ?
Not by any hasty appeals to experience, not even by the
laborious researches of a Joule. Such experiments can indeed
examine the obviously weak places and can show that there
is no manifest flaw there, that                   the apparent flaws dis  all
appear         oncloser inspection, and,            far     can       seen,   so         as             be                    do

I       hold that      can be deduced from Newton's third law and
                          it
from the denial             action of       distance, thus :—Bodies can

 versal contact-action.
    Of course the believer in action at a distance is not at a
 loss: in order to retain his fiction he has invented another
unreality, which he calls possible energy.              He says (truly
enough for many purposes) that when a stone is raised from
the earth a great deal more work is done on the stone than on
the earth; and hence that, although at every instant the stone

potential energy, and it is the means of communicating it to the
thing to be driven, but it is not itself energetic, any more than
the chain and ratchet-wheel which helped to wind it up were
energetic. Or, to take another example, it is like the piston

pressed, and it might be (though it is not usually) employed

to the gas molecules—and, further, that the molecules which
are in motion are not the same as those which are under strain.
The energy, that is the portion of energy concerned with the
            amount of activity contemplated, is continuously
 eaving the molecules recovering from strain and transferring
itself to those in accelerated motion, and as continuously
leaving those in retarded motion and transferring itself to
those acquiring strain".
   Further to avoid misconception it is necessary to admit
distinctly that in speaking of the pressure-energy of a mass
of gas we are subjecting ourselves to an unnecessary though
convenient limitation.   It is chosen as an example just because
so much is known about it; it would have been easy to choose
elastic solid examples, where the elastic stress is not so readily
analysable, and where the idea of potential energy and the
statistical grouping of a mass of molecules was not optional
but necessary, in our present state of ignorance.       know well                                    I
enough that the pressure of gas in a reservoir is really due to
the motion of the particles, and      am willing freely to con       I
template the case of Davy’s “repulsive motion,” no real
contact or elastic impact between particles ever occurring,
but only a rapid swing or asymptotic orbit round their
common centre of gravity; but this rapid centripetal swing
of particles getting within each other's molecular range is at
present essentially an unknown process, and has to be rele
gated to the sphere of potential energy quite as much as in
the not perhaps really dissimilar cases of elastic impact and
gravitation.

 that less heat was given to condenser than was received from
 boiler; that not only temperature fell but also heat was lost;

   That the available portion of heat should bear to the whole
 heat the same ratio which the available drop of temperature
  bears to the absolute temperature, is essentially but a defini
              º
  tion of temperature; it is an assertion that temperature is
  best measured as proportional to heat, or that the zero of
  temperature may conveniently be taken to correspond with
 the zero of heat.
     An essential part of the second law of Thermodynamics
  therefore           to state itself in a very general and purely
 commonsense form, thus:--
     The portion of energy which a body can automatically part
  with is alone available for doing work; and only that portion
  which is parted with reversibly is actually utilised.
                                                                       §
     There is no need to mention “heat;” it is equally true of
  every form of energy. When a cell has run down, or a
 reservoir leaked itself empty, as empty as it wants to, an
 further energy it may have is useless; and any portion
 flowed out in an uncontrolled or irreversible manner will have
 been wasted.
    There is something specific to be said about each form of
 energy in order to apply the above statement definitely to
 that form ; and in the case of heat the supplementary state
 ment needed is that heat will not automatically leave a body
for others at higher temperature: if it goes to a hotter body
it must be carried by matter, or electricity, or something else,
so that it is not a pure and simple flow of heat.       In other
words, heat will not flow “uphill” by pure conduction; and
conduction is the only mode of automatic conveyance of heat
as heat".    Water, air, or electricity can flow “uphill” for a
time and can do work at the same time, by reason of their
property of inertia. Heat cannot : it has no inertia.    None of
the uphill processes can go on continually or cyclicallyf.
   The law of dissipation of energy states itself thus:—
     Ifa body has any portion of energy in such condition that
it is able irreversibly to leave the body, that portion usually
does leave, sooner or later. This is only a rewording of the
customary statement that the potential energy of a system
tends towards a minimum ; or, really, except that circum
stances often delay the consummation unpractically         long,
towards zero. The universe will be stagnant, though by no
means stationary, when           its
                             potential energy   nothing. There

             say (as do on pp. 14, 15, and 20) that acting bodies
have    the same velocity, Fºr course mean their action to be
immediate.                 If
                    indirect action is contemplated, it is too obvious
that a clock-weight has not the same speed as the tip of the
second-hand or the hammer of its bell; but at the contact of
every cog, two wheels, driver and driven, are moving at the
same pace. But now, it may be asked, if                 action      contact             all                is

 rection is diminished in accordance with the suitable cosine

 into detail, even in a simple case, partly for lack of data; and
there is some uncertainty as to the disposal of the energy for
the case of a blow, though even in that case there is no un
certainty about the momentum ; while for a steady force the
body, however essentially elastic, gets rapidly into a practi
cally rigid state, and the molecules then merely act as trans
mitters of the energy. They are, as it were, connected by
massless struts and ties, and along these the energy is trans
mitted, partitioning itself off into several directions, much as
it did in the case of impact, and producing local velocities

and integrals occurring in the theory of tides, in electro
dynamics by Lord Kelvin, who, in his ‘Lectures on Molecular
Dynamics, suggests even the establishment of a mathematical
institution for such calculations.

this is due rather to practical physical needs than to specu
lations as to the theory of cognition.            The method has,
nevertheless, an eminently philosophical stamp, and we must
accordingly enter afresh the field of the theory of cognition.

    At the time of the French Revolution and afterwards the
great mathematicians of Paris had built up a sharply defined
method of theoretical physics on the basis laid by             and
Newton. Mechanical assumptions were made, from which a
group of natural phenomena could be explained by means of
mechanical principles which had attained a kind of geometrical
evidence. Men were conscious that the assumptions could
 not with complete certainty be described as correct, yet up to
a certain point it was held to be probable that they were in
exact conformity with fact, and accordingly they were called
hypotheses. Matter, the luminiferous aether for explaining
the phenomena of light, and the two electrical fluids as sums
of mathematical points were thus conceived. Between each
pair of such points a force was supposed to act having                                      its
 direction      the line joining the two points, and whose

assailed   the old system of centres of force and forces at a
distance; it might be said to have been from the exactly
opposite side, because they were particularly, fond of the
variegated garment of mechanical representation; it might
also be said to be from an adjacent side, as they also dis
pensed with the recognition of a mechanism lying at the
basis of the phenomena, and in the mechanism which they
themselves invented they did not see those of Nature, but
mere images and analogies*.      Several men of science, follow
ing the lead of Faraday, had established a totally different
conception of Nature. . While the older system had held the
centres of force to be the real, and the forces themselves to be
             i.
mathematical conceptions, Faraday saw distinctly the con
tinuous working of the forces from point to point in the inter
mediate space. The Potential, which had hitherto been only a
formula for lightening the work of calculation, was for him the
really existing bond in space, the cause of the action of force
itself.             ideas were far less lucid than the earlier
hypotheses, defined as they were with mathematical precision,
 and many a mathematician of the old school had but a low
 opinion of Faraday's theories, without, however, by the
 clearness of his own conceptions making such great dis
 coveries.
    But soon, and especially in England, it was attempted to
 get as plain and tangible a representation of the ideas and
  * The relation of the directions of the old system of centres of force
and of forces at a distance to the purely mathematical one represented
by Kirchhoff, to Maxwell's own point of view is expressed by him in
the following words:– “The results of this simplification may take the

form of a purely mathematical formula (Kirchhºff), or of a physical
hypothesis                 In the first case we entirely lose sight of the
phenomena to be explained and though we may trace out the conse
quences of given laws, we can never, obtain more extended views of the
connexions of the subject.               If,   on

   In his second paper he goes still further, and from liquid
vortices, and friction wheels working within cells with
elastic sides, he constructs a wonderful mechanism which
serves as a mechanical model for electromagnetism. This
mechanism was of course mocked at by those who, like
Zöllner, regarded it as a hypothesis in the older sense of the
word, and who thought that Maxwell ascribed to it a real
existence : this he decidedly repudiates, and only modestly
hopes “that by such mechanical fictions any one who under
stands the provisional and temporary character of this
hypothesis will find himself rather helped than hindered by
it in his search after the true interpretation of the pheno
mena.”      And they were so helped ; for by his model Maxwell
 arrived at those equations whose peculiar, almost magical

                   By W. H. HARVEY and F. HIRD, B.A."

              came across a remarkable difference
of positive and negative electricity, which forms the subject of
these notes.
   The apparatus was arranged in the now well-known manner
 forobtaining oscillatory discharges  high potential and high

       of silk equal in diameter to the wire.
    The secondary was suspended by silk cords, so as not to be
in contact with any part of the primary, and the whole was
immersed in oil, in order to prevent the passage of brush
discharges.
    With this apparatus vivid brush-discharges are obtained.
    It was observed that the brushes were most brilliant when
allowed to take place between a point and a plate, especially
if the latter had a fair capacity; also that the plate was
always charged positively, although the discharge was of
course oscillatory.                                                  e
    In order to put this fully to the test the experiment was
varied in many ways. The current in the primary of the
induction-coil was reversed, both mechanical and automatic
breaks were used, and the two ends of the secondary of the
transformer were in turn connected to the point (the unused
end remaining immersed in oil), but the result was always the
same, the plate being strongly charged positively.          We ma
add that the    charge  was
equal in amount with any of
                             steady

    We now added to our apparatus in order to test these brush
discharges in various gases.          For this purpose a bell-jar
(fig. 2) was fitted with a rubber bung, through which passed a

 from this point a wire leads into an upper tube and terminates      º

    Both tubes were             filled with oil, this being the only
              º
 means we found of preventing brushes onto the glass of the
bell-jar, which produced local charges and obscured the result.

shown); two bent                            glass tubes afford an inlet and outlet for the
gas to be experimented on.
  During  the experiments a continuous steady flow of gas was
maintained through the bell-jar, the clip was connected alter
nately to the two ends of the secondary, and the current in
the primary of the induction-coil was reversed in each case.
The unused end of the secondary was insulated and entirely
immersed in oil. The mercury in the glass dish was electri
cally connected to the plate of a gold-leaf electroscope, the
sign of the charge on which was determined in the usual
manner.
   In the first case the jar was filled with dry air, of which a
                                              i.
steady stream was kept up. The results confirmed those
previously mentioned, the charge of the gold leaves being
always strong and           positive.
   Next we passed into the jar a stream of dry hydrogen, and
 kept this steadily flowing during the experiments, which were
 of course commenced only after the air was       expelled.                 all
   In   this case the leaves were always strong and steady
negative.

     We have also experimented with other gases, but owing to
  difficulties in obtaining them in a state of purity, on account
  of limited space and want of general conveniences, we have
 not obtained reliable results.
   The results given above, however, may be depended upon,
 as they were                      all
                      repeated some hundreds      times under                              of
 varying conditions, and have always been satisfactory and
 consistent.           -
   We may therefore sum            the results which we have   up
 established                as   follows:—
         Inbrush-discharge
              a                   air positive electricity passes more
                                                     in
  readily than negative from             point onto any neighbouring

         oxygen the same        the case.        is
         hydrogen the reverse holds, negative electricity passing
  more readily.

     1st.    By       the        method         of   coincidences with              the concave
grating, the wave-lengths of 14 more lines throughout the
visible spectrum were determined from this with great accuracy
for primary standards.                                    -

the spectrum to the other many times; and a curve of error
drawn to correct to these primary standards.

º:
    4th. Measurements of photographic plates from 10 to 19
inches long were made. These plates had upon them two
           of the solar spectrum of different orders. Thus the
  lue, violet, and ultra-violet spectra were compared with the
visible spectrum, giving many checks on the first series of
standards.
    5th. Measurements were made of photographic plates
having the solar spectrum in coincidence with metallic
spectra, often of three orders, thus giving the relative wave
lengths of three points in the spectrum.
    Often the same line in the ultra-violet had       wave-length              its

   * The distance apart of the components of this 1474 line measured accurately
is 0-146 by Crew, and 0.141 by Rowland.   The coincidences with Fe and Co are
very doubtful.   The Coline comes more nearly between the two rather than
coinciding with either. (R.)
   A trial of substances in the arc gave the following results:—iron, manganese,
chromium, titanium, and two different specimens of meteoric stones showed
two faint lines having the same relative intensities with respect to each other as
the components of 1474 in the solar spectrum, and either coincided with the
                                     lº
components of 1474 or nearly so. When cobalt and nickel were tried, the lines
were the same distance          but the relative intensities were reversed, the red
component being much the stronger.
   With the best definition 1474 is a triple, or rather a double the red compo
nent of which has a weak side line to violet. The components as measured on
a photographic plate are respectively 0-120 and 0.050 apart. The main com
   onents as determined by a series of measurements on photographic plates are
0.170 apart.
   Probably the violet component of the double is iron and the weak side line of
 the red component is cobalt, but the red component is unknown. (J.)
    t With but little material in the arc this is a di<U+017F>ficult triplet. The violet
 component is very strong, the red component about half as strong, and between
 them, but nearer the red component, is a very narrow line much weaker than
 either of the others. (J.)

but in less degree; the second and third are as nearly perfectly
eliminated as is possible. These, though they may be indi
vidually too minute to be observed, yet tend to be cumulative,
so that as the number of steps employed is increased with
the view to obtain accuracy, so do these accumulated errors
tend to increase when the ordinary method is followed.                 It is
on the elimination of these that the          accuracy    of the method
of curve-drawing, which forms the subject of this paper,
mainly depends.        The increase in facility is also of im
portance, as the operator is not tempted to make his steps
unduly long ; it is brought about as follows.                   make the                  I

hole at the centre of the scale marked                     A small brass      o.
tripod with three needle-feet (fig. 2) is placed so that two
feet just penetrate into the paper and the third rests on the
longitudinal straight line of the strip (which of course passes
through the small hole), and just pricking into it forms a
temporary but rigid and stable centre of rotation for the
strip.    A pencil-point or a capillary glass pen made short
and fastened with wax or a spring clip into                   place                 its              at

  reading cannot be directly observed ; but since by the time
  that the rule is parallel to the axis the needle-point must
  have reached, in the particular case chosen, the              ‘5,
  the two or three steps required may be made with more
  than sufficient accuracy by moving the needle-point a few
  divisions at a time so as to arrive at this point when
  parallelism is being reached; in fact at this stage equal
 angular changes correspond to equal changes on the scale.
  As soon as this position is passed the central line of the strip
 cuts the axis on the other side, and so now these readings
 have to be added to the total curvature 5 in order to find the
 remaining readings upon which the needle-point should rest.
                                                 .
 In fig. 2 one complete loop of this particular nodoid has been
 drawn, and the second one has been carried to the stage at
 which 16 is the axial reading, and 34 the reading of the
 temporary centre of curvature.       Unduloids may be drawn in
 a similar  way,  but in this case the needle-point has to move
 off to an infinite distance, when the axial reading is equal to
 the total curvature.     The length of line for        the centre
 of curvature is beyond the end of the rule is generally very
 small, and this may be drawn so that no error can be detected
by alternately moving the needle from one end to the other,
each for a very small arc.       The catenary may of course be
set out in the same    way  and with still greater ease and accu
racy, for the infinite values do not come into any finite part
of the curve. The axial reading and that on which the needle
point rests must be kept the same, but on opposite sides of the
tracing-point.
    It will be evident that if the little tripod is just pressed
sufficiently upon the paper to make small impressions of the
needle-feet, it may afterwards be taken over the same course
and the third needle-point pressed upon the paper, and thus a
series of points on the evolute determined. In fig. 2 the evolute
is shown dotted. The points of most importance on this are
the cusps a, b, corresponding to the places on the curve where
the curvature is a minimum or a maximum, the distance a b
being the half period of the curve, and the maxima or minima
c, c, which are the ordinates of the curve where the abscissa
is a minimum or a maximum.           By means of these and the
curve itself the   geometrical  constants of any curves drawn in
this  way   may  be determined more accurately than from the
curve itself alone. Prof. Greenhill has given me the formula
by which, with the use of tables of elliptic integrals, the chief
constants of the unduloid and nodoid may be calculated.
Miss Stevenson, a student of the College of Science, has drawn
a large series of these curves, and we have found that while

                             of      Curves by their Curvature.                                 81
they can be drawn each in a few minutes only, it is possible
to set them out correctly to the thickness of a fairly fine
pencil-line; and so they do more than give a general idea of
the shape, they serve to make a true scale-drawing.
   In the case of capillary surfaces of revolution, in which the
fluids on the opposite sides of the surface are of different den
sity, e.g. water and air as already explained, the curvature of
the surface must be zero at the plane surface level, and must
be proportional to the distance above or below this level, being
–   or convex to the denser liquid above, and + or concave
below. The readiest way to determine the curvature when
drawing one of these generating curves is to work on a sheet on
which a series of equidistant lines have been ruled parallel
to the plane surface level, and at such a distance apart that
the hydrostatic pressure due to this distance is balanced by a
curvature of -01 or some small and simple number. These lines,
then, give by inspection, especially if each fifth and tenth line
is a little darker, a scale of curvature, and exactly the same
process that was followed when describing the curves of constant
curvature may be as readily applied when the curvature is
constantly varying. In the case of water this distance                                          is,
using the formula already given,                    d        If, 3.

avoid fractions, the numbers are all multiplied by 10. The

racy and perfect evenness and smoothness of the curve over
what is obtainable by the use of compasses is the same as that
which was found in the case of the capillary curves of revolu

glass, having a clear star-shaped hole in the middle. Below
this and enclosed in a box was an inclined white screen
illuminated by a small glow-lamp.                   By adjusting the illu
mination of the lower screen until the star-shaped hole more
or less completely disappeared, the illumination of the hori

methods, the illumination of the lower screen was adjusted by
altering      itsinclination          the glow-lamp.

84              Mr. A. P. Trotter   on a New Photometer
photometer, in which two screens at 45° to the lights” and to
the eye are used, but side by side, instead of one behind
the other.
    I  showed an extemporized photometer of this kind to
 Mr. Crompton and to Mr. Swinburne on March 26, 1893.
 Mr. Crompton suggested the use of zinc for the screens, and
 this gave me the hint to try perforated zinc, to abandon a
 definite vertical line of uniform tone, and to select a line or
 band of uniformity on a screen provided with a number of
 R.".               I  mentioned the idea to Mr. Swinburne on
    arch 27, but had no opportunity of trying it for more than
 a week.       In the meantime Mr. Crompton had thought of a
 similar   expedient,   and had used with considerable success a
 |.     of screens, the front one of which was perforated with
   orizontal slots, and he observed the shading of the slots, say,
 from bright to dark, and of the bars from dark to bright.
 Before    I  had heard of this modification     I   had tried vertical
 bars or slots and perforated screens.
    The photometer is shown in fig. 2. It consists of a box
 mounted on a sliding-carriage on a photometer-bar.                  A
 slotted screen and a plain screen are fixed inside, and are
 observed through an opening from the direction O. The
lights fall on the screens through two openings from the
 directions     L  and Li.      The lights are arranged exactly

not necessary that the combined sulphuric acid should be
united to a strong base, neutral sulphates of weak bases are
wholly without action. Thus neither brucianor quinia sulphate
causes formation of herapathite; the sulphuric acid in these
salts has no more tendency to bring about the reaction than,
for example, that in sodium sulphate. The fact that quinia
sulphate does not form herapathite with the test indicates that
there is no free iodine present, thus confirming the view that
the iodoquinia molecule is not broken up.
   Space cannot be spared here to go with detail into the
chemistry of iodoquinia compounds. The whole series of acid

           1. SULPHATEs                  of    THE TYPE        R', SO, or           R''SO,
  I find that these salts dissolve in water and exist in solution
as such and absolutely without separation of sulphuric acid
even in those cases in which the solution is acid to litmus.
The substances examined were the alkaline sulphates and
the sulphates                 of Mg, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, TI;
                                                          also the
sulphates of morphia, quinia, strychnia, and brucia.       To this
series of reactions there is a single exception of an interesting
character.
   A solution of ferrous sulphate invariably contains free
acid, no matter how often recrystallized or under what cir
cumstances prepared. A small flask was filled with freshly
distilled water and was well boiled, corked, and set aside to
cool. In this ferrous sulphate was dissolved and potash was
added in quantity sufficient to precipitate a considerable pro
portion of oxide. Even this solution gave the reaction                                                  in
dicating the presence of free acid. So, too, the double salts
of ferrous oxide with ammonia and with magnesia, their
solutions always contain free acid, no matter how often they
may be recrystallized or purified by precipitation of their
solutions in water by alcohol. This exceptional behaviour
probably results from the great tendency of ferrous solutions
to .absorption of oxygen from the air, and, as will pre
sently appear, sesquisulphates are dissociated in solution.
       ith this one exception, the heavy metallic sulphates above
mentioned dissolve in water without decomposition, although
their solutions redden litmus. The alkaloids mentioned yield
sulphates, which, after suitable purification, are perfectly
neutral to litmus.
   To explain this contrast it is necessary to remember that a
salt reddens litmus whenever the affinity of            acid for the               its
potash      litmus     not held      check           in
                                                two affinities which by
                    in
                                is
            its it,                                   is its
oppose      that               of
                     the base for     acid, and that      the litmus                     of
dye for      potash.      the base    sufficiently
                                         If        weak, the affinity
of   its
       acid for   potash  preponderates".       The whole question
therefore reduces itself        that     the strength
                                               to          of
                                                            the base                     of
with which the acid         united and    is   consequently follows
                                                      ;             it

by additional evidence. As bases, the alkaloids vary very
greatly in strength.     A few which contain no oxygen are
bases  approximating  to ammonia in strength. Such are nicotia
and conia.    Among   those which contain oxygen there is much
difference in strength: morphia and codeia are strong bases,
and are known to precipitate iron, copper, cobalt, and nickel
salts. The weaker alkaloids do not seem to have been examined
in this respect,                and     one therefore was selected                           for     exa
mination.

94                           Mr. M. Carey Lea on the
formation of acid sulphate was always endothermic, was
accompanied by the absorption of 1:05 cal. in the case of
NaHSO,.       He especially remarks that when a very small
proportion of acid is added, the tendency is to a complete
 combination in the form of acid salt.*.
   This last-mentioned result is contrary to that which     have                         I
been able to   observe, and               I
                                will therefore mention   my   re
actions with some particularity.
     I
     invariably found that when a trace of sulphuric acid was
added to the solution of a neutral alkaline sulphate, it reacted
as free acid.    The matter was examined especially in the
following manner. To 40 cub. centim. of distilled water 2
                         º
drops of sulphuric acid were added; the liquid was divided
into two equal parts, in one of which was dissolved a gramme
of neutral sodium sulphate. These two liquids were then
examined with the test solution, and the detection of the acid
was found to be fully as easy in the presence of the large
excess of sodium           as in the case of the acid alone.
     It
      is true that this result is open to the following criticism.
                        in.
 Alcohol extracts sulphuric acid from solid acid sodium sul
phate, showing
weak    affinity
                              as Mendeléef remarks, the extremely
                   which unites it to the neutral salt.      In the
present examination the test can only be used in alcoholic
solution.     It may be said that the alcohol first precipitates
the solid acid sulphate, and then abstracts free acid from
There     isforce       this objection, but
                        in                         think    may  I             it            be it.
answered       inthe following manner.        We first reduce sul
phuric acid nearly          the limit
                              to           dilution and quantity
                                                     of                                      at
which      can be detected.
          it                     We then find that the addition of
a  comparatively large quantity            neutral sulphate makes
                                                    of

sulphate, which         highly improbable. The weight

carbonate also dried, and absolute alcohol, scarcely a trace
of action ensues. The liquid, even if kept warm, scarcely
colours, and the brown colour of the salt is retained.     The
addition of a little water brings on rapid action. The dull
brown colour changes to bright metallic green, and solution
 goes on steadily as the sulphuric acid is removed by the
 barium carbonate.
   We thus have the curious result that two substances, both
 entirely insoluble in water, scarcely act on each other until
 water is present, and then a rapid decomposition results.

a suitable test solution could not be obtained by simply acting
on quinia with iodine.    An iodine solution instantly produces
in one of quinia a bulky precipitate of a light yellowish
brown colour, quickly redissolving if the solutions were not
too strong, and the liquid thus obtained, if the iodine is not in
excess, immediately forms herapathite on the addition of sul
 phuric acid.

acid    cannot be detected as with the solution obtained from

 ure  herapathite is used, the resulting solution contains abso
 utely no excess of either quinia or iodine.       But however
carefully we may attempt to mix quinia and iodine, we shall
always have a slight excess of one or the other, and in either

   Herapathite appears to be a very permanent substance.
Some that I prepared over thirty years ago has been kept in
a stoppered, but not sealed, white glass bottle and freely
exposed to light during this time.        It appears to be quite
unchanged, and was used in part of the work just described.
    In preparing the test solution time is gained by using the
barium carbonate in considerable excess and by frequent
shaking.     The herapathite should be in fine powder. After
the   green   particles have entirely disappeared, which will
usually take a day or two, the solution must be filtered
off and be placed in contact with a fresh portion of barium
carbonate, with frequent shaking for several days.           The
complete removal of the last traces of sulphuric acid cannot
be judged of, as might be supposed, by allowing a portion
to evaporate and examining for the crystals of herapathite.
A specimen may dry up to a yellow varnish and yet may
contain sulphuric acid, as may be shown by evaporating to
dryness with a little ammonia, exhausting the residue with
very dilute hydrochloric acid, and adding a drop of barium
chloride solution.     But there is a very much simpler and at
the same time more effective means of testing. A solution is
allowed to evaporate spontaneously after adding a drop or
two of solution of oxalic acid. Then, if there is the slightest
trace of herapathite present, it will show itself in extremely
characteristic crystals, either small rosettes of black prisms or
in thin, light brown, transparent plates, which are black when
crossed.    A great many acids have this property of forcing
out a crystallization ; for example acetic, citric, tartaric,
malic, and even arsenic. On the other hand, hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, and nitric acids have not this power.
   The explanation appears to be this. Iodoquinia is a col
loid, and when present in large excess is able to prevent the
crystallization of the relatively small proportion of herapathite
present. The addition of either of the first-named series of
acids appears to convert the colloid base into a crystalline
salt, which of course no longer interferes with the crystal
lization of the herapathite.
   Method of applying the test.—After having ascertained in
the above-mentioned manner that the test solution is abso
lutely free from herapathite, a few drops of the liquid to be

tested are to placed in a small porcelain basin, a little alcohol
added, and then a few drops of test solution.         When the
quantity of sulphuric acid is something more than a trace, an
immediate black precipitate is formed.               If
                                                the quantity is
something less no immediate result is visible; but as the
alcohol evaporates, it leaves behind a film of dark crystals
which under a lens are easily recognizable.      In this way a
quantity of sulphuric acid amounting only to 000015 gramme,
about ºs of a milligram, can be detected with certainty, pro
vided the test solution is not used in too great excess.              To
detect so small a quantity, however, requires some familiarity
with the reaction.
  With larger quantities of free sulphuric acid, the charac
teristic violet-black crystalline precipitate falls immediately.
In dealing with quantities too small to cause precipitation, it
is advantageous to gently warm the basin beforehand; in
this way a crystallization is obtained within two or three
minutes, and the danger of secondary reactions, such as
might be caused by the presence of oxidizing acids, is
diminished *.
   The conclusions derived from the foregoing investigations

may be briefly summed up as follows:–
   1. The solution of iodoquinia affords the means of detectin
free sulphuric acid even in traces in presence of
sulphuric                                             -
           acid.
   2. The salts of heavy metallic protoxides do not owe their
acid reaction to dissociation.     The solutions of their sulph
ates contain no free sulphuric acid.      To this there is one
exception.    Solutions of ferrous sulphate always contained
free sulphuric acid.
   3. Sesquisulphates, as far as examined, are always disso
ciated in solution.
   4. Alums are always dissociated in solution with a single
notable exception.    Chrome alum exists as such in solution.
   5. Acid salts are dissociated in solution.   The dissociation
is very great and may perhaps be complete.

yellow film dissolves it may leave behind it a violet-black film of hera:
 athite, which, being much less soluble, resists the action of the alcohol
          This is a test of very great delicacy and the treatment with
alcohol should never be omitted.

         By    Professor F. Y. EDGEworth, M.A., D.C.L.”
A”       attempt to estimate and reduce the errors in the calcu
         lation of correlations between organs f may prove not
only useful to those who cultivate that branch of exact biology,
but also interesting to the less specialized student of Proba
bilities, in virtue of some precepts of general application.
   As shown in former papers, the calculation of correlations
consists of three stages.    We begin with the coefficients called
by Mr. Galton r, and by the present writer pis, pis, &c.; which
determine the correlation between the members of each pair
                                                                                   -
of organs; for the probability of any two deviations ºr and y
(each measured from the corresponding average, in units of
the proper modulus) being associated is equal to a constant
raised to a power denoted by the following expression :
                  vi-ºº-ººty

   The conclusion sought is the quantic of the second degree
which forms the exponent of the expression for the proba
bility that particular values of    the organs should      all
                                                         asso                                             be

                    that
 columns 1 and    2, namely '04.
    To these estimates an addition is to be made in virtue of
 the error of the species (y).   It will be found that the errors of
this  species  are  nearly cancelled in both 1 and 2, but not so
in 3 or 4 a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the
             ;
considerable divergence between 3 and 4 as compared with
that between 1 and 2.
   The differences actually occurring are 0, 01, '05, '06,

     II.We have next to consider the errors incident to the
proportional values of the coefficients a, b, c, f, g, h-the case
of three variables being taken as an example. It will be
recollected that these proportions are thus obtained.           The

Accordingly the first set of results, the proportional coeffi
cients of the squares of the variables, have the least possible
relative error when the p’s are all zero (the deviations of the
organs independent); and the greatest possible relative error
when the p’s are each unity (the correlation a case of simple
law unmixed with chance).                                   Contrariwise,          the relative error

that of the p's from which they are calculated.      For, put eis,

                          The Hydrates           of Hydrogen Bromide.                                   111
  Taking a and c as each nearly 6, we should expect & priori
(according to the last paragraph but one) the probable error
between any two determinations of each coefficient to be about
2; and, a posteriori, we observe that of the six differences
presented              §
             the four values of a, three are within and three
without 2. A similar statement is true of the six values
of      c.
  The precariousness of the results becomes much greater,
as the number of the variables is increased, as may be seen
by considering                    the       expression for
                                                                   s in        the   case      of four,
compared with that of three, variables.
     I do not think it necessary to exhibit the work in full.
What has been proved of arithmetical observations may be
true also of algebraic formulae—a better general result is
sometimes obtained by not working up            the particulars.         all
    To sum                up
                  we have estimated the error incident

                                          the correlation between
organs. We have shown how this error becomes greater
with the number         the organs; the instability

  The more numerous results with stronger solutions, 44 to
65 per cent., suggested the existence of two breaks at 52 and

curve    obliterating    the  breaks showed         an error 3-5 times
larger than the experimental error.             Again, a drawing of the
results which placed breaks at points other than those above
mentioned, namely at 56 and 63 per cent. instead of at 52
and 60 per cent, gave an error twice as large as the latter,
and 1-7 times larger than the known experimental error.
These results, therefore, justify the conclusions drawn from
the inspection of the figure.
    Although the breaks thus indicated were of a minor cha
racter only, it was deemed advisable to investigate the freezing
points of the solutions to see whether hydrates corresponding
to them could be isolated, and, as a matter of fact, both the
hydrates indicated were isolated. Two series of determina
tions (of which the second is the fuller) were performed in
the same manner as in my recent work on the Amines (Chem.
Soc. Trans. 1893, p. 141): these are given in Table II. and
illustrated in fig. 2.        I  need only say in explanation of

attain a maximum, and again fall, their doing so is a proof .
that the crystallizing substance is a compound of the two sub
stances forming the solutions, and that the surest means of
determining the composition of this compound is to ascertain
the position of the maximum freezing-point, which must
necessarily coincide with the composition of the pure com
pound (see loc. cit. p. 142).

 remark that although there must of course be a change of
                 ãº,
 curvature at the point where one crystallization gives place
 to another, yet these changes are totally different from those
 previously                 and do not necessarily imply any special
 changes in the solutions at the points where they occur ;
 they are changes in the actual phenomena occurring, whereas
 the others are changes in the rate at which one particular
 phenomenon or property is influenced by changes of strength
 of the solution.
    The strongest solution used contained nearly 69 per cent.
 of acid, and was made by passing the gas into some of                                                      its

so I am anticipating the publication of the results which
have obtained with hydrogen iodide. The monohydrate of
hydrogen bromide was obtained in small quantities under
pressure by Roozeboom, and he also obtained indications of
the existence of a similar hydrate of hydrogen chloride : no
experiments have been made yet to ascertain whether the
iodide forms a monohydrate or not. As far as can be seen,
there appears to be no simple relationship between the freezing
points of the various hydrates.

                 X.  Some Notes on Photometry.

   I.  On the use of Two Overlapping Screens as an Isophotal.
          employment of two opaque screens placed at an angle
THE     with one another, and with the observer's eye, to receive
the light from the two sources, was made the basis of a
photometric method by the author, in conjunction with Mr.
C. C. Starling, in 1881. Their photometer was designed, in the
first instance, for electric-light measurements.     For this special
end any method in which opaque screens are used is to be
preferred, in one respect, to those methods in which trans
lucent screens are used; for then it is not necessary to employ
coloured glasses when making the comparison, as the opaque
screens themselves may be of coloured material, and the choice
of opaque coloured material is much more varied than is that
of tinted glass.
    In the Thompson-Starling photometer the two surfaces for
receiving the light met at an angle of about 70°. The pair
of screens was constituted by two pieces of card, either white
                                           º
or coloured, or by two surfaces of some brilliantly-tinted
fabric mounted on card, each pair being dropped down into
position over a wedge-block.        The observer, placing his eye
opposite the arête of the dihedral pair of screens so as to
view each surface at the same angle, had to adjust the appa
ratus until the apparent illumination at the adjacent parts of
the two surfaces was equal.
    When working with this photometer it was found that the
precision of judgment of the eye as to equality of the two
illuminations was impaired if by bad                       any con
siderable width of blunted edge intervened between the two

surfaces that should have met with precision.          There was a
similar defect in the original form of the Bouguer photometer,
 wherein the opaque partition was continued down to the
screen and interposed an unilluminated patch equal in breadth

to its own thickness between the two illuminated surfaces.
In that case the remedy, applied by Foucault in the modified
instrument which bears his name, was to shorten the partition
so as to permit the two illuminated parts to come just into
optical contact. In the case of the oblique opaque screens the
author tried to remedy the defect by several modifications,
which, though not described at the time, proved useful. In
one of these each surface was extended so as partially to over
lap the adjacent surface, as indicated in figs. 2 and 3. In

    The principle of overlap in photometers operating by the
 diffuse illumination of opaque inclined screens has since been
 º
 used by Sir John Conroy”, who employed two pieces of white
 writing-paper, inclined at about 60° to one another. He
 found, as   I did, that 90° is too large a dihedral angle for
 exact work. Materials such as card and paper are never
           devoid of specular reflexion.     At an incidence of 45°
 on each surface there is so much specular reflexion of the
 light as quite to vitiate the observations.

        It is
         a familiar fact to every person who is accustomed to
 use the Bunsen photometer that the most convenient way of
 taking observations is to swing the carriage which supports
the screen and mirrors backwards and forwards through a
continually-decreasing distance about the position of balance.
That position is ultimately found by the eye noting the suc
cessive departures from equality produced by rapid small
displacements on either side of the position of balance.                                                      If
these inequalities can be made equal inter          the zero will                se,                          lie
midway; for though the intensity            illumination (assumingof
the sources      light   ofpoints) varies inversely
                                         as              the square                            as

    As the intrinsic light of the arc is not far from 70 candles
per square millimetre, a circular aperture 1 millimetre in
diameter will afford a light of about 55 candles.                        Hence
an aperture smaller than this is preferable in a photometric
standard for         all
                    ordinary photometric work.              For the purpose
of    a special photometric standard with which                        compare               to

are in consequence of the absolute magnitudes of the standards
habitually employed.          If  a six-foot bench is the right sort of
apparatus to satisfy the needs of the eye when the standard
is of one or two candle-power, obviously a longer bench will
be right when standards of greater power are employed, as
giving, on the average, similar absolute illuminations of the
working surfaces. If the degree of accuracy implied in the
possibility of reading to within 2 millimetres’ length of scale
can be attained with a Bunsen or Jolly photometer when the
standard is a 2-candle Methven slit, or a pair of standard
sperm-candles, an accuracy of five times as great ought to be
attainable if there is used as a standard a 50-candle light.
The bench need not in this case be five times as long as the
ordinary bench : the half length only need be elongated five
fold on one side of the screen, the other half remaining as
before. In other words, if the standard is of 25-fold brilliancy,
it must be placed 5 times as far away from the screen as
before in order to balance a given light at the same distance
as before on the other side.            And, so far as such standard
º
light is concerned, a five-fold accuracy will be attained, since
       error or uncertainty in reading the scale will be now but
a fifth part of the whole scale-reading.
    All the foregoing points, then, to the use of a brighter
standard light and a longer photometric bench than hereto
fore. Such a standard might well be afforded by an arc
crater viewed through a circular aperture 1 millimetre in
diameter, giving about 0-7854 sq. millimetre of crater-surface,
 with a light of about 55 candles.            This should be placed at
one end of a bench some five metres in length ; the gradua
tions of the scale being, of course, reckoned from the edge of
the aperture *.
     One not unimportant advantage of the use of such a pin
hole standard is that it may with real propriety be treated as
 a luminous point ; whereas no one can maintain that the
 flame standards habitually used are even approximately points
 relatively to the distances at which they are set from the
 screen.      For these the law of inverse squares cannot possibly
 be true    ; though it is never the practice to make any correc
 tions for the errors arising from the size of the flame.
     In contemplating the use of circular apertures pierced in
metal diaphragms, it becomes necessary to inquire how far
    * It is curious to note in this respect that there is usually an erroneous
instruction observed with the use of the Methven slit; the distance of the
photometric screen being reckoned from the flame behind the slit instead
of from the slit itself.

     is required to find the illumination at a point P on the screen
     at a distance PX=y from the point X which is on the axis of
      the aperture.   Let the angle POX be called 6. Then the
     apparent aperture as viewed from P will be bounded by two
     portions of ellipses (the front and back edges of the hole

     as semi-minor axis a cos 6.           two ellipses will overlap,
     their centres being displaced by an amount equal to &r sin 9.
     If  we represent the ratio of the thickness of the metal to the
     radius .# the aperture as 8.r/a-tan p, then we may write the
     following expression for A, the effective area of the hole, as

  Case    (i). To get some idea of the magnitudes involved, let
          us take a concrete case.    Suppose the aperture to be a
          hole 1 millimetre in diameter and the diaphragm
          # millimetre   thick; so that tan ºp-1.        What will

          for a point P 2.5 centimetres from the centre X of a
          screen which is itself at a distance OX=50 centimetres
          from the aperture ? As a Bunsen disk is seldom more
          than 5 centimetres in diameter, this is rather an extreme
          case.   Here tan 6=2.5-50=0.05.         So 6=2° 52', and
          cos 6=0.9975.     Whence     m-0-935.
   Case   (ii). Suppose           in the diaphragm to be still
                                  the hole
          1 millimetre in   diameter, but the diaphragm to be
          2.5 millimetres thick.  Here tan p-5. Taking 6 as

          before, we get m=0-684.
  Case     (iii). Suppose, on the other hand, that the hole is made
          in metal foil only 0.1 millimetre thick, or that, having
          been pierced through thicker metal the edge has been
          cut away by countersinking, leaving only a narrow rim
          0.1 millimetre in thickness.  In this case tan ºp-0-2.
          In the case where thin foil is used there is a consi
          derable risk of the metal buckling with heat ; and it
          would be quite possible, from this cause alone, that
          the axis of the aperture should become oblique by as
          much as 10° from the axis of the photometer. As
          suming then 6=10°, the ratio of the central illumina

      RAGO’S theory of this phenomenon is still perhaps the
        most familiar, although I believe it may be regarded
as abandoned by the best authorities.      According to it the
momentary disappearance of the light of the star is due to
i.
accidental interference between the rays which pass the two
halves of the pupil of the eye or the object-glass of the tele
          When the relative retardation amounts to an odd
multiple of the half wave-length of any kind of light, such
light, it is argued, vanishes from the spectrum of the star.
But this theory is based upon a complete misconception.
“It  is as far as possible from being true that a body emitting
homogeneous light would disappear on merely covering half
the aperture of vision with a half wave-plate.     Such a con

                         Theory       of Stellar Scintillation.                             131
often can only be observed upon the spectrum as slight
general variations of brightness.
   (VII.) As the altitude increases, the movement of the
bands becomes quicker and less regular.
   (VIII.). As the prism is turned so as to bring the spectrum
from the horizontal to the vertical position, the inclination of
the bands to the transversal of the spectrum continually dimi
nishes until it becomes zero, when the spectrum is nearly
vertical; but the bands then become less marked, retaining,
however, the movement in the direction indicated above (III.).
   (IX.), Luminous bands are less frequent and less regular
than dark bands, and occur well marked only in the spectra
of stars near the horizon.
   (X.) In the midst of this general and violent movement of
bright and dark masses in the spectra of stars, the black
spectral lines proper to the light of each star remain sensibly
quiescent or undergo very slight oscillations.
   (XI.) Under abnormal atmospheric conditions the bands
are fainter and less regular in shape and movement.
   (XII.) When strong winds prevail the bands are usually
rather faint and        defined, and then the spectrum exhibits
                          ill
mere changes        brightness, even

which reach the observer                       at an apparent altitude of 10° is
185 centim. Nearer the                         horizon the separation would be
still greater, but    valueits                  cannot well          be      found from (15).

as      v(bX), where
                  A is the wave-length of the light, and b is
the distance across which the shadow is thrown.        We may
take A at 6 x 10-" centim., and if b be reckoned in kilometres,
we have as the space of transition, V (6b). Thus if b were
4 kilometres, the space of transition would amount to about
5 centim.      The inference is that the various parts of the
aperture of a small telescope cannot be very differently
affected unless the obstacles to which the scintillation is due
are at a less distance than 4 kilometres.
                                                                                                        .
   One of the principal outstanding difficulties in the theory
of scintillation is to see how the transition from one index to
another in an atmospheric irregularity can be sufficientl
sudden. The fact that the various parts of a not too
object-glass are diversely affected seems to prove that the
transitions in question do not occupy many centimetres.
Now, whether the irregularity be due to temperature or to
moisture, we should expect that a transition, however abrupt
at first, would after a few minutes or hours be eased off to a
#.erhaps the abruptness of transition
renewed
          degree than would accord with the above estimate.

    (2) is a continuation of the author's “Principles of the Algebra
of   Physics.’
    It  opens with a historical note of the theory and use of      V-I
by three classes of Analysts, and goes on to applications of quater
nions to Spherical Trigonometry, to Circular Spirals, and to Hyper
bolic Spirals.      En route the hyperbolic non-Euclidian Geometry
and some other points which have recently occupied attention are
touched upon.        This paper and the recent Trigonometries by
Levett and Davison and by Hayward show how the ideas of
De Morgan's Double Algebra are coming to the front.

    Mansfield Merriman’s ‘Textbook of the Method of Least Squares'
(Macmillan, 1885) contains 174 pp.4-20 pp. of Appendix and
Tables: Dr. Bobek's Lehrbuch der Ausgleichsrechnung mach der
Methode der Kleinsten Quadrate (Maier, Stuttgart, 1891) has
pp. viii-F176; and W. Woolsey Johnson’s ‘The Theory of Errors
and Method of Least Squares” (Wiley, New York, 1892) has
 pp.  x+174 (and is 12mo, not 8vo).
    Now as Prof. Otto's page is much larger than that of any of the
 above, it is evident that in quantity of matter it “takes the cake.”
     The first part (pp. 1–42) is devoted to the Errors of Observation,
 and the remainder, in seven divisions, discusses the Method of
 Least Squares. The author very rarely cites previous writers, and
 none of these are familiar to us except Hagen.        The simple text is
 perhaps equal in extent to that of the respective works cited at the
 commencement, the special feature is the great amount of illustra
 tive examples which are fully worked out. It is this which makes
 Prof. Koll's work such a practical one. The formulae at the end
 will be useful for reference to the student. It only remains to say
 that the type is very clear, the figures numerous and good, and the
 arrangement of the page conducive to easy reading.

Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The existence of chert between two sheets of eruptive rocks at
Mullion Island seemed to the author to require some explanation.
Cherts are usually associated with limestones, and the absence of
limestones in many cases where cherts are found points to their
removal by underground waters.        The older the limestone, the
greater the probability of                      its
                                 thickness having dwindled.     The

as the conversion of chlorite into biotite—had since been confirmed
by independent investigators.      He held that, as a whole, the
gneisses and schists of Malvern had been formed by the crushing
and shearing of consolidated igneous rocks; but he did not deny the
possibility that here and there the foliated structure might have been
produced in a fused mass.       In the first stage of metamorphism the
diorite or   granite was crushed and decomposed.        This slightly com
pressed rock could be traced step by step into a typical gneiss or
schist.     The signs of pressure progressively increased, and the
mineral and chemical changes became proportionately                greater.
Reconstruction set in. The          process    of metamorphism     did not
always follow the same lines.           Felspar was sometimes crushed
into seams of fragments, and these, by partial re-fusion and pres
sure, were converted into gneissose lenticles of quartz and felspar.
Intervening chlorite was changed to biotite, or even to muscovite or
sericite.    Thus a typical gneiss, consisting of quartz-<U+017F>elspar lenticles
in a felt-work of mica, was formed out of a diorite. Sometimes the
felspar was reconstituted without becoming fragmental; and it was
then deposited on, or it included, idiomorphic mica. Or a soda-lime
felspar might, by a process of corrosion, be converted into quartz, or
a soda-felspar, or both.
    In an early stage of metamorphism, the rock was often dirty and
rotten through the abundance of chlorite and disseminated iron
oxide. The former being changed to mica, and the latter being
either absorbed in the production of biotite, or reconstituted in a
crystalline form, a sound clear gneiss was the result.         In the com
pleted product, the signs of crushing and shearing were often en
tirely wanting.       Even strain-shadows were rare in          The meta         it.

 tracing the gradations inch           by

                                          analyses. The recent researches
of ofMr. Alexander Johnstone had shown that even            the laboratory,     in
 and     atthe ordinary temperatures, carbonated waters were able                                   to
 remove magnesia from certain          its combinations with silica.

     The following communications were read:—
     1.    “The Felsites and Conglomerates between Bethesda and
Llanllyfni, North Wales.”   By Prof. J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
   The author   brought forward fresh evidence in support of the
views he had previously expressed as to the Cambrian age of these
felsites, and as to the unconformity of the conglomerates on the
Purple Slates.
   A new tunnel-section at Penrhyn Quarry was described, in which
felsite was followed by St. Ann's Grit with a conglomerate-band, and
there lying in the midst of the Cambrian Series. After a word or
two on the conglomerate on Moel Rhiw-wen, the sections on either
side of Llyn Padarn were discussed in detail, and it was shown that
the distribution of the rocks on the surface of the country could only
be explained by the unconformable position of the conglomerates and
grits, which, moreover, lie nearly horizontal.
   After a discussion of the conglomerates of Bettws-Garmon, a
detailed section of the adit at Moel Tryfaen was given, in which it
was shown that there was only a 3                        conglomerate
                                                         ft.

Laminated Grits with four distinct intercalated bands          felsite;                     of

                                                               on
across, could scarcely              be
                           represented                   by
                                            this thin band. Finally,

                                          on         was shown                                    to   be
satisfactorily explained              by
                             unconformity.
     Incidentally   was mentioned that
                         it               band           a           be of   rock      in   the felsite
at    Llyn Padarn, which had been considered                    to   a         deposited         slate,
was       in   reality    an   intrusive igneous rock.
   The conglomerates described were considered                           to   be       an   overlap    of
the Bronllwyd Grit.

   The lowest beds present are bluish slates with numerous Bala

but in a grit occupying a similar position at Glyn Ceiriog numerous
fossils have been discovered. The Corwen grit is succeeded by grey
slates with grit-bands; and in Nant Cawrddu near Corwen, and
Nant Llechog near Pen-y-glog, these slates are followed by banded
black shales containing numerous graptolites of the Monograptus
gregarius-zone.    Above these are pale bluish slates; and nothing
further is exposed till we reach the Tarannons.    The Corwen Grit
clearly forms the base of the Llandovery in this area, as suggested
by Prof. Hughes.

   The following communications were read :—
    1. “Notes on Dartmoor.”          By Lieut.-General C. A. McMahon,
F.G.S.
   The author alludes to Part II. of a memoir on the British Culm
Measures recently published by Mr. Ussher, F.G.S., in which the
view is advanced that the granite of Dartmoor resulted from the
metamorphism of pre-existing rocks which had in a rigid state
offered obstruction to a long-sustained N. and S. squeeze, and that
their fusion and consequent consolidation were effected in situ.
   The author gives some of the results of a visit to the western
borders of Dartmoor.       He details some examples of eruptive granite
veins   intruding  into Culm beds in the immediate vicinity of the
main mass of      granite.   The latter, in the locality described, is
porphyritic down to        its
                           boundary, and the veins are also porphyritic.
All the circumstances lead the author         believe that these veins are
                                                     to
                                                                                     by
real apophyses from the main mass, and that the view adopted

one.     The author alludes     some features
                                    to              the Meldon granite

locality, has been produced.
   The author comments             on
                                the improbability that      tremendous
                                                                     a

                                                           a
granite should have left the Culm Measures outside the zone                          of

   2. “On some Recent Borings through          the Lower Cretaceous
Strata in East Lincolnshire.” By A.          J.  Jukes-Browne, Esq.,
B.A., F.G.S.
   The borings described in this paper are at Alford, Willoughby,
and Skegness, and disclose the existence of an unsuspected anticlinal
axis bringing up Lower Cretaceous rocks beneath the Drift.    In the
Willoughby boring, beneath the Drift, a brown sand was obtained,
apparently the ‘Roach' division of the Lower Cretaceous, and below
it the Tealby Clays (108 feet), oolitic ferruginous beds (18 feet),
and sandstone and sand regarded as the Spilsby Sandstone.     In the
Alford boring the highest solid rock appears to belong to the basal
beds of the Red Chalk, and below it is Carstone, and then clay.
   The axis of the anticlinal appears to pass between Alford and the
border of the Wolds, and is probably continued in a north-westerly
direction beyond the village of Claythorpe.
   The result of the information now obtained makes it probable
that the Chalk tract which lies to the south-east of the Calceby
valley is completely isolated from the rest of the Chalk area.

SOME CORRECTIONS TO A PAPER ON THE LAWS OF MOLECULAR
                        FORCE.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
W
       ITH  your permission       I
                                should like to make some corrections
       in my  paper on the  Laws  of Molecular Force, published in the
Philosophical Magazine for March of this year.         In Section 2,
page 222, it is stated that the equation for element gases is almost
identical with that of Van der Waals but is a little simpler.     This
is a mistake, for the equation is absolutely that of Van der Waals.
At the end of Section 4 and in Section 5 and elsewhere, the term
which in the characteristic equation contains the absolute tempera
ture T as a factor is spoken of as the kinetic-energy term, and is
assumed to represent kinetic energy.        This is an error, for the
term includes also the virial of the forces called into play during
the collisions of molecules. To anyone who has read my paper on
a Kinetic Theory of Solids (Phil. Mag. December 1891) the error
will appear a strange one, seeing that the Virial of the collisional
 forces is there treated as of fundamental importance; but the
 paper on Solids, though published before that on Molecular Force,
 was written after     it,
                        and circumstances prevented my correcting
 the mistake   inthe earlier paper before it was read    the Physical

ON    A   REMARKABLE PHENOMENON OF OXIDATION OF PURE
    ALUMINIUM WHEN IN CONTACT WITH MERCURY.                    BY E. O.
    ERDMANN.
    As soon   as the two metals are in actual contact, snow-white
filiform or  straw-shaped    formations result, growing from the point
of contact of the two       metals,  which in a few minutes acquire a
length of 2 to 3 centim.        Under the microscope they appear as
tube-shaped or plate-shaped veils, of extreme delicacy and per
fectly amorphous.        If they are detached by tapping or shaking
they look like lint. Chemical investigation shows that they consist
of pure aluminium hydrate.
    It is immaterial for the formation of this oxide whether the
contact between the metals is effected by rubbing, or whether the
surfaces are purified with hydrochloric acid or caustic soda, and
subsequent washing with much water and drying with blotting
p aider.
    }.   cause of this peculiar oxidation might be sought for in :—
    (1) The formation of an easily oxidizable amalgam of aluminium,
which always forms at the surface of contact in the degree in
which aluminium oxidizes in moist air.
    (2) The electrolytic decomposition of a thin layer of water,
which is condensed on the surfaces of the two metals which form
the element.
    (3) That the highly positive aluminium by contact with mercury
acquires a greater affinity for oxygen, in the same manner as,
according to Magnus, iron-filings do when hanging to a magnet.—

ON    THE PROCESSES WHICH TAKE PLACE AT THE BOUNDARY
    BETWEEN TWO SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATION
    WHEN A CURRENT IS PASSED.            BY GEORGE H. ZAHN.
    The results of these experiments are stated by the author as
follows.     Besides the well-known formation of hydroxides of
magnesium, calcium, and copper above the boundary of a dilute
solution over a concentrated one of the same salt when an elec
trical current passes from the concentrated to the dilute solution,
it is possible, when the concentrations are very different, to   observe
the formation of a solid with barium, strontium, aluminium, iron,
manganese, and zinc in combination with several acids.             Silver
does not exhibit such a behaviour.        In each case, even with silver,
and with the salts of potassium and of sodium, which form readily

soluble hydrates, an alkaline reaction is observed above the bound
ary in the dilute solution,  even with no great difference of con
centration when    dimethyl-orange    is present, but not with less
sensitive reagents.   Gmelin" found in the electrolysis of Na SO,
in water, and of  CaM,0,   in water, in the presence of tincture of
mallow, that the formation of acid or of alkali started from the
electrode, and proceeded slowly towards the boundary.         Davy
observed this also with K.SO, in water and solution of litmus.
    Observations made using the far more sensitive dimethyl-orange
as reagent do not confirm this.       A rapid alkalinity is observed
about a millimetre above the boundary, and with great differences
of concentration the reaction takes place as rapidly above the
boundary as at the electrode.
    As regards the cause of this deposition at the boundary, which
was first observed by Faraday in the case of magnesium sulphate,
G. Wiedemannt ascribes it to the different degrees of migration
in the solutions.      Kohlrausch        f
                                       has objected to this, that a
difference-rate of migration of the two solutions can only affect
the change of concentration at the boundary, but cannot produce
any excess of one ion.
   From Hittorf's numbers for the rate of migration, the following
conclusions may be formed:—                        -
   The influence of dilution on the rate of migration is seen to
differ with the nature of the electrolyte.    In most cases the migra
tion of the anion decreases with increasing dilution, that of the
kation increases in the same degree. With chloride of potassium
the rates of migration are independent of the concentration; with
the nitrates of silver, potassium, and sodium, the migration of the
anion increases with dilution, that of the kation decreases.
  If  now the processes above the boundary had their origin in the
difference of the values for the migration a formation of hydrate
might take place in most cases, potassium chloride could show no
change above the boundary independent of differences of concen
tration, or at any rate very small ones, while with nitrates of
silver, potassium, and sodium a formation of acid is to be expected.
But the experiments, using dimethyl-orange as a reagent, are in
disagreement with this; for with the same direction of current
chloride of potassium as well as the last-mentioned salts show the
same behaviour above the boundary as the other solutions.
   Hence there remains so far only Kohlrausch's explanation, which
sees in the action of water in electrolysis the cause of the processes
at the boundary, and according to which these phenomena must
necessarily follow.    It would be desirable that the experiments
should be made on a sufficiently large scale to examine the products
qualitatively and quantitatively.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 4,

 XV.      Studies of the Phenomena of Simultaneous Contrast
     Colour; and on a Photometer for Measuring the Intensities
     of Lights of different Colours. By ALFRED M. MAYER".
     T  is often desirable in the study of simultaneous contrast
       colours to have large surfaces coloured by contrast, so
 that we can the better match the colours of these surfaces
 with rotating coloured disks and thus arrive at quantitative
 statements     of their hues. This is especially desirable in
ascertaining the hues of the light of flames, of the Welsbach
incandescent lamp, and of the arc electric light when com
   ared with daylight, or when compared one with another.
 The result of many experiments is the apparatus described in
the following section and which is useful for this purpose.
    Screen for ascertaining the Hues of Lights and the Contrast
 Colours of these Lights.-A ring is formed of white card
board by cutting out a central opening of 12 centim. in dia
meter in a disk of 22 centim. in diameter. This ring has a
breadth of 5 centim. Another ring is made similar to this
one, except that it has four narrow radial arms to support a
disk of thin translucent white paperf 35 centim. in diameter.
 This paper disk is placed between the rings, which are then
 fastened together and screwed to a thin rod, on a stand, as
 shown in fig. 1.

    Eageriments on the Complementary Colours of Gratings.-
 Out of thin cardboard, such as is used for thin visiting-cards,
 I cut gratings with a dividing-engine (see fig. 6). The widths
of the spaces cut out of these gra
tings exactly equalled the breadths
of the cardboard left in the grating.
Gratings were thus made having
spaces of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 millim.
                  I
 The cardboard rendered opaque by
 coating one side of it with ivory
black     in dilute shellac-varnish.
 After it has dried, the cardboard is
 well flattened before it is fastened
 to the surface of a piece of hard
 wood on the dividing-engine.       The              Fig. 6.
 cutting-edge of the cutter for this
 work must have a very acute angle.       I  made one by grinding
 down a rod of Stubs' steel.      Heating this to a dull cherry-red
 and then forcing it into a large ball of beeswax gives the edge
 of the cutter the required temper, without the necessity of
subsequently “letting it down.” The blackened side of the
gratings was covered with the
 “Alba tracing-paper.”        The
grating was mounted back of
                                          N

    A mode of observation by which Contrast-Colours are Inten
sified.—Simultaneous contrast-colours are generally viewed
by placing grey or tinted surfaces on coloured grounds, or by
                                                     *
the juxtaposition of coloured surfaces.        The effects thus pro
duced are of such constant occurrence in the paintings of
artists, and in coloured fabrics, that their study is of great
interest. The contrast-colours thus produced have generally
been studied by simply placing on a coloured                 smaller
grey or tinted surfaces and observing these with the unaided
eye.     This method has been improved by H. Meyer", who
viewed the grey on the coloured ground when both were
covered with white transparent paper.
   The mode of observation       I have devised for the study of
contrast-colours is as follows:—A glass tube of 2:7 centim. in
interior diameter and 10 centim. long is coated on the outside
with black Japan varnish, so as to have reflexion only from the
interior surface of the tube. A ring of 3 centim. in diameter
with a central opening of 2 centim. is cut out of grey
The grey of this ring was matched on the rotator by a disk    !".
having 57 parts of ivory-black and 43 parts of white Bristol
board.     This ring, placed on a surface of emerald-green,
appears of a rose colour.      If at the distance of distinct vision
we look at the ring through the tube, we shall see the ring
by direct vision enclosing a circle of green and surrounded by

a  ring of emerald-green, and this enclosed by a rose-coloured
ring, produced by reflexion from the interior of the tube, and
surrounding this ring is another of emerald-green, as shown
in fig. 9, in which R and R
are the red rings and G, G,
and G the circle and the two
 rings of emerald-green.
      he  hue of the rose
coloured rings, as seen through
the tube, is much more               in

 of “               violet R.R.R.” + 34 parts of ivory-black

 vermilion + 15 of “ Hoffman's violet R.R.R.” + 28 of white
 Bristol board.
   Another tube, 4.5 centim, in diameter and 18 centim. long,
gave excellent results, with two reflected rings, and on nearer
vision, with four reflected rings.       A tube, suitable for these

green, though decided, is not strongly marked ; but if viewed
through the reflecting-tube the ring on the cobalt-blue appears
of a rather intense orange, and the ring on the emerald-green
appears of a rose-colour.   When so viewed the difference in
   ese hues is strongly marked.
   Pieces of cardboard, painted with the following colours,
were arranged in pairs. Orange-yellow on the less refran
gible side of D, and orange-yellow on the more refrangible side
of D. Greenish-yellow and yellowish-green, both made with
gamboge and Prussian blue.        Purple of violet end of spec
trum with added     red, made with Hoffman's violet R.R.R.,
and violet between G and H, Young and Müller's funda
mental colour.     Place a pair of the colours, as given above,
side  by side and on each put a grey ring, with a reflecting
tube over each ring. When viewed by the unassisted eye
the differences in hue are slight and difficult to define ; but
when viewed in rapid succession through the adjoining tubes
the differences in hue are decided and may be readily matched
in colour with disks on the rotator.

can be held uniform and also accurately measured.                        On
gradually narrowing the opening in the slit, the duration of
vision of the blue and grey square was reduced to Tºyo of a
second, when the blue half of the square could not                      dis
tinguished from the grey half.
   When the screen was illuminated by a more orange light,
                i.
obtained by placing a sheet of orange gelatine between the
lamp and          screen, the grey and blue were not distinguish
able when the duration of vision was lºop of a second.
   In these experiments I only got 11-6 flashes of light from
the screen in a second, while the number of flashes required
                  flickering from the screen was accurately mea

orange gelatine film.           These experiments show, what            well                            is

   The grey ring was placed on the emerald-green ground near
a Holtz machine, which gave a very bright flash of 8 centim.
long. The condensing surface on the two jars connected with
the electrodes of this machine equalled 135 square centi
metres.   Professor O. N. Rood" measured the duration of the
flash of Leyden jars of 738 and 71 square centimetres of
gº
surface, charged by an inductorium.       The durations of the
discharges of these jars were respectively grºom second and
            of a second.    From these measures I infer that

the roooºooo of a second.        With short striking distances

 seen reflected from the top surface                 green glass and from

    Many careful experiments made                                by
                                                     me and others, using
 as   chronometer three       pairs        forks   of  the octave      ofUT.                 of
 giving respectively 10, 12, and                          15
                                                beats per second, showed
 that certainly the interval between the flash and the per

                 of Simultaneous Contrast-Colour.                165
ception of the colours was much less than 1% of a second.
Indeed, on viewing the flash and the illuminated surfaces at
the same time, or, hearing the discharge and viewing only the
illuminated ring, no interval could be detected by this mode
of observation as existing between the instant of the flash and
the perception of the colours, and we certainly could have
detected a shorter interval than 1% of a second had it existed.
    Incidentally,   I will here state that when different geome
trical or   irregular  figures cut out of white paper and placed
on an ivory-black ground were
 flash, the observer, so far as    I
                                       imº           by the electric
                                     could ascertain, formed con
clusions as to the forms of the pieces of paper in an interval
of time less than the
                           º,"  a second.    Certainly the interval
of time required to reach a conclusion as to the contrast-colour
was less than the <U+017F>º of a second.            Professor Mendenhall
in 1871 (Amer. Journ. Sci.) gives 0.292 sec. for the time
 required by an observer to respond, by means of an electric
chronograph, to the appearance of a white card. When the
 observer responds by touching the circuit-key with one hand
when a white card appears, and with the other hand when a
 red card appears, Professor Mendenhall finds 0.443 sec. as
the time required for the response.          Subtracting the first
 number from the last he obtains        151,  or   sec., as the time
 to form a judgment between white and red. Similar experi
 ments gave him 0.202, or ; sec., as the time to judge whether
 a circle or a triangle appeared to the observer. The inter
 vention of the operation of brain, nerve, and muscle before
 the response is recorded involves complex operations, and the
 action of right or left sides of brain when the two hands are
 used.     It appears that the plan of eliminating these actions,
 and thus obtaining a residual time which is attributed to the
 interval required to form a judgment of colour or of form, is
 faulty.     I am sure that if estimation of the time required for
 such mental operations is made by the continuous indications
 of the beats of forks, such intervals as , and of a second
 will at once appear much in excess of the time respectively
 required to form a conclusion as to whether a white or red
 colour or a circle or triangle has been presented to our vision.
     It is here to be noted that although the after-images of the
 contrast-colours seen in the light of the electric flash lasted
 about ; of a second, yet the most careful scrutiny could detect
 no change in sensation at and immediately following the flash.

 The contrast-colours, so far as and others observed, appeared
 at the moment of the flash. After the instant the image of
 the flash is formed on the retina there exists, no doubt, an
 interval of time before we are conscious of the stimulus,
 whose effects are seen rapidly to rise and then more gradually

the        same colours were distinctly  seen apparently at the
moment of the discharge. Can one “exercise his judgment
and divide between the two images the difference in colour
which really exists’’ in an interval of time which is less than
 's   of a second *
      In     experiment of the coloured shadows cast by the
            the
candle and by daylight, these colours are explained by Von
Bezold (pp. 152, 153), as follows:—“The spot occupied                 the                 iy
blue shadow is illuminated by the white daylight, the larger
white surface by daylight and by candle-light, the other shadow
by candle-light only.        It might be presumed, therefore, that
one of the shadows would appear white, the other yellow.
This is not the case, however; for knowing the surface to be
white we still take it to be white after it has really received
the yellow light of the candle.        Our judgment is led astray
regarding white, and hence we believe the place occupied by
the second shadow to be blue, although it is actually white.”
Helmholtz (‘Lectures,’ London, 1873, p. 267), says:—“Thus
in the experiment described above of coloured shadows thrown
by daylight and candle-light, the doubly illuminated surface
of the paper being the brightest object seen gives, a false
criterion for white. Compared with                the          white butit,    *i;

                                    the candle looks blue.”        These
explanations assume knowledge and conditions which are not
essential.         this knowledge and these conditions were

 necessary       see the phenomena
                      to                 then these explanations                                 of
the phenomena might            convincing     but the conditions they

 assume are not     necessary.    The  following      experiments show

tainly a very good description.
    Having in mind the facts established by the foregoing ex
periments, it seems to me that we have either to regard the
phenomena of simultaneous contrast-colour as psychical phe
nomena of which no satisfactory explanation has been given,
or we must discard the Young-Helmholtz hypothesis of colour
sensation and adopt one similar to that of Hering, which gives
a direct physiological explanation of contrast-colour effects
without the psychological considerations which those who
adopt the Young-Helmholtz hypothesis are obliged to resort
to in their explanation of these phenomena; and which ex
planations, as   I have attempted to show, are faulty, and have
to be modified to be convincing.
   According to Hering's hypothesis of colour-sensations, when
a  portion  of the retina is stimulated adjoining portions of the
field of view are affected by a sort of inductive action ; so
that changes are produced which are antagonistic or comple
mentary to those portions of the retina actually stimulated.
   M. Foster in his “Physiology, Lond. 1891, Part IV.,
bk. iii., gives an excellent discussion of the relative merits of
the Young-Helmholtz hypothesis and Hering's in explaining
colour-sensations.     In conclusion he writes:—“... so far as
we are aware no crucial test between the two has as yet been
brought forward.       We may now leave the matter with the
remark    that, while the Young-Helmholtz theory tends to lead
us direct from the retinal image to the psychological question
ing of the sensations, and seems to offer no bridge between
the first step and the last, Hering's theory is distinctly a
physiological theory, and at least holds out for us the promise
of being able to push the physiological explanation nearer
and nearer home before we are obliged to take refuge in the
methods of psychology.”

 170     Mr. A. M. Mayer on      a Photometer     for Measuring
 appeared    white tinted with blue. The hues were the same as
 described in the experiment with the large disk, fig. 8, onl
 the surfaces appeared brighter by contrast with the blac
 centre and border.                           -
     The feeble character of the hues on the photometer-disk
                          I
 led me to hope that could bring these to the same hue on
 both sides of the disk by the effects of contrast. To accom
 plish this I placed on the daylight side of the photometer
 disk a compound disk formed of three split disks, one of red
 lead, one of chrome-yellow, the other of white Bristol board.
 On the lamp-light side     I placed a disk formed of three split
 disks—coloured ultramarine, emerald-green, and one of white
 Bristol board. On rotation, the compound disk on the
 light side gave an orange-yellow ; on the lamp-light side the    ".
 disk gave a bluish-green. These colours corresponded in hue
to those seen on the respective sides of the ring of the pho
 tometer-disk when it is rotated, only the hues were much
more saturated. After a few trials          I   brought, by the con
trast effects of these coloured    disks, the tints on the two sides
               i.
of the ring of the photometer to the same hue ; the translucent
ring appearing white with a very slight orange-yellow tint on
both of its             The greenish-blue had by contrast effect
obliterated the blue tint of the ring and even replaced it by
a very feeble orange-yellow ; while on the other side of the
ring the orange-yellow disk had diminished the orange-yellow
tint of the ring to the same feeble orange-yellow as seen on
the other side of the ring.
.
    Experiments were now made to test this apparatus as a
photometer. Equality of illumination cannot be determined
with any precision if the two surfaces compared differ even
slightly in hue. Here we had the same hue to deal with on
       sides of the ring ; which condition is different from the
                                                     ~~T-
Bunsen photometer, on which we have two
colours on each side of the disk. Various
methods were tried to render reliable the
comparison of the illumination of the two
sides.
    (1)  I used the eye alone, regarding only
the   portions of the ring on the border near
the mirror, as shown in fig. 14.
    (2) Two prisms reflected the images of
portions of the sides of the ring nearest                NZ7
the mirror to juxtaposition, as shown in                  Fig.15.
fig. 15.
    (3) A tube blackened on the inside, with a black screen on
the end next the disk, as shown in fig. 16, was used. The

eye was thus shielded from extraneous light and the com
parisons of illuminations was made, as in experiments 1 and 2,
on the portions of the rings which
were nearest the mirror, as shown in
fig. 16.   Vision through this screened
tube gave the best results.
   After practice in such comparisons,
made during several hours on differ
ent days,       I
                became more and more
skilful and the results of measure
ments become more concordant;            but
such methods of       photometry     do not
approach the accuracy of those in
which two contiguous surfaces of differ-          Fig. 16.
ent   degrees  of  translucency     coalesce
into one surface of a uniform illumination, as happens on the
balance of illuminations on the two sides of a Bunsen-photo
meter disk when these are illuminated by lights of the same
intensity and of exactly the same hue.         A photometer for
this mode of observation is described in the following section.
It has, however, the advantage over the Bunsen photometer
in that it serves to measure the intensities of differently
                                                              |.

 The side of the ring facing the Welsbach lamp is coloured
greenish-orange.     This greenish orange was matched in hue,
but not in luminosity, by a rotating disk having 41-5 parts of
red-lead, 41-5 of chrome-yellow, and 17 of emerald-green,
viewed illuminated by daylight. This appears to be the hue
of the Welsbach light when compared with daylight.
   Experiments in which are compared the Hues of the Light of
an Incandescent Welsbach Lamp and of Candle-light.—When
“a white-light incandescent Welsbach lamp” is placed on one
side of the large screen (fig. 1) and a candle or petroleum
flame on the other side, the cardboard ring of the screen
facing the Welsbach light appears of a light bluish-green ;
the side of the ring facing the candle or petroleum-flame
appears of a light carmine.
   Matching these hues on the rotator with split disks gave
the following results when the two sides of the screen were
equally illuminated.    The hue of the ring on the side facing
the Welsbach    lamp  was matched by 8 parts of emerald-green,
10 of  cobalt-blue,  25 of ivory-black, and 57 parts of white
Bristol board, as seen illuminated by the Welsbach lamp,
The hue on the side of the ring facing the candle or petro
leum-flame was matched by 12 of carmine, 17 of ivory-black,
and 71 of white cardboard, as seen illuminated by the petro
leum-flame.

rotating the photometer-disk, without any central disks,
between these lights, the same hues as those already de
scribed were seen on                 its
                              sides, only those hues were much

 on the other side a standard candle. As the candle
 was gradually brought nearer the rotating photo
 meter, the illumination and hues of the portions a
 and b (fig. 17) of the photometric ring approached
 equality, and when the candle was at a certain
 distance the difference of illumination and hues
 of a and b become indistinguishable, and only a
 band with a breadth of a + b with a uniform
 surface was observed on the sides of the photo
 metric ring.
    The measures of the intensity of the light of the
 Welsbach lamp in terms of the standard candle
 were made by a friend. He made sixteen measures
 with my Rotating-disk Photometer and sixteen
 with the Bunsen Photometer.
    The mean of the series of measures made with
the Rotating-disk       Photometer differed from the
 mean of the     departure of the maximum and mini
mum measures from the mean by 1:49 per cent.

lamp.                 º

intensity of the light of the Welsbach lamp.

1.  TN     the Phil. Trans., 1892, p. 685,      I have developed a
        modification of Maxwell's electrical theory. As frequent
mention of this paper will be made below, it will be referred
to briefly as :                      The principal object of the
paper was to free Maxwell's theory from certain difficulties       I
                                              I
felt in applying it to gross matter, but was careful to point
out at the beginning that the theory developed might require
serious modification for the aether. The principal object of
the present paper is briefly to consider what - modifications, if
any, are required.                    -
    2. We shall require a proposition analogous to Prop. I.

Before considering this case a word or two of general import
will be given.
  I  cannot see that Maxwell has shown his right to ignore,
as he does in considering the propagation of waves, the
equation of motion of the medium.        It is not hard to show
that we may disregard it if we accept his equations as literally
true for rapid waves in a medium of ordinary density.         But
may we do so for the aether, and may we do so in the case of
gases where the gross matter present has practically no effect
on electrical actions?
   By ignoring the equation Maxwell is led to the conclusion
that the aether when it is excited by electromagnetic waves
exerts a pressure on gross matter. What is the effect of this
pressure after it has left the sun and before it has again
reached gross matter?      It must have some effect on the aether,
but the  equations  expressing  that effect are wanting.       we                            If
tie ourselves down to a strict dynamical theory these equa
tions appear, and we have to decide what is their meaning.
In case    I.,  the present hypothesis, there
                 on                                  doubt            is      no             at    all
about the   meaning.       can      It            be

or    bysaying that the Poynting intensity remains constant
for  every  element            of
                          the aether.         follows also that there
                                                       It                                           is

                                         an               the question on                           of
whether     or not the aether can exert        pressurea    gross matter.     on
    Are these results consistent with                             an
                                                        electromagnetic
theory     oflight?        think they are not, but this
                           I                                       not                  is          on
account     of the most obvious apparent consequences.               Take,
for  instance,   the fact      the   constancy
                                    of                the   Poynting
                                                                 of                                in
tensity.     From this we deduce that             any part  if  the aether         of
were ever electrically           rest the actual displacement and
                                         at
magnetic force for that part would always                 parallel, and
                                                                      forbe
                                                                                                   if
the   displacement    and   magnetic    force were       any  part     the                   of
 aether ever not parallel that part could never come electrically              -
to rest.

 180           Mr. A. M'Aulay      on a Modification
  moving, and in case of a forced irregular disturbance would
  move with velocities comparable with that of light. This
 will explain how we can on the present hypothesis account
for the encroachment with sufficient rapidity of light waves
 on a previously dark region.
    But there is a difficulty  I have not been able to surmount.
 Eq. (14) is not linear in the electromagnetic vectors, and
hence in general the superposition of two solutions of our
 equations does not give a third solution.     I will show directly
 how a single plane wave which is sufficiently arbitrary to
 leave room for the explanation of polarized light &c. can be
 borne by our aether, but I have failed in the endeavour to see
 what the effect on each other of two plane waves inclined to
one another would be. It looks as if they must be altered in
kind by their encounter, and this is contrary to several optical
facts.
    9. Without further preface I proceed to the consideration
of case I. It may be remarked that a great part of the work
below relating to this case is applicable to ordinary dielectrics,
so that though   I am inclined to reject the case, the work is
not thrown away.
    Our equations are now (5), (11), and (14). Equations (11)
are for present purposes more conveniently written by eq.
(23) $ 63 of ‘Electromag.’
              (4T)-v'H'-OD/ot        +Wv'VD'a'

the V being unnecessary before V'H' and V'E' when K' and
a' are constant scalars, as we suppose to be the case for the
aether.   Putting now

    With this notation   eq. (14) becomes
                   V(Eov'E,--Hov'H)=0.            .    . . .   (18)
    Notice that if a' is zero equations (17) reduce to Maxwell's.
Hence any solution of Maxwell's which also satisfies eq. (18),
or, what amounts to the same, when o' is zero any solution of
Maxwell’s which renders WE, Ho constant at every point is a
solution also of our problem. We shall be led to such a
solution below.
    10. The only case   I have been able to discuss is a plane

186                 Mr. A. M*Aulay on a Modification
   15.   However this be, our ideas would be greatly simplified
if Maxwell’s ignoration of the equilibrium equation could be
justified by some suitable modification of the fundamental
 assumptions.
    Let us now assume that the aether has a material density
 sufficiently large to render a 'small compared with the velocity
 of light. This is case II. of § 6 above. In this case Maxwell's
 ignoration will be justified.
    To     fix
            the ideas        let   us

    Since we now suppose the velocity             small and oscilla

                              Dr. W. Pole on Colour-Blindness.                                          189
     As        the theory embodied
                           in it is a matter of constant com
ment whenever colour-blindness comes under discussion, it
may not be amiss to give to the English public some account
of the author's own manner of stating his opinions, which                                                   I
am enabled to do with his concurrence.
   The title of the paper is “An Essay towards the Explana
tion of Colour-Blindness by the Theory of Opposite Colours,”
and it is divided into five sections.                       -
     In        the       First Section, headed “Some passages from the
Theory,” the author explains generally what the theory                                                      is,
so far          as
            necessary for the purpose    view, giving par                       in
ticularly            an is
            explanation     the term  “Gegenfarben.”  of
                                                       He
holds that there are essentially six simple visual sensations—
white, black, yellow, blue, red, and green,            the mixtures                    by                   of
which,     different proportions,
                in                                              all
                                          colour-impressions arise.
                      white and black produces various degrees
                                  he of
   The mixture
    grey, which                         present,      some extent,

all of
                      believes                         to                          to                       in
    colour-impressions.       But the result       mixing the other             of
coloured sensations depends                                 on
                                        certain relations which the
four fundamental colours yellow, blue, red, and green have
to   each other.             found that more than two of these
                                       It   is
can never       recognized
                         be      the same mixture, and that certain
                                                    in
pairs          of
          them cannot both appear             the same hue.      Hence in
the two colours    forming    such     pair  are called   Gegenfarben,

i.e. opposed,      contrary,  or   antagonistic colours. There are
                                                      or
two such opposed pairs yellow and blue,         :      certain definite              in
hues, form one pair; red and green,             certain definite hues,     in
form the other pair. The yellow, for example, may combine
with red, forming           new compound colour,
                                          a                  which the                       in
yellow and red are both recognizable                       with green,            ;         or
forming     yellow-green
                     a          which both yellow and green are
                                                 in
recognizable; but          cannot form    it  new compound colour     a
with           its
           opposite   blue;   for,  put  what proportions you will
(except the   neutralizing    ones),  the mixture will not give any
new hue, but will remain either blue              yellow.    Similarly,

         e     precise hues         of    his four Urfarben,          or   fundamental colours, were,       in
this publication, left undetermined, but they have since been pretty
nearly settled. The yellow and blue pair agree fairly with the ordinary
ideas attached     the names, but the fundamental red and green

 do      so,

neutral hues    the red-green blind.

   The remainder of this section explains certain physiological
or psychophysiological functions of vision by which the author
conceives that the colour-sensations may be produced, and
their peculiar relations accounted for. For these the earlier
Memoir may be referred                                to.
                                 The most relevant proposition
  is,
    that     any  pair
                   in       opposite        of
                                     colours the two sensations
are produced                      by
                      contrary actions       the same excitable        on
substance.    The author's views         these points have been  on
much   controverted,   but the discussions upon them          not                                   do
immediately affect the general nature           the colour-blind                of

   The Third Section contains “General observations on Colour
blindness.”
   After remarking on various possible disturbances of colour
vision, as to which theory can give no account, the author
states that it follows definitely from his doctrine that an eye
which has no sensation of red can have no sensation of green
and vice versä ; and similarly for yellow and blue.
   Now it appears that there are actually eyes for which the rays
of light give no red and also no green sensations, while the
yellow, blue, and white colour-effects remain, either as in the
normal eye, or with modifications.      Such eyes are red-green
blind.       ether there is a corresponding   blue-yellow blind
ness, with vision of red and green, is uncertain; but there
appear to be cases where both pairs fail, i.e. blindness to                       all

      The author points out that if we suppose the red and green
elements     to be removed from normal vision, the blue, yellow,
white, and black sensations remaining as before, then the
impressions given by the spectrum will be exactly as they
are described in the colour-blind cases. The patient will see
the first half of the spectrum a pure yellow, and the second
 half a pure blue; but both will be modified in different
 places with different nuances and degrees of saturation.
...   Before reaching the point which corresponds                  the normal                to

beginning   with rays of a smaller wave-length than corre
spond to the extreme red. The longer waves have then little
or no yellow effect; and since the white effect is also wanting
there, the spectrum appears shortened at the red end.
                     yº
   Kries and Küster found that the red end appeared more
saturated than the           so that red-green blind persons
can distinguish rightly a saturated red of the hue of the
spectral red from yellow ; they understand by red a highly
saturated yellow.   Such persons, if their spectrum is not
shortened, probably see, instead of the spectral red, a yellow
of higher saturation than normal eyes can ever see. For
with the latter the pure yellow hue is strongly mixed with
white; and as they go to orange and beyond, the yellow
becomes more and more overpowered by the red sensation.
   Hering determined the hue of red which red-green, blind
persons matched with grey.       He took a paper of the hue of
spectral red, but which to him had clearly a yellow tinge,
and he found that this required, to render it neutral, blue
in different proportions for different patients; those with
full-length spectrum, and the neutral point nearer the line E,
required much blue; those with shortened spectrum; and the
neutral point nearer F, required less blue.
    The red thus obtained, and which the red-green blind eye
matches with a certain grey, will appear to a normal eye
sometimes more blue and sometimes more yellow.            It tends
more to purple the farther the neutral point lies towards the
 green, and more to the spectral red the farther it lies towards
 the blue.     The grey matching red will, for a shortened
 spectrum, appear to the normal eye much darker than this
 red.
    The neutral green and the neutral red of any red-green
 blind person may be matched with each other by adding
 white or black. And their mixture will also produce white
 for the normal eye, which proves them to be true comple
 mentary colours.
    The author says:—“I have obtained above 100 equations in
 this way, with ten different colours, from four red-green blind

 see yellow exactly alike.      If   anyone chooses      to  assert
 that one   of   them sees blue where the other sees yellow,     we
  cannot contradict him, nor can he,       the other hand, prove

      instrument described below was devised      Professor                     by
THEStroud   some three years ago, with the view of having a
volumenometer which should be capable of yielding more
accurate results than could be obtained by the older methods.
After the instrument was made some preliminary trials
showed that considerable difficulties would be encountered
in making the instrument air-tight, and in consequence of
the pressure of other work the instrument was put on one
side till last October, when it was placed in my hands.
   Various instruments, the principle of whose action is based
on Boyle's law, have been devised with the object of deter
mining the volumes of bodies without immersing them in
liquids. . The ordinary, volumenometer devised by Say is
described in textbooks, but a little calculation shows that no
great accuracy can be obtained by           use.     Rüdorff's  its             In

Messrs. Gee and Harden” suggest a method of determining
the volumes of bodies, depending on the gravimetrical esti
mation of the carbon dioxide occupying a vessel of known
volume in which the body whose volume is required is placed.
However, since a cubic centimetre of carbon-dioxide gas
weighs only .0020 gramme, it is clear that the accuracy
attainable in determining small volumes by this method can
not be very great. The volumenometer about to be described
has proved itself capable of determining the volumes of bodies
with as great expedition and much greater accuracy than any
of the instruments above noticed.
   Let A, B, C, D represent the volumes of the cavities of the
vessels   A, B, C, D.A is in connexion with C, and B with D,

cury shall still be at the same level in both tubes is that the
volume-ratios
                     i. and }     shall be equal.     This principle forms
the basis of action of the instrument.       The vessel B contains
mercury, the quantity of which may be reduced by opening
the tap P, and allowing some to run out. In this way the
equality of volume-ratios may readily be obtained. The two
volumes A and B can be put in communication with each other
by means of the iron tube F, which is of small bore and is
provided with a tap, G. The main difficulty encountered in
      iii.
using each of the instruments above described arises from the
 necessity of hermetically closing the cavity of the instrument.
 This              we have successfully surmounted by providing
 that the pressures on the under and upper surfaces of the cap
 employed to close the instrument shall be approximately
 equal. The device employed will be readily understood by
 reference to figs. 1 and 2. C, D, and M are glass pipettes,
 each of about 20 cub. centim. capacity. They differ from
 ordinary pipettes in one particular, the upper attachments of
 the bulbs consisting of glass tubes of capillary bore (1 millim.
 diameter).      The top of the pipette C communicates with the
 cavity of A. By means of the screw-cap E it will be seen
 that the cavity of B is divided into two compartments, an
 upper and a lower. The pipette D communicates with the
 lower, and M with the upper compartment of the cavity of B.
 It will be clear from this, that as pressure is applied to the
 mercury in the reservoir it will force the mercury up the
 pipettes, thus compressing the air both above and below the
 screw-cap. An approximate balance of pressure is sufficient
 to guard against leakage.
     The lower extremities of the pipettes are connected to an
 iron portion N, which is in communication with the reser
  voir O, containing mercury, to which the arrangement for
  applying pressure Q, is attached.
     At the places of juncture of the pipettes and the iron por
  tions, iron pieces whose diameter is equal to the diameter of
  the pipettes are screwed           The joints are made air-tight

                          ë will        be greater than the ratio            }     In   order
to equalize these ratios mercury is run out by opening the
tap P.     Repeated trials must be made by running out small
quantities,               and then reapplying the pressure after
the vessels A and B have been put in communication with
each other and with the external atmosphere.        The adjust
ment is complete when the mercury stands at the same
horizontal level in both limbs of the manometer, after appli
cation of the pressure employed. The instrument is now
ready for use.
    It is of importance that the pressures in the vessels A and
B shall be identical at the commencement of each experiment.
This equalization is effected by means of the tap G. The
 body whose volume is required is placed inside the cavity, the
screw-cap replaced, and pressure applied to such an extent that
 the compression is the same as in the preliminary adjustment,
 as indicated by the level of mercury in the tube c.   Owing to
 the diminished volume due to the introduction of the body, a
 further quantity of mercury must be run out in order that
 the manometer may not indicate any difference of pressure.
 The quantity which runs out is collected and carefully
 weighed.      Calculation shows that the product of the weight
 multiplied by the constant of the instrument gives the volume
 required.     For        let
                           represent the volume

XIX.      The Magnetic Field close to the Surface of a Wire con
     veying an Electrical Current.   By Professor G. M. MINCHIN,
           #                       -
A" I   a meeting of the Physical Society on March 10, 1893f,
         gave an expression for the conical (“solid") angle
subtended at any point, P, in space by a circle occupying any
 osition.
   When the circle is the seat of an electric current, this
conical angle is the measure of the magnetic potential pro
duced at #. by the current.     The conical angle is usually
expressed by a series of spherical harmonics, or, rather, by
two such series, one of which is to be used when the distance
of P from the centre of the circle is less than the radius of
the circle, and the other when it is greater.   The expression
which       I
          have given consists of two  complete elliptic  integrals
of the third kind, which for convenience     reproduce    here.                 I

the most general problem of long-distance telephony, involving
certain terminal conditions, has been taken up by Mr. Heavi
side ; but the ordinary mathematical physicist must find great
difficulty in understanding the investigation (Phil. Mag.
January 1887). Some of my students have recently obtained
numerical results, neglecting the terminal conditions, which
seem to me to be very instructive, and    think that the Tables        I
will have a permanent value.
   As a matter of fact, the line is supposed to be of infinite
length, and we consider the state of a signal as it gets further
and further away from the origin.
   By comparing the current cat a section ºr centimetres from
the origin with the current at a +da, and properly disposing
of the difference, we arrive at the equation                                    :-

    I do   not     know what values of m and n would produce
confusion of sound in the telephone.                        But as an exercise we
have taken m=4 and n=6.                        We have also taken p-6000,
p/- 600.
    For    the     first    French Atlantic Cable the capacity and
resistance were 0.43 microfarad and 2.93 ohms per nautical
mile, so that

    Mr. Beeston           has calculated the distances X and Y, the
lesser of which        may     be taken as the limiting distance for good

   It will be noticed that although X and Y are derived in
different ways, by taking certain values for m and n they
could be made much the same in value, and altering s or l
seems to produce the same sort of effects on X and Y.
   Mr. Beeston has drawn curves from the calculated numbers,
but these need not be published.
     If
      there is no self-induction, increasing the leakage increases
the distance to which we can telephone.               there is no                                If
leakage, increasing the self-induction increases the distance.
   When the amounts of s and l are not too great, increasing
either increases, the distance.      These and other important
facts are visible in the tables.
   Without such tables as these and this method of study it
would be almost impossible for the average mathematician
to make anything of his mathematical results.           Thus, for
example, when equation         applies    such function (1)                to           a                       as       sin   pt

this age in the district, but the fault lay partly in incorrect corre
lation.
   The Dorset strata are correlated with strata in other districts—
namely, with those of Dundry and Leckhampton Hills in this
country.     Of these the author gives sections, pointing out the
emata during which the strata of those localities were deposited, and
making some alterations in their correlation.
   Passing to Württemberg, the author shows that the equivalent of
Waagen's Sowerbyi-zone is exactly represented at Sherborne.       Re
turning to Normandy, the author compares his results with the recent
                                                                       º
work done by Munier-Chalmas, who in some respects has made an
even more detailed subdivision of the strata.    In a Table he shows
the correspondence between his divisions for Dorset and those of
Munier-Chalmas in Normandy and Haug in Southern France.

beaches examined by him on the south-eastern and eastern coast, but
probably found in other parts of the island also, as indicated by the
existence of rolled stones &c. These beaches seem to prove sub
mergence (in the case of that at South Hill, to a depth of at least
 130 feet below the present level) at the end of the ‘first glacier
                                          -
period.’
   The brick-clay often lying on raised beach, and containing pebbles,
has been compared to loess by the author.      He believes that Prof.
 Prestwich's theory of sudden and rapid upheaval, with a resulting
 tumultuous sweep of water, may be applied to Jersey; but also, if
the sinking took place at the end of the Glacial Period, the peculiar
conditions produced by melting ice may have played their part in
producing the brick-clays.
    Subsequent upheaval above the present sea-level is indicated by
 submerged forests, sometimes lying on the brick-clay.
   No fossils have hitherto been found in the raised beaches; but a
bone of Bos primigenius (?) has been extracted from the brick-clay.

  193°. The two columns of mercury presented a greater or less
 difference according to the initial difference.           The equalization of
 the   mercury-levels    took   place   at 196°. The formula expressing
 the  equilibrium    of the two     parts  of the tube shows that the course
 of the difference of level corresponds very appreciably to that of the
 difference between the density of the liquid and that of the vapour.
    The phenomenon of Cagniard de Latour was observed in seven
 tubes, in which the volumes of the liquid and the vapour were, at
 the temperature of 18°-6, respectively in the following ratios:–
                4      2      1        6         4     4       7

    Comparative     experiments on several tubes heated in the same
bath have shown that the temperature at which the meniscus dis
appears is not constant for the same body, but depends on the
quantity of this body compared in a given volume.                 In the same
tube the reappearance was constantly observed at the same tem
 perature as the disappearance.—Journal             de Physique, June 1893.
THE CRITICAL PoiNT, AND THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISAP–
    PEARANCE OF THE MENISCUS WHEN A LIQUID IS HEATED
   UNDER CONSTANT VOLUME.                 B.Y. G.  ZAMBIASI.
   The fact established by the author in the above Note, that the
temperature te at which the meniscus disappears is not constant,
but rises when the ratio of the initial volume of the liquid to the
volume of the vapour disappears, might have been foreseen from
Jamin's experiments, in which the disappearance of the meniscus
was obtained by a compression at constant temperature.                     M.
Amagat has demonstrated the same fact in a still more accurate
manner in producing, by a slow increase of pressure of carbonic
acid, the disappearance at 30°50, when heat alone produces dis
appearance at 31°55. If the temperature to was singular, it would
be independent of the compression.
   It does not increase the tension, which is a maximum; but by
condensing the vapour it increases the volume and the mass of the
liquid, so that the ratio of the volumes increases.

  The densities d and d' and the volumes v and v' of the liquid

to give laws of this kind.         Prof. James Thomson may be
said to have employed it when he showed how, by observation
of successive relative positions of particles given as moving
in straight lines, the axes by reference to which their paths
are rectilinear may be determined geometrically".             Thomson
and Tait may be said to employ it also, when they show,
by a deduction from the first law, how we may, imagine
 ourselves as obtaining “fixed directions of reference” f. But
these authors make no attempt to give a formal specification
of a dynamical reference system.
    Lange employed this method in the paper referred to above,
basing his suggestion as to specification on a kinematical
result, viz. that for three, or fewer than three, points, which
are moving relatively to one another in any way whatever, it
is always possible to find a system of coordinates, indeed an
infinite number of such systems, by reference to which these
points will have rectilinear paths; while for more than three
 such points this is possible only in special circumstances. It
 follows that the law of the uniformity of the direction of
 motion of particles free from the action of force             for three                            is

   We are also asked how we can appeal to the experience of
the human race with regard to such axes *.         It must be ad
mitted that we cannot make any direct appeal. The only
dynamical axioms which can make such an appeal are axioms
applicable within, but not beyond, the narrow range of direct
experience. When we pass from the discussion of the motion
of bodies on the earth’s surface to the motion of bodies in
space, we enter a region which is outside our direct experience;
and the human race, if it is interested in such things, must
learn that the hypotheses made by philosophers to coordinate
dynamical phenomena generally, must be judged solely by
the accuracy of the deductions which flow from them.
   Possibly Prof. Lodge is not thinking of the human race
generally so much as of the race of young students. And
                   .
it is at once obvious that such an enunciation of the first law
as that suggested, for example, by Lange, is not suitable for
use in an elementary text-book or before a class of beginners.
But no one has proposed to use it in either case. The object
of writers who         sought to solve the problem under con
sideration has been   logical, not pedagogical. The beginner
deals with    simple motions of bodies on the earth's surface.
He is led to see from his own experience that, relatively to
axes fixed in the earth (the north-south, east-west, and up
down lines, say, at his place of observation), the first and
second laws hold for such simple motions. All that is necessary
at this stage is to make clear that it is relatively to such axes
that in such cases these laws are found to hold. When he
reaches such problems as those of theoretical Astronomy, he
will see at once that the laws of motion, as first enunciated,
are insufficient and that they must be generalized.       And by
that time he will have learned that axioms are not to be
accepted or rejected according as they do or do not appeal
directly to his experience, but according as the deductions
which flow from them do or do not stand the test of
observation.
    Mach's objection f to such modes of specifying axes as
those just considered is more to the point.      While he admits
that the first law may be expressed definitely by means of
them, he holds that in using them we only apparently avoid
  * This  objection ought surely not to be urged by a writer who holds to
the third law of motion as an axiom, and yet tells us that he is constantly
meeting with engineers (whose dynamical experience is of course wider
than that of most members of the human race) who refuse to admit      it.

rotation. No doubt, in practical observation of motions on
the earth’s surface or in space, we must still employ, im
mediately, points fixed in the earth, or the fixed stars,
respectively, as reference systems, and the earth's rotation as
giving us our time-scale, applying to the crude observations,
when necessary, the corrections which may have been de

theoretical justification of this course and indicate the way in

which the necessary corrections may be made more and more

in which we find                  surrounded on all sides by bodies,
at vast distances, which are moving with velocities of apparently
the same order of magnitude as our own, these bodies may be
employed as a rough reference system; that the earth, con

 246                       Prof.     J.   G. MacGregor on the
   Maxwell’s version of Newton’s argument", which he regards
as “a deduction of the third law of motion from the first,”
may, as      I        in my Address (p. 12), be attacked on two
                 showed
grounds.     First, it assumes that the attraction between the
 mountain and the remainder of the earth is the only stress
 between them, ignoring the stress at their surface of contact,
 an inequality in the action and reaction of which might ob
 viously neutralize the “residual force ’’ due to the assumed
 inequality in the action and reaction of the attraction.
 Secondly, the conclusion, thus illogically obtained, is not the
 third law of motion.      For the former asserts the equality
and opposition of the action and reaction of the stress between
two parts of a body, to which body, as a whole, the first law
has been assumed to apply, while the latter makes the same
assertion for two bodies, to each of which the first law is
applicable.   That this criticism is sound becomes especially
apparent, if we reflect that when dealing with rotation and
strain we must regard the laws of motion as applicable to
particles or elements, the first and second laws being held to
apply to each particle, and the third law to the stresses
between pairs of particles.      Maxwell’s deduced law would
apply only to the actions and reactions of the stresses between
the parts of single particles which, as Prof. Lodge says
(p. 11), are “not worth troubling about.” It would tell us
nothing about the stresses between pairs of particles, and
would thus be of no use in the solution of dynamical
problems.
    Prof. Lodge's version of Newton's argument:—“Jam the
bodies apart with a rigid obstacle, then you have reduced
                                                                (p.
their action to contact action ” &c.,       10),       condensed               is   so
that   it  hard
            is      analyse. But
                           to            easy    see that
                                                      it   isfirst        to              its
statement       incorrect.   For    when   we  “jam   the  bodies
apart” we        do is
                not reduce their action     contact action. The to
attraction continues.     We have simply introduced,        addi                         in
tion, two contact stresses.     The premisses, therefore, being
thus faulty, the conclusion cannot       warranted.        be

external force” (“Matter and Motion', Arts. lvii. and lviii.).

                    Hypotheses      of Dynamics.                   247
held to depend on how general the terms are in which that
law has been stated.     If  it can be axiomatically asserted that
the centre of mass of a rigid system moves uniformly until an
external force acts on the system, and also that the system
does not begin to spin, then the third law is established.         For
since zero acceleration means zero force, it follows that all
the internal forces add up to zero, and have no moment; and
since the system can be dissected bit by bit without ceasing
to be a system within the scope of the first law, it follows
that no stress can contain an unbalanced force or couple.”
 Here, then, we have a new deduction, on which           I would make
 two remarks :-(1) The conclusion is           obviously   too general.
 For since the    assumptions      specified are made for a rigid
system only, the “no stress” of the conclusion should clearly
 be—no stress between the parts of a rigid system.            The con
clusion would thus become        only  a  particular case of the third
law.     (2) That even this modified conclusion cannot be ob
tained without additional assumptions, and, even with them,
 by the method of dissection, may readily be shown. “All
 the internal forces add up to zero and have no moment.”
 How do we know this? Only by the aid of familiar deduc
 tions from the second law of motion. Thus the second law
 is assumed.     Dissect away one particle from the system.
 By the second law, as above, the internal forces of the re
 maining particles now add up to zero and have no moment.
 But we cannot assert this to have been true before the
 removal of the particle, unless we assume the physical inde
   endence of stresses.     If this second additional assumption
   e made,  though  we now know that the actions and reactions
 of the stresses between any one particle and the remaining
 particles add up to zero and have no moment, we cannot con
 clude that “no stress can contain an unbalanced force or
 couple,” because they would add up to zero and would have
 no moment, also, provided any inequality in the action and
 reaction of one stress, and their resultant moment, were neu
 tralized by inequalities in the actions and reactions of other
 stresses and by their resultant moment, respectively.
    While Prof. Lodge's method of dissection will not give
 even the modified conclusion, even with the aid of the above
 additional axioms, the reverse process will give it without
 his assumption as to spin.       For in a system of two particles
 the conservation of motion of the centre of mass and the
 second law together tell us that the action and reaction of the
 single stress in the system are equal and opposite. And in
 F.
 a system of any number of particles, the axiom of the
            independence of stresses tells us that the stress
   etween any two particles is the same as if there were no

 others acting, and that, therefore, in the case of                          the                                         all
 stresses action and reaction are equal and opposite.
    It       is once obvious that this argument will hold also,
                  at
 whether we restrict ourselves              rigid systems      to not. Prof.                           or
 Lodge does so, probably because                feels       cannot appealhe                he                                   to

fore the conclusion which ought to be drawn is not even
expressed in the same words as the third law.              It is also just
as obvious that even if the conclusion drawn had been war
ranted, though expressed in the same words as the third law
it would not have been the same law, because the term reaction
would be used in entirely different senses in the two laws.
    That the above efforts to deduce the third law from the
first or second should thus prove futile need not surprise us.
For the second law gives us a quantitative statement as to
the effect which is produced in a particle by a force; while
the third tells us that forces always occur as one-sided aspects
of stresses, and gives us the relation between the two forces
of which every stress consists.          Had these laws been recog
nized as being thus complementary to one another, efforts to
deduce either from the other would have been seen before
hand to be doomed to failure +, and the above dreary
refutations would not have been called for.
    (4) Prof. Lodge's Deduction of his Law of Conservation.
    Though Prof. Lodge still holds (pp. 11 & 14) that the
conservation of energy (as defined by him) “can be deduced
from Newton’s third law and from the denial of action at a
distance,” and indeed gives a new version of this deduction,
he admits that his deduction applies only to conservation
during transfer, and that conservation during residence or
“storage" is incapable of deduction f. How he reconciles
   * This seems, at first sight, not to agree with what Mach says
(Mechanik, p. 226) after having referred to the subject matter of New
ton's first and second laws, viz.:-"The third law contains apparently
something new.      We have already seen, however, that without the cor
rect conception of mass it is unintelligible, and that on the other hand,
through the conception of mass, which itself can be obtained only
through dynamical experiences, it is rendered unnecessary.”     As, accor
ding to the ordinary interpretation, the idea of mass is given in terms of
force by the second law, Mach would seem to hold that the third law is
not independent of the second. This is not the case, however.        Mach
had previously shown that if we interpret Newton's second law by the
aid of his definitions, this law does not give us a clear conception of
mass. He himself obtains the conception, without reference to force, by
an appeal to experience, which takes the place of the appeal made in the
...} aw and thus renders it unnecessary.
   f. After dismissing, with some hesitation, the “plausible" method of
establishing a law of nature by appeal to definition, he suggests that
conservation during storage should be adopted as an axiom ; but he does
not meet the argument given in my Address to show, that if we retain
Newton's laws, it is illogical to employ the law of conservation as an
axiom, and that if we adopt the latter law as an axiom, Tait's suggestion
(Ency. Brit., Art. Mechanics, $299) is the only logical one, viz., that
Newton's laws should be abandoned and the law of transference of
energy adopted instead.

250                 Prof.  J.  G. MacGregor       on the
the reiteration of his old claim with this admission we are
not told.
    With regard to my criticism of his earliest mode of making
this deduction, he replies that the appeal to experience which
 I pointed out as having been made in his argument was a mere
piece of politeness, which might have been omitted without
 affecting the argument.            I think if he will look into the
 matter he will find that if he had been less polite his
 reasoning would have been faulty.                It is unnecessary to
 occupy space in proving this, however, because the new de
 duction, given in the present paper and referred to below,
 embodies exactly the same fallacy as the old one.
     In reply to my criticism of the law of conservation de
 duced by the argument of his third paper (quite a different
 law as I pointed out from that obtained in the earlier paper,
 though Prof. Lodge does not seem to realize this), viz., that
 it was of the same nature as the law of the conservation of
 momentum, his energy as defined in that paper being con
 stant in quantity, because equal quantities of positive and
 negative energy must always be produced together, he states
 that his law is deduced from a less obvious assumption than
 the conservation of momentum.               This is possibly true ; but
 it does not affect the nature of the law deduced. The law of
 the conservation of electrical quantity is obtained in a dif
 ferent way from either, but is nevertheless a law of the same
 kind.
     The new version       of the deduction of the conservation of
 energy from the third law and the assumption of contact
 action, is based upon a new definition of energy as “the
 result of work done,” or “the result of activity lasting a
 finite time.”      As this is rather vague, work done on a body
 having a variety of results, Prof. Lodge proceeds to expound
 his definition and tells us that energy “is a name for the
 line-integral of a force, considered as a quantity that can be
 stored ” ".      Here, again, is the appeal to experience,—that
 the   line-integral    of force may be considered as a quantity
 which can be stored.             If it is introduced merely out of
 politeness, it must not be used in the argument.             If used in
 the argument, it forms an unacknowledged assumption.
     The argument is as follows:– “Bodies can only act on one
 another while in contact, hence if they move they must move
 over the same distance; but their action consists of a pair
 of equal opposite forces; therefore the works they do, or
 their activities, are equal and opposite ; therefore, by defi
    * His comments show that he should have added here the words “in
 a body.”    But this does not affect the present argument.

 other words: in    cases                  all

without any reference to such fictions.              Moreover, it may be
deduced from the second law of motion and the impossibility
of the perpetual motion, neither of which axioms involves
such fictions. It is thus quite general, involving no assumption
as to the distance at which bodies can act on one another, and
applying to             all      action, whether         distance zero,

conceptions as to the character of certain forms of energy, as
to the mode of transference of energy, and as to the place of
 residence of potential energy ; but as the law of conservation
makes no statement on such points which will thereby be
completed, our present ignorance with regard to them does
not render it incomplete.
    While in the event of some hypothesis as to acting

adjustment in the ordinary conception of potential energy,

hypothesis becomes axiomatic, no localization of potential
energy is possible.
   It should be noted here that the adoption of the hypothesis
of contact-action alone does not enable us to localize potential
energy.     As an axiom of acting mechanism it is incomplete;
and it involves only the residence of energy in some body or
other *. If we are to know in what body the energy resides,
the axiom of acting mechanism must be made sufficiently
complete.     Thus, as just stated, if we assume, in addition to
mere contact-action, that material bodies consist of rigid
particles, and that the medium is elastic, the potential energy
in the case of the raised stone must be considered to be

latest paper (p. 30), “amounts to just this, that whatever
energy appears in a bounded region must necessarily have
passed through the boundary.”        It is quite obvious that the
assumption of contact-action together with the law of the
conservation of energy do justify this proposition.         It is
equally obvious that, with the ordinary conception of energy,
 this proposition cannot be asserted.      It may hold, but we
 cannot assert that it does.       Why    this difference 2  Not
 because the law of conservation is more precise or definite in
 the one case than in the other, but because we have a more
 complete conception of transference.         With the ordinary
 conception of energy the only source of knowledge of trans
 ference is the third law of motion.   With the other conception,
 we have both the third law and the axiom of contact-action ";
 and it is because of the greater definiteness which this latter
 axiom gives to our conception of transference, that it enables
 us to assert that if energy appears within a bounded region,
it must           have       been either conveyed                  or transferred across the
boundary               f.
   The above proposition seems to Prof. Lodge “to confer
upon energy the same kind of identity or continuous exist
ence (or, if you please, objectivity)     as matter possesses.”
What kind of     identity    or continuous existence matter is
supposed to possess (we need not refer to anything so meta
physical as objectivity) may be gathered from the earlier of the
two statements referred to above, viz.:-" On the new plan we
may label a bit of energy and trace        motion and change       of its                                         of

I  need not enter into a detailed criticism of the demonstration.
It is sufficient for my purpose to draw attention to two points:—
(1) The demonstration itself admits the possibility that a body
may act as “a mere transmitter, not itself active, only passing
on what it receives,” and applies to bodies not acting in this
way. But a body cannot pass on the energy it receives with
out the energy being first transferred to it and subsequently
transferred by         The demonstration, therefore, admits that

   But there is another ground on which this course is seen to
be for him entirely illogical. For though his having taken it is
an admission that he regards the proposition in question as
incapable of deduction, he has been hasty in reaching this
conclusion. We have seen that, in order to maintain complete
transformation during tranference, he has confessedly to
assume that bodies consist of massive particles without elas
ticity, and that the medium is elastic but without inertia.
Now, as pointed out in my paper (p. 141)           That energy :-"
cannot be transformed without       being transferred must of
course be true if bodies consist of particles with inertia but
without elasticity, and if the medium connecting them possess
elasticity but not inertia.”       This is surely quite obvious.
Hence with the      assumptions     already made by Prof. Lodge
the  proposition   under consideration is capable of deduction.
For him therefore it cannot be an axiom.
   For those of us who do not hold to his theory of the con
stitution of bodies and media, the proposition is of course not
capable of deduction.      Whether or not we are to regard it as
axiomatic must     depend     on whether or not it may be shown
to be  capable of coordinating    dynamical phenomena generally.

 but then the charges alternate from positive to negative with
 each half revolution of the disks.
    An approximate measure of the efficiency of the machine
 is seen by the following experiments.
    The glass throughout was held free from electrical excite
 ment, and the disks were rotated sixty times per minute ; the
 actuating cause was then removed, and the disks came to rest
 after making forty-seven revolutions.             This measures the
 friction of the machine.
    The disks were then similarly turned, but the electrical
 charges were allowed to collect; it was then found that the
 disks came to rest after twenty-three revolutions.             The fric
 tion of the machine, therefore, is about equal to the repulsion
 of the electrical charges.
    Leyden jars having eight square inches of tinfoil in each
 coating were then connected to the terminals, and the ter
 minals set 3%        apart in. the disks were turned
                                          :                     the same    to

    The disks were then turned and the number                      sparks        of
 counted     in relation                 to
                               each revolution.      This    gave   seven

 inches     on
             each disk)      with them the self-excitement becomes

                                 [Plate II.]
  § 1.   IN    the autumn of last year we published a short
              account f of experiments made by us during the
  previous summer on the electrical resistance of metals, non
  metals, and alloys taken at the temperatures produced by the
 evaporation of liquid oxygen when boiling under normal or
 under reduced pressures.           These experiments, which were
 merely preliminary, revealed, however, the nature of the
 difficulties to be overcome in repeating and following out this
 work.      During the past year a much more extended series of
 investigations have been carried out by us on the same sub
ject, but with more complete appliances for the production of
the large quantities of the liquid gases necessary as refrigera
ting agents, and with greater care in the preparation of the
metallic wires used and in the physical measurements to be
made.
    This inquiry is still far from complete; but the results are
of considerable interest as far as they have gone, and we con
sider it may be desirable to place on record a portion of the
conclusions at which we have arrived.            The general object of
this research may be stated to be the determination of the
Specific Electrical Resistance of Metals and Alloys between
the limits of temperature of about 200° C. and the lowest
obtainable temperatures approaching the absolute zero. We
particularly desired to investigate the variation of resistance

of    the  temperature-resistance curves as the temperature is
lowered down to the lowest points obtainable by the evapora
tion of liquid oxygen boiling under reduced or normal pres
sure. The two variables with which we are concerned being,
       V.
therefore, Specific Electrical Resistance and Temperature, we
may point out in the first place how each of these has been
defined and measured in tabulating the results.
    § 2. There are, as is well known, two ways in which we
may define Specific Electrical Resistance. The first, called
the                        Resistance, is defined as the resistance
of one cubic unit of the material taken between opposed faces
 of the cube.     In this method of defining it the specific elec
 trical resistance is given as the resistance in ohms, or electro
 magnetic units of one cubic centimetre of the material between
 opposed faces.       The second, called the Mass-Specific Resist
 ance, is the resistance of a wire of the material of a certain
                                                                                                         it,
 length and weight.         In this second method of defining                                           it
is   generally stated                as
                             the resistance       ohms         wire  in  the         of  a             of
 material one metre            length  inand  weighing      one   gramme.

                  materials      the form   in wires,      which the dia

            is                                                 larger, and

 the most convenient way           stating the results

 the mass-specific resistance; and since the mean specific

               wires     this size can always

 very fair degree          accuracy, the volume-specific resistance
                                of
  can easily           be
                    deduced.         however,    If,     the case         as
                                                                         our   in                      of
  own experiments, the conditions necessitate the employment
 of    very fine wires                of                          not very
                                                                 on to

  great lengths, the probable errors           determining the weight
  per metre, and especially the specific gravity, are very con
  siderable. We therefore preferred               face the difficultyto                                     of

  volume-specific resistance         any assigned temperature when

                 Resistance   of Metals and Alloys.                       273
we know the changes in dimensions which the material
undergoes when heated or cooled.            The true volume-specific
resistance of the material at    any   temperature     is the resistance
in electromagnetic measure between opposed faces of one
cubic centimetre of the material taken at that temperature.
Pending, however, the determinations of the temperature
change in dimensions of the metals and alloys employed, we
omit the correction (no doubt small) due to the change of
dimensions, and state our results in terms of the electrical
resistance in electromagnetic measure of one cubic centimetre
of the material measured at 15° C., the said electrical resist
ance being determined at the various temperatures to which
the material is raised or lowered.         In the next place we have
to consider the     question   of   temperature-measurement.          As
the lowest temperatures reached by us in these experiments
were temperatures at which air liquefies under ordinary pres
sures, the practical employment of the air-thermometer was
surrounded with many difficulties.             Ultimately it may be
necessary to define the temperatures attained in terms of the
absolute thermodynamic scale.           But even the employment of
the constant    reduced-pressure       hydrogen     thermometer-scale,
which    may   be taken as     giving     us the nearest practicable
approximation to the true thermodynamic scale, is a matter
in which extreme care will have to be employed in obtaining
and interpreting results. We have been led, however, by
 one part of our results to see that, for our purpose here, by
far the most practical method of defining the temperatures
employed is to state them in terms of the variation of the
specific resistance of one standard metal.
    In the practical determination of temperature we select a
thermometric substance, it may be air, hydrogen, mercury
 in-glass, or some other material, such as a double metallic
junction of thermoelectric materials, and we select also a
 thermometric quality, such as the change in pressure, change
in apparent volume, or thermoelectric difference, and define
our temperature by the temperature-change of the thermo
 metric quality of this thermometric material. There               is,
                                                                   there
fore, nothing    to prevent     us from selecting
                                                        as
                                                        a     measure          of
temperature the change        in electrical resistance       of
                                                              a wire          of
                                                                               a
 standard material and      defining    temperature     in  terms     theof
 change.   It  will afterwards       bepossible   to translate the tem
 peratures  so measured into their equivalents          on   the absolute
thermodynamic       orair-thermometer scales.
    Our experiments      atlow temperatures have confirmed                us   in
 the view that the most convenient method          of   determining and
stating such temperatures      is
                               in     terms  of the change        specific
                                                                  of

 resistance of pure platinum.          H. L. Callendar* and Callendar
 and Griffiths have carefully examined this matter for tempe
 ratures from about zero Centigrade upwards to about 1000°C.
 Callendar has indicated the possible causes of the discrep
 ances in the results obtained by previous observers in the use
 of the platinum resistance-thermometer, as originally sug
 gested by Siemens;           and he has shown that a properly
 arranged pure platinum wire may be employed to measure
 temperatures, and may have                           its
                                         fixed points determined. We
 have      like manner found that wire

and 100°C., and draw through the summits of these ordinates
a straight line cutting the axis of temperature, we may define
temperature as follows:—Divide the horizontal interval be
tween the ordinates into one hundred equal parts, and continue
the division on the scale backwards to the point at which the
inclined line cuts the temperature-axis.               Measure the resist
ance of the platinum at any temperature and find the ordinate
representing this resistance: the foot of this ordinate marks the
temperature on the platinum-scale.               Callendar has shown that
the difference between      temperatures       measured on this platinum
scale and the     corresponding        air-thermometer temperature is
very nearly represented by a parabolic function of the air-ther
mometer temperature. It remains to be seen if                  pure platinum        all

276         Profs. Dewar and Fleming      on the Electrical
    § 3. Passing on to further details, we proceed to describe
 briefly the preparation of the metals and alloys in the required
 state of purity, and the construction of the resistance-coils
suitable for the purpose of these experiments and the mode of
making the required measurements, Our previous experi
ments had shown the necessity for the greatest care in the
 preparation of the metals.       The term pure is of course a
relative term, and absolute purity in a chemical sense is of
course a most difficult matter to secure, but every care has
 been taken to arrive at the greatest possible purity in the
majority of the metals employed. In this part of the work
we have been greatly aided by several friends.             Foremost
amongst these we are especially indebted to Mr. George
 Matthey, who has given us invaluable aid in the preparation
of a large series of metals in a state of great purity. Mr.       J.
 W. Swan has furnished us with many samples of electrolytic
copper and silver prepared by himself by his own special
processes. From Mr. G. Addenbrooke we received samples
 of aluminium and aluminium alloys which have been of use
 to us; and Colonel Dyer, of the Elswick Ordnance (Arm
strong's) Works, has kindly sent us samples of iron prepared
 with very great care.
    Having these materials in our possession, they were in
 most cases drawn into wire for us by Messrs. Johnson and
 Matthey, and in some cases, such as those of lead, tin, thal
lium, and some others, the metals were pressed into wire in a
steel press by the hydraulic 50-ton testing-machine in the
Mechanical Laboratory of University College, London.
    These different wires had a diameter varying from .08
millim. (3 mils) up to about 0.25 millim. (10 mils) and
lengths of from 1 to 3 metres.
    § 4. The next step consisted in measuring the mean dia
meters.      For such fine wires no ordinary process of callipering
was    sufficiently  accurate.    After many experiments, the
following method of obtaining rapidly the mean diameter was
perfected.
    A compound microscope had the eyepiece removed, and the
substage under the object-glass fitted with a large cork, bored
out in the centre with a Tole, and having two small glass
tubes inserted in the sides. This cork was so fixed to the
stage that when a wire was drawn through the small tubes, it
passed across the field of the objective.        The stage had a
rack-work motion which enabled it to be moved to or from
the objective ; but this last remained fixed relatively to the
stand of the microscope. . The microscope being placed hori
zontally, an incandescent lamp was placed behind a condenser

                                                                277

lens at the back of the substage, and an image of the wire
projected by the objective on to a sheet of fine hot-pressed
drawing-paper placed a yard away from the lens.            The ob
jective which formed this image always remained fixed rela
tively to the screen, and the image was focussed by moving
the substage which carried the wire.
    The magnification of the image was about 300 times linear,
so that the image of a wire about 003 inch in diameter could
be made to appear one inch in diameter.          A 2-inch, 1-inch,
or -inch objective could be used as desired. This optical
image or shadow could be made exceedingly sharp and well
 defined, and could be measured with a pair of dividers to
 much less than one per cent. In order to infer the real dia
 meter of the wire from the diameter of the image, the follow
ing method was employed. A series of five steel-wire gauges
 was made formed of round parallel steel wire about 10 centi
 metres in length, rammed into wooden            handles.     These
 handles were planed off on one side flat. These gauges varied
 in diameter from about 3 millim. to 04 of a millimetre. The
 gauges were sent to the Board of Trade Standardised Labora
 tory, and the diameters of the steel wires officially measured
 with their Standard instruments along axes parallel to the flat
 side of the handle, and taken at the centre of the wire.      This
 being done, we had a series of standard gauges whose dia
  ºth
 meter in one definite position was known to the one ten
              of an inch. These gauges were marked A, B,
   ,  D, E.
     Two more similar gauges were prepared, called F and G, of
 smaller steel wire, and a number of observations of the dia
 meters of F and G relatively to E were made by means of a
 micrometer-microscope belonging to the Physical Laboratory
 of University College. Many observations were also made of
 the relative diameters of the images of gauges E, F, and G
 when projected by the projection microscope, the gauges being
 in the same focal position relatively to the objective and screen.
 These experiments, which were most carefully made, sufficed
 to establish the diameters of the steel gauges F and G in the
 centre and parallel to the flat side of their handles, in terms of
 the Board of Trade measuring-instrument, and the final mean
 result expressed in centimetres, is that the central diameters
 of gauges F and G, parallel to the flat side of the handle, are
 as  follows:–
     Central diameter of gauge F=0.03966 of a centimetre.
     Central diameter of gauge G=0.03959 of a centimetre,
 taken at about the normal temperature 15° C.

               of measuring the mean diameter of any wire
     The process
was then as follows:—The appropriate length of the wire
being cut off and measured against a standard-metre scale, it
was drawn through the field of the microscope, the smallest
gauge, F or G, being placed in the same focal plane and
parallel with the wire. The gauge was placed with the flat
side of the handle parallel with the screen and the centre of
the steel gauge in the centre of the objective field.           We had
then on the screen the images or shadows of two objects, one
a wire of steel of known diameter, and the other a wire of
unknown diameter; the diametral planes of each wire being
in the same focal plane of the lens.            The diameters of the
images of the steel gauge and the wire were then carefull
measured with dividers and expressed in terms of some arbi
trary unit.    The ratio of these apparent image-diameters was
taken as the ratio of the real diameters of the wire and the
gauge.
   The measurement of the diameter of the wire was taken
about every five centimetres in the case of very uniformly
drawn wires, and more frequently in other cases.              Generally
about   twenty,  and sometimes        sixty   diametral measurements
were taken in the metre length of the wire to be measured,
and as the wire was turned round                 long axis       passingits                     in

                 Resistance   of Metals and Alloys.              279
experiments the wires of which the resistance was to be deter
mined were wound on a rectangle of mica, having serrations
or teeth cut upon the edge, and the ends of the wire were
then soldered to stout copper connexions.        For many reasons
this   proved  to be an undesirable method.       Many wires, such
as   aluminium,    were  easily broken  by  the sharp  bend in the
wire, and other soft wires, such as lead, were deformed at the
same point of bending.                                        -
    In  preparing  coils for the  purpose   we had in view it was
necessary to keep them small, so that they might be easily
contained in a moderate-sized vacuum-jacketed test-tube in
which the liquid gas was held. For obvious reasons also any
large amount of non-conducting material round the wire was
objectionable.      After some trials the following method of
constructing the resistance-coils to be used was adopted, and
answered very well.       Stout high-conductivity copper wire of
                                                 |.
4 millim. diameter was cut into lengths, and pairs of these wires
 bent up and bound together at the middle,           insulated from
each other with indiarubber tape.          The ends of the wires
 were well tinned and the bottom ends nicked.
    A very thin sheet of vulcanized fibre was then bound round
 the bottom part of the copper rods and sewn to them by silk
 thread. This formed a thin cylinder on which the wire to be
 tested was carried.      A stout silk thread was then wound
 spiral fashion round the cylinder.         The wire to be tested,
 generally 1, 2, or 3 metres in length, was then care
 fully wound on the fibre cylinder in between the silk thread,
 the several turns of which kept the turns of wire from
 becoming short-circuited.       The dimensions of the cylinder of
 vulcanized fibre varied    according   to the length of wire used,
 but was from two to three centimetres in diameter and four
 to five centimetres in length.    A large number of such bobbins
 having been prepared, the next step was to anneal the wires
 on these coils.
     The so prepared resistance-coils were immersed in melted
 paraffin wax and kept at a temperature of 200° C. for some
 time. These being slowly cooled they were annealed and at
 the same time the insulating portions of the coils well saturated
 with paraffin.
     § 6. The resistance measurements were carried out b
  means of a Wheatstone's Bridge by Messrs. Elliott Bros.
  The coils of this bridge were of platinum-silver and adjusted
 to read in standard ohms. The coefficient of variation of resist
 ance of the coils of the bridge with temperature was determined
                                     º,
  and found to be 031 per cent, per degree Centigrade.

                                           was always taken at the

280           Profs. Dewar and Fleming on the Electrical
time of making each set of measurements and the proper cor
rection applied. Another correction of importance was that for
resistance of the connecting leads and the copper terminals of
each coil.     A loop of copper wire was prepared of the same
metal and of the same total length as the standard size
employed as terminals of each resistance-coil.              This blank
was   always   measured before and after each set of       experiments
on the coils, and so arranged that it was under the same
                                                                                g.
temperature conditions as the terminals of the coils. This
together with the resistance of the short thick bridge leads, is
always called “resistance of connexions” in the Tables, and is a
correction invariably applied in each case. The galvanometer
employed with the bridge was a Pitkin-Holden
of the suspended coil type, having a resistance of about 10
ohms and nearly perfectly dead-beat.            One cell of a Helsen
dry battery was used, and the usual battery and galvano
meter keys inserted in their respective circuits.
   The temperatures above zero Centigrade were obtained by
immersing the coils in a beaker of melted paraffin             standing              oil
ina    large zinc bath full             of

100° C. a straight line was drawn and prolonged both ways.
The point where this line cuts the axis of temperature was at
a distance of –283-4 divisions from the zero Centigrade
  oint. This gave the platinum temperature absolute zero.
  rom the measured value of the platinum resistance in any
bath we could then deduce the platinum temperature accord
ing to this wire. The numbers in the fourth column are so
deduced. Hence when plotted in terms of platinum tempera
ture the curve of platinum resistance is a straight line. The
mean temperature-coefficient of this wire between 0°C. and
100° is 003529.
   A similar series of observations was made with the other
platinum wire.

        special process.  The metal was exceedingly soft and
ductile, and was drawn into a very uniform wire without
melting or heating, and annealed by heating in hydrogen.
We call this particular specimen (May 19th) from the
when it came to us.

   Two coils were prepared from this wire-—one, a short coil of
300 centim. in length, and one very much longer, of about
2100 centim. The reason for this being that at the very low
temperatures the copper loses so much of         resistance andits
is   sogood,    conductor that unless
                    a                      considerable length

  We were provided with numerous samples of aluminium
by the kindness of Mr. G. Addenbrooke, and also with a
solder which enabled us, without difficulty, to attach these
wires to the copper terminals. This aluminium was prepared
at Neuhausen.     One sample was the ordinary Commercial
Aluminium which contained 97.5 per cent. of aluminium, and
another was a purer kind containing 99 per cent... of
aluminium.    These we refer to as the Commercial Aluminium
and Neuhausen Aluminium. A third sample was obtained
from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey.          For the first two
samples the results of observation were as follows:–

§ 13.                            VII.  Iron.
    It is needless to say that we had great difficulty        in obtaining
any sample of iron which could properly be                    called pure.
We have not yet succeeded in obtaining iron                    wire drawn
directly from pure electrolytic iron.             Colonel     Dyer, of the
Elswick Ordnance Works, kindly sent us samples of iron very
free from carbon, silicon, and phosphorus but in which unfor
tunately manganese was still present to the extent of nearly
0.25 per cent. and sulphur 0-01 per cent.                   From Messrs.
Hopkins and Williams we procured samples of iron, pre
pared especially for them, and of a high degree of purity
and very soft and well annealed. The electrical behaviour
of this last sample shows it to be almost free from admixture
of other elements.       We call the first iron from Armstrong's
 works, Iron A, and the other Iron H. W. The last iron has
by far the higher conductivity.             The Iron A proved to be
 sufficiently soft to work cold under the hammer and was drawn
 without heating into a very uniform wire.

   § 21. The resistance-curves of all the above metals are
delineated on the chart (see Plate II.) to a suitable
scale.   An examination of these lines will show that some of
them are concave upwards and some concave downwards;
those with the most marked curvature being the magnetic
metals nickel and iron. The lines cross one another at low
temperatures, and hence the order of conductivity of the

296            Profs. Dewar and Fleming on the Electrical
metals at very low temperatures is different to their order at
ordinary temperatures. At the lowest temperature reached the
best metallic conductor is pure copper.          It may be remarked
that  generally  the best conductors      amongst     the pure metals
are those that are most sonorous: silver, aluminium, gold, and
copper would make good bells, whilst lead, thallium, tin, and
palladium, which are the worst conductors, would be un
suitable for this purpose.      The metals platinum, palladium,
have resistance-curves which have a marked concavity down
wards when plotted in terms of Centigrade temperatures;
whilst nickel and iron have a considerable curvature in the
opposite direction.       An examination of this chart will show
lº
that the conclusion reached in our former paper is confirmed
by these more careful experiments, viz., that the electrical
         resistance of                all
                              pure metals will probably vanish                                 at
the absolute zero        temperature.

   The converse, of course, follows, that if the heat be constant
the quantity of electricity is inversely proportional to the
mean volts during each impulse.
   The above is on the assumption that the effects of self
induction are negligible, as is probably the case with small
lamp filaments. Where, however, self-induction does exist a
similar effect is produced owing to the increased resistance
due to this self-induction, as the writer has already suggested.
   The same explanation would also apply to the intense heat
ing-effects of sparks, lightning flashes, and other disruptive
discharges in which the quantity of electricity is apparently
small.

Th;       primary object of these experiments was to obtain a
         dense  form of carbon which should be more durable
than the ordinary carbon when used in arc-lamps, and at the
same time to obtain a material better suited for the formation
of the burners of incandescent lamps.
   There were a considerable number of experiments made in
which the conditions were somewhat alike, and many were
almost repetitions with slightly varying pressures and tempe
ratures. They may, however, be divided into two distinct
classes: the first, in which a carbon rod surrounded by a fluid
under great pressure is electrically heated by passing a large
current through             it;

reader to understand the experimental researches, and the book
ends with a very interesting account of Prof. Ewing's own modifica
tion of Weber's theory of magnetism in magnetic metals which has
done so much to advance our insight into the subject.   An appendix
gives an account of the beautiful curve-tracer which Prof. Ewing
has invented and which has already contributed to our knowledge
of the effects of rapidly alternating magnetic force on the mag
netization of iron, a matter of great interest in connexion with the
working of transformers.
  In chapter x., when dealing with the magnetic circuit, Prof.
Ewing introduces the notion of a magnetic flux and magnetomotive
force.    It
           is to be regretted that the idea was not earlier intro
duced.   In the introductory chapter magnetic force and magnetic
induction are introduced as more or less similar things, one occurring
in a crevasse and the other in a hole. It is to be regretted that
Maxwell's notion of induction being analogous to a flux, or dis
placement, produced by the magnetic force was not the foundation
on which the book was built instead of this hole-crevasse definition,
which gives little, or no insight into the way in which energy is
stored in the medium nor how it is that the induced electric force
depends on the change of induction and not on the magnetic force,
and why on earth induction is continuous and magnetic force is
not. Students who are brought up on the hole-crevasse definition
require to rearrange              all
                          their ideas when they try    develop any                    to
sensible theory      whatof  taking place. This     confessedly the
                                                                           to in is

 October.      But for other regions it does not seem possible as yet
 to deduce any law. The amplitudes of the semi-annual period
 range from 0-06 (southern hemisphere) to 0-79 (Mexico), the
 average value being 0-24.
    3. In fifteen cases the amplitude of the semi-annual period
 exceeds that of the annual period.        Eleven of these records include
 the following insular districts, which are among the most well
 marked seismic regions in the world:—namely, the Grecian Archi
 pelago, Japan, the Malay Archipelago, New Zealand, and the West
 Indies.     The average amplitude of the annual period in these
 eleven cases is 0.16, and that of the semi-annual period 0.24;
 i. e. the average amplitude of the annual period is just half that
 for all the districts examined, while in the case of the semi-annual
 period the average amplitudes are the same.
    Origin of the Annual Period.—In this, the concluding, section of
the paper, an attempt is made to show that the annual change in
 barometric pressure may be the cause of the annual change in
seismic frequency.        It would be difficult to prove that such a con
nexion    exists,  but reasons are given which seem to render it in
some    degree   probable.
    1. The most probable cause of the origin of the majority of non
volcanic earthquakes is the impulsive friction, due to slipping, of
the two rock-surfaces of a fault. Now, whatever be the causes of
seismic periodicity, it seems probable that they are merely auxiliary,
and determine the epoch when an earthquake shall take place, rather
than whether there shall be an earthquake at all. Prof. G. H. Darwin
has shown that the vertical displacement of the earth's surface by
parallel waves of barometric elevation and depression is not incon
siderable, and that it diminishes at first very slowly as the depth
increases. Since the fault-slip which produces even a moderately
strong shock must be very small, and since the work to be done
in such a case            is,
                      not the compression       solid rock, but the slight
                                                      of

                      a                       support      nearly, but not
                                                                  is
quite, withdrawn, the annual range               of

seem incompetent          produce the effects observed.

Th;holtz    investigations of R. v. Helmholtzt, R. v. Helm
                and Richarzi, Shelford Bidwell $, and Aitken |,
 on the effects of electrification and of chemical action on the
 condensation of steam in a steam-jet have brought to light facts                             |
 which are so striking and suggestive that it seems desirable to
consider what, according to the principles which are known to
govern the condensation of steam, would be the effect of
 electrification on the steam-jet, and how far these principles
will go in explaining the phenomena observed by the above
mentioned physicists.
    Before considering the effect of electrification in increasing
the number of water-drops condensed in the jet, it is advisable
to consider the effect of the surface-tension of the water-drop,
as this is one of the most formidable obstacles in the way of
the condensation of the drops.

spherical drop of water                    is,

greater than that over a plane surface, the equilibrium vapour
H.ressure increasing as the curvature of the drop increases:
         as Maxwell points out in the ‘Theory of Heat, the
water will tend to evaporate from a very small drop, which
will therefore grow smaller, and the tendency to evaporate
will get still greater. Thus the condensation of steam into
drops is attended by the difficulty that, even if a small drop
happens to get formed, it will, unless the steam around it is
excessively supersaturated, begin at once to evaporate.                 In
consequence of the excessive infantile mortality among the
drops, the production of fog from water-vapour free from
foreign substances is attended by almost insuperable diffi
culties. This point is illustrated in a very striking way by
                                  J.
º
Aitken’s experiments, which show how greatly the deposition
of fog is facilitated by the presence of dust. The particles of
dust furnish surfaces on              the moisture can be deposited
in   layers  having    much smaller curvatures than any layers
         could be formed if the drop had no nucleus over which
to spread ; the dust, in fact, almost annuls the effect of surface
tension by enabling the drop to come into existence without
passing through the stages in which surface-tension plays the
greatest havoc.
    We can apply a more general method of reasoning to the
effect of surface-tension, and one which has the merit of being
immediately applicable to the consideration of the effect of
 electrification on the condensation.

   In my “Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Che
mistry'. I have calculated the change in the vapour-pressure
of the water-vapour due to this cause (1) when the electrical
field is uniform.    If p is the equilibrium vapour-pressure
when there is no electric field, 8p the increase in p due to a
uniform electric field of strength H, K the specific inductive
capacity of the medium surrounding the drop (that of the
drop itself being regarded as infinite), 6 the absolute tem
perature, a the density of water, and IR a quantity defined by
the equation
                           p= R6p,
where     p is      the pressure due to the water-vapour;
                                     8p         3KH'
                                     p    TT    8tral{}
  The greatest electric field which can exist in air at atmo
spheric pressure without causing discharge is one where H is
about 10° in electrostatic measure, for water-vapour at 15°C.
R6 is about 1.3 x 10"; thus,
                                 º- -*.          roughly.
   Thus the greatest change is excessively small, and is inde
pendent of the size of the drop, so that the uniform field will
not be able to counterbalance the effect of surface-tension,
since the latter varies inversely as the radius of the drop, and
therefore where the drop is very small must be greater than
the constant effect due to the electric field.
   The case          is,
                  however, very different when the electric field,

  I  am not aware that any measurements have been made which
show directly the influence of electrification on the vapour
pressure; indeed, the preceding expressions for the magnitude
of this effect show that such measurements would be hardly
realizable.               I
                   think, however, that some of the effects of
electrification on a steam-jet which were first observed by
R. v. Helmholtz, and subsequently by Shelford Bidwell and
Aitken, may be explained by these principles. When a jet
of steam emerges from a nozzle into dust-free air, there is
very little condensation to be observed within half an inch or
so of the nozzle.          however,      If,                  an

more than the red, so that the jet when seen by transmitted

   The preceding explanation does not require dust to be
present originally in the air, so that it would apply to cases
where, if it were not for the electrification, there would be no
condensation ; when, however, dust is present, it is probable
 that the effects due to electrification arise from several causes.
 Thus if the air contained excessively fine dust, so fine that
 the drops of water deposited on it were too small to be per
 manent, the electricity, by causing these fine particles to
 strike together, might produce particles large enough to act
 as nuclei for the water-drops.       Again, as Aitken has pointed
 out  (Proc, Roy.  Soc.         408,         p.
                                       1892), the electricity would

tendency to rearrangement among the atoms some of them
will become comparatively free, when, as before, the electric
field in the region around them will become stronger, and
consequently the tendency of the steam in that region to con
dense will increase. Thus this incipient chemical combina
tion may produce throughout the region occupied by the gas
minute drops of water. When, however, these are formed, it
is not difficult to see that we have the possibilities for very
great increase in the chemical action. These drops offer sur
faces on which the molecules of A and B may condense; thus
a portion of A and B, instead of being in the gaseous state,
exists as layers condensed on the drops.                  Experience shows
that combination       usually    goes  on more      freely  between gases
condensed on a surface than between the same gases when
free.

electric effects of A ; as one of these effects is to hold the
atom B in combination, the affinity between the atoms A and
B will be almost annulled by the presence of the sphere.
Molecules condensed on the surface of a sphere will thus be
practically dissociated.    The same effect would be pro
duced if the molecules were surrounded by a substance
possessing a very large specific inductive capacity.      Since
water is such a substance it follows, if we accept the view
that the forces between the atoms are electrical in their
origin, that when the molecules of a                                    substance      are    in
aqueous  solution the forces between them are very much
less than they are when the molecule is free and in the
gaseous state.
   Since water-vapour produces so great an effect on chemical
combination, the question suggests itself whether              presence         its
has  any considerable influence          the     on

relate, however, to the special case when a steady discharge
is passing through hydrogen at a low pressure. The effect,
however, is comparatively small, and it seemed worthy of

were placed in this bulb in order that the hydrogen in it
might remain damp. After the bulbs had been filled the
communication between them was shut off, and the system
left for some time, so that the hydrogen in A might get
thoroughly dry. The time required to dry the gas, in
to produce the effects described below, varied from two days
                                                               º:
to a week; and     I am disposed to think that the drying effect
of the pentoxide was not exhausted, even after the gas had
been in contact with it for these periods.
   The following is the arrangement         I adopted for measuring
the potential-difference required to produce a spark.           The
difference of potential was produced by a battery of 600 small
storage-cells giving a potential-difference of about 1200 volts;
                 tºº.
the ends of this battery are connected with C and D (fig. 2),
which are two               sunk into a slate bed; these terminals
are connected by a very large resistance formed by drawing on
                                                     i.
the slate with graphite a semicircle passing through CD
with its centre at #. a metal arm turning                  E makes
movable contact with the graphite semicircle, the contact
with the graphite being made by a metal roller.             E and D
are connected    respectively   with the terminals of one of Lord
Kelvin’s vertical electrostatic voltmeters; they are also con
nected with the spark-gap in one of the hydrogen bulbs, the
terminals of the spark-gap are portions of large brass spheres
carefully cleaned.     By moving the sliding arm EF from D
towards   C,  the difference of potential at the spark-gap was
gradually increased until a spark passed, the electrometer
indicating the corresponding difference of potential.
   Observations were made both on the dry and the damp
hydrogen.      As the result of these observations it appears
that there are well-marked differences in the appearance and
behaviour of the wet and the dry hydrogen.               In the first
                          ãº
place the colour of the discharge is different, that of the
damp hydrogen being much more purplish than that of the
dry. The most striking difference however, which I observed
was the remarkable                          between the potential
difference   required   to produce     the first spark through the
dried  hydrogen    and that which is sufficient to cause one to
follow it immediately afterwards.         I found that whether the
gas was damp or dry the potential-difference, required to
produce the first spark was always greater, than that re
  uired to make another follow it after a small interval.          In
the damp gas, however, the difference was comparatively small,
averaging about ten per cent.; i.e. after the arm EF had been
moved from D until a spark passed through the damp hydro

soon as the spark passed the potential between the electrodes
in the dry gas indicated by the voltmeter fell to a fraction of
the value it had just before the spark passed; the arm EF
could now be moved back in the direction of diminishing
potential until it had often got more than halfway back to D
before the sparks ceased. The readings of the voltmeter showed
that the spark-potential did not vary greatly during this time
from the value it had fallen to immediately after the passage
of the first spark. Another point to be noticed was that the
first spark did not begin as a small faint spark, but, on the
contrary, when it did appear it was exceedingly bright, as if
the gas under the large electromotive force had been in an
unstable condition, and when, by some chance, it did break
down it did so with a rush. When, however, after the spark
had been started it was made to disappear by moving the
arm EF in the direction of diminishing potential, the spark
disappeared gradually and was exceedingly faint just before it
ceased to be visible. The sudden fall of potential at the spark
gap which took place just after the passage of the first spark
was often fatal to the carbon resistance.       The reason of this is
that the difference of potential between C and D is constant ; if
the revolving arm is in the position EF when the spark passes
and the potential suddenly falls, as it does in these experi

was little influenced       the time the spark had been passing,
or   by whether the sliding arm had only just been moved far

parently capriciously from time         time. Again, the potential

    These experiments seem to show that hydrogen ver
carefully dried is able to sustain a much greater
difference than when containing a small amount of moisture,
but that the gas when under this exceptional potential-dif
ference is apparently in an unstable state, as when a spark is
once started the potential difference at once sinks to about the
normal value in a gas containing traces of moisture, and this
   tential-difference is sufficient to produce a second spark, if
this follows the first after only a short interval.
    It should be observed that the hydrogen has to be very
carefully dried in order to show these effects; it is not suf
ficient, for example, merely to allow the gas to bubble through
sulphuric acid, gas so treated seems to differ little in                                                      its

 the discharge through gases we have seen that when a foreign
 substance (water-vapour) is present the potential-difference
 which the gas can support without discharge taking place is
approximately steady, but that when the gas is carefully
dried it can support an abnormally large potential-difference,
though when once the discharge has started the potential

the spark produces supply       a     modified gas which persists
some time after the discharge has stopped; during the ex

               On the Refractice Indices of Liquid Nitrogen and
            Air. By Professors Liv EING and DEwAR *.
        describing the spectrum of liquid oxygen (Phil. Mag.
 IN August       1892) we gave a determination of the refractive
 index of that liquid, and of those of some other liquefied
 gases, for the D ray.     The difficulty of such measurements
 was mainly the mechanical one of making a hollow prism
 with truly wrought faces which would stand the extreme
 cold, and not convey heat from outside to the liquid within
 so fast as to keep it in rapid ebullition.     The dispersion of
 the light by the bubbles passing through the liquid is suffi
 cient to blur the image of the source of light, so much as to
 render an accurate measurement of the dispersion almost
 impossible.    And though by diminishing the pressure, and
 thereby causing a rapid evaporation, the liquid oxygen can
 be reduced to —200° C. and then remains quite tranquil,
 this was found to be of little avail; for it involved the use
 of a hollow prism capable of holding rather a large bulk of
liquid, and of sustaining variation of pressure as well as of
temperature without leaking.       We had therefore to turn our
attention to other methods of determining refractive indices.
 Of these the method used by MM. Terquem and Trannin
seemed to be most free from difficulty, and had been success
fully employed in the determination of the refractive index
of liquid oxygen by Olszewski and Witrowski, whose value of
the index agreed with ours found with a prism (Bull. de
l'Académie de Cracovie, 1891).          This method consists in
suspending in the liquid two plates of glass with a thin layer
of air between them, and measuring the angle of incidence
at which the chosen ray suffers total reflexion at the surface
of the air.
     In this method it is not necessary that the vessel containing
the liquid should have truly wrought surfaces, and the
  roblem seemed to be simplified by the discovery of Professor
   ewar that the amount of heat communicated to the vessel
of liquid by radiation is trifling compared with that com
municated by convection. . He has found that in a double
glass vessel of any form, where the outer and inner vessels
are separated by even a narrow vacuous space, liquid oxygen
can be kept for a great length of time open to the air. Such

gradually and generally giving off streams of small bubbles.
These bubbles do not sensibly mar the distinctness of an
object viewed through the liquid with the naked eye, but we
                            i.
found that they did make a difference when a telescope was
used. As we          no double vessels with a vacuous interval
except such as were either globular or cylindrical, we had to
meet the difficulty that such vessels when filled with liquid
acted like lenses, and lenses which were irregular and full of
striations.   In fact we could not by the use of compensating
lenses obtain in the field of a small telescope any tolerably
definite image of a candle, or other source of light, seen
through the vessel.      At the same time, when the pair of
glass plates above mentioned was suspended in the liquid and
a sodium. flame viewed with the unaided eye through them,
the extinction of the light, when the plates were turned to
the position for total reflexion, appeared quite sudden. The
use of a telescope, however, showed that the rays forming
the blurred image, even when limited by screens to the
central part of the globe, or cylinder, really passed in so
many different directions that they were by no means                                             all

nitrogen at –190°C. when it has, according to Prof. Dewar's

refraction, we get the value for liquid nitrogen 0.1474 and
the refraction-equivalent 2:063.
   Brühl's values of the refraction-equivalent, derived from
observations of the compounds, were for free nitrogen 2:21,
for nitrogen as in nitrous oxide 2.27 at least, and for nitrogen
as in ammonia 2.50.     These numbers are somewhat larger
than  ours, but not a great deal. On the other hand, Glad
stone's value for nitrogen  in nitriles was 4:1 and in ammonia
5:1, which differ a good deal from our value, using Glad
stone's formula, namely 3: 153.
   We hope in a short time to give the refractive indices for
other rays, and the dispersive powers, of liquid oxygen,
nitrogen, and air at a temperature as low as —200° C.

centres of the molecules, as fig. 1 shows for the undisturbed
condition of the system, and fig. 2 for the system subjected to
the supposed elongation.     Hence two of the three diameters
through atoms of each crystalline molecule are altered in
direction, by the elongation, while the diameter through the
third pair of atoms remains unchanged, as is clearly shown in
fig. 2 compared with fig. 1.
   § 6. Remark, first, that the rows of atoms, in lines through
the centres of the crystalline molecules, perpendicular to the

               Piezo-electric Property of Quartz.           335
direction of the strain, are shifted to parallel positions with
distances between the atoms in them unchanged.       Hence the
atoms in these rows contribute nothing to the electrical effect.
                               Fig. 2.
But, in parallels to these rows, on each side of the centre of
each molecule, we find two pairs of atoms whose distances are
                                    y
diminished.

   § 7. This produces an electric effect which, for great
distances from the molecule, is calculated by the same
formula as the magnetic effect of an infinitesimal bar-magnet
whose magnetic moment is numerically equal to the product of
the quantity of electricity of a single atom into the sum of the
diminutions of the two distances between the atoms of the two
pairs under consideration.    Hence, denoting by N the number
of crystalline molecules  per unit bulk of the crystal ; by b the
radius of the circle of each crystalline molecule; by q the
quantity of electricity on each of the six atoms or double
atoms, whether positive or negative ; by S the change of
direction of each of the two diameters through atoms which
experience change of direction ; and by u the electric
moment” developed per unit volume of the crystal, by
the strain which we have been considering and which is
shown in fig. 2; we have

It is of course understood that S is a small fraction of a
radian.

sufficient consideration it might be imagined that the six lines

produces an electro-polarization which is the resultant of the
equal polarizations indicated by aa and bb, and which, as it
bisects the angle b0a, is in a line inclined at 45° to O'K the line

duces electro-polarization ; and it is only when the lines of
two simple elongations are coincident with one another, or are
perpendicular to one another, that the resultant of their
electro-polarizations can be zero.

   La lame de quartz abc (fig. 5) est
montée solidement à ses extrémités dans
deux garnitures métalliques H et B.
Elle est suspendue, en H, à la partie
supérieure ; elle soutient, à son tour,
en B, à la partie inférieure, le plateau et
les poids, par l'intermédiaire d'une tige
munie de crochets.
   L'axe optique du quartz est dirigé
horizontalement, suivant la largeur ab
de la lame.    Les faces sont normales à
un des axes binaires (ou axes électriques)
du cristal.    On exerce les tractions
dans le sens  vertical,  c'est-à-dire dans
une direction à la fois normale à l'axe
optique et à l'axe électrique.
   Les deux faces de la lame sont ar
gentées.
   On a tracé dans l'argenture de chaque
face deux traits fins, mn, m'n', qui isolent
des montures la plus grande partie de la
surface. On recueille l'électricité, sur
ces portions isolées, à l'aide de deux
lames de cuivre faisant ressort (rr, rr),
qui viennent s'appuyer sur les deux
faces et communiquent avec les bornes
de l'appareil.

344             Mr.       J. Trowbridge on the Oscillations                       of
 have obtained evidence that successive discharges of lightning
  follow the same path. Professor Lodge has protested, with
  reason, against the conclusions drawn by the method of
  “waggling” the head or a camera; for the movement of the
  head or the camera certainly requires the hundredth of a
  second, while the discharge of lightning is over in less than
 one hundred-thousandth of a second.
     The method of photographing electrical discharges by
 means of a revolving mirror seems to be the best method of
     i.

 to       electric strain.              I
                                 have, therefore, examined this be
 haviour with more powerful means than those employed by
 previous observers; and it may be well to recall here the fact
 that in lightning discharges high electromotive force and
 great quantity are frequently combined in a very short
 interval of time. The modern alternating machine, there
 fore, and the device of the transformer enable one to study
 the character of lightning more successfully than is possible
 by means of an electrical machine; for both the electromotive
 force of a discharge and                its

   this-length of time every sinuosity in the pilot spark is exactly
   reproduced.     I employed terminals of tin ; and in fig. 1 it
   will be noticed that a mass of melted and vaporized tin
   remained suspended in the air for at least three hundred
   thousandths of a second before it was dissipated in a comet
  like tail. During the three hundred-thousandths of a second,
  therefore, the air remained passive while the electrical oscil
  lations took place.      During this time it is fair to conclude
  that the heat   produced    by the passage of the spark was not
  sensibly conducted away.               If
                                       conduction of heat had taken
  place, the electrical resistance of the air-path would have been
  sensibly altered and the path of the discharge would have
  changed in form.        Here, I think, we have an interesting
  limit to the time it takes atmospheric air to respond to the
  phenomenon of heat-conduction.
     I  have said that the discharges               I
                                            employed were powerful
 both in    regard to electromotive force and to quantity.         Iron
 terminals one    quarter   of an inch in diameter were raised to
 a white heat by the continuous passage of the sparks, and
 globules of the melted metal were formed.             hen the sparks
 were    passed through   the  secondary   of a transformer of about
 thirty secohms of self-induction, three fifty-volt Edison lamps
 placed in multiple in the primary of the transformer, which
 consisted of merely two layers of thick copper wire, were
 lighted to full incandescence.          The spark from two large
glass condensers of 5000 electrostatic units each, excited by
an electrical machine, and passed through the secondary of
the same step-down transformer, barely raised a six-volt lamp
in the primary to a red heat. The study of the efficiency of
step-down transformers in thus transforming transient cur
rents of high potential to transient currents of low potential
and comparatively large current, enables one to obtain an
estimate of the high potential of lightning and of the cur
rent which accompanies             its
                                    fall    potential.

346         Mr.   J. Trowbridge   on the  Oscillations of
decompose    the water with great evolution      of the gases; and
it is probable that an ordinary discharge of lightning of a
few hundred feet in length could light for an instant many
thousand incandescent lamps if it were properly transformed
by means of a step-down transformer.            Indeed the ringing
of electrical bells and the melting of electrical fuses are of
common occurrence during thunderstorms, and manifest the
energy of lightning discharges.         During a recent visit at a
summer hotel which was lighted by incandescent lamps, was      I
much interested to observe that the lamps blinked at every
discharge of lightning, although the interval which elapsed
between the blinking and the peals of thunder showed that
the storm was somewhat remote.           This effect was doubtless
due to induction produced by the surgings of the lightning
discharges; for in heavy and in near discharges the lights
were completely extinguished, although no fuses were burned.
My observation of this effect of lightning upon electric-light
circuits also leads me to believe that the system of carrying
electric-light wires along gas-fixtures, where both electric-light
 º
fixtures and gas fixtures are combined, is fraught with great
danger. If there is any leakage of gas at the joints of the gas
pipes or through a sand-hole in the casting of the pipes, electric
sparks, arising through resonance effects or from the ordinary
         to earth of an electric charge brought into the building
  y the electric wires, can ignite the escaping gas and produce
a mysterious conflagration.      Such a conflagration was averted
in the hotel in which    I noticed the blinking of the lamps only
by the careful scrutiny of an attendant, who noticed a jet of
gas from a pin-hole in the gas fixtures impinging on the
woodwork.       During the storm a minute electric spark had
ignited the escaping gas.      Electric-light wires and gas-pipes
should never be     contiguous,  for no lightning-guard     or pro
                                                    irº.
tector can ensure that minute       sparks,  due in some cases to
resonance effects, may not arise.
   The study of the disruptive or oscillatory discharge of
lightning is closely related with that of the
and the phenomenon of the Aurora Borealis; for the disrup
tive discharge ceases to be disruptive after a few hundred
thousandths of a second—as figures 1 and 2 show—and par
takes of the nature of a brush-discharge.         The zigzag fissure
in the air    disappears,  and   only  the  spark-terminals   glow.
Recent experimenters have exhibited as a marvel the lighting
of a vacuum-tube through the human body by grasping one
terminal of a suitable transformer with one hand and by
holding the vacuum-tube in the other hand. It must be
remembered, however, that the lines of force proceed from

        Lightning Discharges and of the Aurora Borealis.                                                347
the hand which holds the vacuum-tube through the air and
the walls or floor of the room to the other terminal of the
transformer.       We can change this brush-discharge or lumi
nosity at either terminal of a transformer into a disruptive
discharge by lessening the distance between the terminals or
by increasing the electromotive force.

348           Mr.   J. Trowbridge   on the Oscillations of
one   half.. This reduction was due not to the increased self
induction but to the increased resistance ; for the introduction
of a water-resistance of some megohms diminished in a similar
manner the distance between the stratifications.           In short, I
could not discover any connexion between the law t = 27 V LC
and the phenomenon of stratification.
    I  have said that we can pass by insensible gradations from
the condition of the brush-discharge to that of the disruptive
discharge.       By intercalating a non-inductive water-resistance
and a vacuum-tube between the terminals of a suitable trans
 former, we can exactly imitate the phenomena observed when
the vacuum-tube is held in one hand while the other hand
grasps one terminal of the transformer.             In this case the
 water-resistance takes the place of the resistance of the air of
the room. The intensity of the discharge being thus much
 diminished, one can readily study various manifestations of
 stratification which may, perhaps, be termed transitory strati
 fications in distinction to the stationary wave-like forms
 observed in narrow tubes.        The transitory stratifications can
 be  produced    at will  by touching  suitable points of a vacuum
 tube with the      finger or  by connecting   such points with the
 ground.      Such stratifications are stationary as long as the
 ground connexion is maintained, and are independent of the
 rate of the alternating machine which excites the transformer.
 It is evident that the condenser action of the vacuum-tube
 plays an important part in this phenomenon.            In observing
 the striae and columnar form of the waving of the light
 excited in this manner in vessels or tubes filled with rarefied
 gases, one is led to believe that the stratified form of the
 Aurora Borealis is produced in a similar manner. Fig. 3
  (Pl.  III.) is a form  oft.   Aurora noticed by me; and let us
 suppose that a discharge of electricity takes place in rarefied
 air between A and B, and that C is a region of cloud or
 moisture. C can be regarded as the finger or earth-conductor
 which is applied to the tube of rarefied air, and which serves
 to throw the discharge into transitory stratifications and to
 give the waving form of the Northern Lights.
     The pulsation, therefore, of the Aurora is in no way,           I
  believe, connected with any phenomenon of the oscillatory
  discharge ; yet certain writers have intimated that the glow
  ing of vacuum-tubes which are connected with only one
  terminal of a transformer and the light of the Aurora are due
  to millions of electrical oscillations per second.        Now it is
  impossible to study the question of the rate of oscillation of
 the brush-discharge by means of Feddersen's method, for
 the light of the discharge is not sufficient to produce a

       Lightning Discharges and of the Aurora Borealis.          349
photograph.      A brief consideration, however, of the laws of
electrical oscillations shows,     I think, that such writers are
mistaken    ; for the rate of    decay   of the amplitude of such
                                                        Rt.
oscillations is expressed by the well-known factor e”.        In the
case of the brush-discharge R is enormously large.              A re
sistance of thirty or forty ohms was sufficient to completely
damp the oscillations of the sparks studied by me in the
research on the damping produced on iron wires".               In the
case of the brush-discharge, although we may be dealing
with very small values of self-induction and small values of
time, we have, on the other hand, great values of R.                I
believe, therefore, that the brush-discharge is reduced to the
case of one throb, which is analogous to the pilot spark in
disruptive discharges. In regard to the Aurora, it may be
urged that the resistance of the rarefied air is not enormous.
In answer to this it can be said that the phenomenon of the
Aurora can be best reproduced by intercalating a tube
of rarefied air with some megohms of a water-resistance
between the terminals of a suitable transformer.            The sup
position that the Aurora is produced by the action of ex
tremely rapid electrical oscillation on molecules of rarefied
air is not borne out by the theory of transient currents ; and
experiment shows that the phenomenon of the waving and
apparent stratification observed at times in the Aurora is due
to the redistribution of the lines of force which is produced by
suitable earths or conductors in the shape of regions of cloud
|.
or moisture.
   The comparatively small resistance of the electric spark in
air, noticed by many observers, is due, I believe, to the per
manence of path ; for this path is intensely heated, and is
               a charred hole in the air.       When this path no
 onger becomes such a hole and the heated air rises and is
dissipated, the oscillations of the electric spark become
rapidly damped, and we have the phenomenon of the brush
discharge—a glow at each of the spark terminals without a
disruptive discharge—the lines of force crowding from one
terminal seek the other terminal through the air of the room,
and in passing through rarefied air the energy along the lines
of force is manifested by molecular actions which are appa
rently protean in form.          I see, therefore, no evidence for
believing in the rapid oscillation of the Aurora.

by their being in the solid form. This obstacle was removed by
subjecting them to great pressure, and the same remark applies
to some of the interesting experiments of Dr. Hallock.       But
the reduction of the silver haloids and other reactions presently

   Mercuric oride requires      very high pressure   a    produce                              to                    an

                                        the rest, dissolves without
difficulty      acetic acid, and consisted therefore probably
                in                                                                                                   of

ammonia. As                   no to
                       darkening took place, there had evidently
been no reduction.
   Mercuric iodide.—Red mercuric iodide, when subjected                                                              to

very great pressure, darkened considerably, and at points
 where the pressure was greatest it became absolutely black.
 It did not appear, however, that any iodine was set free; none
 could be extracted with alcohol.
    Mercuric    orychloride, 2HgC), HgCl,. — Heavy pressure
 caused much darkening.
    Sodium thiosulphate with a moderate pressure compresses
 to a hard translucent cake, but does not undergo any decom
 position.
    To the foregoing cases are to be added those of the three
 silver haloids described in a previous paper. These blackened
 with a quite moderate pressure, even in the case of the iodide.
    Although in              all

in    concluding that many            the salts     of  easily reducible         of
metals, especially        silver, mercury, and platinum, undergo
                                  of
reduction         by
                pressure.     Such reactions are endothermic and                                    ;
it   therefore follows that mechanical force can bring about
reactions which require erpenditure                              of
                                               energy, which energy                                           is
supplied        by
                mechanical force    precisely       the same way that       in
light, heat, and electricity supply energy              the endothermic          in
changes which they bring about.

by (2). The last expression is intrinsically negative, proving
that until the steady motion is reached F continually de
creases.    Korteweg's theorem is thus shown to be of general
application to systems devoid of potential energy for which
T and F can be expressed as quadratic functions of the
velocities with constant coefficients.
   It may be mentioned in passing that a similar theorem
holds for systems devoid of kinetic energy, for which, however,
F and V (the potential energy) are sensible, and may be
proved in the same way.       If such a system be subjected to
given displacements, it settles down into the configuration of
minimum V ; and during the progress of the motion V
continually decreases.
   The theorem of Korteweg places in a clear light the general
question of the slow motion of a viscous liquid under given
boundary conditions, and the only remaining difficulty lies in
finding the analytical expressions suitable for special problems.
It is proposed to consider a few simple cases relating to
motion in two dimensions.
   Under the above restriction, as is well known, the motion
may be expressed by means of Earnshaw's current function
(W), which satisfies
                              V*) = 0, . . . . . . . (5)
the same equation as governs the transverse displacement of
an elastic plate, when in equilibrium.        Of this analogy we
shall avail ourselves in the sequel.    At a fixed wall ºr retains
a constant value, and, further, in consequence of the friction
dy/dn, representing the tangential velocity, is evanescent.
The boundary conditions for a fixed wall in the fluid problem
are therefore analogous to those of a clamped edge in the
statical problem.
   The motion within a simply connected area is determined
by (5) and by the values of the component velocities over
the boundary.      If we suppose that two such motions are
possible, their difference constitutes a motion also satisfying
(5), and making Jº and dy/dn zero over the boundary.          Con
siderations respecting energy in this or in the analogous
problem of the elastic plate are then sufficient to show that
y   must vanish throughout; and an analytical proof may

 AB; and that the force is applied at a distance
 from CD on the left.        If the partition were
 complete, w and du/dn would be zero over the
 whole, and the displacement in the neighbour
 hood on the left would be simple one-dimen
 sional bending, with w positive throughout.      On
 the right w would vanish throughout.       In order
 to maintain this condition of things a certain
 couple acts upon the plate in virtue of the
 supposed constraints along CD.
    Along the perforated portion AB the couple
 required to produce the one-dimensional bending
 fails. The actual deformation accordingly differs
 from the one-dimensional bending by the de
 formation that would be produced by a couple
 over AB acting upon the plate as clamped along
 CA, BD, but otherwise free from force. This
 deformation is evidently symmetrical with change
 of sign upon the two sides of CD, w being
 positive on the left, negative on the right, and
 vanishing on AB itself. Thus upon the whole               D
 a downward force acting on the left gives rise
 to an upward motion on the right, in opposition to the general
 law proposed for examination.
    In the application to the hydrodynamical problem we see
 that the fluid moving on the left from D to B passes on
 in a straight course to A, and thence along AC, and that on
 the right an eddy, or backwater,                 Fig. 5
is formed. At distances from the
                                                 C
aperture large in comparison with
AB, the supplementary motion is
 of the character expressed in (33).
    A similar argument may be ap
plied to the case (fig. 5) where                A.
fluid moves along a wall DC into
which a channel AF opens, and it
leads to the conclusion that the       |
fluid on arrival at B will refuse to
follow the wall BF, but will rather
shoot across towards A.
    These examples are of some
interest as establishing that the
formation of eddies observed in                 D
practice is not wholly due to

368                          Lord Rayleigh on the
the influence of the terms involving the squares of the
velocities, but would persist in certain cases even though the
motion were made infinitely slow.

     We will now investigate the motion in two dimensions of
                                        Fig.    6.

In this k3 will be supposed to be a small quantity; in other
words, the depth of the corrugations small in comparison
with their wave-length (27/k). Further we shall suppose,
in the first instance, that the motion is slow enough to allow
the terms involving squares of the velocities to be neglected ;
in which case the equation for the stream-function may be
written

In  the absence of corrugations this value of <U+017F>º might hold
good throughout, up to the wall at y=0. The effect of the
corrugations will be to introduce terms periodic with respect
to a ; but the influence of these will be confined to the
neighbourhood of the wall.    For any term in    proportional              <U+017F>º,

    So far as the first power of 8 the action upon the boundary
is thus purely tangential, and of magnitude given by (66).
The periodic part has the same sign as the constant part at
the places where the boundary encroaches upon the fluid.
    This result finds immediate application to the question of
wave-formation under the action of wind, especially if we
suppose that the waves move very slowly, as they would do if
gravity (and cohesion) were small. The maintenance or
augmentation of the waves requires that the forces operative
at the surface be of suitable phase.        Thus pressures acting
upon the retreating shoulders are favourable, as are also tan
 gential forces acting forwards at the crests of the waves,
where the internal motion is itself in the forward direction.
 Equation (65) shows that the pressures produce no effect,
and that we have only to consider the action of the tangential
stress. We see from (66) that when the waves move in the
 same direction as the wind, the effect of the latter is to favour
 the development of the former. Whether the waves will actu
 ally increase depends upon whether the supply of energy,
 proportional to 8%, is greater or less than the loss from internal
 dissipation, itself proportional to the same quantity.         the    If
 waves are moving against the wind, the tendency is to a more
 rapid subsidence than would occur in a calm.

are loci of equal frequency, analogous to Mr. Galton's ellipses
and Professor Edgeworth's ellipsoids; the former of which can
easily be observed as loci of equal height on a probability
surface, the vertical being taken as the dimension of frequency.
   Professor Weldon's measurements of the organs of shrimps
supply a real biological example to which can be applied for
more than three variables the principles of correlated averages.
The theoretic, no less than the practical, interest of this
example is much enhanced by the fact that specimens from
the Plymouth and from the Naples coast were measured, the
number of measurements being 1000 in each case.             Thus
excellent material exists for the    computation  of the  quantic
pertaining to two distinct groups of the same species, and the
two sets of coefficients thus calculated may be compared.

correlating four organs, that appear to be most suitable, we

THE1.      “On Composite Dykes in Arran.”               By Prof.  J. W. Judd,
F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
    It is proposed   to apply the term ‘composite dyke' to any fissure
which contains two or more distinct varieties of igneous rock, differ
ing from one another in chemical composition or mineralogical con
stitution. Such dykes, it is shown, fall into two classes:—
    (A) Dykes in which differentiation has evidently taken place in
the materials after their injection, as in the examples described by
Dr. Lawson in Canada and by Prof. Vogt in Norway.
    (B) Dykes in which we have evidence of the reopening of the
fissure after its first injection and the introduction of materials of
totally different composition.        It is this class of dykes of which we
find such    interesting  illustrations in Arran.
   These Arran dykes belong to the latest volcanic eruptions of the
British Islands; their analogues are found alike in the South of
Scotland, and in the North of England and of Ireland. They are
the infilled fissures along which sporadic volcanic outbursts took
place after the extinction of the great volcanoes of the Inner Hebrides.
The subaerial products of these later, and, for the most part, insigni
ficant volcanic eruptions, have been all swept away by denudation,
except at Beinn Hiant and the Sgár of Eigg,
   The materials filling these dykes belong to two totally different
classes,    one distinctly basic, with about 55 per cent. of silica; and
the other markedly acid in composition, with from 65 to 75 per cent.
of silica. The basic rock is an augite-andesite, which passes some
times into an intersertal and occasionally into an ophitic dolerite
(tholeite and diabase); the glass of this rock shows a great tendency
to separate from the phenocrysts.           The acid rock is often a highly

vitreous material (“pitchstone’ or “pitchstone-porphyry’)            which
by devitrification passes into various forms of felsite and quartz
felsite. These rocks, if we class them according to the nature of
the porphyritic minerals they contain, fall into the several groups of
vitrophyric and trachytoid lavas, to which the terms pantellerite,
quartz-pantellerite, rhyolite, andesite, and dacite have been applied.
The glassy groundmass in the whole of these rocks, however, is
always abundant, and         characters are remarkably uniform how
                                        its
ever much the phenocrysts may vary.

Mhor; this dyke traverses the granite, and has been excellently de
scribed          by
              Ramsay and Bryce. The sides         the dyke are composed          of
of  augite-andesite, having     specific gravity   a   2.71 and       silica          of                       a
percentage       56; the centre
                      of            the dyke consists       of quartz-pan                       of   a
tellerite with glassy base (“pitchstone-porphyry’)            passing into
various stony varieties; this acid rock has      specific gravity     2:36,      a                              of

are  strikingly  contrasted with one another, alike        the characters                   in
 of   all
        their porphyritic crystals and      their vitreous bases. The  of

 crystallization and liquation going on within the magma which has
been injected into the dyke, no such explanation is sufficient in the
case of the composite dykes of the second class, to which the
examples cited from Arran belong.
   That the association of two totally different rocks in the same
dyke is not accidental, the numerous and varied examples at
Tormore sufficiently prove.      Where, as in these cases, we find that
there is the greatest dissimilarity   between both the crystals and the
glassy groundmass of the two rocks, it is clear that the differentiation
has taken place in the magma prior to           injection into the dykes,     its

ON A PHOTOMETRIC METHOD WHICH IS INDEPENDENT                                         OF COLOUR.
                                BY   OGDEN. N. ROOD.
THEin principle
      use
                underlying most of the photometric methods now
           depends on a comparison of the illumination of two
adjacent fields; in some instances, as where a spot or a ring is
made to disappear, this idea is thinly disguised, but instantly
becomes apparent when the lights are differently coloured.
   The object of the present paper is to present a mode of pro
cedure in which the coloration of the two surfaces, even though at
a maximum of vividness, is a matter of entire indifference, since
the process depends not on a comparison of these surfaces, but on
the shock which the retina experiences when one surface is quickly
withdrawn and replaced by another. If we take a uniform circular
disk of any colour, illuminate it evenly, and then set it in rotation
slowly or rapidly, the retina will receive no shock, since the parts
replacing each other in the retinal image are in  respects identical;    all
in other words,       no
                     flickering will    perceived. If, however, one

disk so as to employ the previously unused surfaces. Small irre
gularities of texture or a sandy appearance do not interfere with
the use of the disks to a noticeable extent, but when the depth of
the tint changes slowly over an extended surface it gives more
trouble.   Of course the case frequently arose where in the entire
hundred disks not one could be found with which the flickering
entirely disappeared at quite low rates of rotation, and here it
was necessary to determine with which grey disk the flicker was at
a minimum.     This was accomplished by combining the same coloured
disk with two grey disks, a larger and a smaller, on the same axis,
when it would become evident which was the more favourable
combination, and the observer would notice that the luminosity of
the coloured disk must be nearer to one grey disk than to its mate,
 or about equally distant from both.
   As before stated, results were obtained for six disks, but these
 were selected so as to be complementary to each other in pairs,
 and in order to test the process they were now combined pair-wise
 and the resultant luminosities of their grey mixtures were deter
 mined by the old method, and afterwards calculated on the basis of
 the figures furnished by the flickering process:–

  Accordingly, in measuring the reflecting-power of the grey disks
  by the old method, the standard white and black disks were com
 bined with a small amount of an orange-yellow disk, which made
 their mixture match the tint of the grey disk under experiment.
 The luminosity of the orange-yellow disk in terms of standard
 white cardboard being known, the final result was calculated with
 equal facility and the annoyance removed. It is hardly necessary
 to add that in        all
                    cases the amount      white light reflected fromof
 the standard black disk was taken into account.

experiments for dividing up even the interval between two disks
have been begun, with promising results, but are not yet finished.
    It is well known that gazing steadily at a flickering surface is
trying to the eyes, but in the operations above described no incon
venience whatever from this source was experienced, since if the
flicker was strong a glance revealed the fact and another disk was
substituted; the faint flickering which demands more prolonged
attention seems to be no more trying to the eyes than ordinary
optical work.
    It may be a matter of some interest in physiological optics to
know that the sensation called “flickering ” is independent of wave
length and connected with change in luminosity.       When two dif
ferently-coloured surfaces of the same luminosity are successively
presented to the eye as above described, no shock is experienced,
and the colours are seen to mingle in a soft streaky way; if obser
vation is prolonged for some time, subjective effects begin to
manifest themselves, especially with quite low rates of rotation; it
is of course best not to study these with undue curiosity.—American

        EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS ON DIELECTRICS.
                   BY DR. G. BENISCHRE.
  In   the first part of the research the author determines the
dielectric constants of a few solid bodies by Gordon's method, as
modified by Lester, but in which, instead of the Ruhmkorff's coil,
the alternating current of the Innsbruck installation was used for
charging the condenser. This charges the condenser alternately
positively and negatively, so that the formation of residues of
either kind is thereby avoided.       In order to attain greater sensi
tiveness the   alternating  current was transformed into one of higher
tension   by means of an induction-coil.      In this way it was possible
to use various tensions. It was found that the dielectric constant
is independent of the strength of the electric field in the condenser;
this also proves that there is no appreciable conductivity in the
dielectric, for if there had been              its
                                           capacity must also have been
increased with increase of tension.          The dielectric constant of
paraffin was found     to    1-89, ebonite 2:03, sulphur 2:42, ordinary
                            be
glass 417–4:52, plate glass 385.

ON THE USE of CUPRIC NITRATE IN THE VOLTAMETER, AND THE
  ELECTRO-CHEMICAL  EQUIVALENT OF COPPER. BY F. E. BEACH.
   According to the author the advantages possessed by the nitrate
may be enumerated as follows:–
   1st. The weight of copper deposited does not appear to depend
on the current-density.
   2nd. It permits the use of a high current-density.
   The limit is not easily stated. When 0.25 ampere per square
centimetre is reached the cathode needs watching, for it will fringe
at the edge but does not become powdery.
   No way was found to prevent the branching with a high current
density.
   A greater amount of NH,Cl should be present when the current
density is increased.
   3rd. The weight of copper is practically independent of the
temperature between 10° and 35°C.
   The tendency to oxidation is increased by lowering the tempera
ture, but this may be easily counteracted by the addition of more
NH,Cl.
 ºth. The solution may    be used a number of times.
   5th. The equivalent agrees to four figures with that calculated
from the best chemical determinations, viz.:-
             Richards     Eq. =(3294.4+01) x 10-7.
            First Series   Eq. =(3294.8+0.43) × 10-7.
            Second Series Eq. =(32939-E0:39) x 10–7.
  The purity of the nitrate as a condition of success is to be
emphasized.    One specimen tried, which contained nitrite, was
absolutely worthless with the foregoing   treatment.—American
Journal of Science, August 1893.

            Measuring the Surface-Tension         of Liquids.          387
contact-angle in some cases in which the wall is wet by the
liquid. In support of this assertion he gives the result of a
large number of measurements of bubbles and drops, from
which the surface-tension is found to be considerably greater
than the values found from the measurement of elevations in
capillary tubes.       For water at 25°C. the mean of a small
number of measurements, which differ from each other by
ten per cent. in some cases, gives*T-81 dynes (84.5 at zero).
Worthington f points out that Quincke's formula is only
roughly approximate under the conditions of his measure
ments, and recalculates some of his results. The number 81
is thus reduced to 72.1 (75-6 at zero).            Magief prefers the
value 77-6 (81-1 at zero), calculating from the same data.
 From his own measurements of drops and air-bubbles Magie Š
found for water T=719 dynes at 22°5 C. (75.1 at zero).
Timberg | from similar measurements found T= 80.5–182t
for water.     Bravais" and others have used the same method
for other liquids. The discussion regarding these results has
put a premium on methods which are independent of a contact
angle and whose mathematical relations are undisputed.

of the surface-tension of water between 10° and 97°8 C. by                 .
adhesion-disks, calls attention to the rapid decrease in the
adhesion of the disk as the boiling-point is approached. This
is no doubt due to disengagement of vapour near the surface
of the disk, and may perhaps be an indication that the water
was not completely deprived of air.                 Buys-Ballot gives
T=75:1–236 t          dynes.    Merianff    objects  both to the calcu
lation and to the formula used, and calculates from the same
data T=78.5–253t.             Hagenff finds by this method a result
much too low for the tension of pure water. Weinberg $$
finds T-801–177 t dynes. Miss Poekels|| obtained some
interesting qualitative results with very simple apparatus.

    Wilhelmy" weighed a rectangular plate of known dimen
sions and specific gravity when dipped a determinate distance
into the liquid. He made a large number of determinations
which agreed closely for any one plate, but varied greatly
for plates of different materials in the same liquid. Using a
glass plate in water at 0°C. he found T=77-9 dynes, assuming
                                                                     º
that the angle of contact is zero.
  Waterston+ and Worthington: modified Wilhelmy's method,
touching only the lower edge of the plate to the         surface.
   Sentis $ measured with a spherometer the height of a
weighed and measured rectangular iron plate floating on
mercury, eliminated the irregularity due to the corners by
means of a second plate of the same thickness and density,
and deduced the value of the surface-tension of the mercury.
    Lenard || arranged a regular succession of falling drops so
as to be seen by intermittent light; measured the extent and
time of their oscillations; and from these data calculated the
surface-tension.     For water he found T=70-3 dynes at 16°C.
(72.6 at   zero),  the mean of a considerable number of deter
minations.     With reasonable care in this method a clean
surface is ensured, and no question of contact-angle interferes
with confidence in the results.
    Rayleigh" measured the wave-length of the transverse
vibrations of water-jets issuing under constant pressure from
elliptical orifices. The results, which are not closely con
cordant, are in harmony with the supposition that the surface
tension is about 76 dynes.
    Rayleigh’” also measured the wave-length of ripples and
calculated the surface-tension by Thomson's formula.        Par
ticular attention was given to the purity of the water-surface,
and the results appear to be free from constant errors.
Individual determinations differ by 2 dynes in a few cases.
The mean of all, for both distilled water and tap water, is
T=739 dynes at 18°C., corresponding to 754 at zero, which
happens to be exactly the mean of                    all

capillary tubes.

                         of

a rod of almost any material sufficiently rigid which is wet by
the liquid will serve as well. For mercury a steel needle
       with copper and well amalgamated has been suggested.
 n my investigations the rod was of glass, and formed part
of a glass frame (fig. 1) whose form was varied to suit the
circumstances.    The essentials of a good frame are the
following:—
   (a) It must not yield sensibly under the tension of the
                film.
     (b) The bar      must be thin, and
                                m            parts      and    must  all             of   m        n

            tally both with and without the film.

edge seemed to enter the liquid at once when lowered, and
when raised slowly parted from the liquid first at the two
ends and lastly in the middle of the lower edge. After
adjustment the holder and plate were washed, dried over a
Bunsen flame, attached to the balance in the same way as
the frame (fig. 2), left hanging over the liquid to be examined
until the temperatures were nearly the same, then weighed.
The index of the balance was next set exactly at zero, taking
care that the beam was not lifted, and the liquid slowly raised
by turning the screw-handle s until it touched the plate. The
weight was again adjusted to bring the index exactly to zero.
For a second determination the plate was lifted out of the
liquid by tipping the balance-beam, the liquid lowered a little,
and after all visible disturbance of the surface had ceased the
operation of setting was repeated.        The surface-area of the
liquid must be so great that the measurement is not sensibly
increased by the lowering of level due to the capillary
elevation; or else this must be taken account of in the
calculation.
   It was necessary to ascertain, in the first place, whether the
contact-angle can be considered zero to the limit of accuracy
attainable by this method, and if so under what conditions.
I proceeded to try plates of various materials in some liquids
whose tension could be found by Michelson's method.

dust &c. are more easily seen, but it requires careful washing
with a soft brush.
   Under favourable conditions—a fresh clean surface, con
stant temperature, no dust, no disturbing vapours—a high
degree of accuracy is attainable by this method. The fol

were most nearly fulfilled.

    It has been already stated that,          in order to form a true film
 between the    liquid    and the bar m of the frame (fig. 1), this
 bar   must be from          five to ten millimetres above the level
 surface.   Even when the bar is excessively thin a distinct

maximum of weight is noticeable as the frame is raised, just
before the true double-film is formed.   This maximum can be
found very exactly, and is made the basis of a third method
of measuring surface-tension.
   An equation to the capillary curve is found in the expres
sion of the fact, that the vertical component of the

     This method is capable of showing a change of surface
tension with almost incredible delicacy when the frame is
rigid. A single example is given below. The liquid was
common alcohol, at 20°20 C., and each weight was found
with a fresh film. The increase of weight (W) due to the
tension is given in grams. The corresponding values of T
were not calculated.

   Frames of this sort cannot be made with such exactness as
to give practical results agreeing with those calculated to
1 part in 70,000, nor to 1 in 7000.   But if the values of the
surface-tension are found by either of the methods before
described, and compared with W/p in each case, the values
of r and k may be corrected for any particular frame, so that
reliable results may be obtained with it for other liquids with
much greater ease than by the former methods.
   For this purpose put n=l–2r–tr/2, and 8= a<U+017F> 2. Then
equation (9) becomes
 27trº sin 8(c 4-2r sin 3) + n sin & cos Á(cº–2r” +4cr sin 3
     +4,” sin"3}+rºn(2–7)+Trc”—27trºk—W/p=0. . (10)

    –8Tr'sin & cos Á–2Trºc cos Á—cºn =0. . . . . (11)
   These equations are almost unmanageable, however, and
time will be saved in most cases by disregarding them and
  lotting a curve of experimental values to show the relation
   tween T and W/p for a given frame.
   The convenience of this method in practice will repay the
trouble of finding such a relation. While Michelson's method
has the merit of directness and simplicity,       use      its

existence of a finite contact-angle.       The maximum-weight
method is free from both these objections, and can be used
for almost any liquid.                       If
                              the specific gravity of the liquid is
not  accurately known,    a thin frame should be used, so that
an error in the specific gravity will have small influence on
the final result.   For accurate results great care must be
taken to prevent  any  oscillation of the balance as the weight
approaches the maximum.         Zero weighings are also essential.
                          III.    SURFACE-TENSION OF WATER.
    In spite of the labours of a large number of investigators,
the surface-tension of water is still more or less uncertain.
Apart from experimental errors, which are seldom less than
one half of one per cent, there is very great difficulty in
retaining a pure water surface throughout the measurement.
Using the methods of measurement described in Part                                                II.   of

            Measuring the Surface-Tension
  On several occasions water that was left in the glass dish
in the closed closet over night was found next morning to

greater, even when the cover was on the dish during the
whole time. But after a vigorous stirring the surface-tension
was in each case a little greater than it had been at first. The
substance, whatever it was, that made the change, being
                                                                    of Liquids.                 411

scattered throughout the whole volume of the water, and
hence present in very minute quantity in the surface-layers,
increased the surface-tension.

                                                                                              a
for brevity          I shall
                         call crystalline molecules. The crystalline
molecule may be the smallest portion which can be taken from
the substance without chemical decomposition—that is to say,
it may be the group of atoms kept together by chemical
affinity, which constitutes what for brevity I shall call the
chemical molecule; or it may be a group of two, three,
or more of these chemical molecules kept together by
cohesive force. In a crystal of tartaric acid the crystalline
molecule may be, and it seems to me probably                                 the                              is,

              Elasticity of a Crystal according to Boscovich.                                                            415
original description of his discovery of the magnetic polariza
tion contains ample warning.
   $ 3. These questions, however, of chirality and magnetic
 rotation do not belong to my present subject, which is merely
the forcive" required to keep a crystal homogeneously strained
to any infinitesimal extent from the condition in which it rests
when no force acts upon it from without.     In the elements of
the mathematical theory of elasticity       we find that this                     f
forcive constitutes what is called a homogeneous stress, and
is specified completely by six generalized force-components,

                              CO= OC=Xs
    Thus A' and A are O's nearest neighbours; and B' and B,
O's next-nearest neighbours; and C' and C, O’s nearest
neighbours not in the plane AOB.                (It should be understood
that there     may     be in the  plane   AOB points which, though at
    eater distances from O than B and B', are nearer to O than
are C and Cº.)
     § 30. Supposing, now, BOC, B'OC', &c., to be the acute
angles between the three lines meeting in O; we have two
equal and dichirally similar * tetrahedrons of which each of
the four faces is a scalene acute-angled triangle.                      That
every angle in and between the faces is acute we readily see,
by remembering that OC and OC are shorter than the dis
tances of O from any other of the points on the two sides
 of the plane AOBt.
     § 31. As a preliminary to the engineering of an incom
pressible elastic solid according to Boscovich, it is convenient
 now to consider a special case of scalene tetrahedron, in which
 perpendiculars from the four corners to the four opposite faces
 intersect in one point.         I do not know if the species of tetra
 hedron which fulfils this condition has found a place in geo
 metrical treatises, but I am informed by Dr. Forsyth that it
 has appeared in Cambridge examination papers.                      For m
 present purpose it occurred to me thus:—Let Q0, QA, QB,
 QC be four lines of given lengths drawn from one point, Q.
 It is required to draw them in such relative directions that
 the volume of the tetrahedron OABC is a maximum.                      What
 ever be the four given lengths, this problem clearly has one
 real solution and one only ; and it is such that the four planes
 BOC, COA, AOB, ABC are cut perpendicularly by the lines
  AQ, BQ, CQ, OQ, respectively, each produced through Q.
 Thus we see that the special tetrahedron is defined by four
 lengths, and conclude that two equations among the six edges
 of the tetrahedron in general are required to make it our
  special tetrahedron.
     * Either of   these may be turned round so as to coincide with the image
  of the  other in any plane mirror.    Either may be called a pervert of the
  other; as, according to the usage of some writers, an object is called a
    ervert of another if one of them can be brought to coincide with the
  lin age

    § 32. Hence we see the following simple way of drawing
a  special tetrahedron.   Choose as data three sides of one face
and the length perpendicular to it from the opposite angle.
The planes through this perpendicular, and the angles of the
triangle, contain the perpendiculars from these angles to the
opposite sides of the tetrahedron, and therefore cut the
                                                                       º
opposite sides of the triangle perpendicularly.        (Thus, par
enthetically, we have a proof of the known theorem of ele
mentary geometry that the perpendiculars from the three
angles of a triangle to the opposite sides intersect in one
Let ABC be the chosen triangle and S the point in which it

is cut by the perpendicular from 0, the opposite corner of the
tetrahedron.   AS, BS, CS, produced through S, cut the
opposite sides perpendicularly, and therefore we find the point
S by drawing two of these perpendiculars and taking their
point of intersection.  The tetrahedron is then found by
drawing through Sa line SO of the given length perpendicular
to the plane of ABC.    (We have, again parenthetically, an
interesting geometrical theorem.   The perpendiculars from
A, B, C to the planes of OBC, OCA, OAB cut OS in the
same point; SO being of any arbitrarily chosen length.)
         I
   § 33. wish now to show how an incompressible homo
geneous solid of wholly oblique crystalline configuration can
be constructed without going beyond Boscovich for material.
Consider, in any scalene assemblage, the plane of the line
A'OA through any point O and                its
                                         nearest neighbours, and
the line B'OB   through   the same    point   and           its
                                                       next-nearest
neighbours.   To    fix
                      the ideas, and avoid circumlocutions, we
shall suppose this plane   to    be
                                  horizontal.     Consider the two
parallel planes  of points nearest       the plane above
                                            to                 and     it
below   it.  The corner    C    ofthe acute-angled tetrahedron
OABC, which we have been considering,             one  isthe points
                                                                  of

shall suppose.   And the corner C" of the equal and dichirally
similar tetrahedron OA'B'C' is one of the points in the nearest
parallel plane below. All the points in the plane through C
are corners of equal tetrahedrons chirally similar to OABC,
and standing on the horizontal triangles oriented as BOA.
All the points C' in the nearest plane below are corners of
tetrahedrons chirally similar to OA'B'C' placed downwards on
the triangles oriented as BOA'.          The volume of the tetra
hedron OABC is , of the volume of the parallelepiped, of
which OA, OB, OC are conterminous edges.             Hence the sum
                                          is all
of the volumes of         the upward tetrahedrons having their
bases    one plane
            in                 the volume               of
                                                 the space between                     of
large areas     these   of
                       planes    and,  therefore, the sum    :      the                                            of    all

XLV.        Note on some Thermal Properties      of a Mixture of Car

IN acid,
   his classical researches on thermal properties of carbonic
         Andrews found the isothermals for 13°1 and 21°5 a
little rounded-off at the points of complete liquefaction and of
complete evaporation, and pointed out that this was due to a
                                                                   .#
very small unavoidable admixture of air in the gas.    Maxwell
was much interested in this “question, of an exceedingl
interesting nature,” as appears from his letters to
Andrews then made a further investigation on the subject,
the results of which were given in an abstract              f.
                                                     A further
i.
account was published as a posthumous paper in the “Philoso
phical Transactions’ for 1886 S.
                .
    The subject did not remain unattacked by other physicists
working in this part of the field of investigation. Cailletet"
made some experiments as early as 1880 on mixtures of car
bonic acid        other gases, on which Jamin wrote a note **.
 In  England,   Ansdell was occupied with various mixtures of
               acid and carbonic acid ft.
    Cailletet studied especially the very curious fact of the
 appearance    and disappearance   of the condensed state at
 certain   temperatures  and pressures; Ansdell confined his
 attention to the determinations of the critical temperatures of
 the mixtures; while Dewar described many interesting facts
 relating to the behaviour of carbonic acid in presence of
                                         wº,
 other substances ff. Andrews's paper contains a series of
H.
measurements    on changes of             pressures, and tem
peratures of the mixture of carbonic acid and nitrogen in the
            of 3 to 4. Thus, although the paper was pub
 ished, according to Prof. Tait, twelve years after the date of
experiment, yet it has remained, and still remains, so far as
I  am aware, a very complete investigation and perhaps the
only one.

q/760 is an unknown factor; but inasmuch as Andrews
mentions in his first Bakerian Lecture that the difference
rarely exceeded 200 mm., a correction arising from this is so
small that it can be safely neglected.  For example, since

  M. Amagat makes       use of isothermals of another type, of
which the   product po  is taken for ordinate, and the pressure
p for abscissa.   For the sake of comparison they are drawn
in fig. 2. The product prºhas a minimum value for each

temperature.    The parts of the isothermals which are on the
left-hand side of that value are appreciably convex towards
the origin, while those which are on the right-hand side seem
to converge asymptotically, their curvatures tending to be
come zero. These features belong to isothermals of this type
for pure carbonic acid at much higher temperatures; thus an
admixture of a more permanent gas like nitrogen seems to
have the same effect as a rise of temperature, as a priori
would be probable. The locus of these minima can be found
 from the characteristic equation, but          its
                                            equation   almost

geneous mass must have presented themselves in a very
striking manner at higher temperatures and under stronger

the above optically homogeneous appearance.
   It is therefore very likely, as Jamin remarked, that we
have under those circumstances of temperature and pressure
nothing that is different in kind from what we see under
ordinary circumstances.
   Dewar's experiments, especially those on liquefaction of
carbonic acid in presence of other liquids, are interesting
from our point of view, and we cannot but think of some
such process as interdiffusion being in action through                                                     all

to change of temperature when force acting on the surface
prevents change of volume or shape. Thus we have in all
21 independent coefficients for piezo-electricity and pyro
electricity; to be determined for a real crystal by observation.
It is interesting to see how our model can be constructed to
realize the piezo-electric and pyro-electric phenomena in
accordance with any given values of these 21 coefficients, by
                                      º,
experimental solution of as much of the mathematical problem
of § 4 as is necessary for the purpose.
    § 12. Choose any convenient             spherical or not wildly
different from spherical, for each molecule.             Divide the
whole surface into 22     parts  (not wildly  unequal   nor extrava
#.        different from squares or equilateral equi-angular
  exagons), and number them 0, 1, 2, . . . . 21. Construct a
trial molecule with part 0 always of copper; and with, for
first trial, part 1 of zinc, and parts 2, 3, . . . . . 21 of copper.
Take a large number of such molecules and make of them a
Bravais homogeneous assemblage with any arbitrarily chosen
                       ji.
values for the six edges of the fundamental acute-angled
tetrahedrons.      Connect the molecules homogeneously by
springs of non-conducting material in the manner described
in S 2 above. To                fully for pyro-electricity, without
hypothesis, we must now take care that these springs are
such, that when the temperature is changed, and the border
molecules are held fixed, all the interior molecules shall be
caused to rotate round parallel axes through equal angles
proportional to the difference of temperature.             For this
purpose the springs must be of two or more different
materials; and when set in their proper positions between
the molecules they must be under stress, some of them
pushing and some pulling, in the undisturbed condition of
the assemblage.
   § 13. Subject   now the assemblage        successively to six
different  geometrical   strain-components,   e,f, g, a, b, c ; and
to one    change of   temperature,  t, with the boundary mole
cules held fixed. With each of these seven configurations,
measure, by three separate measurements conducted according
to the method described in § 10, the three components of
the sum of the electric moments of the molecules in unit
volume.
   § 14. Repeat the same 21 measurements with part 2 of
the surface of each molecule zinc, and        all
                                                the rest copper:
next with part    3 zinc, and   allthe rest copper and
                                                    :         so on.
Thus we have 21° distinct      measurements,  each   giving    inde
pendently one      the 21° multipliers [a,e, 1], [a,

    The spindle of one of the rollers is attached to an 8-day
 English clock from which the escapement

 running down under such circumstances being compensated
for by means of a fusee adjustment.
    The following measurements were made to determine
                                                                       to
what extent the clock, thus modified, could be relied upon
                                                                       to
give a constant speed to the shutter
                                            at different stages of the
unwinding of the spring.
    Four sets of ten consecutive readings were taken of the
time of opening of the shutter. Two series of
were made.                                              measurements
   These numbers show that during forty revolutions of the
shutter the variation in the time of exposure is exceedingly
small, and it is obvious that by using
...
                                             the same portion of the
         in each case 10 or 15 exposures may be made where
the time is practically constant*.
   * The fact that it takes a slightly shorter time to open the shutter
when the spring has partly run down, as is seen from the
                                                         above readings,
must be due, we think, to the fusee not being turned quite accurately.

   In conclusion, it may be pointed out that the present
modification has the advantage of portability, and measure
ments can be taken when it is                          in any position. Further,
since the shutter moves at a constant rate, the time during
which any portion of the slit is open is directly proportional
to that occupied in opening the entire slit, whereas in the
pendulum apparatus a series of calculations is necessary to
determine the length of time during which each millim. of
the total length of the slit is open.

              this is at least the fourth edition of Mr.              Payne's portion
SINCE(pp. 1–206) of the volume, it may be presumed to                      have met the
requirements of the examinees of the Science and Art Depart
ment, as also of many “Draughtsmen, Engineers and persons
engaged      in machine and building construction,”                       satisfactorily.
Indeed a glance through it shows that this elementary treatise of
Descriptive Geometry has been compiled with painstaking con
scientiousness in the effort to make its matter clear to those classes
of students.

 of Spheres, Cones, Cylinders, and Pyramids, together with the
 “development” of the surfaces of the two last-named solids,-refer
 ence being made for other cases to the “Crystallography” of the
 Series—contain what is regarded as the more elementary portion
 of the subject. More advanced problems on the Line and Plane:
 on the Projections and Plane Sections of Solids: on the less easy
 determination of the Intersections of Solids, as exemplified by two
 simple cases: on the Determination of Tangent Planes to Cylinders,
 Cones, and Spheres: on the Projection of Shadows: on Isometric
 Projection, cursorily treated, and stated to be “a branch of Ortho
 graphic,”       which latter adjective is barely explained as             “G.       orthos,
 right, straight; grapho, I write"—for “draw:” the six cases of
 the Spherical Triangle: lastly, on “Horizontal Projection.”
     It would be unreasonable to expect that so extensive a pro
 gramme could be treated with an adequate amount of demonstration
 within the limits prescribed to the author. Student-life is short ;
 and it is deemed necessary to train a certain number of proficients
 in the correct performance of the constructions, whether “the
 reason why” is known or not: “Est quadam prodire tenus, si non
datur ultra.” The diagrams inserted amidst the text are copious
and generally clear; while each chapter is accompanied by a
number of examples for exercise.
    The second part of the volume of 48 pages, numbered anew,
gives solutions of the most elementary problems of Constructive
Geometry (pp. 1–10): the constructive performance of the four
rules of Arithmetic, of involution and extraction of square roots
(12 pp.): the representation of areas and volumes by straight
lines (15 pp.); the elementary parts of “Graphical Statics" as far
as the Equilibrium of Coplanar Forces and the determination of
Centres of Gravity of Plane Areas: finally, a selection of Exercises
taken from the Science Examination        Papers “with hints and
solutions" (21 pp.)—a section requiring careful revision.     J. W.             J.

466                  Dr. Harry C. Jones on the
more special, and can be employed for determining particular
kinds of ions.
   The “osmotic-pressure” and “boiling-point” methods are
at present, however, not sufficiently accurate to admit of
extensive application for this purpose.      Some doubt has re
cently been cast on the accuracy of the “solubility’ method
for measuring dissociation, but it seems probable that the
method will be capable of yielding fair results in a limited
number of cases. The freezing-point method has hitherto
been open to the same objections as apply to the boiling
point and osmotic-pressure methods.
    The “conductivity" method has been then, up to the
present time, by far the most accurate and general method
for measuring dissociation. It has this particular advantage,
that it can be applied to very dilute solutions.
    The “freezing-point” method, as improved by Beckmann”,
is of limited application, since it cannot be used for very dilute
solutions; indeed, it can scarcely be applied to solutions more
 dilute than 0-01 m. It has now, however, been so developed
 that the dissociation of solutions as dilute as 0.004 or 0.005 m
can be   fairly well determined.
                            The Apparatus.
   The apparatus employed was essentially the same in prin
ciple as that devised by Beckmann, in which every part was
very greatly enlarged. The thermometer used was made espe
cially for this work, and the scale was divided directly into
thousandths of a degree, so that with a small lens one could
read accurately to a ten-thousandth part of a degree.      This
thermometer was very carefully calibrated. The entire scale
corresponded to only 0.6°C.
   The vessel in which the solution whose freezing-point was
to be determined was placed had a capacity of about 1200
cub. centim., and just a litre of the solution was used in each
determination.    The remainder of the apparatus, designed
for the gradual cooling of the solution and for maintaining
constant temperature, is shown in drawings, figs. 1, 2, and 3,

   The form of stirrer there described has been found to be
 very efficient. All currents produced on the upward stroke
 of the stirrer were completely reversed on the downward.

investigated, a stirrer of silver plated with gold by electrolysis
was employed. A glass cover was also used for the inner
vessel instead of a plate of brass covered with asphalt.
                        The Method      of Work.
   The compounds used were purified by the methods best
adapted to the different substances and standard solutions
prepared.
   The freezing-point of exactly a litre of distilled water,
which had been cooled nearly to zero before it was placed in
the inner vessel, was determined each morning.             Was}.
found to differ very slightly from day to day. This slight
difference was doubtless due to small changes in the large
bulb of the thermometer, which was about 14 centim. long
 and 1.5 centim. in width.
   A convenient number of cubic centimetres was removed
from the litre of water by means of a graduated and calibrated
pipette, and an equal volume of the standard solution added.
The freezing-point of this new solution was then determined
after it had been carefully mixed.
   The vessel containing the solution was then removed from
the cold bath and the ice which had formed was allowed to
melt.    Again a certain number of cubic centimetres was
removed from this solution, and exactly an equal number of
the standard solution added, and the freezing-point of this
new solution determined.      This was continued as long as it
seemed desirable to concentrate the solution to be investigated.
Thus   allsolutions were prepared directly from the original
standardized solution.       Itwas not possible         to
                                                        measure the
freezing-point     ofmore than four          or
                                            five concentrations          in
one day. Every evening the vessel containing the solution
was emptied, and        onthe following morning the freezing
point  ofa litre   pure
                  of    water determined.          A
                                                   sufficient volume
of the water was removed and of the standard solution added
 to make the concentration slightly greater than the last
employed. This new solution was then concentrated and the
freezing-points determined        as the preceding day.

been concentrated, only 1.5 per cent. remains so nearly con
stant that the error would be entirely inappreciable.
   Further, this correction does not take into account the ice
which separated during the time required for the thermometer
to become constant.      But on account of the form of the
apparatus and        the large volume      of solution employed, the
cooling
           "..."         so  slowly  that the amount of ice which
separated during this time was comparatively small, and no
serious error could have been introduced from this source.
    A great advantage in the regulation of the temperature
was derived from the use of such a large volume of the solu
tions. The surface of the solution exposed to the cold layer
of air was relatively very much diminished, and the solution
itself would therefore be affected much less by external
changes in temperature.           The cooling of the solution pro
ceeded   very   slowly:   therefore the accuracy of the measurement
at  any  given    time would be much increased. When small
volumes of solutions are employed, the continued separation
of the ice is comparatively rapid, and the solutions are thus
ever concentrated by a large and unknown amount. This
necessarily affects the accuracy of such determinations very
considerably.
    A number of duplicate determinations of the freezing
point of the same solution were made with this enlarged
apparatus and improved method, and in no case did the
individual determinations differ from each other by more
than 0-0004°.          For the most dilute solutions duplicate
measurements        were made, and the figure given is the mean
result.
    Whenever an acid was used, a drop of a dilute solution of
the same acid was added to the litre of water each morning
 before the freezing-point of the water was determined. This
was for the purpose of neutralizing any trace of ammonia
present, and to convert        all             of

The results with the three alkalies cannot be regarded as so
accurate as those with the acids and salts. The solutions were
of necessity in contact with the air and must have absorbed
small amounts of carbon dioxide.    The solutions were, how
ever, so very dilute that the magnitude of the error could
not have been great.
                  The Results with Electrolytes.
   On account of the method of preparing the solutions, the
concentrations actually investigated are not those which are
commonly employed in work: they are not simple fractional
parts of a normal solution. The results with the solutions
used have already been partly recorded ", and the remainder
will appear later in the same journal. For convenience in
comparison and for future work, the results obtained have
been plotted as curves, and the lowering of the freezing
point for simple decimal parts of a normal solution read off
from the curves.   The remaining values for each concentra
tion have been calculated from this lowering.
   In the Tables, column 1 contains the strength of the solu
tions in terms of gram-molecular normal. This was employed
instead of gram-equivalent normal, because a molecule pro
duces the same lowering of the freezing-point whatever the
equivalence of the acid or base may be. Column 2 contains
the corrected lowerings of the freezing-point.   Column 3, the
lowerings of the freezing-point which would have been pro

    The    experimental       results have been plotted as curves
 (Plates IV. to    IX.),     in which the ordinates represent con
 centrations, and the abscissas lowering of the freezing-point.
 In the first curve of each set, the ordinate unit = 0.0005
 normal, and the abscissa unit=0.0015° lowering of freezing
 point for the electrolytes, and 0-0010° lowering of freezing
point for the non-electrolytes. In the second the units are
increased ten times, and in the same ratio as the concentra
tions are increased.         In the third the units are the same as
in the second. That the third curve may be placed in a
convenient position with respect to the others, 0:1 normal is
subtracted from the ordinates, and the lowering produced by
0-1 normal from the abscissas for the third curve.
   The first curve extends from about 0.001 normal to about
0-01 normal; the second from this point to about 0.1 normal;
and the third from here to about 0.2 normal, when the                in
vestigations were carried so far.
   The points marked on the curves correspond to the con
centrations actually used in the experiments, and the lowerings
of the freezing-point produced by these concentrations. For
the organic compounds, the first curve extends from the most
dilute solution used to about 0.01 normal.

                     Discussion of THE RESULTs.
   The chlorides of potassium, sodium, and ammonium have
been found to give the same dissociation within the limits of
experimental errors. The same fact was found by Noyes"
from his “Solubility” investigations.    Two complete series
of measurements have been made with solutions of sodium
chloride, and the mean results are given as the most exact for
the three chlorides.     A number of solutions of potassium and
ammonium chlorides have, however, been measured f. The
curve from the results with sodium chloride (Pl. IV. curves 1, 2)
can also be regarded as expressing the results in               three                   all
cases.   The dissociation of the chlorides and other salts de
creases more        less regularly with the increase
                     or                                      concen                in
tration.   Certain apparent exceptions will            noticed here        be

a monovalent anion and a monovalent kation.                        Each ion   con
tains only one element, with the exception of the kation NH4,
which resembles so closely the alkali elements.    This is the
simplest kind of dissociation, and regularities which appear
with these salts might not be found when the molecules are
more complicated and yield more complex ions. It may be
said in advance that such regularities do exist in general, and
will be seen from an examination of the following compounds.
   Potassium Sulphate.—The molecules of potassium sulphate
dissociate into two univalent kations and one bivalent anion.
The molecules here, as with other compounds which give
three ions, may dissociate at first into K and KSO, and then
with increase in dilution the ion KSO, dissociate into K and
SO. The freezing-point method is not capable of deciding
this point, since it has to do with the quantity and not the
quality of the ions present.  This problem must be solved by
a study of some property of the particular ions, electrical or
otherwise.
   The complete dissociation of potassium sulphate into three
ions is less than the complete dissociation of potassium chloride
for all the dilutions measured.          This difference increases
rapidly with the concentration. At 0:01 n it is about 8 per
cent., while at 0.1 n it is about 20 per cent. This rapid
decrease in dissociation with increase in concentration for
potassium sulphate is seen in curve 4, Plate IV., which
rapidly rises from the abscissa and approaches curve 3.
    The comparison between the isotonic coefficients from
osmotic pressure and the molecular lowering of the freezing
point for this and other salts has been made by de Vries*.
   Barium Chloride.—The molecules of barium chloride, like
the molecules of potassium sulphate, dissociate into three ions,
but into one bivalent kation and two univalent anions. The
complete dissociation here is less than for the alkali chlorides,
and this difference also increases with the concentration. The
decrease in dissociation with increase in concentration is less
rapid than for potassium sulphate.
   Magnesium Sulphate.—The molecules of this salt dissociate
into two ions, a bivalent kation and a bivalent anion. This
differs from the alkali chlorides, which also yield two ions, in
that both ions in the former case are bivalent, in the latter
univalent.     It also differs from the two salts just considered,
which   give  three ions, one bivalent and two univalent.
   The   compounds     thus far considered can be regarded as
typical representatives of four different ways in which mole
cules dissociate into ions:—

because the   conductivity    results showed       abnormally small            an
dissociation.    These results also show that the chloride of
cadmium dissociates much less than the chloride of barium.

                 Dissociation    of Compounds in Water.                                   479
used was standardized against sodium and potassium car
bonates, both of which had been repeatedly recrystallized.
The chlorine was also determined as silver chloride.
     It will be of interest to compare the amount of the disso
ciation of the acids with that of their salts, to ascertain
whether the hydrogen of the acid or the replacing metal has
the greater tendency to dissociate from the molecules into ions.
     The chlorides of sodium, potassium, and ammonium disso
ciate iess than hydrochloric acid.            At 0 1 n this difference
amounts to about 4.5 per cent. The difference is still greater
when the acid is compared with the chlorides of barium, cad
mium, and zinc, which dissociate much less than the univalent
alkali chlorides.
     Sulphuric Acid.—The solution was titrated against an
all-ali which had been titrated against the standardized hydro
chloric acid. The sulphur was also determined as barium
sulphate.       Like the sulphates, it is quite possible that the acid
dissociates first into H and HSO, and with increased dilution
 HSO, dissociates into H and SO,. Sulphuric acid dissociates
 less than the potassium salt, which is the reverse to that
 observed with hydrochloric acid.          The dissociation of the acid
 is much      greater  than that of the   sulphate   of magnesium, but
 the dissociation of this salt is       abnormally     small, as will be
 shown later.
      Nitric Acid.—The solution was compared with alkalies
  which had been standardized against both hydrochloric and
 sulphuric acids. Nitric acid dissociates slightly more than                                  its
 alkali salts;    it    also
                       is       little more dissociated than hydro
                                 a
 chloric acid, but the difference         slight.
                                                is
      Phosphoric Acid.--The phosphoric acid used was prepared
 by    the oxidation      phosphorus with nitric acid. The arsenic
                            of
  present was precipitated           by
                                   hydrogen sulphide.         qualitative    A

  because the      conductivity  shows    very  small dissociation.                           It
  shows, further, that the acid probably dissociates into only
  two ions, H     and HyPO, since the greatest conductivity           less               is
  than if    the dissociation into two ions were complete.            The
   freezing-point results lead             to
                                        the same conclusions           the               as

 in    dissociation    over

 480                  Dr. Harry C. Jones   on the
 complete     dissociation, then becomes greater and greater
 with increase in concentration, and finally diminishes as we
 approach no dissociation.       This is clearly seen in curve 8
 (Plate   VI.), which   rapidly approaches  curve 7, while curve 9
 rises much less rapidly.
     Of the four acids investigated, the two monobasic (HCl
 and HNO3) dissociate to a greater degree than the dibasic
 (H2SO,), and this in turn more than the tribasic (HAPO,).
    Potassium Hydrocide.—The preparation was freed from
 carbonate, with special care, by solution in alcohol.     As has
 been pointed out, these results from the hydroxides cannot be
 regarded as thoroughly accurate, on account of the exposure
 to the air and the absorption of small amounts of carbon
 dioxide.    When the hydroxides were under investigation, all
 the water was boiled just previous to using and before the
                                }.
                                                  ºil.
 drop of alkali was added.          water used in the preparation
 of the original solution was also boiled and            protected
 from the carbon dioxide of the air, that the above error might
 be reduced to a minimum.
    The results show that potassium hydroxide is dissociated to
 very nearly the same degree as potassium chloride, while both
 are dissociated less than the hydrochloric acid. The dissocia
 tion of the hydroxide is greater than that of the sulphate,
 which in turn is more dissociated than the free sulphuric acid.
    Sodium 1//drowide.—The hydroxide used was prepared by
 allowing sodium to act upon water. The difference in the
 dissociation of sodium and potassium hydroxide is so slight
that it is probably the result of error caused by the presence
of unequal small quantities of carbonate. This difference
increases somewhat with increase in concentration ; but this
increase is so small that doubt exists as to whether it repre
sents an actual difference.     The relation between the degree
of dissociation of the hydroxides, acids, and salts, which exist
in the case of potassium, hold also for sodium.
    Ammonium Hydrocide.—The conductivity of ammonium
hydroxide has shown that the dissociation is only a small part
of that of the other hydroxides.       The freezing-point results
lead to the same      conclusion, yet the chloride of ammonium
undergoes the same dissociation as the chlorides of sodium
and potassium. This very small dissociation is seen in curves
5 and 6 (Plate VII.), which rise very rapidly as compared
with the curves for the other hydroxides.
    The solutions of ammonium hydroxide were exposed to the
same error from the carbon dioxide of the air as the other
hydroxides, and an additional error from the volatility of the
base.    This can be disregarded for the most dilute solutions,

               Dissociation of Compounds    in Water.           481
but is considerable for the more concentrated. After the
four most concentrated solutions had been measured, which
required several hours, the solution was titrated against
standard acid, and found to have lost about $ per cent. of the
calculated concentration.       This error increased rapidly with
increase in concentration, and prevented the use of more
concentrated solutions than those which were employed.
   Potassium Carbonate.—The carbonate is slightly more dis
sociated than the sulphate.        The carbon dioxide was also
removed from the water used in preparing the solutions of
the carbonates to prevent the formation of acid carbonates.
The solutions of the carbonates must have also been slightly
affected by the carbon dioxide of the air.        The hydrolysis of
the carbonate molecules into KOH and KHCOs by the water
in dilute solution, and the subsequent dissociation of these
products of hydrolysis, would give slightly too great lowerings
of the freezing-point and consequently a dissociation somewhat
too high.
   Sodium Carbonate.—Three compounds of potassium and
sodium have then been investigated—the chlorides, hydroxides,
and carbonates. The chlorides dissociate to the same degree,
within the limit of error; the hydroxides to very nearly the
same extent; sodium hydroxide possibly a little less in the
more concentrated solutions.       The carbonates have about the
same dissociation in the most dilute solutions, but the differ
ence noticed with the hydroxides increases here. Sodium
carbonate dissociates.less with increased concentration, and
this difference amounts to 4 per cent. at 0:1 n.
           Comparison with Kohlrausch's      Results from
                             Conductivity.
   The Conductivity method is probably the most exact
hitherto employed for determining dissociation.         It admits of
wide   application,  and has the   advantage    over the Freezing
| oint method that it can be    applied  to more dilute solutions.
    will suffice to compare a few of the results obtained by the
two methods.
   Most of the compounds discussed thus far in this communi
cation have been studied by Kohlrausch 4, as to their conduc
tivity, with that care which characterizes his work.         He has
employed equivalent-normal solutions throughout, while             I
have used gram-molecular normal.           Where the two do not
coincide, Kohlrausch's results have been reduced to molecular
normal and compared directly with mine. This applies to
                 * Kohlrausch, Wied. Ann. xxvi. p. 160.

and sodium carbonates.           The comparison will only be carried
to 0.002 or 0.003 molec. normal, beyond which the error in
my results is necessarily large, from the very small lowering
of the freezing-point to be measured.
    Since the following comparison is only approximate, and
does not demand the greatest accuracy, the highest molecular
conductivity found will be taken as azo in the calculation—
 dissociation   =  *.
                   Au Co
     The results from the two methods are given in the Table on
the opposite page, where column 1 contains the names of the
 compounds investigated, with the values used as puz : 2, con
 centrations of solutions compared, in gram-molecular normal ;
 3, the dissociation as calculated from Kohlrausch's results,
 using Conductivity method ; 4, the dissociation calculated
 from     my results, using the improved Freezing-point
 method.
     The general agreement between the results from the two
 methods is unmistakable.             Indeed, it is as close as could be
 expected when it is considered that such widely different
 properties of the ions as the lowering of the freezing-point
 of the solvent and the conduction of electricity are utilized
 in the two cases. Again, each method is doubtless affected
 by small errors peculiar to itself. It has been pointed
 out that a slight difference in the amount of dissociation
 would be produced by the difference in temperature at which
 the two series of measurements were made”.
     The dissociation of some of the salts as calculated from the
 lowering of the freezing-point is slightly greater than that
  calculated from the “Conductivity.”            A possible explanation
  in the case of the carbonates is to be found in the hydrolysis
  produced by the water. Shields f has shown that the amount
  of hydrolysis is at least nearly proportional to the square root of
  the dilution.    The products of the hydrolysis would conduct
  better than the carbonate molecules, and u2 at the greater
  dilution would be too large relative to uv. This would give
  too little dissociation from the            conductivity      results for
 those concentrations where the results are              compared.     This
  would also explain why the difference increases with the con
 centration.        he dissociation of magnesium sulphate, as
 calculated from the freezing-point results, is considerably
 lower for the concentrated solutions. This has been explained

484                   Dr. Harry C. Jones on                the
by Arrhenius+ as probably due to the formation of double
molecules of sulphate in the more concentrated solutions, and
these are partly broken down with increase in dilution.
   The dissociation of the acids and alkalies as calculated from
the lowering of the freezing-point is in general slightly lower
than from the conductivity. This would be expected, since the
highest conductivity in Kohlrausch's results is probably not
that representing complete dissociation.    The conductivity
value decreases from 0.001 or 0.002     equivalent normal to
the greatest dilutions employed f.  Doubtless the same cause
which produces this real decrease also diminishes the highest
value to some extent. A decrease in the true value of Ax,
would increase the dissociation calculated from
                                                                  #.
    It is to be regretted that the freezing-point method could
not be extended beyond that dilution where the conductivity
value began to decrease.         But on account of the very small
lowering produced by such dilute solutions, it is even at present
impossible.     The cause of this decrease in conductivity for the
very dilute solutions has been thought to be the carbon dioxide
and ammonia in the water.            These form compounds with
the alkalies and acids    respectively, and the molecules of these
compounds dissociate into ions with smaller “velocity” than
the ions of the original compounds, decreasing the conduc
tivity. The amount of such impurities required to neutralize
a considerable per cent. of the acid or base in such dilute
solutions would be extremely small. Whether such impurities
are the real cause is not positively established by the work
of Kohlrausch, as will appear from his own statements f.

                 Dissociation of Compounds          in Water.           485
 his method of curve-drawing to my results from sodium
  chloride, which differ from his to the extent of more than
  50 per cent., and with it claims to have found the same
  “breaks '' as in his own results. He has thus shown the true
  value of his method, which seems to be largely independent
  of the experimental data.
     I  have since * shown that his curve contains the following
 fundamental errors:–
       I. At least some of the points in his curve are wrong.
     II. The choice of points through which he has drawn the
 curve is purely arbitrary.
                           Organic Compounds.
     Many of the organic compounds are known to undergo
 little or no electrolytic dissociation. These would be expected
 to give molecular lowerings of the freezing-point not widely
 different from the constant for the solvent, at least in fairly
dilute solutions.      The chief object in mind at first in studying
some of the organic substances was to determine experimen
tally and with some care the constant for water.                    he work
was      begun   with  cane-sugar,    and it was found that the most
dilute solutions gave a molecular lowering much greater than
the constant calculated for water, and that this high molecular
lowering decreased fairly regularly with increase in concen
tration.      It was thought at first that this was probably due
to some inorganic impurity in the sugar, but that this was not
the cause was shown when the same results were obtained
from sugar as pure as it could be prepared.                    It was then
thought that such results might be peculiar to sugar and bodies
of similar chemical constitution.            It was possible that the
cane-sugar molecules conducted themselves in the very dilute
solutions as if inverted into two molecules.                  Dextrose was
then investigated, the molecules of which could not apparently
conduct themselves in this way. When results of the same
general character were obtained from the dilute solutions of
dextrose, it was decided to study a number of organic com
pounds whose chemical composition and constitution were as
widely different from each other as possible. One could then
see whether this property were more or less general among
the organic compounds, or limited to certain classes of them.
In addition to cane-sugar and dextrose, urea, phenol, ethyl
and propyl alcohols have been studied in reference to this
point.     Acetic and succinic acids have also been investigated,
but the organic acids are known to undergo electrolytic dis
sociation.

   Cane-Sugar.—Since these more or less unexpected results
were obtained first with came-sugar, great care was taken to
secure a specimen as pure as possible. Two samples were
obtained, one from the sugar refinery in Berlin, and the other
through the kindness of           r. Lippmann from the refinery in
Halle. Both were tested with ehling's solution and found

488                 Dr. Harry C. Jones             on the
to be completely free from dextrose.        The specimen from
Berlin was purified by alcohol, and was in the form of a
powder. That from Halle consisted of small crystals. The
latter sample was on the whole to be preferred, and although
measurement of solutions prepared from each were made, only
those results obtained from the Halle sugar have been given
here.
    From the table of results it will be seen that the molecular
lowering at 0:003 n is about 2:36.      This decreases with                    in
crease in concentration to about 0.1 m, and then increases
again as the solution becomes more and more concentrated.
    This increase in the molecular lowering with increase in
 concentration for the more concentrated solutions of cane
 sugar was found by Arrhenius *. His method was, however,
 not sufficiently accurate to enable him to employ solutions
 dilute enough to detect the corresponding increase in this
 region.
    Raoult f, using an improved method, has found that the
 molecular lowering of cane-sugar increases with increase in
 dilution from about 0.1 m, and also increases with the concen
 tration in the more concentrated solutions.      He did not use
 solutions more dilute than 0.02 n. These determinations of
 Raoult are probably the most accurate hitherto made for
cane-sugar solutions.
  I   am entirely unable to understand the results of Loomist,
 who has found the smallest molecular lowering for the most
 dilute solutions employed (0.01 m), and that this increased
 throughout with the concentration.     He has also found similar
 results with other organic compounds.
    Since the results with cane-sugar were of an unsuspected
 character, it was determined to test the last apparent possi
 bility of experimental error being their cause. It was barely
 possible that some considerable change in the bulb of the large
 thermometer had taken place and escaped notice. To test
 this it was decided to remeasure a series of solutions of sodium
chloride.   The results of these measurements agreed with the
results obtained several months before, in every case to within
a few ten-thousandths of a degree.
   The facts with cane-sugar are then : 1st, the molecular
lowering increases from a certain concentration (about 0.1 m)
with increase in dilution, and also increases from this same
concentration with increase in concentration.
   A possible explanation of the latter fact has been furnished

has shown the relation between osmotic pressure and lowering
of the freezing-point.  In the formula for osmotic pressure,

absolute  temperature,   B a new  constant,  a measure of the
difference between the attractions of the solvent—dissolved
body and the dissolved body-dissolved body, K= concen
tration.   When the concentration K is small, BK* vanishes
with respect to AK, and we have the law for ideal gases.
But as K increases, the osmotic pressure would increase or
decrease relatively, depending on whether B is positive or
negative.    But with water as a solvent, B is generally posi
tive. Thus as solutions which satisfy the above condition
increase in concentration, the osmotic pressure would increase
                                                                Ilater in the same

osmotic pressure and lowering of the freezing-point.     Since
the lowering   of the  freezing-point is proportional   to the

                       K
increase, and this agrees with the facts of experiment.
  On the other hand, Bredig              f        has pointed out that when
                                                                                              s1

  Natanson   f     has also discussed              results from freezing-point,
boiling-point, and osmotic-pressure determinations.

490                Dr. Harry C. Jones on the
very    closely with that of cane-sugar for the most dilute
solutions.     The minimum value here also is very nearly
reached at 0.1 m, but for dextrose is slightly lower than for
cane-sugar. As the concentration increases from about 0.1 n
the molecular lowering of dextrose increases, but the change
is much less rapid than for cane-sugar. In general tae same
qualitative changes in the molecular lowering with changes
in the concentration of the solution are observed with dex
trose as with cane-sugar, and for the more dilute solutions
the results from the two compounds agree very well with each
other.
    Urea.—Urea     shows   the same variations in molecular
lowering with concentration as the other compounds for the
more dilute solutions.     This value is somewhat less for urea
for the same concentrations. The molecular lowering of this
compound becomes constant at about 0.1 m, and remains un
changed as the concentration is increased, at least as far as
my experiments were carried. There exists, then, this marked
difference between the more concentrated solutions of urea
and of the two carbohydrates which have been considered.
    Since the molecular lowering of urea reaches a constant,
this can be taken as the constant for water. This value deter
mined experimentally can then be compared with that calcu
lated by van’t Hoff.
    Phenol.—Here also the same general results are obtained
from the more dilute solutions, but the molecular lowering
does not reach a minimum for the most concentrated solutions
used.    This decreases below the calculated constant for water,
being only about 1714 at 0-619 n. That phenol may possibly
undergo a very slight electrolytic dissociation has been shown
by Bader *.
    Ethyl and Propyl Alcohol.—Results of the same general
character as above considered were found for the more dilute
solutions of both alcohols. The molecular lowering of ethyl
alcohol for the same concentrations is considerably greater
than that of propyl, and agrees fairly well with that of dextrose
 and cane-sugar. The molecular lowering of both alcohols be
comes practically constant at a concentration slightly greater
than 0.1m.
    All the organic compounds thus far examined show, then,
 this increase in the molecular lowering with increase in
 dilution.   Since compounds have been selected which differ
 chemically so widely from one another, this can scarcely
 depend on chemical composition or constitution, but seems
 to be more or less general. Investigations have not as yet

point.      The molecular                 for the different compounds
agree fairly well with each other in many cases for the more
dilute solutions, and in general reach a minimum or become
constant at about 0.1m.          The two carbohydrates, dextrose
and cane-sugar, are the only two compounds thus far studied
which show an increase in the mol. lowering with increase

slight that it is doubtless without important significance.
   Succinic Acid.—This acid, like the other dibasic organic
acids, dissociates into two ions, and the amount of dissociation
is considerably greater than that of acetic acid. The results
with succinic acid do not run as smoothly as could be desired,
and without knowing the cause for this I am inclined to
regard them as less exact than the other results.
      Comparison with the Conductivity Results of Ostwald.
   Ostwald has determined the conductivity of a large number
of organic acids, as is well known, and among them are
acetic and succinic acid”. The dissociation of these acids,
as calculated from his conductivity results and from mine on
the lowering of the freezing-point, are given below:—

   Very recently Mr. C. Dietericit has suggested some points
which he thinks would slightly affect the accuracy of m
results as obtained from this improved freezing-point method.
The very sensitive thermometer, he thinks, would detect the
changes in the freezing-point of the solution produced by the
changes in the barometric pressure. A change of an entire
atmosphere would alter the freezing-point only about 0.0075°.
The maximum time between the determination of the freezing
point of the water and of the last solution in which that
 water was used was six hours, since a new litre of water
 was employed and                its
                             freezing-point

It  then passed loosely through cork G, on which c rested, and
was never raised or lowered to the extent of 5 millim. The
freezing-point of the water was thus determined at a certain
depth, and that of the solution at the same depth. The
lowering was the difference between these two determinations
made under the same hydrostatic pressure.                The difference
between the    specific gravity   of the water and that of the very
dilute solutions employed producing slight differences in
pressures, is almost too small to consider.              The difference
e.g. for a 0:2 normal solution of cane-sugar at 20 centim.
beneath the surface would be about $ millim. Hg, and this
would alter the freezing-point 0-000005°.
   The third point, as to whether the thermometer had reached
the same temperature as the solution, can only be decided by
the results.    Several solutions were determined several times
each to test this point.     In some of these determinations twice
as much time was allowed as in others, and the maximum
difference between the readings was only a few ten-thousandths
of a degree.      While   I could not wait an unlimited time to
make the readings, because the solution became more con
centrated as more and more ice separated, yet Mr. Dieterici
must remember that in the apparatus which was employed the
litre of solution cooled very slowly, and the time at my dis
posal to make the readings seems to have been quite sufficient,
as shown by the results.
    Thus the three points suggested by Mr. Dieterici, as
probably introducing slight errors into my results, are almost
entirely of a theoretical character, as shown by the calculation
of the exact amount of error introduced by each.               From his
final statements the author himself does not seem to attach
any great significance to them.
    I suggested the error 0.0002°* simply as the half of the
maximum difference between the results in a series of deter
minations of the same solution.          Of course any error either
of  weight   or measurement in the      preparation     of the solutions,
or   any traces of   impurity    in the   compounds,      which always
exist to some slight degree, would not be included in this maxi
mum error in the determination of the freezing-point.

    To briefly summarize      —
    The dissociation of the electrolytes investigated, as calcu
lated from the lowering of the freezing-point,                agrees in
general with that calculated from the conductivity.                  The

 this has been       fairly  satisfactorily   explained.     The slight
 difference for the carbonates can be accounted for by hydro
 lysis. . . The freezing-point method, as here improved, is
 probably as accurate a measure of dissociation as the con
ductivity method for                       all

                         has been applied.        The lowering

great.

    The organic compounds which               not undergo electrolytic
dissociation have         givenall more       less unexpected results.
The molecular      lowering   for the most dilute solutions        much                      is
greater than the constant for water. As the concentration
is   increased the molecular lowering decreases                   mini                to     a
mum, and then either remains constant or,                  with the two      as
carbohydrates, increases.         The minimum for phenol was,
apparently, not reached. The dissociation                  acetic acid,      of
as    calculated from the       freezing-point,     agrees  moderately
well with that from        conductivity,    but for succinic acid the
freezing-point     results are considerably higher.           The con
stant for     water,  which      have found from urea and ethyl
                                      I
and    propyl  alcohols,  agrees   very closely with that calculated
by  van't Hoff.

of the fringes.
   A telescope T was used to observe the displacement of the
fringes due to the forward or the backward motion of the
mirror m'. A motion of one wave-length produces a dis
placement of two fringes; so by observing in the telescope the
number of fringes-displacement relative to the cross wires, it
is an easy matter, knowing the wave-length of sodium light,
to compute the actual expansion or contraction of the bar.

500                Mr. S.        J.    Lochner on the Elongation
     I made  some experiments with my instrument to ascertain
 whether   any  uncertainties entered into my observations from
 this cause. I found that when the centre of the bar fell even two
 or three centimetres from the centre of the coil, the measure
 ments were the same as when it was centred as nearly as
 possible. When, however, the bar was thrown completely off
 from the centre, as much, for instance, as 10 or 15 centimetres,
I   found a slight but measurable effect amounting to about 0:2
 of a fringe, or 000002 of an inch.
     Early in the experiment                   I
                                found that for a given magnetic
 field I could produce different amounts of expansion depending
 upon the manner in which the current had been applied—for
 instance, whether the full amount of the current had been
º
 turned on suddenly or, on the other hand, had been applied
 gradually, then again whether the current had been gradually
increased from zero or had been decreased from a higher
    int.
         me here mention that it was observed that the second
and following contacts did not give the same expansion as the
first contact; this has already been well shown by Prof. A.
M. Mayer's observations.
    In the following table the values dealing with the second
and following contacts show some of these peculiarities quite
conclusively.    Column I. gives the amount of expansion in
fringes, column II. the corresponding current when it was
suddenly turned on at                      its
                               full strength, column         when              III.
     dually increased, and column IV. when gradually de
creased from the current which produced the maximum ex

   Here must be noted a peculiarity which was observed in
every bar that      I
                  experimented with.
     Ifthe current be gradually increased from zero up, at a
certain point we reach a maximum amount of expansion: now
a further increase in current will produce a decrease from
that maximum ; but                 if,    on
                                the other hand, we gradually
decrease the   current, we are able       obtain    still greater
                                                            to         a

      In order to determine the effect of the thickness of his bar
   upon the amount of expansion, Mr. Bidwell selects for the
   purpose three rods of 100 millim. length and 2-65, 3-65, and
.  6.25 millim. in diameter.           He assumes that the iron in the
  three bars may be regarded as similar, and that the differences
  in the expansion are due only to their diameters. He finds
  that the expansion “varies inversely as the square root of the
  diameter’’ (the length remaining the same). I regret to say
  that my results do not in any way confirm his conclusions.
  Instead of finding that larger bars give less expansion than

                    thought that              best way to make this test
  would be to take        my   largest    bar and turn it down to suc
  cessively smaller diameters. In fact,               I did this with bar I.
  The resultant bar, which            I  have called No. VI., showed a
  falling off of the expansion from 10:3 fringes to 7.2 fringes.
  I  found it a very difficult matter to turn so long a bar per

  the same time was not certain about the effect of the strains
  due to the turning.        Further, there was no certainty that the
  inside of my bar would behave in the same manner as the
  outside.
      Taking into consideration these factors,             I determined that
  the most feasible method of avoiding the difficulties would be

    The object of the present paper is to show that the whole
of the discrepancy between theory and experiment disappears
if in the theory account is taken of molecular force. Accord
ing to the usual presentation of the kinetic theory, the
molecules are supposed to be spheres colliding with coefficient
of restitution unity, molecular force is neglected because at
the average distance apart of the molecules in a gas it is very
small.     Now molecular attraction has been proved to exist,
and, though negligible at the average distance apart of mole
cules in a gas, it is not negligible when two molecules are
passing quite close to one another, it can cause two molecules
to collide which in                  its
                            absence might have passed one another
without   collision;   and the lower the velocities           the mole                     of
cules, the more effective does molecular force become
bringing about collisions which would                                         be                                    its in

absence    : thus molecular force cannot            neglected      inves be                       in
tigating the relation between viscosity and molecular velocity
or  temperature.

510              Mr. W. Sutherland             on the Viscosity
that in the case of molecules which do collide amongst them
selves a portion of the viscosity will be due to molecular
attraction on account of mutual deflection of paths experienced
by those pairs of molecules which pass close to one another
without actual collision.
   It is thus apparent that a full mathematical theory of the
viscosity of a medium composed of colliding molecules which
attract one another would be a complicated affair, but to
anyone familiar with the available knowledge of the size
of molecules and the strength of molecular attraction, the fol
lowing considerations lend themselves to simplify the problem
of the viscosity of actual gases:–First, that where the average
                                                     .
relative velocity is so low and the molecular force is so strong
that it happens in a large number of cases that a pair of
molecules describe closed paths relative to their centre of
mass, then there must be a still larger number of cases of
pairs of molecules which deflect             other's path through
a  large  angle.  In other  words,  deflection of paths, on account
of molecular attraction and irrespective of collisions, may
become an appreciable factor in viscosity in the case of
vapours below their critical temperatures.           Second, that
where a closed path is of rare occurrence, that              the case   is,   in
of   gases above the critical temperature and                   great     at       no
pressure, the effect           of

is   negligible     comparison with that due

                        in the proportion 1+2m<U+017F>(1/2a)/V* : 1.
   Hence, in the theory of viscosity as worked out for force
less molecules, we need only increase the square of the
molecular sphere-diameter in this proportion to take account
of molecular force. As the expression diminishes with                                              in
creasing W*, that is with increasing temperature, we see at
once why the apparent result of increasing temperature was
to make the molecules shrink: increase of temperature does
not make the real molecules shrink (at least to the extent
imagined), but produces shrinkage of the imaginary enlarged
forceless spheres which could exhibit the same viscosity as
the real molecules.
   So far we have considered only a typical case of two
molecules: to obtain the effect of molecular force in the
average case we should have to calculate, in accordance with
Maxwell's law of the distribution of velocities amongst the
molecules, the number of pairs that have relative velocities
between W and W+d V and sum for            values          This pro

so that from each of Holman's values of                           m/mo    we can        calculate
a value of C, which is now given.
  Temp. C. .........             140      439      67.82     88-89            99.2°         124-42

   There appears to be a tendency for the values of C to
increase with the temperature-interval;      but it is of no
importance, because the smaller temperature-intervals are too
small to give a reliable measure of C. Giving each of the
values of C a weight in proportion to the temperature
interval from which it is derived, we get the mean value of C
as 113.   With this value of C in the theoretical equation, the
following values of m/mo have been calculated for comparison
with Holman's experimental results:—
  Temp. C.          .........    149      432      67.82     88-89            99-29         124-49

The agreement is within the limits of experimental error.
  Barus's results for air are now given with the values of                                           C
derived from them :—

   The range in the values of C is about the same as in
Holman's experiments, but the mean value is less, namely
100, but in this mean the values at certain temperatures get
undue weight ; and seeing that the measurement of tempera
ture is the most difficult part of the experiment, it would be
fairer to take for instance the mean of 84 and 101 at 56.5°
and 569° as 92 at 56.7°, and in this way to get the values 118,
92, 83, 96, 118, and 107, of which the mean is 102.      But to
compare theory with experiment we will retain the value
113 already found from Holman’s results.

proved to hold over the great range of temperature up to
1216°C. Barus found that his results for air could be well
represented by the empirical form m/no-(T/273)', and, further,
that the results for hydrogen could be equally well represented
by the same form :                     for hydrogen the value of C in our
theoretical       equation       would from his experiments have the
same value as for             air,  namely 113; and the theoretical law
applies to hydrogen as well as to air up to high temperatures.
     olman’s experiments on carbonic dioxide furnish a still
better test of the theory.              Here are his values of m/mo at the
given temperatures with the values of C calculated therefrom:—

   Giving each value of C a weight proportional to the tempera
ture-interval from which it is found, we get the mean value
C=277, with which the calculated values of m/mo in the last
table were obtained.                The agreement between the experi
mental and calculated numbers is again within the limits of
experimental error.
    he law of the connexion of viscosity and temperature
being thus established, we can now examine some important
consequences of the theoretical formula (2),
                             -         •064c: mº Tº
                                 ex(rº)              C
   The value of C, that is of mº<U+017F>(1/2a)/c, is proportional to
the potential energy m”f (1/2a) of two molecules in contact,
and it is therefore desirable to obtain values of C for as many
substances         as possible;        and as C is a function of 2a it
will be       advantageous          to use the values of C to calculate
relative values of 2a for different substances by means of tho
above formula, so that we may be in possession of relative
values of the diameters of molecules and of the mutual
potential energy of two molecules whose centres are at the
distance apart of a diameter. The equation of the kinetic
theory of forceless                             ocmé'T/(2a)”, was applied by

Naumann and L. Meyer (Lieb. Ann. Suppl. Bd. v. p. 253, and
Phil. Mag. 1867, xxxiv. p. 551) to the calculation of the
relative sizes of molecules, and with considerable success;
but when the same method was applied to vapours of liquids,
certain discrepancies arose which have caused this method of
inquiry as to molecular size to come to a standstill. We can
now see that the reason for these discrepancies lies in the fact
that the form of relation for the viscosity of vapours is different
from that for gases, and also in the fact that with gases also
inaccuracies are introduced by ignoring molecular force in the
factor 1+CT by which it expresses itself.

   The value       the ratioof    larger for the elements than is
for the   compounds;     but considering  that MB ranges from
8-6     42°8,tothe ratio approaches   near enough       constancy                                       to
    show that the theory       right         essentials, while                       its

considered.
   But fortunately we can test our theory in a more complete
manner in another direction, namely, in that of the values
of C which are proportional to the potential energy of two
                J.
molecules in contact. Now, if the law of molecular force is that
discussed by me in various papers, namely, that of the inverse
fourth power, or, if the force between two molecules of mass
m at distance r apart is 3Amºr", where A is a constant
characteristic of each substance,      then mº<U+017F>(1/r) becomes
Amºr", and C or m”f (1/2a)/e becomes Am”/(2a)*e, so that
(2a)* C is proportional to Am”.
   In the               equations alluded to (Phil. Mag. March
1893) there is a term representing the virial of the attrac
tions of the molecules, which by definition is 4.4×3Am°/r",
where the summations are extended to all the molecules in
unit mass, and this is shown to be proportional to 3ATp where
p is the density; when this is written in the form                                                   lp,

compounds NH3 and SO2, but not for                                         CH, because            I        have

so that with values of 8 and M*l we can calculate the visco
sities of substances as gases. Values of M*l are tabulated
(Phil. Mag. March 1893), and the method cf calculating
them from chemical composition is also given, and values of
B, the limiting volume of a gramme of the above substances,
are calculable from existing data by means of the characteristic
equation for liquids given in the same paper, or by a much
simplified unpublished eqnation which gives the same values
to the degree of accuracy required for the present purpose.

cent. of that due to collisions; with rising temperature and
diminishing pressure, that is with nearer approach to the
gaseous state, this difference ought to diminish towards 0 as
a limit; in the case of the esters the reverse of this appears
to hold, but the experiments are perhaps at fault.         For the
complete elucidation of this part of the subject further ex
periments are required, in which the various values of the
viscosity of a substance are followed from the one limit when
it is a gas to other limits when it is a saturated vapour. The
theoretical investigation of this part of the subject would not
be difficult, though it might be tedious, and not very interesting
unless hand in hand with experiment.

depend on the molecular free path or number of collisions

investigation of the properties of mixed gases (viscosity, con
ductivity, and characteristic equation), where the attraction
of unlike molecules would be an essential element in the
question. The experimental investigation of the properties
of mixed gases could also be extended with advantage.
   With regard to conduction, the kinetic theory of forceless,
smooth, spherical molecules leads to the result that in a first
approximation the thermal conductivity k=-826mmvº/mTo,
where mº/2 is the mean kinetic energy of a molecule of
mass m at temperature To.               But if in order to come nearer to
what must be the conditions of conduction in natural gases,
we assume that the natural molecules transmit the whole of
their molecular kinetic energy in the same proportion as
they would transmit their translatory kinetic energy if they
were smooth spheres, then k="826me, where c is the specific
heat of the gas at constant pressure. According to this
formula the effect of molecular force on conductivity is found
by putting for m the value obtained when molecular force is
allowed for. The temperature-variation of the conductivity
of only three gases has been thoroughly investigated, namely
of air, hydrogen, and CO2. The temperature-variation of c for
 air and hydrogen is so small that within ordinary temperature
ranges it can be neglected, but for CO, choo/co according to
                                 º
E. Wiedemann is 1:11, and according to Regnault 1:147.
For these three gases the theoretical ratio of the conductivities
at 100° C. and 0°C. is calculable according to the relation
using for each the                             value of C already found,
namely 113 for air, 79 for hydrogen, and 277 for CO2, with

    It will   be noticed that the theoretical numbers           agree best
with Winkelmann's determinations of 1876 and with Schleier
macher's ; but Winkelmann, returning with great devotion
to these difficult measurements, obtains persistently smaller

520                 Mr. W. Sutherland                   on the Viscosity
results, and if the experimental difficulties were not so great,
we should be led to the conclusion that the theory is inadequate;
but the variation of the individual numbers from which these
means are derived is so great that we cannot yet accept so
definite a conclusion.
   Schleiermacher's results are obtained by a special and
apparently very appropriate method, namely that of measuring
the heat conducted through a gaseous envelope from a wire
heated by an electric current, and yet his values of kio<U+017F>ko
range from 1256 to 1:318 for air, from 1:200 to 1-315 for
hydrogen, and from 1485 to 1:584 for CO2, and the separate
measurements of other experimenters vary in the same
manner. Under the circumstances of the case all that we can
say is that when molecular force is taken account of in the
theory of the conductivity of gases, the theoretical variation of
conductivity with temperature is brought within the range of
present experimental determinations in a manner which is not
possible when molecular force is ignored.              The direction in
which further experimental work is desirable is that of testin
for other compound gases where c is largely variable wit
temperature, whether k < cT/(1+CT).
   The whole theory of the conduction of heat in gases awaits
development; it has been touched on here in only one aspect,
namely that of           its
                        dependence                 on

xxxv.) and introduce the necessary modifications for attracting
molecules.
 The starting-point is Clausius's equation of the                            Virial,
                               §pv=X}mv°– #.               XXRr,
where R is the force acting between two molecules at distance
r apart. Now the forces R consist of two sets, first the con
tinuously acting attractions to be denoted by R., and second,
the discontinuous repulsions that act during the collision of
two molecules to be denoted by R, thus
                                 XXRr=XXRar—XXR,r.
Of the actual values of Rº we know nothing, but if    v is the
number of encounters of a molecule in a second and p is the
average momentum communicated to a molecule in an en
counter, then we can treat the virial of the unknown impulsive
forces as equivalent to that of an average continuous force of
repulsion uv acting at points 2a apart (the distance of two
centres at collision), so that XXR,r becomes X2apºv. The
value of u for forceless spheres is m(rº/3)'.
   When molecular attraction acts, the molecules at the instant
of collision have on the average a relative velocity greater
than that which rules amongst molecules that are remote from
one another's influence; calling it V., then
            #m.V.”=}mV* + m3/(1/2a)— mº<U+017F>(1/D),
where D is the distance apart of molecules remote from one
another's influence, so that mº<U+017F>(1/D) can be neglected, and
then
          V.- (Wº 4-2m<U+017F> (1/2a)}=W{1+2mf(1/2a)                                V3}}.
Thus, then, for attracting molecules the value of u is got by
supposing the velocities of forceless molecules in         the              ºfin

    We have now to take up the evaluation of                                       v   for attracting
molecules.          In the first place, if we neglect molecular diameter
compared   to free path and also neglect curvature of path and
acceleration of velocity due to molecular force, then the
number of encounters per second of each of N molecules
in volume B is obtained, according to our principle, from
that given for forceless molecules by increasing (2a)* to
(2a)*(1+mf(1/2a)/*).      But it may not appear legitimate to
neglect curvature of path and acceleration of velocity due to
molecular force, even although they tend to neutralize one
another, so we will prove them to be practically negligible in
determining the average time taken by a molecule starting
with relative velocity V from distance D to reach distance
2a from the centre of attraction.       Neglecting mº<U+017F>(1/D),

as smooth spheres, but there are others which cannot be so
explained, the best known of the latter being the specific heat.
It is well to see how far a simplifying hypothesis such as that
of smooth spherical molecules can lead us; but it is also well
to recognize when the hypothesis has got to the end of                                                   its

    aluminium needle of the usual shape suspended by a quartz
    fibre. One quadrant is connected to each wire.       The needle
    not  being   charged, throws are  always in the same direction,
    and are    directly proportional   to the time-integral of the
    energy, or to the intensity of the radiation.      First throws,
    not steady deflexions, are read.
       Various glass jars were used for holding the electrolyte.
    The wires were run vertically through holes in the bottom of

   The first trials of the apparatus were made with dilute
solutions of copper sulphate, some five or six centimetres of
solution being the greatest depth used, as the dish was only a
shallow one.    One of the first curves obtained is given in
º
fig. 2, and may serve as a type of two or three similar ones.
The curve is by no means logarithmic, and if the conductivity
of the solution be calculated from a pair of points on it arbi
        chosen near the beginning and end it comes out very
high.
  It appeared           possible that this    irregularity might be due to
the existence of interference-effects analogous to Newton's
rings or the phenomena of thin plates by transmitted light,
especially in view of a somewhat similar effect observed just
previously by Mr. Barton in the same laboratory”; but                         I
felt doubtful at first whether it might not be ascribed to some
other disturbance—to the fact that a part of the radiation
passes round outside the jar instead of through the electrolyte,
or to mutual induction between the two halves of the long
wire circuit in the garden.       The second disturbance proved,
however, to be nonexistent, and the first quite inadequate to
explain such a distortion of the curve.
   To see if the effect were really due to interference phe
momena, it was necessary to determine a transmission-curve
for a great length of liquid, and consequently to avoid ab
sorption as far as possible.        Distilled water presented itself
naturally as the best liquid for the purpose.
    A tall glass cylinder, about 114 centim. high and 12 centim.
                        d;
internal diameter, was used as the containing vessel, the wires
being strained straight down the middle of

                              the bottom.

    The complete results for distilled water are given in
curve 1, fig. 3. It is seen that, at least for such a poor con
ductor as distilled water, any slight absorption is completely
masked by the interference.         As I   mentioned in the intro
duction, the intensity of the transmitted ray does not uniformly
decrease, but the transmission follows the same general law
as for light with a thin plate: we are in fact dealing with a
“thin plate ’’.—a plate whose thickness is comparable with
the wave-length of the radiation used.         A minimum is trans
mitted    by  a plate a  quarter   wave-length   thick, a maximum
by a plate a half wave-length      thick, and so on. The fact that
the maxima in our curve (1. fig. 3) get successively lower is
only in part due to the absorption : it is chiefly owing to the
fact that we are here dealing, not with a steady wave-train
like light, but with a rapidly damped wave-train.              If the
head .# such a wave-train be only interfered with by the tail,
it is not much affected : complete interference is quite im
possible.
    It was desirable to know how far the phenomenon would
still be noticeable with electrolytes of higher conductivity.
To test this question, a few drops of a strong solution of zinc
sulphate were added to the jarful (some 14 litres) of distilled
water, and the relative intensities of the transmitted radiation
determined as before. The results are given in curve 2,
 fig. 3. Curve 3 of the same figure was determined with a
 slightly stronger solution.      In both curves the first maximum
is very well marked. Both solutions were, however, very
 dilute : their specific gravities with reference to water at the
 same temperature were approximately 1.00028 and 1.00038,
 and their specific resistances 5100 and 4030 ohms x cm.
 respectively, as measured with the Kohlrausch bridge and
 telephone. To give an idea of the corresponding opacities                I
 may add that radiation traversing the first solution would be
 reduced to 0:41 of       its
                            initial intensity   in
                                                 a  metre,  or
                                                            to    0-32
of   its initial intensity      traversing
                                in          a  metre   of the second
 solution.                                                            -
    With view
           a        tomaking    certainof  the nature of the  periodic
 effect, experiments were also carried out with liquids              of   a
 different specific inductive capacity.        Curve  1, fig.   4, was
 determined with         95per cent.  alcohol,  and curve   2  with       a
 mixture of three volumes of the same alcohol with one volume
of   water.    In both cases the maxima are very well marked.

540             Mr. G. U. Yule on       the Passage          of Electric
   The figures given by Stschegtiaeff agree so nicely with
Maxwell's law that one regrets being compelled to treat them
as negligible ; and the low value found for alcohol by Bouty is
also in a minority and requires explanation.          It should be
noted that it was not determined directly, but deduced from
the constants found for mixtures of small proportions of
alcohol with other liquids.
   My figures agree roughly with the high values given in
the table, but are somewhat low.      This is very likely to be
ascribed to the fact that a certain  portion  of the wave always
flows  through  the dielectric outside the   jar instead of going
through the liquid. This portion interferes with the first
in such a way as to shift the maximum of the curve forwards;
i.e. the whole arrangement behaves as if the wave had flowed
through a layer of air and water mixed instead of through
pure water.
   The indefinite error arising from this cause might have
been avoided in one way, namely, by making a certain length
A B (fig. 5) of the one wire into a tube sur
rounding the other, and using this tube A B C D            Fig. 5.
also for holding the liquids. The whole of the
induction must then lie between the inside wire
and the tube, and, consequently, the whole of
the radiation must pass through the liquid.
   This was in fact the arrangement that                             I
originally wished to use. It possesses, however,
several serious disadvantages which finally led
to     rejection

shows at all events that the constants of these substances

  It   was myoriginal intention to calculate from the curves,
not the dielectric constants, but the conductivities of the
liquids. At first sight one might claim that this should be
possible, but practically the matter is too complex to serve
the purpose. On the assumption that the conductivity be
very small, so that one may neglect the phase alteration on
reflexion and the increase in the reflected fraction, the equa
tion to the curve may be calculated by a procedure recently
described by Mr. Barton".                             I

centre line, on which the humps formed by the second,

    Among the numerous books on practical organic chemistry now
at the disposal of laboratory workers there is none which occupies
exactly the same position as the work under consideration.    It is
 literally a “handbook” in the best sense. The various processes
described under their respective headings are introduced by a list
 of the leagents employed, and then the more important special
methods of applying the reagents are described in some detail.                                It
 will thus be seen that the book supplies the working chemist with
much about the same kind of information that a book on workshop
recipes supplies to the mechanic. As such it will be found most
serviceable, and we have no hesitation in recommending  adoption                  its
 by chemists       in
                this country.

     ever extended to Bathurst.                 There is nothing to show what happened
    in this region during Mesozoic and early Tertiary times.                        The
     Hawkesbury Sandstone (probably Triassic) may have approached
     nearer to Bathurst than it does now. In late Tertiary times stream
     deposits were formed on the granitic rocks, and afterwards covered
     with thick basaltic lava-flows, which have since undergone much
    denudation.
