I.   On the Elastic Force          of Steam at different                    Temperatures.

THE    principal
  1st, What is
                       questions relating to steam are these two:
                       the relation between the elastic force and
 the temperature? .2dly, How much heat is required to pro
 duce steam of a given elasticity or temperature?              propose               I
 at present  to treat of the first of these  questions  only;  and my
 intention is not confined    merely   to seek a numerical    formula,
 but, if possible, to investigate some property or law, that may
instruct us, generally at least, in regard to what takes place
beyond the present range of our experiments.
    The best experiments on the expansive force of steam are
those of Dalton, comprehending                       all
                                          temperatures between the
freezing and the boiling points; and those            Dr. Ure, which   of
extend from the     freezing  point     312°. We have also, more

The three Tables               we

gather in general that they decrease slowly; and hence we
may infer that the quotients, at least for a considerable range
of temperature, may be expressed with tolerable accuracy by
means of the first and second orders of differences.      But as
these differences cannot be found  directly, we must  try to de

II.   On- the  Identity of Epistilbite and Heulandite. By A. LEvy,
                               Esq. M.A. F.G.S."
     R. GUSTAVUS                 ROSE, of Berlin, in the eighth num-            .
       ber of the      Edinburgh       Journal of Science, has given the
description of a mineral species which he has considered as
new, and named Epistilbite.                He states that the most consi
derable differences between this species and Heulandite are
those in their regular forms, the physical characters and che
mical compositions of both species being nearly exactly the
same+.       When I read his paper it struck me, however, that
the forms and angles of Epistilbite might be derived by simple
and frequently occurring decrements from the primitive form
I  had adopted for Heulandite, and that the easy, nacreous, and
only cleavage of Epistilbite was parallel to the same modifi
cation of this primitive form, as is the easy, nacreous, and only
cleavage of Heulandite.              It appears to me, therefore, that if
this mode of        viewing     the  crystals  of the newly described sub
stance should be           found    correct,  there  is no sufficient ground
to consider it as forming a distinct species from Heulandite;
since the forms of these two substances, which had been thought
to constitute their principal difference, may easily be made to
agree.

                                           some remarks
 on our experiments for ascertaining the Velocity    Sound                                           of                 at
Port Bowen;        which we should have replied earlier, had
                        to
not circumstances connected, with our present engagements
interfered     the time

                           our becoming acquainted with the
remarks      question.
              in
      the first place, Mr. Galbraith seems
     In                                     regret that  such                    to                            in

                    on the Velocity            of Sound at Port             Bowen.                    13
a climate we should not have recorded more particularly the
several circumstances which are required in such experiments.
It does not appear, however, that we have neglected any cir
cumstance which he has pointed out as necessary, except the
precise velocity of the wind,-for which purpose unfortunately
we had no anemometer: nevertheless the velocity of the wind
during our experiments must, we conceive, be of little impor
tance; as in all cases, save two, the observations were made
in calm weather, or when very light airs prevailed, as stated
in the table. With respect to “the angle between the                                                  di
rection of the sound and that of the wind,” we beg to ob
serve that, as the exact bearing of the gun is given, and like
wise the direction of the wind to the nearest point, we do not
comprehend what reason Mr. Galbraith has for regrettin
that “the direction of the wind relative to that of the soun
was not ascertained.”
   The circumstance of our not having noted the state of the
hygrometer, cannot properly be considered an omission, since
 itsindications were always those                         of
                                               perfect dryness       very                   in

                     is                                                                               to
the same cause, but solely from our having inadvertently
spoken        of  increased density, where we ought

                              no
omitted that part which applies               temperature: for we did

IV.         Experiments on the Cohesion of Cast-Iron.                             By B. BEVAN,
                                                   Esq.
                 To Richard Taylor, Esq.

AN     eratum, of a single
                                                   #.
                                in the third formula in the
    last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, page 343,
may have a tendency to mislead some of your readers. It will
be noticed that the third as printed, is the same as the second,
but should have been
                                        #=              C.
   Experiments on the cohesion of cast-iron lead to very irre
gular results, depending in some degree upon the quality of
the metal; but in a greater degree upon the improper mode
of applying the force. During the present year. had some                                  I
cylinders and prisms cast of gray soft metal; I then reduced
the middle part of one of the cylinders to 425 inches diameter
º
and fixed it in my experimental press, with the resultant of
the straining force, nearly in the axis of the cylinder, the
weight required to break it was 2550 pounds; at the place of
fracture was a visible fault in the casting, so that the proper
          must be more than 17,900 pounds to the square
1I]CI).
    I then   took another cylinder and reduced              turning,        it,   by                    to
exactly       '5    or;    an
                        inch    diameter, inand submitted            the                      it   to
like process. The breaking weight was 6430 pounds, showing
a   strength          of
                  cohesion     32,700 pounds per square inch.

the transverse strength          some         of             of

   Being partly aware of the transverse strength from the for
mer experiment, the time used for applying the first part of
the load was shortened; but towards the conclusion the ad
ditions were cautious and slow, and the whole time occupied
in the experiment was 574 minutes; the breaking weight was
506 pounds, which gives 59,950 pounds per square inch, for
the cohesion, or in round numbers 60,000 pounds, and the
mean of both 60,500 pounds.            Yours truly,

    P.S.. I have  lately seen in the public papers, under the title
of Curious Weather-gauge, an account of a machine invented
by Mr. Donovan, capable of showing the commencement and
 termination of every shower, and the rate of raining, with the
 quantity fallen.
   I  beg leave to say, that                   I
                                 have several rain-gauges of such

 a nature as to exhibit      these particulars; one     which has
 been   inconstant use for fifteen   years.--Further  particulars                                I
 perhaps may give        another time.

      VI.    Further List    of Errors in PIAzzi's     of Stars.   Catalogue
 IN   vol. lxvi. p. 261, of the Philosophical Magazine, a list of
    certain errata in Piazzi's celebrated Catalogue of stars was
 given, which had either been pointed
                                        out by himself, or disco
vered by subsequent observations. We are indebted
                                                           to the
same correspondent for the communication of the following
of additional errors, which he has discovered, on a careful list
                                                            com
parison of the catalogue of Piazzi,
                                       with those of Flamsteed,
Bradley and Mayer. These errors are principally
                                                    in the names
of the stars, and do not affect the general accuracy of that                               in
valuable work.

 VII.     On the Inflammation of Gunpowder and other Substances by
       Electricity; with a Proposal to employ the Term Momentum
       as expressive of a certain Condition of the Electric Fluid. By
       Mr. W. STURGEON.
     To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Sir,
        the publication of my paper on the ignition of                                    gun
 SINCE
   powder by the electric fluid, I have had an opportunity of
 pertising Mr. Woodward's paper* on the same subject.                                     But
 I find that, like         all
                    other authors  have yet read, Mr.I                                    W.
     *This paper   oneis         of
                           those you      obligingly pointed out
                                                    so               me for          to
 perusal; and appears   page 283, vol. vii.
                            at                           of
                                               the new series    the Annals    of
 of Philosophy.  The two papers     vol. viii. contain nothing material on
                                               in
 the subject.
                                                                                          has

has left us entirely in the dark with respect to the law that is
necessary to be observed in varying the experiment.                   For al
 though the dimensions of his        jar  and tube are     given,   no men
 tion whatever is made, why it is necessary to observe those
 dimensions, or why other jars and tubes of various other                                                   di
 mensions may not answer as well.             Indeed, so little does Mr.
 W.’s   hypothesis     concur with the conclusions deduced from
my experiments, that he supposes the water derives                    retard                     its

 stated   in Mr. W.'s paper,             the tube   “If filled with aether

    “The same effect will              produced       be transmitting the        by
 charge through the animal oeconomy,                  through water not    or

   It is  evident from this statement            Mr. Woodward's, that
                                                                 of

                                would have found little difficulty                                          in

powder was ignited on both the positive and negative side of
a long conducting wire.
   Mr. Leuthwaite has likewise conducted a number of                                             in
teresting experiments on this subject; but I believe they were
intended chiefly to ascertain the conducting power of different
fluids, in order to make choice of the most eligible for the
purpose of igniting gunpowder by the electric fluid.
   Hence, so far it appears that the idea had not been enter
tained, (prior to the institution of my experiments,) that the
diameter of the tube, and the nature of the charge, would any
way affect the result of the experiment. Neither does it ap
pear that the ignition of gunpowder, by means of transmittin
the electric fluid through unconfined water, was ever attemp
prior to those experiments detailed in my former paper on
this subject.      The most extraordinary method of effecting the
ignition of gunpowder by the electric fluid, that

the   following   circumstances.
   First. Let the table           which the jar and chain are placed
                                     of on

   Secondly. Let the same arrangement again                    made, only       be

of the chain. Discharge the jar through this circuit.
   Should there occur different results in those experiments,
(as I am persuaded there will,) why did Mr. Howldy not men
tion such essential particulars? Or are we to conclude from
his silence, that he entertained just notions of the nature of
the experiment, and that this circumstance was too trivial to
notice?
  With    respect to the method in which the wooden peg is
used,   Iam aware that it will answer very well if regulated
upon the principles stated in my paper:-that           when the                               is,

the thickness of the aqueous column may be increased. When

the same jar is used with different intensities, then the lowest
intensity requires the thinnest strip of water; not because the
intensity is             but because the quantity of fluid is less:
and although a column of water that answers for a low inten
sity will answer for every intensity that is higher; neverthe
less, a column that would answer very well for a high inten
sity, might be far too large, to insure success, with an inten
sity that is very low.

    When four such jars were charged to the highest possible
 intensity, and discharged through the water tube, gold leaf
 placed in the circuit was powerfully attracted, but not defla
 grated.
   One jar with an intensity of 60°, powerfully magnetized a
 sewing needle, placed in a spiral forming part of a complete
   metallic circuit. With two jars charged to the highest possible
   intensity, no magnetic effect was produced, when the tube of
   water formed a part of the circuit.
      How do these experiments accord with the doctrine of quan
  tity and intensity?. In the galvanic process, a needle may be
  powerfully magnetized by a single pair of small copper and
  zinc plates; by which process, it is said, we have quantity,
  but not intensity.       But by the experiments I have just now
  mentioned, it appears that quantity has not the power of mag
  netizing needles, without intensity. For when the electric fluid
  was not retarded by inferior conductors, a very small quantity
  produced the effect; but when the intensity of the discharge
  was reduced, although three times the former quantity, at
  least, was employed, not the slightest magnetic effect was pro
  duced. The truth           is,
                               we want another and            more appro a

26                 Mr. Lévy        on some newly-discovered
cuit of metal; the former was completely exploded, but the
latter substance was scattered only. When the water tube
formed a part of the circuit, every other part arranged as be
fore, the gunpowder ignited, but the gold leaf was undisturbed
by the discharge of the jars.
    Similar experiments were made with gunpowderandneedles,
gunpowder and aether, gunpowder and tow, prepared as above.
 When the circuit was completely metallic, the needles were
 magnetized, or the aether, the tow, &c. were fired: but the
É.  npowder was in no instance ignited. When the water tube
          a part of the circuit, the gunpowder was, in every case,
 ignited; but the other substances remained unaffected.
    Hence we may conclude, that in order to magnetize pieces
 of steel, to explode metals, to ignite aether, or tow, with resin,
 &c. by electricity; quantity and velocity, or momentum of the
 fluid is required. But to ignite gunpowder, quantity and time

IX.     Observations on the Solar Eclipse, November 29th, 1826.
                      By   the Rev. BADEN              Powell, M.A. F.R.S.
To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of
                                               Philosophy.
     HE    curious observations of Mr. Wiseman during the
     solar eclipse of September 1820, recorded in the Memoirs
of the Astronomical Society (Part I. p. 140.) tend to show
that during the eclipse there was a deficiency of the red rays
of the sun and the heating power accompanying them. This
conclusion is considered to be corroborated by the further
observation of a diminution in the space occupied by the red
rays in the prismatic spectrum formed at the same time.        The
facts are stated to have been anticipated by Mr. Wiseman; but
the principle on which he anticipated them is not mentioned.
   As there is nothing said in the paper alluded         which can        to,
        us
lead    to   determine how far the effects may depend upon the
magnitude             of

covered by Mr. Herschel, to which the greatest heating power
belongs; and looking at the sun during the eclipse through a
good prism of flint glass, interposing before the eye three
thicknesses of the purple glass, described by that gentleman,
I  saw the ray in question perfectly distinct, and unaltered as

pure chemical inquiry: and it is only lately, and on an occa
sion which is well known, that I have again taken up the
subject of the general principles of electro-chemical action.
After a number of new experiments, which I shall have the
pleasure of laying before the Society, and notwithstanding
the various novel views which have been brought forward in
this and in other countries, and the great activity and exten
sion of science, it is peculiarly satisfactory to me to find that
I have nothing to alter in the fundamental theory laid down
in my original communication; and which, after a lapse of
twenty years, has continued, as it was in the beginning, the
guide and foundation of          all
                              my researches.
 I    am the more inclined     bring forward these new labours
                                      to
at  the present moment, though they are far from being                                        in
finished state, because the discovery                 of

there are not wanting persons who imagine the origin
electro-chemical science before the discovery          the pile           of
Volta; and Ritter and Winterl have been quoted       amongst                   *

            of

original experiments on the formation and powers of single
galvanic circles; and Winterl's some bold, though loose spe
culative views" upon the primary causes of chemical phaeno
mena; and in the obscurity of the language and metaphysics
of both these gentlemen, it is difficult to say what may not be
found. In the ingenious, though wild views, and often inex
act experiments of Ritter, there are more hints which may be
considered as applying to electro-magnetism than to electro
chemistry; and Winterl's miraculous Andronia might, with as
much propriety, be considered as a type of            the chemical                          all

     In 1804, MM. Hisinger and Berzelius stated that neutro
saline solutions were decomposed          electricity, and the acid   by
matter   separated    the positive, at

36                             Sir H. Davy on the Relations
ferred in the beginning of this Lecture.         Finding that acid
and alkaline substances, even when existing in the most solid
combinations, or in the smallest proportion in the hardest
bodies, were elicited by voltaic electricity,      established that     I
they were the results of decomposition, and not of composi
tion or generation; and referring to my experiments of 1800
and 1801 and 1802, and to a number of new facts, which
showed that inflammable substances and oxygen, alkalies and
acids, and oxidable and noble metals, were in electrical re
lations of positive and negative,                        I
                                         drew the conclusion, that
the combinations and    decompositions     by electricity were refer
rible to the law of electrical attractions and repulsions, and ad
vanced the hypothesis, “that chemical and electrical attraction
were produced by the same cause, acting in one case on parti
cles, in the other on masses,” and that the same property, under
different modifications, was the cause of all the phaenomena exhi
bited by different voltaic combinations.
    Believing that our philosophical systems are exceedingly
imperfect,         I
               never attached much importance to this hypo
thesis; but having formed it after a copious induction of
facts, and having gained immediately by the application of it
a number of practical results, and considering myself as much
the author of it as I was of the decomposition of the alkalies,
and having developed it in an elementary work, as far as the
present state of chemistry seemed to allow, I have never cri
ticized or examined the manner in which different authors
have adopted or explained         contented,  it,   the hands       if      in               of

have been adopted in electro-chemical science.
    In determining the nature of the electrical action in what
may be called the closed circle, or the combinations in which,
according to the language used on the continent, electrical
currents exist,                  I
                     have employed instruments constructed upon
the same principles as the galvanometer of Professor Cum
ming, or the multiplier of Professor Schweigger.             Silver, wire,
covered with silk, about 1-70th of an inch in diameter, was
folded round a small wooden frame, so as to fill a narrow
deep groove: the two extreme wires were parallel, and the
convolutions as nearly as possible in the same perpendicular:
a small tube containing a filament of silk was passed through
the centre of the convolutions of wires, to which a delicate
magnetised needle was suspended ; which, when the apparatus
was properly disposed, rested with                                  its
                                               north pole between the
two extremities         the wires.   ofThis instrument, which con

conducting by impalpable charcoal powder, to receive the

400 circles of silver and gold foil, of the third of an inch in

intervening; the attraction of the gold leaf or the filament,
either to the positive or negative        indicates the nature of
the   charge:  and, as in cases of electro-chemical action there
are always two corresponding opposite states, I considered
the part of the system which touched the conductor as pos
sessing the same electrical state with that exhibited by the
leaf.  I   have never however put much dependence upon                        in
dications given by this instrument, unless they were confirmed
by other results; having found them very uncertain, and                       in
fluenced by the state of the condenser and the atmosphere.

XI.   Observations on a Mineral from near Hay Tor,                    in Devon
             shire.  By CoRNELIUs TRIPE, Esq.”                                      -
               mineralogical science is so extensively cultivated,
WHIRE
  and rapidly        increasing in interest and importance, the
following brief description of a newly discovered mineral sub
stance may not be unacceptable to the readers of the Philo
sophical Magazine.
   The mineral alluded to was found in detached pieces, ac
companied by small masses of chalcedony, garnet, actynolite,
talc, and very splendent octohedral oxidulated iron. These
substances, altogether, formed a single bunch of inconsiderable
size enveloped by a ferruginous clay, in a large lode of very
       K.
pure oxidulated iron, in an iron mine adjacent to the Hay Tor
granite quarries, Devonshire.
   Mr.              a respectable mineral dealer of Devonport,
personally assisted in removing the mineral from         situation, its
and   possesses the
                   #.       part  which has been raised.
myself examined the mine since; but with the most attentive
                                                              have        I

                                                                              are

areof a brownish red, ferruginous yellow, and delicate white
colour. Every crystal has certain planes smooth and splen
dent, while the others are rough and dull, and is either semi
transparent or translucent. The substance scratches rock
crystal, and in lustre, colour, fracture, and general appearance
                                                                  -        -
closely resembles chalcedony.                    -
    Mr. Robert Cole, a gentleman resident here, who is pas
sionately devoted to the science, has been associated with us
in examining the mineral; and after giving it our best consi
deration, we have been led to conclude that it is crystallized
                      of to Its
chalcedony.          hardness, fracture, colour, and close affinity
in  appearance       that substance, warrant such opinion; whilst
the uniformity         character observable throughout the whole
series of  specimens, with the perfection and brilliancy              many             of
of   the crystals, induce          believe that the crystallization

original.    We are aware that chalcedony has not hitherto
been found regularly crystallized; but this we submit does not
present     an insuperable barrier        the opinion just expressed,

32                         Sir H. Davy on the Relations
pure chemical inquiry: and it is only lately, and on an occa
sion which is well known, that I have again taken up the
subject of the general principles of electro-chemical action.
After a number of new experiments, which           shall have the           I
pleasure of laying before the Society, and notwithstanding
the various novel views which have been brought forward in
this and in other countries, and the great activity and exten
sion of science, it is peculiarly satisfactory to me to find that
I  have nothing to alter in the fundamental theory laid down
in my original communication; and which, after a lapse of
twenty years, has continued, as it was in the beginning, the
guide and foundation of                     all
                               my researches.
I     am the more inclined      bring forward these new labours
                                             to
at  the present   moment,  though  they are far from being                                       in

                             some late ingenious inquiries, con
nect the electro-chemical changes with entirely new classes                                       of

XII.    Remarks on the Crystalline Form                   of the Haytorite.    By
                         W. PHILLIPs, F.G.S.              &c.”
       HAVE received from the writer of the foregoing commu
   nication, and from the other gentlemen who are therein
 mentioned, several crystals of the substance to which they have
  given the appropriate name of Haytorite.                      -
     It has only been found in regular crystals, which in general
  are well defined, the edges being sharp, and the planes for the
  most part brilliant.    In dimension they vary from the size of
 a  pin's head to an inch in diameter: three or four minute cry
 stals are colourless and almost perfectly transparent; but in
 general their colour passes from pale brownish yellow, (in
 which case they are translucent,) to deep brown and opaque.
     The crystals, however, have rarely been found isolated,
 being commonly grouped together in such a manner as to
 show only about one half of the crystal, but they are easily
 separable; the planes of separation are bright and frequently
 somewhat iridescent on the surface.
   I   have in vain attempted to discover a regular cleavage,
 which rarely is absent in crystallized minerals; and it is re
 markable that the surface produced by breaking a crystal in
 any direction, is almost totally devoid of lustre, having com
 pletely the aspect and fracture of chalcedony: and this takes
   lace even in the almost perfectly transparent crystals, which
É.     immediately that character, assuming the same degree of
 translucency as is commonly possessed by chalcedony, when
 viewed on the fractured surface.          Specific gravity of two
 translucent crystals taken by my friend S. L. Kent, F.G.S.
 2-5628.2°5862.        It scratches quartz.
    The characters detailed in the preceding sentence induced
the suspicion,-and which            I
                                   communicated to Messrs. Tripe
and Cole in my first letter to them on the subject, that it is
only a pseudomorphous mineral.

acute angle to the other. Some of the crystals forming one
large group in my possession, are opaque, in others trans
lucency exists; and others again seem to have suffered a par
tial decomposition, having the appearance of being carious
internally; but to what extent soever that appearance has
taken place, it is remarkable that the portion remaining of
the external plane, however small, is not deprived of            or                               its

    The vein in which this substance was found, as already
mentioned by Mr. Tripe, is of oxidulated iron; and having

 lately had an opportunity of seeing that vein, may add that
it is about 6 feet wide, runs nearly east and west, and under
lies to the north about 45°, or 6 feet in a fathom. The iron
is occasionally free from admixture, and crystallized in octo
hedrons; but, as was perceptible in the cavity made in the vein
from the surface by the miner, and which is about 30 feet
long by 12 to 15 in depth, the mass of ironstone is commonly
mixed with what appears by the help of the glass to be a
species of actynolite, of a greenish colour, and thus

of the forms of Haytorite with that of Humboldtite repre

therefore, sufficient evidence perhaps to say that the crystals
of Haytorite are pseudomorphic of Humboldtite. The repo
sitories of the two substances seem to be different: for besides
the already known localities of Humboldtite,                  the Seiser alp in
the  Tyrol,    and  Salisbury-craig     near   Edinburgh,        -I  know only
of another, which is Utoë in Sweden, where, to judge by the
specimen in Mr. Heuland's collection, it occurs in macled cry
stals, and accompanied by apophyllite, carbonate of lime, sul
                                                                               -
phate of barytes, and bitumen.
   In conclusion it may be said, that if the reasons for supposing
the crystals of Haytorite to be pseudomorphic appear conclu
sive, there is some not unreasonable ground to think they may
owe their form to Humboldtite, but have been modelled upon
crystals of that substance larger and of a different variety than
those which have been met with hitherto; or otherwise they
must be considered as pseudomorphic crystals of an unknown
species.

 extent it may be said, that the smaller the difference between the mea
surements of two crystals, if well established, the greater is the difficulty to
refer them to the same primitive form.        If therefore the difference which
Mr. Phillips and myself have found should prove to be correct, it would be
most likely an insurmountable objection to the re-union of Humboldtite
with Datholite.    There is not a much greater difference between the cry
stals of Cleavelandite and Felspar, than there would be between those of
these two substances. There is still another way to compare the crystals
of Humboldtite with those of Datholite: it is by supposing that the planes M
of the first correspond to the planes i of the second (see Phillips's figures);
for according to Mr. Phillips they measure exactly the same angles; but
then a difficulty of the same order as the one above would be raised, with
respect to the identity of the faces e” of Humboldtite and a” of Datholite.

          XV. A        List of Moon-culminating Stars for 1827*.
         Dear Sir,
I
                                                                   London, 25 Aug.   1826.
     SEND     you inclosed the list of moon-culminating stars for
     the first six months of the ensuing year 1827. The method
I  adopt is to look out for two stars to precede, and two to fol
 dow the moon's transit: one of each of these is to be as near as
 possible to the moon in right ascension; and the others at not
more than 30 or 40 minutes distance.—The former are for the
 use of those observatories that are situated near each other;
such as the principal European ones; and the others are for
observatories situated at a considerable distance from each
other, and for travellers in various parts of the world.—I have
also selected stars of greater magnitude than have generally
been adopted: for           I
                         have found by experience that the smaller
stars are apt to be mistaken; and several erroneous observa
tions have consequently been recorded.           For that purpose                         I
have taken a greater range in declination (still however limiting
that range to a difference of 2° or 3° only); for           find that          I
unless a transit instrument is very much out of level, no great
error can arise. In these latitudes an inclination of the axis,
of 10", would make a difference of only 0",01 in time, when
the star is situated 1° from the moon: and as we approach
towards the equator, these differences vanish altogether.
                                          I
   You will observe that have inserted Jupiter and Saturn,
when they are near the moon, and when their motion is retro
grade : and also Venus on the day of her occultation in Fe
bruary.            I
               have also inserted the moon's declination as well
as her  right   ascension: both of which relate to the time of her
culmination at Greenwich.          Opposite to the moon I have also
placed (in a parenthesis) the number of days, from the time of
new moon; which may be occasionally useful.
   Those stars to which an asterisk is annexed, are such as
will pass through the field of the telescope                        (in
                                                     these latitudes)

XVI.         Observations     on the late Solar Eclipse.                               By Thomas
                                       SQUIRE, Esq.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
THE   day with us was
  the late solar eclipse;
                             rather unfavourable for observing
                              I could not see the beginning, as
 the sun was obscured by clouds                      (\–
                                       and ~) at the time. But
 at about two minutes after 10 M. S. T. the sun became visible
through the passing nascent cumuli, when the obscuration
was very considerable on the north-west part of the sun's disc.
 The eclipse continued to be visible at intervals till near the
middle, when a dense cumulostratus again obscured the sun,
but towards the end the air became            and continued so
till the termination of the eclipse; and which took place
                                                                  §.
 here at 12" On 54° mean solar time. Latitude of the place
51° 41' 41"-6 north.      Longitude 27 seconds in time east of
 Greenwich.     The above time reduced to that at the Royal
 Observatory gives 12" On 27°. Probably the end here was
absolutely rather later than at Greenwich, owing to the effects
of the lunar parallax, the moon being a little more depressed
from our northern situation.
   The above observations were made with one of Dollond’s
achromatic telescopes, and power of 80.      The time was de
duced from correct altitudes of the sun, taken with an excel
lent reflecting circle made by Troughton, having at the same
time the latitude of the place and sun's declination given.
Epping, Dec. 15, 1826.
                              I
                        remain, Gentlemen, yours truly,

of tin;–it consisted of colouring matter and gallic acid. In a

remains 9:10 grains of gallic acid and colouring matter.

The large amount of loss is probably occasioned by the great
difficulty in bringing substances, which attract moisture so
rapidly as woody fibre, to the same hygrometric state.
                             On the applications                      of   Fustic.
   The colouring matter of fustic is seldom employed in the
dyeing of yellow: the only case in which it is so applied is as
a cheap substitute for weld or quercitron; but for woollen
goods intended to be dyed a true green in the indigo vat, the
           shade of yellow is first given by means of fustic.
*::::he dyeing vessel may be of iron; and for 120 yards of
woollen cloth, weighing ilb. 4oz, to the yard, 45lbs. of fustic
in chips with 6lbs. of alum will be found sufficient for ordinary
             i<U+017F><U+017F>iºn
shades of green.                 If
                          the shade required be bright, 4lbs. of
solution of        tin

                             added with advantage, but for bottle
green an                              fustic will      required: some

                                                                            a of

The large amount of loss is probably occasioned by the great
difficulty in bringing substances, which attract moisture so
rapidly as woody fibre, to the same hygrometric state.
                      On the applications     of Fustic.
    The colouring matter of fustic is seldom employed in the
dyeing of yellow: the only case in which it is so applied is as
a cheap substitute for weld or quercitron; but for woollen
goods intended to be dyed a true green in the indigo vat, the
required shade of yellow is first given by means of fustic.
    The dyeing vessel may be of iron; and for 120 yards of
woollen cloth, weighing ilb. 4oz, to the yard, 45lbs. of fustic
in chips with 6lbs. of alum will be found sufficient for ordinary
shades of green.        Ifthe shade required be bright, 4lbs. of
solution of tin    may  be added with advantage, but for bottle
green an additional proportion of fustic will be required: some
dyers use the fustic alone without any mordant, and the affinity
of woollen fibre for the colouring matter of fustic is sufficiently
powerful to fix the whole; the addition of a mordant, however,
É.ives much greater durability. After the fustic and alum have
        boiled a few minutes in a dyeing vessel containing from
300 to 400 gallons of water, 20 gallons of cold water are added
and the cloths entered, turning quickly a few minutes and
afterwards more slowly, and boiled from fifty minutes to an
hour. They are afterwards well washed, and the requisite
shade of blue given in the indigo vat.
    Fustic is employed in     all
                               the shades known     Saxon green.

 tered, and again boiled 1 hour; the colour thus obtained was
 a bright full red brown.    In the same manner a similar shade
 of red  brown,   or others  yellower,  may be dyed in the same
 dyeing liquor, adding the alum after thered part of the colour
 has become fixed. After the above a yellow brown approach
 ing to a snuff colour was dyed;—for i00lbs. of worsted goods
 added 21bs. of camwood, 10lbs. of mull madder, 9lbs. of rasped
 fustic, 31bs. of red argol, 14 measured ounces of sulphate of
indigo, and 21bs. of sulphuric acid, boiled 1 hour. Took up,
added 4lbs. of alum, Ilb. of sulphate of copper, 21bs of rasped
fustic, and 4 measured ounces of sulphate of indigo; entered
 and boiled 1 hour. A small portion of sulphate of copper                      in
 creases the brilliancy and adds much to the intensity- of the
yellow browns.
    The mode of dyeing olive and brown now described, has
 .
only been introduced to the dyeing establishments of this coun
     since the last 20 years: it is called by dyers the sour way.
#.e same colours, possessing however little brilliancy, were
        with camwood, fustic, and logwood; the mordant em
ployed was sulphate of iron.
    For 591bs. of a coarse woollen cloth called Calmuck, a full
olive brown. Dyed in an iron pan containing 400 gallons of
water; added 201bs. of rasped fustic, 8lbs. of rasped camwood,
6lbs. of chipped logwood; boiled 14 hour: took up, emptied
the dyeing vessel half-way, filled with fresh water, and added
2lbs. of sulphate of iron, entered the cloths turning quickly
10 minutes, raised gradually to ebullition, and boiled 10 mi
Inutes.
  In the same manner may be dyed                  all   the shades    of   copper,
brown, and olive.

business  by reading the list   of
                                the Fellows who had been admitted,
and those they had lost   bydeath since the last anniversary. Among
the foreign deceased members         he
                                   mentioned, with particular notice,
Scarpa, the celebrated anatomist        Pavia; and Piazzi, the dis

   coverer of the planet Ceres. These gentlemen, said the President,
   died according to the ordinary course of nature in old age, having
   enjoyed a glory which in no respect disturbed their repose. Among
   the home members, he dwelt at some length on the loss of Mr. Taylor
   Combe and Sir Stamford Raffles; the last of whom he eulogized as
   a most disinterested and liberal contributor to the Natural History
   of this country. “Occupying high situations,” said the president,
   “in our empire in the East, he employed his talents and his exten
   sive resources, not in the exercise of power or the accumulation of
   wealth, but in endeavouring to benefit and to improve the condition
   of the natives, to fix liberal institutions, and to establish a perma
   ment commercial intercourse between the colonies in which he pre
   sided and the mother country; which, while it brought new trea
   sures to Europe, tended to civilize and to improve the condition of
   the inhabitants of some of the most important islands of the East.
   Neither misfortune nor pecuniary losses damped the ardour of his
   mind in the pursuit of knowledge.          Having lost one splendid col
   lection by fire, he instantly commenced the formation of another;
   and having brought this to Europe, he made it not private, but
   public property, and placed it entirely at the disposition of a new

  discussed and supported by Drs. Thomson and Wollaston, and the
  scale of chemical equivalents of the latter gentleman separates the
  practical part of the doctrine from the atomic or hypothetical part,
  and is worthy of the celebrated author. Gay-Lussac, Berzelius,
 Prout, and other chemists, have added to the evidence in favour of
 the essential part of Mr. Dalton's doctrine; and for the last ten
 years it has acquired, almost every month, additional weight and
'solidity.                                               -
    The President      begged    to be   understood,   that it was the funda
 mental principle that he was contending for, and not Mr. Dalton's
 particular statement of the nature of bodies, and the numbers re
 presenting them, given in Mr. Dalton's New System of Chemical
‘Philosophy.       In this, he said, as a first sketch, many of the opinions
 are   erroneous,    and the results incorrect, and they are given with
 much more     precision   in later authors. It is in the nature of physical
 science that         its
                      methods offer only approximations              truth, and       to
 the first and most glorious inventors were often left behind                very                by

 enabled others to discover truth.

tion to the planetary world, and demonstrative of the laws of
gravity.     These researches, pursued for many years by Sir William
Herschel, were after his death continued by his son, Mr. Herschel,
and Mr. South, with an instrument adapted for the purpose by
Mr.Troughton. The combined observations, according to Mr. South,
establish several important points—such as occultations of fixed
stars by each other, proper motions of fixed stars, and revolving
systems, in which two stars perform to each other the office of sun
and planet, several of them having revolutions which may be
assigned from 53 to 1400 years. After giving a pretty extensive
account of Mr. South's conclusions, the President said: When the

   Dec. 19.—A. B. Lambert, Esq. in the Chair:—A vacancy for
ten Foreign Members was declared; and a certificate was presented
recommending Charles Lucien Buonapartè, Prince of Musignano,
author of several valuable works on American Ornithology, to fill
one of the vacancies.
   The continuation was read of Mr. W. S. MacLeay's “Remarks
on the comparative anatomy of certain Birds of Cuba, with a view to
their respective places in the system of Nature, or- to their relations
with other animals.”
   After insisting on the importance of studying Natural Arrange
ment and Comparative Anatomy in connexion with each other, in
order to investigate, whilst examining particular organs, the place
held in nature by the animals to which they belong, Mr. MacLeay
proceeds to examine the principles of arrangement laid down by
Aristotle, with reference to the plan of studying the variation of
structure in different animals, in preference to classing them to
gether according to an arbitrary division of organs. He then states,
that on the appearance of Mr. Vigors's View of Ornithology, he na
turally became anxious to know whether the affinities therein stated
held good throughout, and on           his
                                     arrival  Cubain    he
                                                       resolved   toex
amine anatomically those forms, which from being Extra-European
had hitherto been little studied. He prefaces his observations upon
them with some remarks      on
                             the affinities  Vertebrata, and the Com

     Nov.         17th-" A noticewas read On some beds associated with
the magnesian limestone, and on some fossil fish found in them," by
the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, Woodwardian Professor, F.G.S.
   This notice professes to be an abstract of a longer paper hereafter
to be presented to the Society. (1.) It first describes a deposit
which extends through Yorkshire and Durham and separates the
magnesian limestone from the coal measures. It is principally com
posed of sand and sandstone : but in one or two instances red marl
and gypsum have been found associated with                    Its general cha        it.

     The cave of Lunel is situated in compact calcaire grossier, with
 subordinate beds of globular calcareous concretions, and the whole
 of the rock having something of an oolitic structure. In working a
 free-stone quarry of this calcaire grossier, the side of the present
 cavern was accidentally laid open, and considerable excavations
 have since been made in                     it,

    68                       -Geological Society.
     For  these discoveries we are indebted to the exertions of M. Cristol,
    a  young  naturalist of Montpelier, whose observations on the geology
     of that district the author
                           -      found to be in perfect accordance with
     his own.
        With respect to the bones of Camels said to have been discovered
    in this cavern, Dr. Buckland found on comparing rigidly the only
    bone which was supposed to be of this animal with the proportions
    given in Cuvier, that it certainly does not belong to the Camel. In
    some few parts of the diluvial mud there occur the bones of Rabbits
    and Rats; and M. Cristol has also discovered the leg of a Domestic
    Cock. All these Dr. B. found on examination to be of recent origin
    (not adhering to the tongue when dry, as do the antediluvian bones).
    The Rats and Rabbits are supposed to have entered the cave spon
    taneously, and died in the holes which they had burrowed in the
    soft diluvial mud, and the Cock's bone to have been introduced b
    a Fox through a small hole in the side of the cavern, which had been
   long known as a retreat of Foxes, in the bottom of an ancient
    quarry.
       Land shells, similar to those which hybernate in the soil, or fis
   sures of the neighbouring rocks, are also found in the mud that filled
   the cave. The author considers that these may either be the shells
   of animals that in modern times have entered some small crevices
   in the side of the cavern to hybernate there, and have buried them
   selves in the mud; or that they entered in more ancient times, and
   died whilst the cave was inhabited by hyaenas, and lay mixed with
   the bones before the introduction of the mud and pebbles, or that
   they were washed in by the same diluvial water which imported
   there the diluvial detritus in which they are now imbedded.
       Dr. Buckland draws a strong line of distinction between the mud
  and gravel of the caves and fissures, which he considers to be part
   of the general diluvium so widely spread over the adjacent country,
  and the local freshwater formations occurring also in the same
  neighbourhood of Montpelier; and which differ as decidedly from
  them, and bear to them the same relation that the gravel on the
  summit of Headen Hill in the Isle of Wight, bears to the strata of
  freshwater limestone that lie beneath it.
      The author next proceeds to consider the epoch of the deposi
  tion of the remains of quadrupeds that have been found in some
  extensive quarries of stone and sand in the Fauxbourg St. Domi
  nique at Montpelier, imbedded in a very recent marine formation
  which has been described by M. Marcel de Serres, in the 4th
  volume of the Linn. Trans. of Paris.                                   -
      In the central beds of this deposit, the remains of the Elephant,
  Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Mastodon, Ox and Stag, are found
  intermingled with those of Cetacea, Dugong, or Lamantin; they are
  more or less rolled, and are occasionally covered with marine shells.
  Beds of oysters also (the Ostrea crassissima of Lamarck,) and
  barnacles, occur in horizontal and nearly parallel strata amid the
  marine sand, and show this deposition to have taken place gradually
  and at successive though perhaps short intervals, rather than to
- have resulted from a sudden marine irruption.       The period of this
                                                              deposition

.deposition is supposed by the author to have been that which im
 mediately preceded, and was terminated by the last grand aqueous
 revolution which formed the diluvium.                              -
     To a similar and contemporaneous period with this upper marine
 formation of Montpelier, he refers the bones of the Elephant, Rhino
 ceros, &c. with marine shells, (oysters and barnacles adhering to
 them,) that have been found in certain parts of the Sub-apennine
 hills, and also the bones of similar quadrupeds and shells that occur
                                                    -
 in the Crag of Norfolk and Suffolk.
     To the same period also he assigns the bones of the osseous breccia
 of Gibraltar, Cette, and other fissures and caves along the north
 coast of the Mediterranean; and the accumulation of the remains
 of bears, hyaenas, &c. in the caves of Germany, England and France:
 he also attributes the same date to the bones of similar animals
 that are found buried in the sediments of the antediluvian fresh
water lake of the Upper Val d’Arno.
   Dec. 1.-An extract of a letter from B. de Basterol, Esq. to
Dr. Fitton, V.P.G.S. was read.
   The author gives a short account of the succession of the strata
in the vicinity of Folkstone, about which there had existed some
uncertainty; from whence it appears that the Folkstone marl (or
Gault) is separated from the lowest beds of the chalk by a stratum
of green-sand, and is itself succeeded by sand and stone also abound
ing in green particles. The order being as follows: 1st, white chalk;
2nd, gray chalk; 3d a) sand containing green particles, and indi
stinct organic remains.      b) marl of a dirty white colour mixed
with the sand, and containing compact nodules; 4th, the blue marl
of Folkstone (Gault) with Hamites, Inocerami, Ammonites, and a
small Belemnite. , 5th, thick beds of sand and sandstone full of green
particles, but void of organic remains.
   The reading of a paper was commenced, entitled “Additional
notes on part of the opposite coasts of France and England, in

   Nov. 10.—There was read a letter addressed to the President by
Lieut. Henry Foster, R.N., On the method of determining the
longitude by moon-culminating stars.   The method was employed
in finding the longitude of Port Bowen, the station where the ex
pedition for the discovery of a North-west passage, under the com
mand of Capt. W. E. Parry, passed the winter of 1824-5. The ob
servations were made with an excellent portable transit instrument
by Dollond, of thirty inches focal length, and two inches aperture;
and made as often as circumstances would admit, between Dec. 5,
1824, and April 1, 1825. The resulting longitude is 5' 55" 39-2
west of Greenwich; the latitude being 73° 18' 39";4 north.
   During a residence of nine months at Port Bowen, Lieut. Foster
                                                                 ".

limb from a fixed star, he found from the peculiarities of the cli
mate, to be subject to these inconveniencies: viz. The uncertainty
in the amount of atmospherical refractions at moderate altitudes in
extreme low temperatures:—The alteration of the index error from
a change in figure of the instrument, caused by temperature during
an observation, and the painful sensation of burning (denominated
long ago by Virgil, the scalding cold), on touching intensely cold
metal with the naked hand. In addition to which, the condensa
tion of the vapour from the eye, in a thin film of ice on the eye
piece of the telescope, rendering the star and the moon's limb ob
scure:—and further, the absolute necessity of holding the breath
during an observation, as well as when reading off the measured
arc:—all of which are, evidently, serious obstacles to correct ob
 servation.
    There was also read a communication from Dr. Rumker, of Star
gard, Paramatta, to Dr. Gregory, containing an account of some
 observations made at the observatory there. This paper contains,

 about 30 spots, as well as the time of the beginning and the end,
 under very favourable circumstances. The darkness of the moon
 during  its   total obscuration was such, that the occultations   of  stars
of   the 8th and 9th magnitudes could distinctly      be   observed. Dr.     R.

        M. Berthier prepares this sulphuret as follows:—Dissolve zinc
 foil in sulphuric acid, and   separate the small quantity of charcoal
and lead which remains undissolved; evaporate the solution to
dryness, and add a few drops of nitric acid to peroxidize the iron;
calcine slightly to decompose a part of the sulphates, and redissolve
in water. If the solution still contains iron, which may be determined
by a prussiate, repeat the operation; when there is no iron remain
ing, add a few drops of hydrosulphuret of ammonia to separate any
trace of lead which may be dissolved.         By slowly heating the sul
phuret in an earthenware crucible to whiteness, either alone or mixed
with 15 per cent of charcoal, it is reduced to a sulphuret; but as it
almost always happens that a portion of the sulphate is decomposed
by the heat before charcoal can reduce           the sulphuret   mixed              it,                            is

    General Observations.—Considering that November                      general, the                    is,   in
most wet and gloomy month             the year, we may term the present
                                                      in                            fine                                        a
month; but the prevailing northerly and easterly winds made                   cold.                                   it             It
seldom happens               in
                        November that                               we
                                             can see the coerulean hue         the sky                                     of
five days without clouds, which was the case this month.             But during one
third      the month much low haze and vapours prevailed, which, from the
           of
obliquity        the sun's rays, had rather
                 of                                gravitating than          ascending
                                                                              a                                       an
power. Their floating                          so
                                near the earth's surface was the cause           exces                                         of
sive dampness for several days, which seemed                  have    more powerful          to              a
effect     onthe human constitution, than the cold weather with brisk drying
winds had. On the penetrating effects                  sudden vicissitudes of the  of
weather          autumn, we may draw some inference from the discoloured

XX.      On some new auriliary Tables for determining the ap

                         To Mr. Taylor.
1.
      IN  a late Number of your valuable Journal”, you have
        noticed the New Tables for facilitating the computation of
Precession, Aberration and Nutation recently published by the
Astronomical Society of London.      These tables certainly pre
sent the most convenient mode of computing those quantities,
when occasionally required: but they, by no means, supersede
the utility and (in the present state of astronomy,    may say)         I
the necessity of those Special Tables for the daily corrections
of the Greenwich stars, which were computed also at the ex
pense of the Astronomical Society, at the suggestion (I believe)
of Mr. Herschel; and who has written an excellent Introduc
tion to the same.
   2. It is well known that Mr. Herschel’s tables are intended
only to be subsidiary to the formation of other tables of the
corrections which are daily required in an active observatory:
and to save the time and labour which must otherwise be em
ployed in determining those quantities.      And, in the compu
tation of those  daily  values, it will be evident to the experi
enced calculator that a still greater saving of time and labour
might be effected if the computations of one year could be
made subservient to those of the following years. This may
be readily done with respect to the aberration: since the place
of the sun on any given day will never differ more than 15 or
 16 minutes from    itsplace         on
                                 the same day     any contiguous
                                                               in
               by
year: and      a  previous arrangement       the       of
                                                 tables, the cor

82                 Mr. Baily's             proposed Tables             for    the
rection for such difference may be easily applied. The solar
mutation likewise, depending on twice the same argument as
the aberration, may be conveniently added thereto: and the
precession, being a constant quantity, and proportional to the
time elapsed, may also be easily united to the aberration.             It
follows therefore that tables of precession, aberration and
solar-mutation for each Greenwich star may be so formed, for
every tenth day of the year, as to last for many years to come,
without the necessity of any other correction than such as
arises from the position of the sun on the given day: and the
practical astronomer may at any time take out, almost by
inspection, the proper quantities required.          With respect to
the  lunar-mutation,   (to which I shall   presently    refer,)    value                        its
will differ from  year      year     considerably,
                                      to             that annual com

putations must               be
                      made for each year, and for each star. But,
                                                                                                            be be
since four computations for each star,             every year, will    in
sufficient, they may           arranged from year
                                     be    so             year                     to            as    to
united with the    daily   values above alluded               Mr. Her         to.    If
schel's tables, therefore,         considered   be  the first step to    as
wards the formation          these daily corrections
                                          of                  the stars,                of

 January 0, 1800, being exactly 280°: but, in order to pre
serve uniformity in the arrangement of the tables published
by the Astronomical Society,     shall assume the epoch of the I
sun's mean longitude at mean noon at Greenwich on January
1, 1800, being exactly 281°: which, in fact, differs very little
from the preceding assumption. The mean motion of the
sun in a sidereal day is 58'58",6417; which, in 10 such days,
amounts to 9° 49'46",417; and it will be seen that the inter
vals of computation may be extended to 10 days, without any
risk of error.
   5. This being premised, we shall find that the mean longi
tude of the sun, when any given star culminates, on any given
day of the fictitious year, will be equal to
                        280° 13'57",88                    +    (d.   4-     a)   58'   58,6417

sequent fictitious year, commencing when the sun's mean
longitude at mean noon is 28.1°.   The mean motion of the
nodes, in 100 sidereal days, is -5°281.      But these days
should (for each star) be computed from the moment of time
when the sun's mean longitude is equal to
            280° 13'57",88 + 2 x 58'58",6417

note the mean  place of the moon's   node, for any given star,

the mean places of the moon's node, for the respective periods
as under *: viz.

                             Dec. 67 = Q –           21 124
The year in every case being supposed to commence when
the mean longitude of the sun at mean noon at Greenwich, on
January 1, 1800, is presumed to be exactly 28.1°. But, it will
be found that great accuracy in this respect is not essentially -
necessary, when it concerns only the lunar-nutation.
   14. The mean place of the moon's node being computed
for those periods in any given year, we may readily deduce
the place of the node for the same days in any following
year, by merely adding —19°3417 to each of such values:
this being (as I have already observed) the motion of the
moon's node in a tropical revolution of the sun.
   15. Having thus determined the mean longitude of the
moon's node for every hundredth day of the year, we must
enter Mr. Herschel's tables with the Arguments
                       (Q.   - N') and (2   Q.   -- Niv)
and having deduced the lunar-nutation for those days, we may
   * As an example, take the case of 2 Aquilae, whose right ascension,
reduced to the fractional part of 24 hours, has been already deduced equal
to 82118; consequently we must compute the mean place of the moon's
node for January 0.21944 + 82118 = January 104062. The position of
the moon’s node for that moment of time is 172°955; which being added
to —5°281, and     itsmultiples, will give the positionof  the moon's node,
at the time  ofthe culmination   ofthe star,on  every subsequent hundredth
sidereal day  of the year. Thus,      on the tabular April 11th,it  will be
1679,674  =                                                  -
             1670 40' 26".
                                                                  readily

  88               Mr. Baily's   proposed Tables, &c.
  readily determine the amount for every tenth day, when we
  wish to apply it to the computation of the annual tables *.
  The values of N' and Ni" are given by Mr. Herschel.
  M. Bessel has, in the formation of his subsidiary tables, added
  the mean place of the star, at the commencement of the year,
  to the amount of the lunar-nutation: by which means he saves
  the computer the trouble of one addition.              But, with de
                                        I
  ference to so great an authority, would suggest the propriety
  of keeping those quantities distinct.
      16. Having thus given a sketch of the manner in which
  auxiliary tables may be formed, so as to render Mr. Herschel’s
  tables more generally applicable and useful, and at the same
  time to enable us to obtain more easily the necessary correc
  tions for the Greenwich stars, I trust that some one will be
  induced to pursue the subject still further, and endeavour to
  procure the actual computation of such auxiliary tables for
  the correction of all the principal stars now observed at the
  Observatory at Greenwich.          The number of those stars was
  formerly 36; and these are the stars whose corrections in
  right ascension have been tabulated by M. Bessel: the cor
  rections in declination being still a desideratum.          The num
  ber in Mr. Herschel's tables is 46: and the whole of these
  might be tabulated in the manner here proposed, without any
  considerable trouble. But Mr. Pond has recently extended
  his list to 60 stars, whose apparent places are now given an
  nually in the Nautical Almanac; and at the end of the volume
  for 1829, is given a Catalogue of one hundred principal fixed
  stars.   Whether it is intended to give the apparent places of
  the whole of these,       I know not; but it is evident that the
  more the list is extended, the more desirable it will be to save
  the time and labour of the computer: and in no way can this
  be so effectually done as by the tabular arrangement here
  proposed.
      As your Journal appears to be very extensively circulated
  on the continent, as well as in this country,      I beg leave to take
  this  opportunity   of  correcting  a slight  typographical    error in
  my Introduction to the New Tables for facilitating the com
 putation of Precession, Aberration and Nutation, which may
  probably mislead some persons who may employ those tables
  for a different meridian to that of Greenwich.          The error oc
  curs in page xx, where the accent has been placed on the
  wrong h : therefore in line 10 for (h) read (h'), and in line
•    * As an example, take the case of 2 Aquilae on the tabular April 11th.
  These values will be found equal to —0”2005 + 0.0039 = –0.2026.

                                               subsequent
 then be accurate: but the cases mentioned in page xxv re
 quire a slight correction, and should be as follow:
 Case 1. Arg. = Feb. 10 + (500        378)        = Feb. 10-122  –
 Case 2. Arg.  = Feb. 10 + (.750      378)        = Feb. 10.372  –
 Case 3. Arg. = Feb. 10 + (.250       878)        = Feb. 9.872   –
 Case 4. Arg. = Feb. 10 + (125        378)+.018= Feb. 9.765      –
This error has likewise led to the inaccurate expression a
in pages xxii line 18, xxiii line 9, xxiv lines 1 and 5, and
                                                               1                                         –
xxv line 10; in each of which places it ought to be a + l.
   It is evident that this error will not affect the argument of
the Tables, when they are used in this country, or at any of
the observatories in the neighbouring states. But, as it might
probably mislead a computer under a more distant meridian,
unless previously detected,                            I
                                 have taken the earliest oppor
tunity of making the error known; although it is manifest
that the effect will seldom be of much importance.

90        Mr. Ivory's Investigation of the Heat                                     extricated
the same condition to which it was before brought by the
agency of heat alone.         For, in both cases, there is the same
volume and the same temperature, and consequently there
must be the same density and pressure.
    And, since the air is precisely in the same state, it must
have acquired the same quantity of heat in both processes.
It follows, therefore, that when air, under a constant pres
sure, expands by the agency of heat, the absolute heat which
causes a given rise of temperature, or a given dilatation, is
resolvable into two distinct parts; of which one is capable of
producing the given rise of temperature, when the volume of
the air remains constant; and the other enters into the air,
and somehow unites with it while it is expanding. Of this
latter part there is no perceptible sign, except the cold, or
the heat, which appears at the instant of             entrance,       exit.       its                  or
 The two heats have              mutual      no

     Of
     the two constants a and 3, the first is the well-known
expansion of elastic fluids for one degree of the thermometer.
The fraction            +,      and consequently             3, may be found                    by as
certaining the heat disengaged from a given mass of air by
a given condensation; for the proportion of this heat to the
heat of temperature required to produce the same condensa
tion, the pressure remaining constant, would be the fraction
sought.          I
            know not that any such experiment has been made
with sufficient precision. It appears difficult to perform it
with great accuracy, on account of the small quantity of mat
ter in air when compared with the vessels that contain it and
with the thermometer, bulk for bulk.     But we may employ
for the same purpose a very curious and ingenious experi
ment first made by MM. Clement and Desormes, and after
wards repeated by MM. Gay-Lussac and Welter, which as
certains by the variation of the barometer the heat absorbed

   The gray sulphuret of copper is negative, in solutions of
                     to clean copper, and the superficial coating
has apparently similar electrical powers to this substance.
    Copper, in the state of protoxide, is negative, not only with
respect to metallic copper, but likewise with respect to the
sulphuret; a circumstance which explains many singular and
apparently anomalous circumstances with respect to the action
of hydro-sulphuret on copper. I have often found the order
which          I
           have mentioned, of metallic copper being positive
with respect to copper that had been a few seconds in solution
of hydro-sulphuret, reversed in a singular and capricious

98                     Sir H. Davy on the Relations
kind,   the well known           phaenomena          of   the       development    of
chlorine and oxygen and acid matter at the positive, and hy
drogen, alkaline matter, &c. at the negative pole, takes place.
   Acid and alkaline matters, when perfectly dry and non
conducting, become on contact negative and positive; as                             I
have shown is the case with oxalic acid and lime; but this
effect is similar to that of glass and silk, and the result is a
common electricity of tension.      And when acids and alkalies
combine, their union being apparently the result of the same
attractive powers acting on the particles which would pro
duce their electrical relations as masses, they exhibit no phae
nomena of electro-motion; and such phaenomena, when they
occur in combinations in which acids and alkalies unite,                           al
ways depend upon the contact of the metal with the acid and
alkaline matter, change of temperature, evaporation, &c. and
never on the combination of the acid and alkali.
   As a different opinion has been lately started, on high au
thority”,    I
             shall give the proofs of the truth of this my early
view, which appear to me of the strictest demonstrative nature.
   A solution of nitre, which is a substance neutral to the con
tact of noble metals, was introduced into a glass cup contain
ing a plate of platinum connected with the multiplier; pure
concentrated nitric acid was placed in another cup, in which
there was another plate of platinum joined to the other wire
of the multiplier, and the connexion was made by a piece of
asbestus wetted in a solution of nitre.       At the moment of
contact, the needle indicated a strong electrical action, nega
tive on the plate plunged in the acid, and which occasioned a
 permanent deviation of about 60°.
   This arrangement was removed from the multiplier, and
another substituted for         it,
                                which strong solution
                                      in                  potassa        of
occupied the place         of
                          the nitric acid, being     contact with   in
platinum     inone cup, and solution    nitre    the other, with
                                                of             in
the same communications. The deviation was now much
weaker, about         10
                     degrees, and the platinum     the solution in                 of
potassa was positive.
   The nitric acid and the solution      potassa were now con
                                                    of

needle was       to
              about 65°.   In this instance there was no che
mical action      of
                 the fluids           on
                                each other; for they had      ten             no

of less specific gravity than either      the other solutions, re

                                                                99.
                of Electrical and Chemical Changes.
    A piece of asbestus, of nearly the same size with the other,
but dry, was now substituted for the moist asbestus, so that
the acid and alkali combined by capillary attraction producing
heat: at first, the deviation was rather less than in the former
instance; but as soon as the combination was complete, the
needle stood exactly at the same point, proving that no elec
tricity was developed by the combination, any more than b
the indirect communication of the acid and the alkali.
    After trying the effects of the contact of fluid acid upon
platinum by the arrangement with solution of nitre, and find
ing that oxalic acid was the acid among the powerful ones
which produced the slightest deviation of the needle, or the
smallest negative effect,    I employed this acid and solution of
potassa, exactly in the same manner as the nitric acid in the
experiment just detailed; as the joint action of the acid and
alkali on the platinum was only to produce a deviation of
7 or 8 degrees, it might be suspected that any electrical action
produced by combination might be more easily manifested;
but no such effect occurred; and whether the communication
was made by combination through dry asbestus, or through
asbestus wetted in a saline solution, the effect was precisely
the same.
    Again,-the two surfaces of platinum were placed in con
tact with strong solutions of nitre, and the communication
made between them by solution of potassa and nitric acid;
there was no electrical action, though the chemical combina
tion was intense.     But when the fluids were mixed, so that a
little acid touched one plate of platinum and a little alkali the
other, electro-motion immediately began; and in using muri
atic acid and solution of ammonia, which, being lighter than
the saline solutions, very soon came in contact with the plati
num, the effect commenced almost immediately, and continued
for some time to increase.
    Again, -1 placed pieces of paper coloured with litmus and
turmeric, and moistened in solutions of nitre, upon two sur
faces of platinum connected with the multiplier; they were
covered with a stratum of porcelain clay wetted with the same
solution, a stratum of clay moistened with muriatic acid was
placed above on one plate, and a stratum moistened with so
lution of ammonia above on the other, so as to make a con
tact in which there should be action upon a large surface
without direct communication with the metals.         In several
experiments of this kind there was no electro-motion; and
whenever it was perceived, it was found that either the acid,
                                                               :
or the alkali, or both, had penetrated through the clay, and

the papers, which were placed as indications of the correct
ness of the experiment.
    Having brought forward what appear to me decided proofs
   n this subject, I shall now proceed to investigate the opera
tion of the metals and fluids in combinations containing two
of the latter substances.         At first was surprised to find that  I
platinum acted so powerfully with nitric acid, which under
goes no chemical change by contact with                       and suspecting              it,
that    it might arise from the presence                minute portions          of                                 of

where the quantity of acid or alkaline matter is very small
and the chemical action of the metals strong, there is some
times a different order.       Thus zinc and tin tarnish immedi
ately even in a weak solution of potassa, and, so tarnished,
they are negative to the same metals in weak solutions of
muriatic or sulphuric acid; but in experiments of this kind it
is easy to determine the true circumstances by changing the
poles; the negative side, when the energies of the alkali and
acid are weak, will be determined by the tarnish or coat of
oxide formed.
     Solutions of sulphurets act in these combinations like alkali,
with circumstances depending upon the formation of new
compounds, according to the law explained in the last section.
In combinations, of which the elements are hydro-sulphuret
and acid, the metal in the hydro-sulphuretted solution is po
 sitive, and that in the acid negative; but with alkalies and
 hydro-sulphurets, and zinc and tin, the metal in the solution
 of alkali is positive, and that in the solution of hydro-sul
 phuret, negative: with silver and palladium the opposite order
 occurs, and with copper there is nearly a balance of powers,
 or changes of power, dependent upon    -
                                             the circumstances de
 tailed in the last section.
     When, in electrical combinations containing one metal,
 water or a neutro-saline solution is in one of the cups, and
 alkali or acid in another, the result is usually such as might
 be anticipated,—the side of the metal in the alkali is positive,
 that in the acid negative, and that in the neutro-saline solu
 tion in the opposite state. There are however certain neutro
 saline solutions, which when they contain oxygen or com
 mon air, act upon the more oxidable metals, and such have a
 power or energy of their own; thus zinc, and tin, and copper
 in solution of common salt, are positive to the same metals in
 distilled water; and the surfaces of the same metals in weak
 muriatic acid are positive with respect to the surfaces in water
  or saline solutions. In combinations, in which weak and
  strong solutions of acids or of alkalies are the two fluids, both
  being of the same kind, the electrical action is usually feeble;
  but the surface in the strongest alkali is most positive, and in
  the acids the result usually depends upon the ‘nature of the
  solution; if oxide is formed and deposited, the strongest acid
  is negative with respect to the diluted one.
      The chemical changes produced in combinations of this
 kind, are best observed in cases where the metals undergo no
  change; for instance, with platinum, diluted sulphuric acid,
  and solution of potassa.     In this combination, hydrogen soon
  appears on the platinum in the acid, and a very small quantity
                                                                   of

the negative surface, and the alkali towards the positive, is

     In general, the electricities developed              metallic contact             by
are       of  stronger kind than those resulting from the contact

hydrogen and the alkaline body always passing to the nega

    There is no instance of continued electro-motion except in
cases where chemical changes can take place, for even De
Luc's or Zamboni's columns do not act when quite dry, and
the silver in combinations of this kind, when the negative
metal is gold, is uniformly found tarnished: for the exhibition
of electricities of tension, however, a very slight chemical ac
tion is sufficient, as the quantity of electricity required to give
 repulsion to light bodies is exceedingly small; but to form
 electro-magnetic combinations the chemical agents must be
 of an energetic kind.
     As most of the fluids which act powerfully in voltaic com
 binations contain water, or oxygen and hydrogen, it has been
 suspected that these principles were essenti<U+017F> to the effect.
 this however does not seem to be the case, for I found zinc
 and platinum formed powerful electro-motive circles in fused
 litharge and fused oxy-chlorate of potassa, which are not
 known to contain water; and        I   have little doubt that similar
 effects would be produced by other fused salts containing only
 acid and alkaline matter.
     It may elucidate this part of the subject, which must at best
 be obscure, to take a view of the changes occurring in one
 of the simplest voltaic combinations,—that consisting of zinc,
 platinum, and solution of sulphate of soda.            It is a fact that
 zinc and    platinum   become electrical   by  contact,  the zinc posi
 tive, the platinum      negative;  and the two kinds of electricity
 are   apparently   most  intense  at  the surfaces where they are in
 contact with    the fluid, which   is  too imperfect a conductor to
  allow them to neutralize or      destroy   each other: they conse
  quently exert their attractive and       repellent  powers upon the
  elements of the menstruum ; acid and oxygen circulate to the
  surface of zinc, which in consequence is dissolved, and alkali
  and hydrogen to the surface of platinum, of which the hydro
  gen is disengaged, and the equilibrium broken by the contact
  of the metals is restored by the chemical changes; so that a
  constant circulation, or a current of electricity, takes place,
  the power of the combination becoming feebler in proportion
  as the solution is decomposed, and acid accumulated round
 its  positive, and alkali round    its negative surface.
                                                                      In

        In               or acid solutions alone are used, the
             cases where acids
destruction of one or both surfaces, with the transfer of hydro
gen or oxygen, seems to produce the same effect; and the
inactivity of single circles or voltaic piles, in which pure water
is used, or saline solutions freed from air, seems to show that
the destruction of the surface of the oxidable metal is one of
the conditions of continued electrical action; and the cessa
tion of the power of De Luc's or Zamboni's piles, is always
connected         with the tarnish of the imperfect metal employed                                  in

obtained.    The one in question has been in use for nearly
three years, yet, though it was to be apprehended, no symptom
of furring has taken place in the pipes. This arises from the
formation of the apparatus causing the matter to be deposited
in those parts of the cylinder where there is no current. In
instances where boiling water or steam is required, and where
the liability to fur would be consequently greater, any deposit
might be easily drawn off at intervals, by placing a cock at
the bottom of the cylinder, which however does not seem to

XXV.      On the Triple Prussiate of Potash. By R. PHILLIPs,
               -
                            F.R.S. L. & E. &c.
            substances have more occupied the attention of che
FEW  mists, than the salt called triple prussiate of potash: but
notwithstanding the repeated examinations to which it has
been subjected, it will appear on referring even to the latest
chemical works, that great difference of opinion still exists, not
only as to the mode in which the elements of the salt are com
bined, but even as to their number, nature, and proportions.
   It is not my intention to give a history of the various ideas
which have been entertained respecting this substance.              I shall
first notice the experiments of Mr. Porrett, to whom we are
indebted for an opinion now very generally admitted to be true,
or at least probable,_-that iron, carbon, azote and hydrogen
form a peculiar acid, which he has called ferrochyazic acid, and
which he considers as the acid of the salt in question.
   According to the latest experiments of Mr. Porrett” the
triple prussiate of potash is composed of

   t It will be noticed that Mr. Porrett estimates the weight of an atom of
iron at only one half of what it is usually allowed to be.
                                                                         It

   It will be observed that the carbon and azote are equiva
lent to three atoms of cyanogen; and Berzelius considers the
salt as a double cyanide of iron and potassium, containing
water of crystallization, or as
         1 atom cyanide of iron . . . . 26 + 28 =             54

   As the atomic     weights  of the salt   given   by  these analyses
differ so  greatly,   and the   quantities   of the elements consti
tuting it do not in any instance agree, it was evidently requi
site to repeat the analysis, to a certain extent at least, be
fore any probable theoretical views of            nature could       de
                                                                      its                        be

               I                                                   Two

XXVI.                On Capillary Attraction.                                   By the Rev.             J. B.     EMMETT.*
THE  phaenomena of capillary attraction are amongst the
  most curious and obscure in nature. The spontaneous
rise of liquids between solid surfaces placed very near to each
other, proves that corpuscular attraction does extend to a
distance equal to several diameters of the particles of the
suspended liquid, so as greatly to exceed their weight. Hence
the elevation is occasioned       the corpuscular force acting
perpendicularly to the axis of the tube, on the same principles      .
as common hydraulic pressure: if the corpuscular force exist,
and extend      powers      its

   The quantity of the depression in the above experiments is
 not to be regarded as rigidly accurate, since the apparatus
 employed is imperfect: the future experiments (of which you
 will receive an account in time for your next Number,) will be
 made with an apparatus in which the index will be moved by
 means of a fine micrometer-screw: the above, however, prove
unquestionably that heat depresses water, and some, probably
all, other liquids.”                                            -
    It would be premature to assign the cause to which these
phaenomena are to be ascribed: yet since the diminution pro
duced in the density of the liquid by heat, cannot give rise to
the effect +, it appears highly probable that the repulsive
force of caloric, acting between the solid and the particles of
the liquid<U+017F>, being augmented by an increase of temperature,
the sensible force of attraction, i.e. the excess of the attrac
tion above the force of calorific repulsion is consequently                                                 di
minished, and therefore the height of the suspended column
is reduced.
   Should this be the case, the phaenomena of capillary attrac
tion will afford a ready and accurate means of ascertaining the
relative intensity of the attraction of various bodies, and the
ratio between the force of attraction, and that of repulsion at
different temperatures, together with many other departments
of chemical science.

 XXVII. A                new Method of bleaching and preparing Flair.                                               By

 ONtheaccount of the great distress which prevails in most of
        manufacturing districts, I have been induced to pre
 sent to the public the following means of bleaching and pre
 paring flax and tow, by a simple, easy and cheap process,
 whereby it is reduced to a beautiful degree of whiteness, be
 comes possessed of a silky lustre, and is made sufficiently fine
to be manufactured into the finest goods; hoping that it may
become the means, in the hands of opulent manufacturers, of
giving employment to some of the workmen, who are unable
to meet with it.
    The process is as follows: Steep or boil the flax or tow in
a weak solution of subcarbonate of potash or soda, in order to
extract the colouring matter, resin, &c.           I prefer the subcar
bonate to the      pure  or caustic  alkali, because,   however diluted
the latter may be,          powers its  corrosion are     of great that                   so                        if
it extracts the extraneous matter perfectly,            will almost cer             it
tainly diminish the strength           the fibre; whilst of   find that                   I                         it
may         thoroughly extracted

XXIX.           On the Accidents incident to Steam Boilers *.               By
                John TAYLoR, Esq. F.R.S. F.G.S. F.H.S.
ITmost
   has been remarked by some practical men who have had
       opportunity of examining the circumstances under
which the bursting of boilers has taken place, that the causes
have sometimes appeared to be not of that simple character
which is commonly assigned to them; and that some such ac
cidents have occurred where neither excessive expansive force
of steam, neglect of the usual precaution, weakness of material
or bad construction, existed to a degree equal to the effect.
Mr. Woolf in a conversation upon this subject some time since,
expressed to me his opinion of some case where, as he thought,
there was ground to suspect the operation of an explosion of
gas in the flues, or at least outside the boiler.   Any inquiry
or discussion into the causes of circumstances which continue
to be a reproach to our mode of using steam, must, conceive,           I
be useful; and my principal object will rather be to provoke
it,and     encourage
           to            record
                             a             of

                                            admit that some re
                        to of
particular theory     my own, though                 I
cent cases appear     countenance Mr. Woolf’s idea.

the outer case #ths.
   The weakest parts of this construction have generally been
supposed to be, the outer tube, by having too great a diameter
for the strength of iron used, and the ends of the boiler, which,
by being square and riveted to angle iron, are more likely to
break than if a spherical form were adopted. It does not ap

pear, however, in practice, that these have been the first parts
to give way.
        e advantages which this boiler seems to possess over
others may be             stated. It has been found, by comparin
the   duty of the  engines  by means of the monthly reports,                     .#
checking this by the observations of the agents, that the fuel
goes further in them than in any others yet tried.               Circum
stances, at first sight apparently trivial, may perhaps conduce
                   I
to this result. suspect that the peculiarities of coal of different
districts influence more the success of different kinds of boilers

                     incident to Steam Boilers.                 129
 meter, with ends of the same material generally of a hemi
spherical form; it is placed horizontally, the water occupying
 by far the larger portion of the space within, and the fire is ap
plied under    §.  bottom part.
   The section annexed shows the position of the boiler with
respect to the fire: the lengths which have been usually made
may be stated at from 20 to 40 feet, and the diameter from 4
to 5 feet. The plates generally employed for making these
boilers are #ths thick.
   This construction is common,        I  believe, in America, but
they were not much used in England until they were intro
duced by Messrs. Taylor and Martineau, who have made
them in a very excellent manner; and by placing the bar across
the centre, as shown in the drawing, and which is repeated at
intervals throughout the whole length, they have given them
the greatest strength, and rendered them easy to repair. I have
never heard of any one of these boilers having burst or caused
any disagreeable accident.
                                     I
   In our mines in North Wales have used them with great
advantage, and our agents and engineers prefer them to any
other, and find that they generate steam rapidly, and appa
rently with oeconomy; but, as there is no monthly report there
as in Cornwall, this point cannot be ascertained precisely.
   I expected the same advantage by using them in Cornwall,
with the further one of increased security. In this, have   I
been disappointed: the difference in the quality of the coal
appears to be the reason;–in NorthWales it is a free burning
and bituminous coal, and makes little or no clinker, and there
fore essentially different from what     I have described the coal
used in Cornwall to be.      With the latter these boilers do not
appear to afford steam freely; whilst the brick sides of the fire

 place are so rapidly encrusted with clinker, and the door so
 frequently kept open to cleanse them, that much of the effect
 of the fire is destroyed.
    The third class of boilers which have been used in the mines
 is that which includes Mr. Woolf’s invention of a series of
 tubes filled with water and exposed to the fire. These boilers
 were the subject of one of his patents, and various descriptions
 of them are to be found in works which treat on these sub
jects. If one objection to them could be surmounted, they
 would probably be the best description of boilers we know                                     of,
 but this has caused the use of them              be discontinued;—the

  as well as the engine were nearly new.                 One man, unfortu
  nately, was killed, and the stack of the engine-house was much
  shattered, as well as the building itself. The interior tubes of
  the boilers were much contorted and rent.                    Captain Reed,
  who was near the spot, remarked, that the one explosion was
  heard a little before the other, but the noise had hardly ceased
  when the second took place.
     Some time after, one of the boilers of the 64-inch cylinder
  engine at East Crennis Mine blew up. This engine was also
  under the care of Mr. Sims, but had been much longer at
  work than that at Polgooth. The inner tube was compressed
 as if the fire had softened the part above                     though there        it,
 did not appear           toany other reason

place, and almost immediately after an explosion, which made
him jump from a door-way considerably above the level of
the ground below, as the engine stands on the side of a steep
hill:—this door was used to discharge the cinders from the
ashpits.    He alighted on the heap, and escaped out of the
way just before the hot water gushed out. Two other men
who were in the boiler-house were not so fortunate, and they
were killed instantly by the boiling water; no mark of any
other injury being to be found on their bodies.
    In this case, had the rush of flame from the fireplace any
thing to do with the subsequent explosion?
    And admitting that the steam was so far within the pressure
that could by mere expansive force regularly exerted injure
such a boiler,-might not the rupture be occasioned by the aid
that a vacuum suddenly created might produce?
    Does not the bursting of the one boiler after another as at
Polgooth, seem to indicate that exterior causes operated?
    Is it possible to conceive, supposing the pressure equal in
two boilers as was the case at Polgooth, both being connected
to the same steam-pipe, that the relative strength of the two
 should be so exactly the same as that what would by mere
expansive force burst the one should have the same effect
 upon the other?

INMagazine
       the first  Number of the New Series of the Philosophical
                  and Annals of Philosophy, there is a paper
(page 12), purporting to be a reply from Captain Parry and
Lieutenant Foster, to my remarks on the velocity of sound at
                                            I
Port Bowen; the meaning of which do not exactly compre
           I
hend, as think they apparently controvert my remarks, while
at the same time they indirectly acknowledge the justice of
them. In fact, my formulae were investigated long before -
their experiments were made known.                I cursorily noticed
them at the end of the paper, when it was just upon the point
                                               I
of being transmitted to London, and hope that my paper
upon comparison will be found to be characterized with as
much fairness and candour as theirs. Indeed,             I  spoke with
as much courtesy of them in that paper as          I  did of NEwton,
and    I do not think they deserve more.
    However, if they will demonstrate the truth of the proposi
tion which they have enunciated as following from their ob
servations, under the Table of the velocity of sound at Port
 Bowen, page 86 of the Appendix to the Third Voyage, with
out any equivocation of language, such as speaking of an            in
creased density, instead of a diminished elasticity, &c.—I shall
be most happy to correct any mistake or indelicacy of lan
guage which I may have inadvertently employed.

    Since the reading of a former communication of the author, the
 correct identification of the beds beneath the chalk suggested by
 Mr. Lyell, and an examination of the strata in the vicinity of
 Weymouth, have enabled him to compare some portions of the
 country on the opposite sides of the English Channel more accu
 rately than before was practicable: and he now, 1st, describes in
 detail the strata which succeed the chalk in the vicinity of Folk
 stone; and 2dly, gives a general description of the Lower Bou

   I. On the N.E. of Folkstone, the chalk is succeeded by the equi
valent of the Merstham Firestone, (or green sand,) which is there
however not more than fifteen or sixteen feet in thickness; and this
is followed immediately by Gault.             The Shanklin Sands, (or lower
green sand,) which come next in succession, are composed of three
groups, which may be recognized also in theinterior of the country.—
The first and uppermost consisting of sand, abounding in irregular
concretions of limestone and chert, sometimes disposed in courses
oblique to the general direction of the strata. And the top of this
formation, in the vicinity of Folkstone and Hythe, forms an ex
tensive plateau resembling that of the Blackdown range of hills in
Devonshire.—The second number of the group likewise consists
chiefly of sand, but in some places so much mixed with clay, or
with oxide of iron, as to retain water; and it is remarkable for the
                                  or its
great variation of           colour and consistency,+from            the state                                             of

much more         instone,   the concretional beds being closer together
and more nearly continuous; and the fossils                   this group, which          of
are very numerous, agree with those                                   of

the incumbent mass of oolite is removed, the surface of the lime
stone beneath is found to be smooth, or slightly waved like the
sands of the shore after the tide has retired; and the rock is pierced
by tubular perforations evidently the work of marine animals; a
proof that the surface must have been exposed to their activity for
some time before the oolite was deposited. The beds of mountain
 limestone of the ordinary character, in some places alternate with
 dolomite, precisely resembling that which is found in the same geo
logical situation near Dublin. , And the fossils of this formation in
 the Boulonnois are the same with those of Derbyshire, Gloucester
 shire, and Dublin.
     On comparing in a general view the strata of the opposite
 coasts, it will be seen that those of the Boulonnois do not occur
 upon the English shore, except in the vicinity of Weymouth; and
 if the line of elevated strata which extends from that part of the
 coast of Dorsetshire, through the Isle of Purbeck and the Isle of
 Wight, were continued to the eastward, it would reach the French
 coast near Gris-nez;-just at the place where the same beds arise, and
  where it is remarkable their position is likewise very highly inclined.

posed was the comet announced by M. Gambart.              Looking for the
same comet on      subsequent   evenings,    the only   one of his instru

whose double object-glass was of 40 inches and 6 lines focal di
stance, and 30 lines and a half of aperture;—this telescope has an
eye-glass of 2 inches focal distance, and is of admirable clearness.
It is mounted on a parallactic foot, but required the appropriation
of a micrometer, before it could be well applied to this class of ob
servations. On the 4th, 5th and 6th of April, he made some good
observations on the comet with this apparatus: on the 7th he could

 the matter soluble in water has been removed, are principally com

       DECOMPOSITION    OF OXALIC ACID BY SULPHURIC ACID.
  In our last number we noticed M. Dumas's experiment of the de
composition of oxalic acid into carbonic acid and oxide by means
of sulphuric acid and binoxalate of potash. I have repeated the ex
periment successfully, and the same decomposition is effected when
oxalic acid is substituted for the binoxalate of potash.-R. P.

                         *
                             ORIGIN OF THE DIAMOND.
    In the Philosophical Magazine for November 1826, is inserted an
article from the Asiatic Researches, vol. xv., “On the Diamond
Mines of Southern India,” by the late Mr. Voysey, Geologist to the
Trigonometrical Survey of India. The question, as to the proper ma
trix of the diamond, being one of great interest in the inquiry con
cerning the periods in the physical history of the earth, at which the
various forms of carbon were respectively first produced, and also
in that relating to the natural process by which this gem was form
ed, and as the paper alluded to appears to be less decisive on the
subject than could be wished, it may be useful to future inquirers
to make a few remarks on Mr. Voysey's statements.
    The description given in this paper of the constitution of the
 Nalla Malla mountains is somewhat indecisive and confused; and
does not afford the means of determining, with precision, to what
formation the sandstone-breccia belongs, which is stated to be the
matrix of the diamonds. But it would appear that this range consists
of transition strata, intersected or overlaid in some places, by trap
rocks; the breccia, of course, belonging to the former class. The
imperfect nature of this description, however, is rather to be attri
buted to the existing deficiency of correct general views on the
                                                                         ge
 ology of India, than to any want of accuracy or of knowledge in
 the observer.
     But an aggregate rock, consisting, it is stated, of jasper, quartz,
 chalcedony, and hornstone, cemented together by a quartzose paste,
 and passing into a pudding-stone composed of rounded pebbles of
 the same substances, cemented by an argillo-calcareous earth, can
 not be the matrix of the diamond, as Mr. Voysey supposes.              The
 diamonds it contains, like the other minerals of which it is consti
 tuted, must have existed previous to             consolidation; and
                                                        its                          it   is
 possible, that, also like them,  they  were derived from the destruction
 of some older rocks. The matrix           the Brazilian diamond, we have

that in which silica is deposited in the joints of certain arundinaceous
vegetables.     And Dr. Brewster, at a later period, (See Edin. Phil.
Journ. vol. iii. p. 100.) from the very compressible state which
certain optical characters of the diamond evince it to have once
  ossessed, and which, he states, could not arise from the action of
  eat, nor exist in a mass formed by aqueous deposition, inferred,
that the diamond probably originates, like amber, from the conso
lidation of perhaps vegetable matter, which gradually acquires a
crystalline form.
   It is not intended, in the present remarks, to advocate the opi
nion either of Professor Jameson or Dr. Brewster, though, under all
the circumstances of the case, both are deserving of attention; but
Mr. Voysey quotes the observations of the latter writer, with the
intent to prove, that, as “ diamonds have for two centuries at least
been found in a rock, generally supposed to owe                  origin     depo          its                to

that of the diamond the writer of this notice is not aware; nor has
he, at present, the means of ascertaining.
     It is worthy of remark, whilst considering this interesting ques
tion, that the observation of Newton, which has usually been cited
merely as a sagacious conjecture of the combustible nature of the
diamond, is more precisely an anticipation of the conclusion, to
which the optical characters of this gem have led Dr. Brewster.
Sir Isaac infers, from the great refractive power of the diamond,
“that it is probably an unctuous body coagulated.” (See Phil. Mag.
vol. xvii. p. 197.) Such an inference, derived from an optical cha
 racter entirely distinct from that on which Dr. Brewster founds his
 opinion, affords a strong additional reason for examining this view of
 the question.
      The present-state of the inquiry, then, respecting the origin of
 the diamond, appears briefly to be as follows:
      Argument in favour of the vegetable origin of the diamond:
      This gem is a form of carbon: of that species of matter which
 constitutes the solid basis of                     all

                                                                                                                     to

  that the diamond         originally
                               is         mineral substance.

  Pluviameter and Evaporator have respectively the same square
 area: the former is emptied every morning at 8 o'clock, after rain,
 into a cylindrical glass-gauge accurately graduated to rºodth of an
 inch; and the quantity lost hy evaporation from the latter, is ascer
  tained at least every third day.
     BARoMETRicAL PREssure.—The mean altitude of the Barome
 ter this year very nearly coincides with that of last year, and in
 these two years it is unprecedented in our register, arising from a
 more settled state of the atmosphere in the summer and winter
 months. The maximum pressure is not so high as that of last year
by 4%ths of an inch; but the minimum pressure is exactly the same.
     The aggregate of the spaces described by the alternate rising and
 falling of the quicksilver, is 24-71 inches less than in 1824, and 8.82
 inches less than that of last year.
    For 201 days in which the moon ranged in North declination, the
 mean pressure was      ºth  of an inch higher than in the 183 days in
which she ranged in South declination.
    TEMPERATURE.-The annual mean temperature of the external
 air isºths     of a degree higher than that of last year, and 1:42 de
gree higher than the mean of the last ten years.          As it respects
 the  temperature   of the  atmosphere   there were two  singular devia
tions from the regular course of the seasons this year; namely, the
mean temperature of February was about one-third of a degree
higher than that of March; and the mean temperature of Decem
ber was 1% degree higher than that of November. The mean tem
perature of spring water at 8 o'clock A.M. this year, is 1-70 de
gree lower than the mean temperature of the external air ten feet
from the ground; and for the last six years it is 1-09 degree lower.
With the exception of the genial year 1822, this year has been the
warmest that we have experienced for a great number of years past.
   WIND.—During the first four months, and in September, we had
a long  continuance of brisk and hard gales; the other part of the
year, particularly the last three months, very few gales prevailed.
The number of strong gales, or the days on which they have pre
vailed this year, are as in the following scale.

158          Meteorological Observations                         for          December, 1826.
   WEATHER.—The number of clear natural days, or days on which
no clouds have appeared, as stated in the table, is three more than
last year; and the number of rainy days three less: the number of
fair days with clouds is 9% less, and the number of overcast days
without rain, 10% more than last year. The year has been distin
  uished for a seasonable winter, a warm and healthy spring, a hot
and fruitful summer, and a humid and rather a sickly autumn
from the great and rapid changes in the temperature and state of
the atmosphere. Even in the winter and autumn, only a sufficient
quantity of rain fell to keep the ground in a growing condition.
From the close of March to the end of August only 74 inches fell
here, which with the hot summer months, caused a drought, ma
terially shortened the grass, stunted the barley generally, and on
high and light soils the wheat, but not the fruit crops: the produce
of the earth, therefore, met with advantages and disadvantages. So
dry a period we have not experienced since the year 1818; and the
annual depth of rain at the ground coincides nearly with the dry    -
year 1820.

   General Observations.—The first part of this month was very
the latter part dry (excepting a day or           two),   with more   healthy  airs. It
has been     remarkably    mild for the     season,    the  greatest difference  in the
state of the thermometer         between     the  days   and  nights being  only  15 de
grees, and in three of the nights it rose higher than in the days.

           sciences have recently lost Joseph Piazzi; he died at
 THE  Naples the 22d of July 1826.           He was born at Ponte, in
 the Walteline, on the 16th of July 1746; he took the garb of
 the theatins at Milan, and finished his novitiate in the convent
 of St. Anthony. In his studies, which were conducted suc
 cessively at Milan, Turin, and Rome, he had the advantage
 of being under the tuition of Tiraboschi, Beccaria, Leseur,
 and Jacquier. Intending to engage himself in a similar course
of teaching, he went as professor of philosophy to Genoa, where
expressing his opinions too freely, he alarmed the zeal of the
Dominicans, who would have disturbed his tranquillity if
the grand-master Pinto had not engaged him to teach ma
thematics with him in the new University of Malta.              On the
suppression of this body, Piazzi went to Rome, and afterwards
to Ravenna, where he occupied the philosophical and mathe
matical chair at the College of the Nobles: he there made
himself enemies by publishing some philosophical theses which
appeared to be too bold as coming from a young monk. He
was nevertheless thought worthy to succeed the preacher at
Cremona, where he had retired after the theatins had given
up the management of the college at Ravenna. He was ap
pointed reader on theological dogmas at Saint-André della
Valle, at Rome, where Father Chiaramonte (Pius VII.) was
his colleague, and who retained for him on the throne, the
same sentiments which he had expressed in the cloister.             In
1780, Piazzi, by the advice of Father Jacquier, accepted the

professorship of the higher mathematics at the Academy of
Palermo.      On his arrival there he reformed the method of
teaching, by substituting modern institutes for the works of
Wolff, and by rendering those of Locke and Condillac fami
liar, which were previously almost unknown. By his know
ledge he powerfully contributed to dispel the darkness, which,
under the combined influence of the Inquisition and the Jesuits,
still enveloped the territory of Sicily.         Not satisfied with
having rekindled the love of letters, he obtained from the
prince of Caramanico, the viceroy of the island, permission to
establish an observatory at Palermo.
    He visited France and England, in order to procure the
instruments necessary for his new establishment, and to form
 an acquaintance with those astronomers who were most cele
brated for their labours and knowledge. He was acquainted
with Lalande, Jeaurat, Bailly, Delambre, and Pingré.              He
took   advantage   of the departure   of Cassini, Méchain,   and Le
gendre, who were deputed to determine the difference of the
two meridians of Paris and Greenwich, to visit England, where
 he became intimate with Maskelyne, Herschel, and Vince,
 and especially with Ramsden, to whom he entrusted the con
 struction of his instruments.       He frequented the Greenwich
 observatory, and from it he observed the solar eclipse of 1788,
 of which he gave an account in a memoir inserted in the Phi
losophical Transactions.
    Being desirous of avoiding the uncertainty which quadrants
always leave in the mind of the observer, Piazzi engaged
 Ramsden to construct for him a vertical circle of five feet in
 diameter, accompanied with an azimuth, and divided with the
 precision of which that artist was then alone capable.           He
 went every day to the workshop to hasten the work; and be
 ing dissatisfied with Ramsden's slowness, he conceived that he
 might stimulate his self-love by a letter addressed to Lalande,
 on the life and labours of this optician. The trick succeeded;
 in a short time after Piazzi had the satisfaction to see his great
 circle finished, and he also obtained a transit instrument,
 a sextant, and some other less important machines.              The
 English minister pretended that the circle belonged to the
 class of discoveries, and consequently that it was subject to the
 prohibitory duties of England; but Ramsden protested that
 if it was a new invention the merit of it belonged to Piazzi,
 whose instructions he had merely executed.          This declara
 tion obviated every difficulty, and Piazzi returned to Sicily,
 carrying with him   all   the instruments.    He put the new ob
  servatory in   activity, andit    was the most southern which
  then existed, that of   Malta having been destroyed     by      in

                           Biographical Notice                    of M. Piazzi.                            169
1789. As soon as every thing was in order, observations were
commenced, the results of which were published in 1792.
   Piazzi immediately occupied himself with forming a new
catalogue of stars, the exact position of which appeared to
him as the only true basis of astronomy. François Lalande, in
France; Cagnoli, in Italy; de Zach, Henry,                        in Ger               Bº,
many; had partially commenced this work, relying upon the
position of thirty-six stars which Maskelyne had pointed out
to astronomers as fixed points of comparison. Piazzi, on the
contrary, was unwilling to confide in a single observation: the
slightest inaccuracy on the part of the observer, the smallest
imperfection in the instruments, were accidents too probable
to render them admissible.            He also knew, that if Flamsteed,
Mayer and Lemonnier had continued their observations, they
would probably have deprived Herschel of the honour of his
discovery. These considerations made him return many times
to the same star, before he fixed               position, and     was ac
                                                                  its                        it

                the Academy           Sciences     ofFrance, and which   of

mined his health for four years, could for a moment divert him
from his studies.     The positions assigned by Maskelyne to
several stars were almost immediately mistrusted; but Piazzi
was too much engaged in his researches to think of correcting
the works of others.       He deputed M. Cacciatore, the most
 distinguished of his pupils, to compare directly the principal
 stars with the sun.
    This work was not confined to the thirty-six stars of Mas
 kelyne; it contained one hundred and twenty, which served as
 the basis of the new Catalogue.     Piazzi did not finish it until
 1814, and it was not without astonishment that he was found
 to have extended his researches to 7646 stars. Urged by his
 friends and his pupils, Piazzi occupied himself with preparing
 several memoirs which he intended for several Academies of
 which he was a member: he held at the same time some com
 missions which the government of Naples had given him;
 among others, the formation of a metrical code, to establish a
 uniformity of weights and measures in Sicily.      His work was
 preceded by an Essay, published in 1808, and by Instruc
 tions intended for the use of the curés. During the constitu
 tional government of the kingdom (in 1812), Piazzi was con
 sulted upon a new territorial division, which was decreed by
 the parliament, according to the report of the astronomers,
 and has been preserved even since the destruction of the re
presentative government.      The comet of 1811 gave Piazzi an
 opportunity of explaining his ideas upon the nature of these
 bodies.   He did not suppose their formation to be contem
 poraneous with that of the planets: he was rather of opinion
 that they were occasionally formed in the immensity of space,
 in which they are afterwards dissipated, nearly like those globes
 and luminous meteors which are generated and disappear in
 the terrestrial atmosphere. With such opinions, it is not sur
 prising that he always attached but little importance to the
 observing of comets.
    In 1817, Piazzi was called to Naples to examine the plans
 of the new observatory, founded by Murat, upon the heights
 of Capo-di-Monte. . He introduced many changes, of which
 he gave an account in a work published a little before his re
 turn to Palermo. Succeeded in the immediate direction of
 this observatory by his pupil Cacciatore, he took an active
 part in the labour of a commission charged with the public
 instruction in Sicily, a country which he regarded as a second
 home, and which he preferred to the brilliant offers made to
 him by Bonaparte, to draw him to the University of Bologna.
    Piazzi had no less constancy in his affections, than perseve
 rance in his studies: he had collected an uninterrupted series
                                                                 of

were executed in 1750, by Bradley, Mayer, and Lacaille, it

44" in every century.
   The last arrangements of this great astronomer furnished
fresh proofs of his love for science.   He bequeathed his                                       li
brary and his apparatus to the observatory of Palermo, adding
an annual sum for the education of a pupil. Piazzi enjoyed
a just reputation, acquired by his innumerable and important
labours. He was director-general of the observatories        of
Naples and Palermo, president of the Academy of Sciences
of Naples, member of that of Turin, Gottingen, Berlin, and
Petersburg, foreign associate of the French Institute, of the
 Royal Society of London; ordinary member of the Italian
Society, and corresponding member of the Institute of Milan,

of the mercury between the points at which mercury freezes

ture afterwards communicated. Now by both processes the
air is ultimately brought to the same condition, and conse
quently it must have acquired the same quantity of heat. It is
therefore proved that the whole heat acquired by air which
expands under a constant pressure, is composed of two inde
pendent parts, namely, the latent heat and the heat of tempe
rature.
    Let us next compare the dilatation of a mass of air under a
constant pressure, or, which is the same thing, an air-thermo
meter, with the indications of a mercurial thermometer: the
whole heat acquired by the air will be proportional to the
ascent of the mercury or to the increase of the bulk of the
air: and again, according to what is shown above, the heat of
temperature will likewise be proportional to the ascent of the
mercury, or to the increase of the bulk of the air; wherefore
 the difference of these two heats, that         the latent heat, mustis,
 be   proportional       the ascent
                              to          the  mercury,

heats, namely, the whole heat acquired              the air and         two by                          its

                                                        any given                              in                    di

    The theory which we have been explaining suggests some
 reflections concerning the agency    heat. When    expands          of                                 it
 air         or
           gas,   raises the temperature, and
                  a          it                enlarges the                                    it
 volume without affecting the thermometer.   These effects are
 independent     one another;

 and unites with         manner not perceptible
                                 it    in   a      our senses,                                     to

                                            temperature augments the
 elasticity and affects our senses. Does heat operate according
    these laws only                    air and the gases? or, rather,

with the doctrine     specific heat and capacity. We have here
                            of
compared the quantities                       of
                               heat which unite with bodies when
their temperature        raised, with the dilatation which they
                                is
produce.     But we may likewise compare with one another the
quantities     heat requisite
                 of                cause     given rise
                                                   to        tempera  a                      of

         different            and,      this view, they are called
                                                         in
specific heats, and the bodies themselves are said            have dif                           to
ferent capacities for heat. These two ways                considering                       of
the manner       which heat combines with bodies, are clearly
                       in
distinguished. The one                            by    no
                                     means supersedes the other.
On the    contrary,  we may   deduce from the property           latent                               of
heat we have endeavoured           establish, the condition which
                                                   to
causes the capacity           body   of      aconstant,           vary.
                                                                 to    be                        or   to
Whenever equal additions          latent heat produce equal incre

must   vary.   This will  readily   appear,           considered that      if
                                                                            it        be

employ the expansion         measure the free heat,

   I confine myself to these observations which must stand as
long as any trust can be put in the rules of arithmetic. To
venture upon any discussion concerning the cause of the sin
#.ular discordance between Captain Sabine's experiments and
       made by other observers, might possibly stir up an                                                al

fluence  can be attributed here to the decomposition and pu
trefaction of animal substances in contact with the air.
   But nitric acid forms in the open air, and in materials which
contain no vestige of animal or vegetable matter. An ex
periment is related by one of the competitors for the French
prize”, in which a quantity of earth from the fields, washed
with great care, dried

kept moist by occasional watering for a year, afforded by lixi
viation a saline solution, in one case of one degree of the areo
meter, and in another of half a degree.                            too,
who has   produced       nitric acid  by  exposing  chalk to the gases
evolved from the putrefaction of animal or vegetable substances,
mixed with common air, likewise obtained this acid when the
chalk was in contact with nothing but atmospheric airt.              It
is true that in the experiment which he relates, the materials
exposed to the atmospheric air loaded with putrid gases,
yielded fifteen parts of nitrate of lime; while those which were
in contact with pure atmospheric air, afforded no more than
six parts of the salt. Thouvenel concludes,                 is demon        “It
strated by our experiments, that atmospheric air possesses all
that is necessary to serve for nitrification, as well as the air
which emanates from putrescent bodies, provided it finds mat
ter capable of absorbing the materials f.”
    M. Longchamp having thus shown how ill-founded the pro
position     is,
              that the materials proper for nitrifying never                                   ni

                                         the atmosphere.
  It   isadmitted, he observes, that the animal matters do not
require     to     be
                    contact with the earths, but that their emana
                        in
 tions are sufficient for the production                     of

 might disengage during putrefaction?              But chemists know
 that the products                of
                            this putrefaction are ammonia, carbonic
acid, carburetted hydrogen, and perhaps some carbonic oxide

    But it cannot be denied, that the nitrification of calcareous
substances is greatly promoted by the contact, or, more ge
nerally, by the proximity of putrescent vegetable and animal
matter. The experiment of Thouvenel, to which M. Long
champ refers above, abundantly proves this; and the constant

strongly confirms          This fact appears, therefore,

                                  is                   pure water,              in
while water saturated with carbonic acid dissolves 1-1500th

reason to doubt, that in our present difficulties, more accurate
results will be derived by an attention to this state of the                                                     in
sect, than can be expected from a paramount regard to the
larva. Entomologists have long ago remarked the following
variations in the form and suspension of diurnal pupae.
    1. Pupa suspended by the posterior extremity.        2. Pupa
attached by the posterior extremity, but braced or supported
 in a horizontal or vertical direction by a transverse thread.
 3. Pupa attached like the last, but foliculated, or inclosed
 within a leaf. Among these, two forms are conspicuous:—
 1. Pupae elongated and angular. 2. Pupae obtuse and smooth.
    Geoffroy and Latreille have not failed to draw a marked
 distinction between such of the diurnal Lepidoptera as have
 the anterior feet perfect, that                     is,
                                 distinctly furnished with claws,

  184                 Mr. Swainson     on the    Natural Affinities
  perfections of the diurnal Lepidoptera, the superiority would
  undoubtedly be conferred upon this group, did they not show
  a decided inferiority to the last in their imperfect construction.
  The anterior legs are destitute of claws, and are so short, as
  to appear at first sight perfectly useless. The angular form
  of the pupa is still fully preserved; yet, instead of being braced,
  it is suspended only by the posterior extremity. The lower
 wings of the perfect insect are dilated, so as to form a groove
 for the defence and support of the short conic body. It is
 obvious that this particular construction is admirably adapted
 for giving to these insects that superiority of flight for which
 they are remarkable. Yet in this power there are gradations:
 it is most developed in the genus Paphia, F., but is diminished
 in Morpho; the former is conspicuous for strength, the latter
 for size and beauty. Tracing this gradation further, we find
 in the genus Hipparchia a feeble and irregular flight, and
 a considerable falling off, in other respects, from the typical
 characters.
    The following observation of                the celebrated             Latreille de
 serves particular attention, in this part of our inquiry. “Papil.
 Crameri: Phlegia, Eugenia, Calliope, Euterpe, Diaphana,
 Lenea, Nise, Melanida, etc.; Heliconiorum habitus; horum
 lepidopterorum sedes naturalis incerta; an genus proprium ?”
 No better authority can be brought forward to show that we
have now arrived on the confines of another and a very ex
tensive group, typically represented by the genera Mechanitis
and Idea of Fabricius: these, with Euploa, and probably
Acraea of the same author, are marked by the same debility
in their anterior feet, and the same mode of suspension in their
pupa state, as the last: the pupa, however, is obtuse, and quite
smooth; while the perfect insect, from                its
                                             delicate construction,
betrays    weakness
             a            flight unexampled
                                 of           among the diurnal
Lepidoptera.     This have  I  myself witnessed.    The feeble tex
ture, and horizontally lengthened wings
                                                            its of
                                                  Mechanitis seem,
during flight, scarcely sufficient support  to     long and clavate
body. As we recede from these, the anterior feet             one             in     or
two groups, not hitherto characterized, begin        assume   moreto           a
decided form,          as
                     Nature was about
                        if                   quit this type for an
                                                      to
other. Unfortunately, the slight information we possess                             on
the metamorphosis            of
                         these insects, leaves me     much igno        in

with noticing the generally weak construction, and striking
similitude between several             of

Lycena they become perfectly developed.                The forms and ha
bits  of  this interesting group are              less varied.   noThey are
mostly     of  small
                a      size;    some are remarkable for their sombre,
others for their    brilliant,   colouring. Some are feeble, and when
at rest extend their wings horizontally; others,                    more ro               of   a
bust make,            fly
                    with swiftness, and repose with their wings

Nymphalidae, Heliconidae, and Hesperidae, are not only repre

will find   itsprototype among the Erycinidae.

 186              Mr. Swainson                 on the    Natural Affinities
 lated,   Ican come to no other conclusion than that we have at
 length returned, by a different route, to the point from which
 we first commenced our inquiry.         And that notwithstanding
 the apparent dissimilarity between      Papilio  and Hesperia, they
 are, in fact, closely united by certain characters, which, under
 various modifications, preserve an unbroken thread through
 the whole circle of the diurnal Lepidoptera.
     Nevertheless it must be observed, that there is an apparent
 hiatus between the points of these two groups, so far as regards
 the forms of the perfect insect: or at least, that the transition
 is not so gradual and progressive as that which can be traced
                                                          I
 in the other divisions. But this, apprehend, may originate
 either from ignorance of the metamorphos of certain insects
 already known, or of others which still remain undiscovered.
 I venture to express this opinion, because, so far from disco
 vering any particular fallacy in the mode of investigation here
 adopted,     Ifind it has conducted me through difficulties,
 which, but for this guide, appeared at first insurmountable.
 I see, therefore, no reasonable cause to doubt it will fail, or
become no longer of value, in the present instance. The true
metamorphos of Urania Leilus *, when discovered, may pro
bably confirm the views of M. Latreille; and by assigning to
this insect an intermediate station between the two groups,
render their connexion perfect. Of the metamorphos of Cast
nia we are equally ignorant: but I am more inclined to con
sider that on this point also, the views of that celebrated en
tomologist will be found correct; and that Castnia will form
an aberrant group among the Sphingides connecting them
with the Hesperidae, by means of Hesp. Amycus of Cramer.
    It will be easily seen, that in this faint attempt to thread the
labyrinth of Nature, many inferior groups have been passed over.
                                                                                   by

of the measurements                   he
                           has given, “cannot boast         very great                of

should believe his determinations will nevertheless “contribute

      Now       I
             have constantly found by means of the reflective
 goniometer, that the former of these angles is about 2 degrees
 less, the latter about 2 degrees greater, than Dr. Walchner's
 determination.                    I
                     forbear, nevertheless, from annexing re
marks, which naturally arise from a consideration of the pre
ceding extracts from Dr. Walchner's communication; and
should have been content with simply noticing the differences
between his measurements and those afforded by the reflective
goniometer, which alone is adapted for crystals so minute as
those of the hyalosiderite (for no one of mine exceeds 1-20th
of an inch in any direction), if could have persuaded myselfI
that some ill-founded prejudice against that admirable instru
ment, does not exist on the European continent generally,
notwithstanding the many errors it has served to correct, the
nice differences it has detected, and the ease with which it
may be used.        Rarely does a foreign mineralogist visit this
country, who is acquainted with it except in theory: and I
believe that in every foreign work on mineralogy, it is figured,
not with the moveable pin at right angles, but horizontally, in
continuation as it may be termed, with the axis, in which po
sition it is almost useless. These observations are penned in
the hope that they may meet the eye of Dr. Walchner, and
serve to induce him to prove the superiority of the reflective
goniometer, and consequently the futility of the prejudice
against      it,   reality
                    if   in  exists.         it
    We   know,   however,    that every measurement,          whatso                            by
ever means       may it    made,                        is,

by measuring them, agree much better with each other, than
those obtained from large crystals.

agents which, in proportion to their surface and their num
ber, occasioned the constant circulation of a certain quantity
of electricity through the fluids, or the connecting wires in
the pile; and the chemical changes occurring in these fluids
were considered as mere results, and not necessarily con
nected with the circulation.          The inactivity of combinations
where no chemical changes occur, is sufficiently hostile to this
view; but an examination of some of the circumstances of the
construction of compound electrical combinations, will bring
this hypothesis, and that which                          I

 192               Sir H. Davy on the Relations
    If two, three, or four glasses are used, and two, three, or
 four arcs of platinum and zinc, the extreme metals of which
 are connected through the multiplier, a piece of platinum
 used instead of one of the arcs will not now entirely destroy
 the electro-motive effect: it will be diminished as if one arc
 had been removed.       The two will act as a single combina
tion; the three as two arcs, and the four as three; and of
 course in a voltaic combination of 100 arcs, a single piece of
 platinum substituted for any one of the arcs, will diminish the
 power of the apparatus only 1-100dth part.
    In attempting to protect copper by zinc, in a separate ves
 sel, from the action of sea-water,   I found that when the two
 vessels were connected by moist tow or vegetable substances,
 or by a wire (even through fine) of any oxidable metal, the
 protection was complete; but when even a thick wire of
platinum was employed, the copper, though in immediate con
tact with the zinc, became corroded.        After the experiment
 had continued several days, the surface of the platinum op
 posite to the copper was found tarnished, as if it had been
slightly acted upon by the chlorine combined in the sea-water;
 but this effect had been too feeble to be connected with any
sensible degree of electrical polarity in the platinum.
    This result, with those mentioned in the preceding pages,
seems to show that there can be no accumulation of electri
city in voltaic combinations, unless the same or similar con
 ditions of chemical change exist in the elements or single cir
 cles composing them; and that under other conditions, the
 power generated in single circles is either destroyed or      di
 minished according to the opposing nature, or want of con
ducting power of the chain of intervening bodies. For instance,
 in the arrangement (mentioned p. 191) of one piece of zinc
 and one of platinum, the power is doubled by another series
of the same kind, destroyed by an arc of platinum, and         di
 minished by an arc of zinc.; by a second solution and a second
arc of zinc, it is diminished still more; by a third it is nearly,
and by a fourth absolutely, destroyed.
    As the chemical changes always tend to restore the elec
trical equilibrium destroyed by the contact of the metals with
each other in the fluids, it is evident that in cases in which
arcs primarily inactive are connected with those primarily
active, the chemical changes produced by the electrical attrac
tions must tend to produce in the primarily inactive parts of
the combination, an arrangement which must give it a power
in direct opposition to that of the primarily active circles; so
that when separated, their actions, if any, must be directly the
reverse of the other.                        I
                         This result, which anticipated,

actually found to be correct; six arcs                                      of platinum in                   vessels
filled with solution of nitre, were connected with a voltaic
battery of 50 pairs of plates; of course each arc gave off
oxygen, and collected acid round the pole in the place of the
zinc, and afforded hydrogen and collected alkali round the
pole in the place of the noble metal: on separating the six
arcs from the battery, they were found to possess independent
action, the poles which were negative being positive, and those
positive being negative: in short, the combination acted as if
an original one, consisting of acid, alkali, and platinum.
   With arcs of zinc, the results were of the same kind, but
the electrical effects were much more distinct: as the tarnished
zinc in this case added                         its
                                  own negative power           that pro                               to

            the contact with the acid.

copper, and other metals, and using different saline solutions,
it  was found that the reversed electrical effects were most
powerful with the most oxidable metals, and the most con
centrated and most decomposable solutions; and the weakest
arrangement             of
                    this kind was with arcs        platinum and pure            of

 it must act with much greater power, as the chemical changes
 produced are exactly of the kind which must enhance the
 primary power of the metals.        This deduction (a necessary
 consequence of the electro-chemical theory) I have proved by
 direct experiment. A series of 6 arcs, composed of zinc and
 copper and solution of nitre, was connected in the proper
 order with a voltaic arrangement of 50 pairs, and suffered to
 remain in connexion for 10 minutes; they were then sepa
 rated, and made to act as a single battery: their powers were
 extremely feeble, not certainly one-third as great as those of
 a combination of the same kind which had been in action (but
 unconnected) for the same time.      Six arcs of copper and zinc
 were now connected with the same battery of 50, in a reverse
 or unconformable manner, so that the six plates of zinc gave
 off hydrogen and attracted alkali, and the plates of copper
oxidated and attracted acid.        Being separated after a few
minutes, and made to act alone, they exhibited powers which
appeared three or four times greater than if they had never
been in connexion; the zinc resumed a much higher positive,
and the copper a higher negative state, than if they had not
before been in the antagonist or unconformable conditions.
    All these facts bear upon the same point, and confirm the
view which       I
                took of the nature of voltaic combinations in the
Bakerian Lecture for 1806; in all of which, whether the de
struction of the electrical equilibrium is produced by the con
tact of metals or fluids, it is always restored by chemical
changes, and in which the circulation, if it may be so called,
depends upon a union of these causes, the direction of the
currents being always opposite in the metallic and fluid parts
of the combination, so as to produce what may be regarded as
an electrical circle.
       VIII.     General observations and practical applications.
      Toexplain the manner in which different chemical agents
 in combination, and in a perfectly neutral state, instantly start
 into an active existence, when exposed to the two electrical
 poles, it is necessary to assume principles, and take views of
 corpuscular action of a perfectly novel kind; and as the chief
 agents are invisible, and probably imponderable, no direct
 demonstrative evidence can be brought forward on the sub
ject; and different hypotheses may in consequence be applied
to    it.   Inassuming the idea      two ethereal, subtile, elastic
                                    of
fluids, attractive     the particles
                      of               each other, and repulsive
                                       of
as     their own particles, capable
      to                                 of

                                                         in
proportions with bodies, and according         to
                                               their proportions
giving them their specific qualities and rendering them equi

  valent masses, it would be natural to refer the action of the
  poles to the repulsions of the substances combined with ex
  cess of one fluid, and the attractions of these united to the
  excess of the other fluid; and a history of the phaenomena,
  not unsatisfactory to the reason, might in this way be made
  out; but as it is possible likewise to take an entirely different
  view of the subject, on the idea of the dependence of the re
  sults upon the primary attractive powers of the parts of the

  any discussion upon this obscure part of theory, but I shall
  endeavour to clear the way for elucidations of it by stating
  some experimental results.
     Some solution of nitrate of potassa was introduced into a
 glass basin of six inches in diameter, and large slips of paper,
 tinged with litmus and turmeric, were placed below the fluid,
 and connected with two pieces of foil of platinum; so that
 the indications of the formation of acid and alkali, in any part
 of the basin, by electricity, would be instant and distinct.
 The two pieces of foil were now connected with the poles of
 a voltaic battery: it was found that the alkali was developed
 only at the point or immediate surface of the negative plati
 num, and the acid in the same manner at the surface of the
 positive platinum; and they then gradually diffused them
 selves through the fluid in a circle round the conductors, and
 there was no appearance of any repulsions or attractions of
 the menstrua in the line of the circuit.
    In various repetitions of this experiment the same result was
 obtained; the alkaline and acid matters were influenced in
 their direction only by currents produced by the disengaged
 oxygen or hydrogen, or the inclination of the vessel; in short,
by mechanical causes only; and the same effects were pro
duced on the test papers, as if a spherical piece of acid and
 an amalgam of potassium had been introduced in the places
 of the two poles.
    Mr. Herschel has shown, by some elaborate and ingenious
experiments in the last Bakerian Lecture, that an amalgam
of potassium, containing so minute a portion as some hundred
thousand parts of     itsweight  isstrongly attracted        so  oc
                                                                  as   to

divided into two zones, directly opposite           their powers

the neutral point;     so thatby  a  series    decompositions and
recompositions, the alkaline matters and hydrogen separate                   at
one side, and oxygen, pure      or    union,     the other.

   In this way, the two electricities may be regarded as the
transporters of the ponderable matters, which assume their
own peculiar characters at the moment they arrive at the point
of rest.    I shall detail an experiment which made under a dif                   I

tion in the conception of this singular and mysterious mode

    In the Bakerian Lecture for 1806, proposed the electrical
powers, or the forces required to disunite the elements of
bodies, as a test or measure of the intensity of chemical union.
By the use of the multiplier it would be now easy to apply
this test; and accurate researches on the connexion of
may be called the electro-dynamic relations of bodies to their
                                                                                  ..
combining masses or proportional numbers, will be the first

 absolute remedy for adhesions, is to be sought for by other
 more refined means of protection, and which appear to be in.
 dicated by these researches.
     The nails used in ships are an alloy of copper and tin, which
I   find is slightly negative with respect to copper, and it is on
these nails that the first adhesions uniformly take place: a
 slightly positive and slightly decomposable alloy would pro
bably prevent this effect, and                         I

the prevention of the wear of the paddles or wheels, which
are rapidly dissolved by salt water.

ideas    of that subject are but very obscure and indistinct; but
how that in process of time and by diligent study, these ideas
may be rendered more distinct and clear, by means of the ge
neral experience we may have at length acquired : for as we
observed above, it takes a long time for man to become ra
tional; or in other words, for the rational faculty of man to
become stored with those truths which are indispensable to his
becoming a truly rational or intelligent being.
     We cannot help bringing to your notice the connexion, com
munion, and mutual respect existing between                  things      the            all         of
 world and    nature;—for     does not one science meet and enlarge
 our apprehension                of
                           another, and every new acquisition afford
 an   explanation       what preceded? By many and various facts
                           to
judiciously associated and mutually compared, our ideas are
 illustrated and our reason illuminated; for                  only       de        it   is          by
 grees that the mind disperses the shadows and clouds                                                     of
 ignorance and prejudice, and emerges thence into light.

                      all
   the mind      in     reveries, and how obstinately does withstand

  proposed by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. By THoMAs

To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of
                                      Philosophy.
      Gentlemen.
I HEREWITH          send you a Meteorological Table contain
     ing the monthly means of the barometer, thermometer,
&c. as obtained from daily observations made at 8 A.M. at
Epping, during the year 1826, and also the depth of rain for
each month of the last five years.                          I
                                             have also added another
table of the   hourly   observations made at this place on the 17th
July, 1826, agreeably to the wish of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh. In this latter table have moreover given the I
computed altitudes of my barometer at Epping above that of
 Mr. Bevan's at Leighton-Buzzard; the mean of which agrees
so well with that obtained from similar observations made at
the two places in 1821, as given in the 58th vol. of the Philo
sophical Magazine, from the computations of Mr. Bevan, jun.,
that for this reason             I
                           was induced to trouble you with them
on the    present   occasion.
   It may not be improper to say, something respecting the
instruments used in these observations, as relates to their con
struction and locality,+particulars which ought not to be lost
sight      of,   aknowledge

   The rain gauge is of the same kind as the one described
by Luke Howard, Esq. in his elaborate work on the Climate
of London; it stands in an open situation, about 7 feet from
the ground, and at such a distance from any tree or building
as to prevent, in the least degree, the quantity of precipita
tion being affected by such a cause. The rain is measured
daily, as often as any falls; and in the summer season, during
showery weather with bright intervals, this is done more fre
quently, for the purpose of guarding against any  - diminution
arising from the effects of evaporation.                       :
    In the 2nd Table, containing the hourly observations of the
barometer, &c., the same instruments were used on this oc
casion as in the daily observations, with the addition of De
 Luc's whalebone hygrometer and an horizontal self-register
ing spirit thermometer; they were both exposed to the open
 air in the shade, the former
                          -    5 feet from the ground and the-
 latter 2 feet.   .

       The observations here recorded have been made with great
   care, and as near the stated times as possible.
       However desirable it may be to institute a general plan
   for the purpose of barometrical measurement, yet it is clear
   to every one, that instruments of the very best construction
   only can be used on such an occasion, with any prospect of
   success, in this interesting and useful branch of inquiry. And
 I    have moreover to regret, that it is not at present in my
   power to give to the above barometrical observations that de
                              I
  gree of accuracy could wish, for the want of the necessary
   corrections for the relative capacity of the cistern and tube,
  and capillary action, &c. It was my intention to have sent
  you the annual means of the atmospheric pressure for the last
  five years, as obtained from daily observations made at this
  place during that period; but these I shall defer till such time
      I
  as can with certainty apply to them the requisite corrections
  and reductions, by a comparison with a barometer of the most
  approved construction.
      It appears from the highly valuable Essays on Meteorology
  by J. F. Daniell, Esq., that this gentleman has paid more than
  usual attention to the manufacture of barometers; and the one
  that has been made for the Royal Society under his superin
  tendence, is doubtless superior to anything of the kind known
   in this country.                     -
      For the more certain verification of the accuracy and good
a
  ness of barometers intended for philosophical experiments,
  would it not be proper that
     time,     to

  comparison with this standard instrument?               from the ra
  pid advances and important discoveries that are now making
                                                                                as

                                          Meteorology, this seems
          as necessary            as                        the Obser
                                        is                                       to

  regularity       their rates, and thereby their fitness for ascer
                    of
  taining the longitude with certainty.
 I      will here just remark that                        p. on

any change like this, took place in the atmospheric pressure,
on the 17th of July last, over any part of the British isles.
And therefore, setting aside the relative situations of the two
places it must be inferred that either Mr. Weekes's baro
meter is extremely defective, or that the observations were
made without sufficient regard to accuracy, and for that rea
son are unfit for the purpose intended.
    I  have with great pleasure read Mr. Daniell's excellent
work, entitled “Meteorological Essays,” and in justice          I  can
truly say that great credit is due to that gentleman, for his        la
borious and scientific researches relative to meteorology:-
his valuable illustrations of the general laws and phaenomena
of our atmosphere;—his unremitted attention to the impro
ving and perfecting of the various instruments connected with
this branch of philosophy, entitle him to the highest praise
and thanks of all true lovers of science.                              . .
                    I remain, Gentlemen, yours truly,

  XLIII.      On the expected Occultation of Venus in February.
            -         By THoMAS SQUIRE, Esq.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine - and Annals    -        of
                              Philosophy.
      Gentlemen,
                                                remarks to his valu
 ONable  reading Mr. Baily's introductory
             list of moon-culminating stars,    he says, “You will
 observe that     I have inserted  Jupiter  and   Saturn, when they
are near the     moon,  and when their motion is retrograde; and
 also Venus on the day of her occultation in February.”
    Now with respect to the 6 of 2 and the D, on the morn
 ing of the 22nd of February, it appears from the result of com
 putations which      I made relative to this d, for Moore's Alma
 nack of the present year, that this will not prove to be an oc
 cultation at Greenwich.        For at the time of visible 3, (which
 happens at 33" after 9, apparent time,) the apparent latitude
 of 2 exceeds that of the moon 17' 57"; and if from this we
 take the sum of the apparent semidiameters of the moon and
 Venus, it will leave 1'29":4, for the distance of the N's north
 ern limb from the southern limb of Venus. But the nearest
 approximation in this respect will be 1/8":4, as seen from
 the Royal Observatory.                              - --         . ..     .
     Hence we may conclude that there will not only be no
 occultation at Greenwich, but that this will also be the case
 in every other part of England.
    It is to be hoped the atmosphere will prove favourable for
                                                            verifying

verifying the accuracy of the above calculations. Venus is at
this time approaching very near the point of her greatest elon
gation, and will pass the meridian about 32 minutes before
the time of visible conjunction, at an altitude of about 16° 51'
above the horizon of Greenwich.          Yours truly,

    -                 Capture   of the animal.
    The following short history of the circumstances under
which the animal was found, and of the mode of taking him,
is drawn up from accounts which were furnished to me either
directly or indirectly by persons concerned in his capture.
A boat party under the command of Messrs. Craygyman
and Fish, officers of the brig Mary Anne Sophia having
landed to procure water at a place called Ramboom near
Touraman, on the N.W. coast of Sumatra, on a spot where
there was much cultivated ground and but few trees, disco
vered on one of these a gigantic animal of the monkey tribé.
On the approach of the party he came to the ground, and when
pursued sought refuge in another tree at some distance, ex
hibiting as he moved, the appearance of a tall man-like figure
covered with shining brown hair, walking erect with a wad
dling gait, but sometimes accelerating his motion with his
hands, and occasionally impelling himself forward with the
bough of a tree. His motion on the ground was plainly not
his natural mode of progression, for even when assisted by
his hands or a stick, it was slow and vacillating: it was neces
sary to see him amongst trees in order to estimate his agi
lity and strength. On being driven to a small clump, he gained
by one spring a very lofty branch, and bounded from one
branch to another with the ease and alacrity of a common
monkey. Had the country been covered with wood, it would
;.
have been almost impossible to prevent his escape, as his mode
of travelling from one tree to another is described to be as
rapid as the progress of a swift horse.      Even amidst the few
trees that were on the spot, his movements were so quick that
it was very difficult to obtain a settled aim; and it was only by
cutting down one tree after another, that his pursuers by con
            within a very limited range, were enabled to destroy
him by several successive shots, some of which penetrated his
body and wounded his viscera.          Having received five balls,
his exertions  relaxed,  and  reclining  exhausted on one of the
branches of a tree, he vomited a considerable quantity of
blood. The ammunition of the hunters being by this time
expended, they were obliged to fell the tree in order to obtain
him, and did this in full confidence that his power was so far
gone that they could secure him without trouble, but were
astonished as the tree- was falling to see him - effect his retreat

      SKIN.—The skin itself is of a dark leaden colour. The hair
 is of a brownish red, but when observed at some distance, has
 a dull, and in some places an almost black appearance; but
 in a strong light it is of a light red. It is in     parts very long;                all
  on the fore-arm        directed
                              it   upwards;

 scanty, and gives the impression that these parts must have
 been comparatively bare.        Round the upper part         the back                                of

          The Barometer, Thermometer, and Winds were observed between
      9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, at which hour the temperature of
      the external air is nearly the same as the mean temperature. See
      column 3 and 8.
           The greatest altitude of the mercury in the barometer was on
      December 28th, 30-068 inches; the least, on the 14th November,

      some crystals belonging,                      I   believe, to a new species, which
      at his     suggestion          I  propose       to call Mohsite, in honour of Pro
      fessor Mohs.
           An    acute rhomboid of 73° 43' represented fig. 1. may be
      considered as the primitive form of this substance.                                         It does
      not yield to mechanical division in any direction, as far as                                            I
      could judge upon the small quantity had to examine.            I                                  The
      fracture is conchoidal and shining. It is brittle, but scratches
      glass very easily. It is opaque, iron black, and possesses a high

“Yet,” says Mr. Robberds, “the eastern valleys of Norfolk afford
throughout the whole of their extent those clear traces of the former
residence of the sea, which, M. De Luc here says, are not to be
found in any such districts; and the gradual retreat of             waters                         its              is

The author had examined it            as preserved in rum by Capt Sawyer.
In    several   characters this animal strongly resembles the Ophidian
  reptiles, especially in the formation of the jaws, which, with the ex
  ception of the apparent want of interarticular bones, are truly ser
  pentiform; and from this resemblance, after showing the dissimi
  litude of the animal from the genera to which it is nearest allied, in
  conjunction with the remarkable character afforded by the large
  sac with which it is provided, Dr. Harwood assigns to it the generic
  appellation of Ophiognathus, with the following generic character:
  Corpus nudum, lubricum, colubriforme, compressum, sacco amplo
 abdominali.
     Giving the specific name of ampullaceus to this animal, the author
 proceeds to describe it in detail. The specimen examined is about
 four feet six inches in length, is very slender, and the tail has a                                                fi
 lamentous termination occupying about 20 inches of the entire
 length of the animal; this begins at the termination of the dorsal
 fin, which, like      allthe other fins,     small. The colour
                                                        is                 purplish           is   a
 black, the filamentous portion            the tail being lighter than the rest.

of   their veins and     arteries,   capable         being  rendered objects

 microscopical examination by Mr. Bauer.
   The first fact discovered, was, that though              injection introduced     an
by the pulmonary artery was found                                                         by                      of

pulmonary veins; yet, when thrown                       the veins              by
                                                                       does not re                 it
turn by the arteries. The next fact ascertained, was, that the dis
tention      the air-cells produces
             of                              interruption between the arterial

and the venous circulation, the blood being carried                    further than                 no
the small arterial branches surrounding the air-cells.                  Sir Everard
next proceeds         describe the air-cells and parts surrounding them,
                             to
from drawings made by Mr. Bauer. The branches                       the pulmonary              of
artery accompanied                       by
                              larger and more numerous branches                  the                              of
pulmonary vein, are seen ramifying behind the internal membrane
of   each cell: the latter have valves             regular intervals, and there
                                                                     at
are numerous absorbents          supplied     also with valves.      The injection
was found         to
                  have  stopped    short        the termination of       the artery,                    of

    The conclusions deduced                               by

 collected by the author, amounting nearly to fifty, two-thirds are
 well known fossils of the oolite;—the remainder belonging to new
 species represented in the last numbers of the Mineral Concho
 logy. The plant of which the Brora coal appears to have been
formed, is identical with one of the most characteristic vegetables
 of the Yorkshire coast, but differs essentially from any of the
plants found in the coal measures beneath the new red-sandstone :—
 It has been formed into a new genus by Mr. König, and is described
by him in the present memoir, under the name of Oncylogonatum.
    The author, therefore, considers the Brora coal, from its asso
 ciated shells and plants, as the equivalent of that of the Eastern
 Moorlands of Yorkshire.                                                -

 perimental report on the late advances in magnetism, dependent on

 metals not magnetic in the ordinary sense of the word, i. e. exerting
 no action upon the magnetic needle when merely placed in                  vici                                      its

    It may be remarked, that the time of the year is the most unfa
vourable to the work of the engines; as from the abundance of water
in the mines, many are pushed beyond their most advantageous
rate.

depth of 100 fathoms by ditto.
    Duty of the best stamping engines, rotatory, double, 15 millions
lifted i foot high, by each bushel of coals.
    Note.—The monthly report of the duty of steam engines in
Cornwall, is taken and computed by Messrs. John and Thomas
Lean, who are specially appointed and paid for that purpose by
the adventurers in the mines, whose object is to obtain a correct
comparative statement, by which they may ascertain the merits of
the respective engines, and may judge of the skill and care of the
engineers they employ.
    Messrs. Leans have the custody of the keys of the counters on
the engines, they themselves measure the capacity and lengths of
the pumps, and they receive the returns of the quantity of coals

  able.   These parts cannot be shown in a drawing on a small
  scale.
     The arrangements which are more especially novel in this
 engine are, the mode of combining the effect of the cylinders,
 and the carrying the piston rods through both ends of the
 cylinders.
    The horizontal position affords a facility of concentrating
 the power derived from even 4 or 6 cylinders upon one point,
 and the carrying the piston rods through both ends of the
 cylinders has the effect of preventing the weight of the piston
 from producing unequal friction, owing to the state of tension
 in which the rods are constantly kept.
    It is obvious that with an engine thus constructed, the
power may be divided and applied at each end; or it may be
directed wholly to one end, by attaching at the opposite ex
tremity a balance bob, or beam with a weight equal, to half
 the power of the engine.
    A common pumping engine with a beam requires that the
 engine-house should be built close to the mouth of the shaft
in which the pumps are placed, which is often attended with
much inconvenience. The engine above described may be
merely covered by a shed, and this placed at any convenient
distance from the shaft.       As mining engines are often re
moved from one situation to another, the greater the facility
of fixing them, and the less masonry required, the more will
time    .#  expense be saved.
    The  engine  which  I have described, with three others built
in Cornwall under the superintendence of Mr. Woolf, and a
complete out-fit of founders’, engineers', and millwrights’ tools,
implements, &c., also saw-mills and stamping-mills, were
shipped on board the Melpomene, at Falmouth, on the 30th
of March 1825, and arrived off the coast of Mexico the 27th
of May following.
    The Castle of St. Juan de Ulloa, which commands the
harbour of Vera Cruz, being at that time in the possession of
the Spaniards, the cargo was obliged to be landed on the
beach at Mocambo, a league to the southward, which could
not be accomplished until the 10th of June, when the setting
                     .
in of the rains, and of the unhealthy season on the coast, oc
casioned great suffering and the death of some of the trans
port party. These circumstances prevented the machinery
being carried further than Santa Fé, which is about four
 miles from the coast.
    Here Lieut. Colquhoun of the Royal Artillery, who had
taken the charge            most arduous enterprise, remained to
recruit the health and     strength of the party under his com

In the January following the great bulk of the machinery was
forwarded by different convoys to a depôt on the table-land
near Jalapa; and on March 31st, a train of 52 waggons, car

  246      Mr. George's Analysis of a    Sulphuretted  Water
 the boring by a casing     of iron pipes descending into     a solid
  stratum of shale.

     Specific gravity 1-00155.
     The water when taken from the spring appears clear and
 sparkling, has a considerable sulphuretted odour, slightly blues
 reddened litmus; reddens turmeric; with solution of soap
 gives a very slight curdy precipitate. Lime-water occasions a
 precipitate both before and after ebullition.       Oxalate of am
 monia no precipitate; in the concentrated water a slight cloudi
 ness.    Nitrate of barytes, a precipitate; the addition of a few
 drops of nitric acid removed nearly the whole with efferves
                                                                j.
 cence. Nitrate of silver, a precipitate with an immediate slight
 discoloration. Ferrocyanate of potash, no precipitate, nor an
 change of colour. Acetate of lead, a copious precipitate
 a brown tinge, before boiling,-a colourless precipitate after
 ebullition.
     Nitro-muriate of platinum does not occasion any precipitate
 in the concentrated water after boiling. The concentrated
 water possesses a strong alkaline taste, and deeply reddens
 turmeric paper: not the slightest cloudiness was perceptible
 after boiling the water twenty minutes with the addition of
 carbonate of soda.       Phosphate of soda gave no indication of
 magnesia.
       he action of tests shows that sulphuretted hydrogen exists
in a gaseous state, that the carbonate, muriate, and sulphate
 of an alkali are present, and that the alkali is soda; that the
 water does not contain any metallic salt, any muriate of lime,
 or any salt of magnesia.
                           Gaseous contents.
    Having ascertained     the gases contained in the water to be
sulphuretted hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, oxygen and
azote;—a wine gallon of the water was boiled in a proper ap
paratus, and gave out 12 cubic inches of gas.-The experiment
was repeated several times with the same result.
    1. To ascertain the amount of sulphuretted hydrogen, ex
                        .
posed a cubic inch of the gas, contained in a graduated glass
tube, to contact, by very gentle agitation, with carbonate of
lead; (obtained by precipitating [the carbonate of lead] from a
solution of acetate of lead by carbonate of ammonia as directed
by Dr. Henry, in his excellent paper “On the analysis of coal
   as”) 0:22 of a cubic inch was absorbed. Having thus separated
the sulphuretted hydrogen, agitated the residue in a solution
of caustic potash, a            diminution of 0°18 of a cubic inch
of carbonic acid gas took place.                            -

    2. 0-33 of a cubic inch of the gas, (after the separation of
the sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid gases,) was mixed
with 0-60 of a cubic inch of nitrous gas: an absorption of 0-10
took place, indicating 0.025 of oxygen gas; and in 1 cubic
inch of the gas from the water, 0.045 of oxygen gas.
    3. On firing 0-5 of a cubic inch of the unabsorbable gases
with 0-575 of oxygen, the carbonic acid produced was 0.20,
and the oxygen that had disappeared 0-897; approximatin
so closely to the quantity of carbonic acid gas produced,                                                .#
of oxygen gas consumed during the detonation of the carbu
 retted hydrogen gas from stagnant pools, that the composi
 tion of the gases may be considered the same; and since that
 gas produces          its
                    own bulk                of
                                  carbonic acid, the carburetted
 hydrogen contained        0-50     the gas will

the small parcel of air is less than in the quiescent state,
the elasticity will be greater on the second supposition than
on the first, on account of the extrication of heat; but, when
ever the bulk is greater than in the quiescent state, the elasti
city will be less on the second supposition than on the first,
 on account of the cold produced by the absorption of heat.
 Now the accelerating forces of the aërial particles are the dif
 ferences between their actual elasticity and the elasticity of
 the quiescent medium; and as these forces are always greater
 on the second supposition than on the first, the velocity of
 the undulation must be swifter in that case than in this. The
 formula of Newton, being deduced from the law of Boyle and
 Mariotte, is consonant to the first supposition; and there is
 undoubtedly in the second supposition a tendency to diminish
 the difference between theory and experiment, by increasing
 the estimate of the velocity of sound.            One circumstance how
 ever, it may be alleged, must in some degree modify the effect
 of the variations of heat in the agitated air; namely, the ra
 pidity with which the small increments and decrements of free
 heat would be equalized to the temperature of the surrounding
 medium. But the whole time of an aerial vibration is ex
  tremely short; and we may safely consider every change of
  volume that takes place during                            its
                                               progress, and every varia

 stration:—The velocity of sound is equal to the velocity accord
ing to Newton's formula, multiplied by the square root of the
proportion of the specific heat of air under a constant pres
sure, to the specific heat under a constant volume.      The                                    in
vestigation was first given in the Conn. des Tems 1825, and af
terwards in the xiith book of the Mécanique Céleste.        This
theorem left   nothing  more to be done than to find a certain
ratio in numbers; and this was accomplished by the ingenious
experiment of MM. Clement and Desormes, from which we
have deduced the proportion of the latent, to the free, heat,
when air varies under a constant pressure. MM. Gay-Lussac
and Welter improved a little the original procedure of the                                      in
ventors, and repeated the experiment in a great variety of cir
cumstances; by which means they not only determined the
number sought more exactly, but they likewise showed that
it was constant, or nearly so, in considerable diversity of tem
perature and pressure. The result of this long investigation,
protracted for so many years, was a complete solution of the
difficulty, and a satisfactory reconcilement of the theoretical,
with the experimental, estimate of the velocity of sound.
   The numerical value of the proportion indicated in Laplace's
theorem is immediately deducible from what has been shown
respecting the manner in which heat combines with elastic
fluids.   When air varies under a constant pressure, the ab
solute heat requisite to produce the rise of temperature r, is
r + i, i being the latent heat. But t is the heat that causes
an equal rise of temperature when the volume is constant.
It is manifest therefore that the proportion of the two specific
heats in the theorem,            is r +       i   to r,     or   1   + + to      1,    that     is,
1          to   1:   and             +        is   the factor        by   which the        New

     The equation (D)   does not coincide with what is elsewhere
given for expressing the relation of the same quantities.    It is
different from the equation published by M. Poisson in the
Conn. des Tems 1826, p. 264.         In order to clear away all
clouds of   obscurity from a matter of considerable importance,
I  shall now examine particularly, what it is that occasions the
difference.   For this purpose I shall set out from M. Poisson's
equation (6), p. 263, viz.
                                    w   = (k      -    1) (1    +      2   3)    +.

   It must not, however, be imagined that the damage arising
from the inadvertency that has been noticed, is ruinously great.
The formulae obtained are true to quantities of the second
order with respect to 2 and 3. They are sufficiently exact
for investigating the velocity of sound; and they can hardly
lead to any error of moment in any practical inquiry.          But it
is always   best to  square   our  speculations  according  to expe
rience and the laws     actually followed in  nature; and, in a case

   If we place    in a vertical position the sides of a (glass) vessel
W,     formed of two equal
 parallel circular planes,                         -   t
 held together by a rim
 R, perpendicular to the
 planes, the surface of
 contact of the incom
 pressible fluid (or liquid),
 with the superincumbent
 elastic fluid, together fill
 ing the vessel, will be sen
 sibly a horizontal plane.
 A vertical plane passing
‘in the direction of the
 centres    of the circles,
 (through their vertices
 and that of the rim,) will U.
 divide at right angles a
 straight line Ll, drawn on this horizontal surface parallel to
 the circles, into two equal parts.      The vertex or zenith v of
 the circumference of either circle or the rim will therefore be
 the point of bisection of such part of the arc of either as is
 situated above this horizontal surface.
    Having marked this zenith-point, if the vessel be made to
 describe in a vertical plane, any part of a revolution about
 the horizontal line or axis C, passing through the centres of
 the circles, the mark moving along with the vessel, will pass
 Qver an equal arc of revolution. The zenith-distance of a
 straight line drawn from the mark, which we will now call v.
 to C, will therefore be equal to that arc or to the angle formed
 by the intersection at C of this straight line, and a vertical
 line passing through the new zenith-point of the rim, &c. found
 by bisecting, as before, the arch of the rim, &c. now extended
 over the horizontal surface Ll.
    When the interior of the rim is perfectly circular, the arc
 passed over (or zenith-distance of v) may be measured at
 once on   its graduated parallel exterior.     But should the figure
of   the rim     be

aspect of calcareous spar : the latter are colourless and trans
parent, and are doubly refractive in a high degree: in respect
of hardness, this substance is between the two above men
tioned. Spec. grav. 1928, 1950; but that of the remarkably
brilliant and solid crystal above figured, was found by my
friend S. L. Kent to be 1990.        It is extremely brittle; is ea
sily reduced to a grayish powder; the cross fracture is con
choidal, and the surfaces produced by it are of a vitreous lus
tre.   The crystals are neither phosphorescent by friction, nor
electric by heat; nor does any phosphorescence appear if the
powder be thrown on a live coal.        When exposed to heat in
a  matrass, it decrepitates slightly  and becomes opaque: de
crepitation continues until it has acquired a red heat; if then
subjected to the flame of the blowpipe, it melts rapidly into
an opaque globule, which once formed, is infusible; and which
if placed on the tongue when it is cold, has a decidedly alka
line taste. In nitric acid it dissolves with brisk effervescence,
and if then left to spontaneous evaporation, fine crystals of ni
trate of soda are formed, floating in a solution of nitrate of
                                                                                    º

successful.  The divers told me that there are other and infe
rior strata of urao and mud alternating to a depth which they
could only reach by extraordinary exertions. The urao is
used by the natives to give pungency to their tobacco, by
steeping it in a solution.   Smoking cigars thus prepared pro
duces soreness of the mouth, really amounting to a slight sa
livation. The inhabitants in the vicinity of the lake use a pre
paration of this salt worked into a paste, with tobacco, and
which they call chimo, carrying it in a small box slung round
the neck, and occasionally rubbing the nauseous mixture upon
the gums and tongue, a practice which appears to be of                                               In

LVII.     On the Geology of East Norfolk; with Remarks upon
   the  Hypothesis  of Mr. Robberds, respecting the former Level
    of the German Ocean. By R. C. TAYLoR, Esq. F.G.S.
                           [With Engravings.]
To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of
       Gentlemen,             Philosophy.
THE        district
       Robberds's
                    which is the subject of examination in Mr.
                    “Geological and Historical Observations on
the Eastern Vallies of Norfolk,” noticed in your last Number,
having particularly occupied my attention, a perusal of the
work has induced me to send you some remarks on this            in
quiry, and on the validity of the conclusions which the         in
genious author has adopted.
    Mr. Robberds shows that these valleys, which are now for
the most part solid and productive land, yielding rich pas.
turage to many thousand head of cattle, were “at no very
distant period, arms of the sea, navigated by our forefathers.”
    The proofs of this change are arranged under two heads:
 Physical and Historical.
    Under the first class are enumerated the connection between
 the valleys and the German Ocean; the resemblance which
their outline bears to the forms generally exhibited by aestu
 aries and inlets of the sea; and the remains of marine shells
 and exuviae discoverable along their margins, at the elevation
 of 40 feet. These beds of shells are stated to have the fol
 lowing striking and peculiar characters.
    “1st. None of them, except a few casual specimens, belong to
                            -

    any extinct or even rare species; but they consist entirely of
    the littoral shells, which now abound in the German Ocean,
   and are constantly met with on               shores    its              or
                                                                 the aestuaries     in
   into which its tidal waters flow.”
       “2d. Many            them, particularly the Buccina, are still
   very perfect, and            in of
                             excellent preservation. 3d. The beds are
   found      atvarious  places,   and uniformly          the same height at                             of
    40   feet. 4th.    They    appear,       most  instances,

   table substances resembling.fuci, fragments                 coal, &c.        of
       From these      physical    circumstances the       following    conclu
  sions are drawn:—
       1st. The shells found either below the soil that fills these
  basins,        or   on
                    the sides        the surrounding hills, are unques
                                           of
  tionably marine; they were therefore deposited                    the waters           by
  of the sea.
      2d. They contain                   no
                                 exuviae that are peculiar            the older           to
  strata, but all resemble those                     of
                                            the testaceous molluscae now
 found     in  the neighbouring ocean; therefore the sea,                whose                 by
 waters these deposits were formed, was the German Ocean.
      3d. These beds of shells and other coincident traces of an
 ancient beach are found about                        40
                                               feet above the present sur

 man Ocean once flowed up, and permanently occupied this
 valley    at  that elevation.                -
      4th. The valleys          the Bure and Waveney are upon the
                                      of

  valleys and the sea, forming the hundred of Lothingland,
  still retains its name of the Island.
     A.D. 1004, Sweyn, as the Saxon Chronicle states, “came
  with his fleet to Norwich,” which he plundered and burned.
  From the circumstance of this fleet proceeding so far as thirty
 miles into the interior, it is inferred that this could not have
 been effected in safety within the ordinary channel of the Yare,
 but that the whole valley was at that time navigable.
     Domesday-book is the next historical document which sup
 plies certain proofs of the sea having entered into the eastern
 valleys.     These proofs exist in the salinae, or saltworks, which
 are enumerated in many parishes, now distant from the ocean.

at some distant period.                      In summing up, Mr. Robberds con
ceives that the sea once filled the interior valleys to the height
of 40 feet, as marked by the ancient shells;–that the tides
flowed at an elevation of 10 or 12 feet, at Burgh Castle, du
ring the Roman occupation of that fort:-that at the Norman
Conquest they were only about six feet high:-that there have
been in every succeeding century, fewer and less extensive                                             in
undations of fresh-water in these valleys:—that old navigators
observe within their remembrance, a sensible lowering of the
waters in the present channels;—and        that     these circum                all
stances combine         mark  to                “a
                                  progressive depression       the                               in
level     of
         the adjacent sea.”—“The rate           which this change          at
has proceeded, might probably                              be
                                       calculated with mathema
tical precision;  the data are rather uncertain, but they seem
to indicate that the level    the sea has been regularly fallin
                                             of
about eight      or
                nine inches   every hundred years, which woul
                                        of in
carry back the period                            its
                                 greatest elevation      about six                     to
thousand   years  ago.”
   Such are the inferences which the observation of Mr. Rob
                                   form. He proposes hereafter
                                            to

assumes the appearance of a gray sandstone; in others the
shells are detected in an extremely hard clay-stone; but                          in
stances occasionally occur where organic remains are alto
gether wanting.
   In remarking upon the absence, at Bramerton, of a parti
cular shell, which is met with among the crag fossils of Har
wich, Mr. Robberds considers that this circumstance alone is
fatal to the opinion entertained by me, of the continuity of the
formation.      But it must be remarked, that it is characteristic
of the shells and other organic bodies deposited with the crag;
that they are by no means diffused in equal numbers and pro
portions throughout, as in some older strata; but occur at                        in
tervals, in groups and genera.         Thus at Cromer the predo
minant and remarkable shells are       Mactra;   at Runton, Cardiae;
nearer Cley, Murex striatus; at Bawdesey cliff, Murer re
versus, and Pectunculus; at the Beacon, Venus acqualis; at Felix
 Stow, Pectunculus and Voluta Lamberti; south of Languard
 Cottage, Murea contrarius, Cardiac, and Mya lata: at Bramer
 ton and near Norwich are Murea striatus, Tellinae and Ba
lani. The absence, therefore, of one or of many species from
any of these localities, cannot weaken the remaining concur
 rent evidences that identify this formation, nor can it lead to
 the confounding it with any other.
   The shells of Bramerton, and other parts of the Norwich
valley, consequently, belong to the crag formation, and are
not an assemblage simply of the recent species which abound
in our seas, although they are mixed with many that closely
resemble the existing varieties.
   Mr. William Smith, than whom a better practical authority
on this question cannot be quoted, states that “through Nor
folk the crag shells     lie         to,   or   contact with the top
                                                 on in

sustained,—that the shells          far from being stratified, form
                                     so

  286      Mr. R. C. Taylor  on the Geology   of East Norfolk.
  So abundant are these animal remains on the oyster banks op
  posite Happisburgh, that they are frequently drawn up in nets.
      Further arguments in proof of identity and general con
  tinuity,+the two great facts which it was essential to establish,
  as applied to this formation and the theory of Mr. Robberds,
  —are, it is presumed, unnecessary.       The supposed course of
  the crag formation across Norfolk and Suffolk is traced in Sec
  tion  III.
      Some notices of the prevalence of fossil bones upon the
 eastern coast have appeared in the Philosophical Magazine, and
  Geological Transactions.     To those enumerated might now
 be added    many  subsequent discoveries.    I am happy in having
 been instrumental in attracting the attention of several ob
 servers to these phaenomena.       Since the year 1822, many    in
 teresting well-preserved specimens have been collected upon
 the beach between Winterton and Cromer, where heretofore
 they continued unregarded. It is useless to occupy these
 pages with a detail of localities; for in fact, traces are discerni
 ble at every mile.    By far the greater number of specimens
 have been derived    by means of the fishermen: a circumstance
 that confirms the opinion before given, that a considerable ac
 cumulation exists on some of the outer banks off this coast.
 Viewing these scattered fragments         as the relics of those
 animals who once inhabited the surface of the upper marine

      A  detailed account of these deposits cannot but be in
 structive, and will be best supplied by those who have frequent
opportunities for observation.      There is some reason to hope
that this information will be furnished by a reverend gentle
man of East Norfolk, who possesses ample materials, and the
ability to promote the science of which he is an admirer.
     Let me be permitted to add here one word on the services
which the establishment of a provincial museum at Norwich
has already rendered, by furthering the progress of local geo
logical discovery, by increasing the number of labourers in
the field of science, and by furnishing a public depository of
those interesting objects, which illustrate the structure and
former condition of the surrounding district, and attest the
revolutions to which it has been subjected.

appearance through every modification of woody clay and
gravel, peat and beds of forest trees, that it is often difficult
to determine whether their real position be above or beneath
the crag. Certainly, near Cromer, the trees are a few feet
above the crag stratum, and are about the level of high water.
   Perhaps the most probable conclusions, to be derived from
a consideration of all these circumstances, are these:—
   That after the formation of the chalk, the waters deposited
the marine exuviae, and gave existence, during the long period
in which they occupied that portion of the former surface, to
those remarkable accumulations of crag shells which we now
witness.
   That the trees and vegetables covered various parts of the
surface  of this new formation after it had become consolidated.
   That in this state, these woodland tracts afforded shelter and
support to certain animals, whose traces we find both amongst
the vegetable deposits      and in the drifted heaps         containing
marine substances.
   Finally: All were buried in one common catastrophe. The
same eruption of the waters that overthrew the pines and
forest trees, destroyed the herbivorous animals, and buried
the crag shells, beneath the ruins of more ancient strata.

dividuals, who nobly sacrifice a great portion of their time

former period.

your indefatigable President, who, agreeably to the Regula
tions of the Society, resigns the chair this day.               Much of the
time and labour of the computers, engaged in this extensive
work, was saved, and the liability to error very much abridged,
by the use of printed skeleton forms, which he had constructed
expressly for their use from formulae reduced to the most
simple and convenient shape for calculation. The work itself
has been brought to a successful termination by the extraor
dinary diligence, activity and perseverance of Lieut. Stratford,
of the Royal Navy, one of your Secretaries; who, in the midst
of his other various avocations and duties, has been unremit
ting in his attention to promote the progress and secure the
accuracy of this highly useful work; and who is entitled to
your best and most cordial thanks for such a devotion of his
time and labour. In fact, the Council, desirous of expressing
their sense of the benefit conferred on the science of Astro
nomy by this important undertaking, have awarded the gold
medal to Mr. Baily; and the silver medal to Lieut. Stratford,
for the service rendered by these gentlemen in the promotion
 and completion of the work.               May we hope that some ex
perienced astronomer will now take up this new catalogue,
 and make a series of observations on every star contained
 therein, whereby we may be enabled to ascertain more cor
 rectly the proper motion (if any) that should be attributed to
 each star: and thus deduce a Fundamental Catalogue that
 may assist astronomers for many years to come. The ex
 pense of computing and printing this Catalogue has encroach
 ed on the ordinary funds of the Society; and has induced
  many members to suggest the propriety and advantage of de

     The Council, bearing in mind the objects which it is the
 wish and desire of the Society more particularly to promote,
 have also awarded the silver medal to Col. Beaufoy for his valu
 able collection of observations communicated from time to time
 to this Society, and more especially those relative to the Eclipses
  of Jupiter's Satellites. Part of this collection has already been
  published in the Memoirs of this Society; and the remainder
  will appear in the ensuing volume. These observations seem

assumes the appearance of a gray sandstone; in others the
shells are detected in an extremely hard clay-stone; but                            in
stances occasionally occur where organic remains are alto
gether wanting.
   In remarking upon the absence, at Bramerton, of a parti
cular shell, which is met with among the crag fossils of Har
wich, Mr. Robberds considers that this circumstance alone is
fatal to the opinion entertained by me, of the continuity of the
formation.      But it must be remarked, that it is characteristic
of the shells and other organic bodies deposited with the crag;
that they are by no means diffused in equal numbers and pro
portions throughout, as in some older strata; but occur at                          in
tervals, in groups and genera.         Thus at Cromer the predo
minant and remarkable shells are Mactra: ; at Runton, Cardiae;
nearer Cley, Murer striatus; at Bawdesey cliff, Murer re
versus, and Pectunculus; at the Beacon, Venus acqualis; at Felix
 Stow, Pectunculus and Voluta Lamberti, south of Languard
 Cottage, Murer contrarius, Cardiac, and Mya lata: at Bramer
 ton and near Norwich are Murex striatus, Tellinae and Ba
lani. The absence, therefore, of one or of many species from
any of these localities, cannot weaken the remaining concur
 rent evidences that identify this formation, nor can it lead to
the confounding it with any other.
   The shells of Bramerton, and other parts of the Norwich
valley, consequently, belong to the crag formation, and are
not an assemblage simply of the recent species which abound
in our seas, although they are mixed with many that closely
resemble the existing varieties.
   Mr. William Smith, than whom a better practical authority
on this question cannot be quoted, states that “through Nor
folk the crag shells     lie         to,   or    contact with the top

     Further arguments in proof of identity and general con

 —are, it is presumed, unnecessary.        The supposed course of
 the crag formation across Norfolk and Suffolk is traced in Sec
 tion III.
     Some notices of the prevalence of fossil bones upon the
 eastern coast have appeared in the Philosophical Magazine, and
 Geological Transactions.      To those enumerated might now
 be added   many  subsequent  discoveries.    I am happy in having
 been instrumental in attracting the attention of several ob
 servers to these phaenomena. , Since the year 1822, many in
 teresting well-preserved specimens have been collected upon
 the beach between Winterton and Cromer, where heretofore
 they continued unregarded. It is useless to occupy these
 pages with a detail of localities; for in fact, traces are discerni
 ble at every mile. By far the greater number of specimens
 have been derived by means of the fishermen: a circumstance
 that confirms the opinion before given, that a considerable ac
 cumulation exists on some of the outer banks off this coast.        ;

     A detailed account of these deposits cannot but be          in
structive, and will be best supplied by those who have frequent
opportunities for observation.      There is some reason to hope
that this information will be furnished by a reverend gentle
man of East Norfolk, who possesses ample materials, and the
ability to promote the science of which he is an admirer.
    Let me be permitted to add here one word on the services
which the establishment of a provincial museum at Norwich
has already rendered, by furthering the progress of local geo
logical discovery, by increasing the number of labourers in
the field of science, and by furnishing a public depository of
those interesting objects, which illustrate the structure and
former condition of the surrounding district, and attest the
revolutions to which it has been subjected.

appearance through every modification of woody clay and
gravel, peat and beds of forest trees, that it is often difficult
to determine whether their real position be above or beneath
the crag.      Certainly, near Cromer, the trees are a few feet
above the    crag stratum, and are about the level of high water.
   Perhaps the most probable conclusions, to be derived from
a consideration of all these circumstances, are these:—
   That after the formation of the chalk, the waters deposited
the marine exuviae, and gave existence, during the long period
in which they occupied that portion of the former surface, to
those remarkable accumulations of crag shells which we now
witness.                           -
   That the trees and vegetables covered various parts of the
surface of this new formation after it had become consolidated.
   That in this state, these woodland tracts afforded shelter and
support to certain animals, whose traces we find both amongst
the vegetable deposits and in the drifted heaps containing
marine substances.
   Finally: All were buried in one common catastrophe. The
same eruption of the waters that overthrew the pines and
forest trees, destroyed the herbivorous animals, and buried
the crag shells, beneath the ruins of more ancient strata.

your indefatigable President, who, agreeably to the Regula
tions of the Society, resigns the chair this day.              Much of the
time and labour of the computers, engaged in this extensive
work, was saved, and the liability to error very much abridged,
by the use of printed skeleton forms, which he had constructed
expressly for their use from formulae reduced to the most
simple and convenient shape for calculation. The work itself
has been brought to a successful termination by the extraor
dinary diligence, activity and perseverance of Lieut. Stratford,
of the Royal Navy, one of your Secretaries; who, in the midst
of his other various avocations and duties, has been unremit
ting in his attention to promote the progress and secure the
accuracy of this highly useful work; and who is entitled to
your best and most cordial thanks for such a devotion of his
time and labour.         In fact, the Council, desirous of expressing
their sense of the benefit conferred on the science of Astro
nomy by this important undertaking, have awarded the gold
medal to     Mr. Baily; and the silver medal to Lieut. Stratford,
for the service rendered by these gentlemen in the promotion
and completion of the work.               May we hope that some ex
perienced astronomer will now take up this new catalogue,
 and make a series of observations on every star contained
therein, whereby we may be enabled to ascertain more cor
 rectly the proper motion (if any) that should be attributed to
 each star: and thus deduce a Fundamental Catalogue that
 may assist astronomers for many years to come.                      The ex
 pense of computing and printing this Catalogue has encroach
 ed on the ordinary funds of the Society; and has induced
 many members to suggest the propriety and advantage of de
 fraying the expense not only of this, but of any similar under
 taking, by means of a separate subscription amongst the mem
 bers. Should a measure of this kind be recommended, the
 Council trust that it will meet with the support of every friend
 of Science”.
     The Council, bearing in mind the objects which it is the
 wish and desire of the Society more particularly to promote,
 have also awarded the silver medal to Col. Beaufoy for his valu
 able collection of observations communicated from time to time
 to this Society, and more especially those relative to the Eclipses
 of Jupiter's Satellites. Part of this collection has already been
 published in the Memoirs of this Society; and the remainder
 will appear in the ensuing volume. These observations seem
 to have been made with great care and diligence, and afford

 at the public observatories: the state of the weather, or more

 state  of knowledge, he appears to have relied entirely on his
own    resources,  and drawn little from others,) as less connected
with astronomy, it is not necessary here to speak. He died at
a premature age: his death being accelerated, it is said, by the
unwholesome nature of the processes employed in his glass
house; leaving behind him a reputation rarely if ever attained
by one so young.                                        -
    Of M. Piazzi and his labours, it will also be interesting to
the Society to receive a concise account, as this distinguished
individual furnishes another example, in addition to the many
already upon record, of the power of genius to deliver a man
from pursuits for which he had no taste, and to carry him
successfully through others, to promote which he was richly
qualified”. Piazzi was born at Ponte in the Walteline, July 16th
1746, and died at Naples, July 22d 1826.              Early in life he
was devoted to a religious order denominated the Théatins, at
Milan.       But, after various changes, he in 1780 accepted the
appointment of Professor of the Higher Mathematics in the
Academy of Palermo: and from that time, entirely devoted
himself to science.                                         -
    In  a few years he obtained the confidence and favour of the
 Prince of Caramanico, viceroy of Sicily, by whose permission
and assistance he founded an observatory at Palermo. With
a view to open an intercourse with astronomers, and to obtain
valuable instruments for his observatory, he visited England,
where he formed an intimacy with Maskelyne, Herschel, Vince,
and Ramsden. From the last of these he obtained some very
excellent instruments, and, amongst the rest, the Altitude and
Azimuth instrument, with which his principal observations
were made.        From this time Piazzi cherished a warm attach
ment both to the English and to their language; and to the
latest period of his life continued to evince the same esteem.
 While he was in England, Piazzi observed at Greenwich,
 in conjunction with Maskelyne, the solar eclipse of June 3d
 1788.     He also collected the corresponding observations of
eighteen different astronomers in various parts of Europe, and
deduced from them the differences in longitude of the several
observatories from that of Greenwich.          The results he pub
lished in the    Philosophical  Transactions for 1789 (vol. lxxix);
and the circumstance is here recorded, as this paper is under
 stood to be M. Piazzi's earliest production as an astronomer.
 In 1789 he commenced with great activity, his labours in his
new observatory, then the most southern which existed in
Europe; that at Malta having been recently destroyed by fire.

 state of knowledge, he appears to have relied entirely on his
 own resources, and drawn little from others,) as less connected
 with astronomy, it is not necessary here to speak. He died at
 a premature age: his death being accelerated, it is said, by the
unwholesome nature of the processes employed in his glass
house; leaving behind him a reputation rarely if ever attained
by one so young.                                           -
    Of M. Piazzi and his labours, it will also be interesting to
the Society to receive a concise account, as this distinguished
individual furnishes another example, in addition to the many
already upon record, of the power of genius to deliver a man
from pursuits for which he had no taste, and to carry him
successfully through others, to promote which he was richly
qualified”. Piazzi was born at Ponte in the Walteline, July 16th
 1746, and died at Naples, July 22d 1826.               Early in life he
 was devoted to a religious order denominated the Théatins, at
Milan.      But, after various changes, he in 1780 accepted the
appointment of Professor of the Higher Mathematics in the
Academy of Palermo: and from that time, entirely devoted
himself to science.                                            -
    In a few years he obtained the confidence and favour of the
 Prince of Caramanico, viceroy of Sicily, by whose permission
and assistance he founded an observatory at Palermo. With
a view to open an intercourse with astronomers, and to obtain
valuable instruments for his observatory, he visited England,
where he formed an intimacy with Maskelyne, Herschel, Vince,
and Ramsden. From the last of these he obtained some very
excellent instruments, and, amongst the rest, the Altitude and
Azimuth instrument, with which his principal observations
were made.       From this time Piazzi cherished a warm attach
ment both to the English and to their language; and to the
latest period of his life continued to evince the same esteem.
 While he was in England, Piazzi observed at Greenwich,
in conjunction with Maskelyne, the solar eclipse of June 3d
 1788.    He also collected the corresponding observations of
eighteen different astronomers in various parts of Europe, and
deduced from them the differences in longitude of the several
observatories from that of Greenwich.            The results he pub
lished in the   Philosophical      Transactions for 1789 (vol. lxxix);
and the circumstance is here recorded, as this paper is under
stood to be M. Piazzi's earliest production as an astronomer.
In 1789 he commenced with great activity, his labours in his
new observatory, then the most southern which existed in
Europe; that at Malta having been recently destroyed by fire.

298                              Astronomical Society.
   On the 1st of January 1801 he discovered the planet Ceres.
The principal circumstances of that discovery, being well
known to astronomers, need not be detailed here. But it is due
to the character of this distinguished individual, to state, that
when the king of Naples announced his intention of perpe
tuating the event by the circulation of a gold medal among
 European observers, Piazzi, whose modesty and zeal were
equal to his merit, requested the monarch to assign the pro
posed value of the medals to the purchase of an equatorial,
which he thought was greatly needed in his observatory. In
 1803 he published the result of a labour of twelve years, un
dertaken with a view to determine the mean position of the
principal stars; for this work he received the medal from the
 Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. In 1814 was published
 M. Piazzi's New Catalogue, from which it appeared that this
indefatigable astronomer had actually extended his researches
to 7646 stars! Early in 1817 M. Piazzi published his Lessons
on Astronomy, and the same year he was called to Naples, to
put into activity the new observatory established on the heights
of Capo-di-Monte. Cacciatore (now also one of the Associates
of this Society) has from that time taken the charge of the ob
servatory at Palermo ; and by his zeal and assiduity is emu
lating the conduct of his predecessor.
   The subsequent labours of this indefatigable astronomer,
are as universally known as they are highly appreciated,
throughout Europe. The grand work, however, to which we
have already adverted (the Catalogue of 7646 stars) will ever
remain a monument of his superior activity and perseverance,
as long as the science endures.        This important work far ex
ceeds  every   thing  of the kind that has preceded                  it;
                                                             and shows

                                        one individual.
   The will            of
                  this eminent astronomer furnishes          new proofa
of of
    his cordial desire           to

The Council have, indeed, in some of their former Reports,
ventured to suggest several points as more particularly worthy
of the attention of the Members, but it must be obvious to
every one, that these are a few only of the desiderata in Astro
nomy; and that many others will suggest themselves to every
skilful and intelligent observer.

   March 9.—At this meeting there was read, a “ Notice respecting
some errors common to many tables of logarithms," by C. Babbage,
Esq. Foreign Secretary of this Society.      Mr. Babbage having lately
printed a stereotype table of the logarithms of the natural numbers
for the use of the Trigonometrical Survey in Ireland, for the sake of
greater accuracy subjected them to eight readings and comparisons
with other tables. This cautious process led to the detection of va.
rious errors, which are common to almost all the tables; those of
Vega, the last impressions of Callet, and Mr. Babbage's own tables,
being  allthat he  has found free from the errors which      he
                                                              specifies.
The tables subjected      this examination, were those

 the errors which he has detected can only be attributed to the uni
 versal system of copying which prevails in such works.
        The numbers and         correct logarithms to seven places are as                       below:

 From these the several tables specified                   may readily be corrected.
        Mr. Babbage knowing that there was in the Library of the Royal
  Society a table of logarithms printed in the Chinese character, and
 which exhibits no indication or acknowledgement of                  being copied   its
 from another    work,  was   naturally    desirous     compare  to    with Euro     it
 pean tables. On doing so,                   he
                                         found that        the six cases above
                                                                  in
 noted, errors occurred precisely                  the European tables; thus
                                                   as   in
 furnishing       an
                 irresistible  proof  that the Chinese tables have             Eu               an
 ropean origin.

      Feb. 15.-Sir R. R. Wyvan, Bart. M.P., and Caesar Moreau, Esq.,
   were respectively admitted Fellows of the Society; and the following
   papers were read:                                           -
      South Polar Distances of Stars included within the tropic of
   Capricorn; observed in the months of May and June 1822; re
   duced to their mean places for January 1823: with other astrono
   mical observations: by C. Rumker, Esq.
      This paper consists of 1. A Catalogue of the south polar distances
  of about 204 stars in the Southern Hemisphere, arranged in a table
  accompanied by columns containing their annual variations in
   S. P. D. and their elements of aberration and nutation:
     2. A determination of the latitude of the observatory at Para
  matta, as deduced from circumpolar altitudes of 3 Argus, observed
  with the repeating circle; and which determination differs about 15"
  from that obtained from solstices and zodiacal stars:
     3. Observations of the summer solstice of 1822, with the mural
  circle:                   -
     4. Observations of the moon : .
     5. Observations of the comet of 1824 in the Lion, with its ele
  ments; as also of another comet discovered by Sir Thos. Brisbane,
  in the Lion, in the year 1825; and of another, designated as the
  great comet of 1825:
     6. Observations of the opposition of Mars.
     7. Intervals between the transits of the moon and those of fixed
  stars culminating nearly in the same parallel in the year 1826.
     8. Observations of an eclipse of the moon at Paramatta, May 21,
  1826.
     The author regards the accuracy of these observations as in
 ferior to that obtained by Jupiter's satellites.
     9. Observations of the Northern solstice of the sun with a re
 peating circle of Reichenbach, at Paramatta, in the year 1826. The
 obliquity resulting from these observations differs only 0".4 from
 that stated in the Nautical Almanac.

     The reading was begun of a paper On the mutual attraction of
 the particles of magnetic bodies, and on the law of variation of
 the magnetic forces generated by rotation; by S. H. Christie, Esq.
 M.A. F.R.S.
     Feb. 22.—G. W. Taylor, Esq. M.P., was admitted a Fellow of
 the Spciety; and the reading of Mr. Christie's paper was concluded.
     The results described by Mr. Christie in a former paper, when a
copper disc was made to revolve under a magnetized needle, appear
ing to him not likely to lead to an accurate knowledge of the law of
magnetic attraction developed during rotation, from the effect of
lateral àttraction, he was induced to resume the inquiry, substitu
ting a ring for the disc, expecting that as no lateral force would here
be called into action, the results would be more uniform; and in
this expectation he was not disappointed. One of the first phaeno

    fice of the    gland   is situated about two-thirds of the          length      of the
    lower jaw backwards from the symphysis, being a longitudinal slit
    a little within the lower edge of the basis of the jaw, through which
    exudes the substance just mentioned. During warm weather, when
    the animal feeds freely, the secretion is copious; but in winter it is
    much diminished in quantity and is less powerful in scent. The
    gland itself is a simple follicle of an elongated pyriform figure, lying
    between the skin and the under surface of the tongue. In an alli
    gator of four feet in length, it is about half an inch long and one
    sixth of an inch in diameter. This gland is enveloped by ex
    tremely fine and delicate muscular fibres, disposed obliquely, con
    sisting of two fasciculi passing repeatedly over and under the
    gland, which unite at                     its

    March 6.—Read a paper by Thos. Bell, Esq. F.L.S. On two new
genera  of land tortoises.—These genera   possess a peculiar interest
 as exhibiting the affinities by which the freshwater tortoises are
connected with those inhabiting the land.      Mr. Bell has named
them   Pyris, and Kinyris; and both are distinguished by   a moveable
joint, one in the sternum, and the other in the hinder part of the
 back, by means of which the shell can be completely closed. The
species described are Pyxis arachnoides, a perfect land tortoise,
with the anterior lobe of the sternum moveable, and capable of as
accurately closing the shell as in any species of the freshwater box
tortoises: Kinyris castanea; and Kinyris Homiana, a species forming
 a passage from the group of Testudinidae to that of the Emydidae.
   March 20. Amongst the presents announced, was a collection of
birds from New Holland sent by Alex. MacLeay, Esq., Secretary

paper on the Birds of Cuba, in the introductory part of which the
principles of arrangement adopted by Aristotle in the Animal King
dom are investigated.

     Feb. 2–An account was given by Mr. Alcock in the Lecture
  room, of the applications lately made in France of the chloride of
 lime, and the solution prepared by passing chlorine through solu
 tion of carbonate of soda, as disinfecting agents. It appears that
 notwithstanding the affinity by which the chlorine is held in these
 bodies, that it is ready to act upon, and destroy any putrid miasma
 ta that may be floating in the atmosphere in which they are exposed.
If   a cloth be dipped in a solution of chloride of lime, and exposed
 to a foul air, or placed over putrescent matter, as a disinterred corpse,
 that the noxious effluvia are quickly destroyed, and              injury     all

latter appeared      to   bethe only methods which afforded security, and
a  lock of   this kind constructed         Egypt was produced, which from
                                          in

DESCRIPTION          OF A PLANETARIUM, or ORRERY, ON A NEW
  PRINCIPLE,         PUT IN MOTION BY THE STATE OF THE ATMO
  SPHERE.
    the year 1824, I made a Planetarium or Orrery, on a new                      prin
INciple, showing the motion of the Earth and Moon round the Sun,
and of the Moon round the Earth; of which invention        observed a    I
notice in the Philosophical Magazine for March that year.        have        I
lately constructed one on the same principle, representing the Sun,
an inferior planet (Venus), the Earth and Moon, and a superior
planet (Mars),—which I shall describe, referring to the figure which
accompanies this paper. The figure is not given as an exact re

tion be found sufficient for those persons who may wish to make a
planetarium of the same sort. The principal parts of this machine
are the following; to which may be added rings and hooks for con
necting the parts together.
   A piece of catgut string about fifteen   N=
inches in length, A (represented as

this passes through the round bars or
rods B, C, D, and is fastened to them
on the under sides by knots with glue,
to prevent them from slipping.         E, a

    The annual motion of the planets round the Sun is caused by
the property which catgut strings have of twisting and untwisting
according to the state of the atmosphere. When the apparatus is
removed from a damp room into one which is drier, and hung up,
the catgut A twists and carries the rods B, C, D round from right
to left, thus showing the course in which the planets really move
round the Sun.
    The small bar E hanging by a string of catgut about three feet
long, makes several revolutions, whilst it is carried round the Sun
once; the Earth and Moon are connected with this bar at unequal
distances from the point of suspension, and are carried round this
point (which represents the common centre of gravity between
those bodies), the Moon by revolving round the Earth illustrating
the monthly motion. Owing to the relative lengths of catgut be
tween the point of suspension of the string A, and the bars B, C,
and D, the difference in the annual motions of the planets is oc
 casioned. In the Planetarium here figured, the diameter of the
 Earth's orbit is about one foot eight inches; that of the Moon's
round the centre of gravity, between four and five inches. I have
 one, of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, in which the diameter of the
 orbit of the Earth is about six feet, and of the Moon about one
 foot eight inches.
     On the principle of this machine, the rest of the Solar system
 usual on Orreries may be added; and where a considerable length of
 catgut can be €onveniently made use                          of,
                                                 the diurnal motions         the                          of
 planets may        shown. By substituting
                   be                                catgut string instead

                      CRYSTALLIZED LITHARGE.
    M. Gaultier de Claubry remarked that crystals of litharge were
formed during the cupellation of argentiferous lead: he collected
and analysed some of them. These crystals had the appearance of
regular dodecahedrons; but M. Beudant, who examined them with
the assistance of the reflective goniometer, found that they possessed
no regular angles, and that their facets were curvilinear.
   M. Houton-Labilliadère had previously obtained litharge in
crystals, which appeared to him to be regular dodecahedrons; they
were formed in a solution of oxide of lead in soda, during the win
ter.—(Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. t. vii. p. 218.)

   On the surface of the   crystals there were  semitralisparent  laminae
of a yellow colour, of the size of the nail : their composition was
similar to that of the crystals.-(Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. t. xxiii.
p. 443.)
                   COMPOSITION      OF NITRIC ACID.
   The 12th volume of the Annals of Philosophy, O.S. (p. 351),
contains a translation of a paper on the composition of nitric acid,
by Berthollet: the process employed was that of decomposing ni
trate of potash by heat in a porcelain retort, the weight and nature of
the gaseous products and of the residual potash being ascertained.
From these experiments the author concluded that nitric acid is
composed of 69-6 oxygen + 304 azote, instead of 74.08 of the
former and 25.92 of the latter element, as now generally admitted.
   Dr. Thomson observes, that though he has no doubt of the inac
curacy of Berthollet's analysis, he cannot pretend to account for the
fallacy.   Having lately prepared some oxygen gas by decomposing
nitre, I found that the last gaseous product, if not entirely azctic
gas, contained so little oxygen that it extinguished a candle. Upon
pouring water into the gun-barrel to remove the potash,          I  found
that oxygen gas was immediately evolved, and in such quantity
that an ignited stick was immediately inflamed; and the combustion
continued for a considerable period.
   Now Berthollet distinctly, though erroneously, asserts, that the
potash retains no oxygen: but it is evident from the experiment now
                                                                   stated,

stated, that peroxide of potassium is formed; and it appeared to me
probable, that the quantity was sufficient to supply the deficiency
of about 4% per cent of oxygen in Berthollet's experiment—R. P.

   M. Viala finds that when phosphorus is introduced into a receiver

                   ACI DS DiscOWERED IN CASTOR OIL.
   MM.    Bussy   and Lecanu have obtained three new fatty acids from
castor oil: one, which they call ricinic acid, is fusible at 72°Fahr.;
another, termed elaiodic acid, is fluid at several degrees below 82°;
and the third they have denominated margaritic acid; this crystal
lizes in fine scales, and is not fusible below 264°. These acids are
volatile, more or less soluble in alcohol, and perfectly insoluble in
water; and they form salts of very distinct characters, with several
bases, and especially with magnesia and oxide of lead.

   Mr. Mac Mullin continued his experiments to discover the source
of the chlorine, and concludes “that the chlorine combined with
the black oxide is in the state             of chloric acid; and that the native
       is,

                                           offered some reasons for
 supposing that the chrome in this mineral is in the state of
 protoxide.                                                      -
    Such a  supposition,  however,    afforded no   satisfactory   solu
 tion of the orange colour of the phosphate; for though many
 of the combinations of the chromic acid are yellow or red, and
especially   itscombination with lead, this        not the case with       is
 the  green oxide         of

LXII.     On the Orange Phosphate   of Lead. By                                     the Rev.
              WM. V. VERNoN, F.R.S. Pres. Y.P.S.*
   N  a former communication which I had the honour of
     making to the Society, I stated as the result of some ana
lytical researches into the cause of the diversity of colour in
the phosphates of lead, that                  I
                                      had found manganese in the
  reen phosphate, and chrome in the orange phosphate from
    anlock head; at the same time I offered some reasons for
supposing that the chrome in this mineral is in the state of
protoxide.                                                        -
    Such a  supposition,   however,    afforded no   satisfactory   solu
tion of the orange colour of the phosphate; for though many
of the combinations of the chromic acid are yellow or red, and
especially    its
               combination with lead, this          not the case with
                                                                    is
the  green  oxide        of
                      chrome.

resumed the inquiry, and made the experiments,                  which         of          I
now   propose      give

golden yellow.

for   ascertaining      this   point, was founded     upon    the    property

they become green by the reduction of the chromic acid.
   In considering the circumstances of this analysis, it ap
peared to me extraordinary that the chrome should be partly
in the state of protoxide and partly of chromic acid; and to
this point      I

The difficulty is now overcome; for there is no doubt that the
integral is equal to 4+. The integration may be performed
as usual; or it may be accomplished by the peculiar process
of M. Poisson. The argument cannot be affected by different
algebraic operations that lead to the same result.     But we
may fairly hesitate to admit the gratuitous supposition of
making y constant.     In order to examine this point, put
y = y + (y y)*: then–

according to the usual doctrine”.
   There is a remarkable proof of the deficiency of the usual
theory in M. Poisson's Memoir. He applies his analysis to a
homogeneous fluid mass, revolving upon an axis, and nearly
spherical+.     When the square of the centrifugal force is neg
lected, he finds that the figure of the fluid must be an ellipti
cal spheroid, agreeing with the solutions of Legendre and
Laplace.      But, on attempting to carry the approximation
further, the method fails; all that can be known               that there                              is,
is only one figure which will satisfy the equations:—Mais                                                                      ce

 recedes from the axis, the rotatory velocity                     will decrease; and
 whenever it returns in a contrary direction, the same velocity
 will increase; and ultimately, in the state of equilibrium, the
 rotation actually remaining, will depend upon the nature of
 the figure of equilibrium, and the proportion of the two forces
   urging the particles. Although we suppose that the rotation
   in equilibrio is small, yet we cannot infer that the rotatory ve
   locity originally imprest, was likewise small. On the contrary,
  if the rotation were very small, and at the same time the figure
  very oblate, we must conclude that the primitive rotatory force
  was just within the limit required to dissipate the fluid. What
  particular figure the fluid in equilibrio will have, we do not
  now inquire; but we are entitled to infer that there is only
  one such figure for every degree of rotatory force originally
  communicated to the fluid sphere.            This is incompatible with
  the usual theory; and it refutes M. Poisson's argument. But
  it is very consistent with my system; nay, it can be consistent
 with no other; for, if there be but one figure, that, it is cer
 tain, must be an oblate elliptical spheroid.

THE   force which elevates a column of liquid in a fine
  tube, between two plain surfaces, or around solid mat
ter generally, is corpuscular: the effect is produced by either
the surface only of the solid, or a stratum of immeasurably
small depth. The liquid is elevated by the attraction of
the solid to             its
                    upper strata: for,        the upper strata alone  if

   This table exhibits the relative altitudes to which the liquids
are elevated; and since it was shown in the former paper, that
a change in the density produced by variation of temperature,
does not affect the height of the column, these numbers re
present the ratios of the forces of attraction between the glass
and one particle of the liquid, at the distance to which they
are kept asunder by the repulsive force of caloric: and if the
force of attraction of the liquid to the solid be required at any
temperature, multiply the altitude by the density of the liquid
at that temperature.
   The following are some effects of combination:

   By formula (a), h! = 15:2; by experiment h' = 7-8.
Hence the altitude to which any liquid, mixture or combina
tion of liquids is raised, does not depend solely upon the den
sity or densities of the substances concerned: this is evident
from Exp. 5; in which, 100 by weight of water, added to 83
of alcohol, causes an addition of ºth only to the column of
pure alcohol; although the height of the column of water: that
of alcohol :: 100:40-8. So extraordinary a phaenomenon can
not result from any mechanical law depending upon the rela
tive weight or specific gravity of the component parts; it is more
analogous to chemical attraction, and capillary phaenomena
will afford a measure of corpuscular forces, as well as of their
increase and decrease, so far as depends upon distance.
   The phaenomena of alcohol present apparent anomalies;
but they are so constant, that a thorough investigation will de
velop some of the primary laws of corpuscular forces: the
appearances may be partially accounted for by considering that
alcohol consists of the elements of 51°15 olefiant (bicarbu
retted hydrogen) gas, and 31-85 water; the former of which
must be repulsive to glass, since a small quantity of alcohol
greatly depresses a column of water: thus, 100 water + 83
alcohol rose to 6'66 elev.; 1 vol. of this mixture + 3 water
rose to 10:5; 1 vol. mixture + 7 water was elevated 13;
water alone 16: in this experiment (since 100 alcohol consists
of 61-63 olefiant gas + 38-37 water), 100 of the mixture,
proof strength, contains 27-95 olefiant gas + 72.05 water;                                       its
altitude was 6'66; pure water 16; 27.95 olefiant gas          372.05                    +
water rose        10:5; 27.95 olefiant gas

                                                                                                 be of

   Whether these curious results arise from an actual force of

he has made this branch of the mechanical philosophy more
particularly his study, and has applied the peculiar kind of
analysis employed in it to different problems; so that among
existing mathematicians an abler vindicator could not have
been found.       Every subject that passes through such hands
must acquire valuable improvements; and                     the present             in if,    on

The difficulty is now overcome; for there is no doubt that the
integral is equal to 4+. The integration may be performed
as usual; or it may be accomplished by the peculiar process
of M. Poisson. The argument cannot be affected by different
algebraic operations that lead to the same result. But we
may fairly hesitate to admit the gratuitous supposition of
making y constant.      In order to examine this point, put
y  = y + (y          –

   There is a remarkable proof of the deficiency of the usual
theory in M. Poisson's Memoir. He applies his analysis to a
homogeneous fluid mass, revolving upon an axis, and nearly
spherical+.     When the square of the centrifugal force is neg
lected, he finds that the figure of the fluid must be an ellipti
cal spheroid, agreeing with the solutions of Legendre and
Laplace.     But, on attempting to carry the approximation
further, the method fails; all that can be known                that there                               is,
is only one figure which will satisfy the equations:—Mais                                                                        ce

  recedes from the axis, the rotatory velocity             will decrease; and
    whenever it returns in a       contrary    direction,   the same velocity
   will increase; and ultimately, in the state of equilibrium, the
   rotation actually remaining, will depend upon the nature of
   the figure of equilibrium, and the proportion of the two forces
   urging the particles. Although we suppose that the rotation
   in equilibrio is small, yet we cannot infer that the rotatory ve
   locity originally imprest, was likewise small. On the contrary,
  if the rotation were very small, and at the same time the figure
  very oblate, we must conclude that the primitive rotatory force
  was just within the limit required to dissipate the fluid. What
  particular figure the fluid in equilibrio will have, we do not
  now inquire; but we are entitled to infer that there is only
  one such figure for every degree of rotatory force originally
  communicated to the fluid sphere.              This is incompatible with
  the usual theory; and it refutes M. Poisson’s argument.                  But
  it is very consistent with my system; nay, it can be consistent
  with no other; for, if there be but one figure, that, it is cer
  tain, must be an oblate elliptical spheroid.

      force which elevates a column of liquid in a fine
THE
  tube, between two plain surfaces, or around solid mat
ter generally, is corpuscular: the effect is produced by either
the surface only of the solid, or a stratum of immeasurably
small depth. The liquid is elevated by the attraction of
the solid to                its
                   upper strata: for,        the upper strata alone      if
of  the suspended column          heated,      great     beeffect    pro     as                 an                     is

   This table exhibits the relative altitudes to which the liquids
are elevated; and since it was shown in the former paper, that
a change in the density produced by variation of temperature,
does not affect the height of the column, these numbers re
present the ratios of the forces of attraction between the glass
and one particle of the liquid, at the distance to which they
are kept asunder by the repulsive force of caloric: and if the
force of attraction of the liquid to the solid be required at any
temperature, multiply the altitude by the density of the liquid
at that temperature.
   The following are some effects of combination:

   By formula (a), h = 15:2; by experiment h' = 7-8.
Hence the altitude to which any liquid, mixture or combina
tion of liquids is raised, does not depend solely upon the den
sity or densities of the substances concerned: this is evident
from Exp. 5; in which, 100 by weight of water, added to 83
of alcohol, causes an addition of ºth only to the column of
pure alcohol; although the height of the column of water: that
of alcohol :: 100:40-8. So extraordinary a phaenomenon can
not result from any mechanical law depending upon the rela
tive weight or specific gravity of the component parts; it is more
analogous to chemical attraction, and capillary phaenomena
will afford a measure of corpuscular forces, as well as of their
increase and decrease, so far as depends upon distance.
   The phaenomena of alcohol present apparent anomalies;
but they are so constant, that a thorough investigation will de
velop some of the primary laws of corpuscular forces: the
appearances may be partially accounted for by considering that
alcohol consists of the elements of 51.15 olefiant (bicarbu
retted hydrogen) gas, and 31-85 water; the former of which
must be repulsive to glass, since a small quantity of alcohol
greatly depresses a column of water: thus, 100 water + 83
alcohol rose to 6'66 elev.; 1 vol. of this mixture + 3 water
rose to 10:5; 1 vol. mixture + 7 water was elevated 13;
water alone 16: in this experiment (since 100 alcohol consists
of 61-63 olefiant gas + 38-37 water), 100 of the mixture,
proof strength, contains 27-95 olefiant gas + 72.05 water;                            its
altitude was 6'66; pure water 16; 27.95 olefiant gas          372.05            +

   Whether these curious results arise from an actual force of

it arises  simply  from the cohesive force     the   upper      of

336            Mr. Galbraith          on the Velocity       of Sound.
the water (on which the effect depends) being diminished by
the mixture of the alcohol, is not apparent.
   Another singular example of the agency of heat in effecting
a diminution of corpuscular attraction presents itself in the
following experiment:—Cut two pieces of soft lead, so that
each may have a plain and bright surface; by pressure these
surfaces may be made to cohere with considerable force.
Suspend the pieces one perpendicularly over the other, and to
the lower piece hang weights, nearly as heavy as the cohesive
force may be supposed capable of supporting. The applica
tion of a degree of heat, not superior to that of boiling water,
will cause a separation, provided the weights be sufficiently
heavy: whence the corpuscular force of heat produces sensible
effects at minute, even sensible distances.
   The phaenomena of the capillary action of parallel metallic
plates are curious.        I
                         have made a considerable number of
experiments; but until some difficulties shall be surmounted,
they cannot be in a state to be submitted to public scrutiny.

        the velocity in English feet, employing the English ba

    As I have been able to find no experiments by which a                 di
 rect comparison with these formulae can be made, except those
 of Professor Moll of Utrecht, with the omission of the last
 term, namely, w cos ?,     Icannot say whether it is in this last
 respect perfectly correct. As Dr. Moll took the precaution
 of firing guns at each end of the measured base, the effect of
 the wind was in this case obviated; and if my formula agree
 nearly with his experiments, independent of this term, it may
 be looked on in this state as verified by direct experiment.
    The truth of these remarks will be obvious, on consulting
Dr. Moll's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the
 Royal Society of London for the year 1824, pages 425, &c.
in which a full account of the whole steps of his experi
ments is recorded. At page 445 there is presented a table of
the velocity of sound from 44 different experiments on a base
near Utrecht in Holland, of about nine miles in length. On
the 27th of June 1823, twenty-two shots were fired at each
station or end of the base of 17669°28 metres, or 9664-7044
            º
fathoms, the metre being supposed 39:3824 English inches.
The sum of the times was 2286°-07, which divided by 44
gives 51°-96 for the mean of the whole, which Dr. Moll adopts.
Whence             = 340.06      metres, the experimental velocity
in one second of time.      Now while these 22 shots were fired
at each end of the measured base, the mean temperature at
both ends of it was 11°16 = t of the Centigrade scale.   Also
the mean height of the metrical barometer was 74475 = p ;
the mean tension of aqueous vapour by Daniell’s hygrometer
was 0-00925307 metre = <U+017F>.    By substituting these quantities
in formula (A) neglecting the last term, w cos 0, since by
firing guns at both ends of the measured base       effect,    its        as

Dr. Moll's experiments, as the mean error of the whole would
only be about — 0.196 of a metre, or about eight English
i.e.    a degree of coincidence, in such researches, not to be
expected.

    The barometrical observations having been registered only
to the first decimal place of an inch, there is no doubt a con
siderable loss in the resulting mean pressure: this supposition
is verified by the annual mean result being so low, compared
with those of barometers that were placed much higher; as
it is rººm or          gº
                        of an inch lower than that at Kinfauns
Castle, where the barometer is stated to have been 129 feet
above the level of the sea, and that at Wick only 45 feet, if
it were placed at the same height as the thermometer. Con
sidering the difference of latitude of these places, it is curious
that the mean temperature at Wick at 10 A.M. and 10 P.M.
should be higher in January, February, March, October, No
vember, and December 1823, than at Kinfauns Castle, at the
same hours, and lower in the other six months; and also that
the annual mean temperatures of these places should coincide
within   <U+017F>ºn    of a degree: but this must have arisen from the
contiguity of Wick to a more open sea, which tends to lessen
the chill of the atmosphere in the winter months.
     WIND. The prevailing wind, according to the scale in the
table, was decidedly from the S. and S.W. points of the com
pass, in which direction they are influenced by the Western
                  in its
 Ocean, and         bluff eastern shore. The wind from the N.
 was the next     duration,     coming from the open sea. From
                                      as
the   S.E., W. and N.W.      they were nearly equal, but least from
 the N.E. and      E.,  from which points they had       travel over       to
 the continents            of
                       Europe and Asia.     Hence      appears that       it
 the S.W. wind does not retain                          its
                                           prevailing character                                   at
 Wick,   as  itdoes  along  the southern shores     England.    The  of
 prevailing South wind         Wick may
                                     at       considered      beland

                                                                                    a
breeze, and       isfortunate one for vegetation there. The winds
                    a
 from the S.W., W. and N. are sea breezes; the succulent
 state  of the two first, soon counteracts the sterile effects    the                       of
  last.

    The above corrections are the differences of the mean
monthly temperatures by a Fahrenheit's thermometer at Gos
port, taken nearly at the same time in the mornings and even
ings as at Wick, and the monthly means by a self-registering
thermometer; and are applied to the average temperatures of
the morning and evening at Wick, in order to obtain an ap
proximation to the real mean temperature of that place. But
as these corrections were obtained from simultaneous obser
vations here, perhaps they have made the approximate mean
 temperature of Wick, nearly half a degree too high.                  From
 these results, which were made to compare the temperature
 of the atmosphere at the remote part of Scotland with that at
 the southern parts of England, it appears that the difference in
 the approximate mean temperature at Wick, and the real
mean temperature at Gosport, Hants, in 1823, was only 4%
 degrees, and in 1825, five degrees, notwithstanding the former
 place has a greater north latitude than the latter by 7° 14'.

      Gentlemen,
  N   consequence      of some passages in Mr. Sturgeon's paper,
     inserted in   your    Number for January, appearing to me to
insinuate that my experiments on the inflammation of gun
powder were not actually performed in the manner which                                            I
stated, but that         I
                        concealed, either designedly or ignorantly,
some essential particular which rendered them successful,                                         I
feel the necessity of requesting the favour of your inserting
my present letter. Mr. Sturgeon introduces the subject of
my experiments with the following observation.                 “The most
extraordinary method of effecting the ignition of gunpowder
                                                                                  of,

by Mr. Howldy,   is         the Philosophical Magazine, vol. lxviii.
p.  173.”    Thisat is    strong, though       indirect, testimony that
                                                              an
my method           a in
                      least  original.    He then proceeds:            have              “I
been    induced,”    says    Mr.      “to pay some attention

                                                                       be

 Now, can relieve Mr. Sturgeon's regret,
      I                                                 assuring him that
the part    of the table which              he
                                       has mentioned and suspected,
was    perfectly  dry,   and free from moisture             every kind,       of                  as

 employed, when the experiments              question were made. The

   An examination into the materials of this range of cliffs
will introduce to our notice more ancient formations, whose
traces are not here so readily accounted for.         The shore to
the west of Cromer exhibits a singular accumulation of tra
velled fragments of primitive rocks, whence it would not be
difficult to collect a tolerably illustrative series. They consist
chiefly of rounded blocks of several varieties of granite, ba
salt, porphyry, trap, and micaceous schist; sandstones of va
rious kinds, chert, breccia; besides limestone, claystone, &c.
I  am not sufficiently acquainted with the nomenclature of
rocks to hazard a more detailed enumeration here. The dilu
vial fragments of the later series are from the chalk, the plas
tic clay, London clay, green sand, Kelloway's rock, the oolites,
lias clay, and marlestone;—in fact, almost every formation
                                                       of

  diluvial clay in which they may frequently be noticed, whence
 I  have collected many specimens, and others may be seen se
  veral miles inland. It is probable that these large masses, after
  being dislodged from the cliffs, are very little removed from
  their original sites by the action of existing currents in the
  ocean. This opinion is confirmed on considering the other                                           cir
  cumstances attendant on the wearing away of these cliffs. As
 might be expected, the alluvial substances that form the beach.
  and line the shores of the eastern counties, are, for the most
 part, obviously derived from the small rounded fragments,
 and the ancient water-worn gravel, which the sea has washed
 from   its  precipitous borders. But there remain extensive por

 The ancient villages of Shipden, Wimpwell and Eccles have
 disappeared; several manors and large portions of neighbour
 ing parishes have, piece after piece, been swallowed up by
 the encroaching waves; and their site, some fathoms deep,
 now forms a part of the bed of the German Ocean. Coope
 rating with the tides, the land springs in the bordering high
 grounds are constantly, though slowly, working to reduce our
 boundaries. Enormous masses, dislodged by the pressure of
 the springs, are continually precipitated upon the beach from
 the high cliffs, to be carried off by succeeding tides.      In the
winter of 1825, one of these fallen masses covered twelve acres,
extending far into the sea;                 its

freshwater valley.    Every thing denotes that their beds were
gradually heightened by the deposition of a marine sediment.
In this there is nothing remarkable; the operation is daily
going on on the Lincolnshire coast, where instances are re
lated of the precipitation of a stratum of mud an inch thick,
in a single day. The industry of man enables him to avail
himself of this tendency;—the operations of nature are assisted
by art, and large tracts of the richest land have been artifi
cially produced from the earthy materials brought by the
waters of the ocean.     Had we need to travel further than the
adjoining county, this article might be extended by reciting
remarkable illustrations of the formation of alluvial lands, in
the numerous and fertile Danish islands of the Baltic; in the
marsches on the coast of Sleswick, or in the Deltas on the
 shores of the Adriatic.   A due examination into all the facts
by which local changes are accomplished,—whether in the gra
 dual absorption of high lands, on the one hand, or in the pro
 gressive emersion of extensive flats, on the other,    in either
 case the result of existing causes, has always ended in con
 firming the general principle of the permanent residence of
 the sea at one level, and without diminution, since the deluge.
 All the apparent exceptions are referable to local and existing
 causes; as in the cases of coral reefs, of muddy depositions, or
volcanic agency, which affect not the surface of the ocean, but
elevate or depress the base upon which       waters repose. The     its
balance of these fluctuations leaves the water level where

 I  have placed a mark over the corrected figures: and it will
  be clear that, if we reserve only seven places of decimals, and
  we wish to have the last of them true to the nearest figure,
  Mr. B.'s corrections will be necessary for the last five num
 bers in this list. It should, however, be remarked in justice
 to Taylor, that he had detected the mistake in the logarithm of
 38962, and has noted, in the errata printed on the last page
 of his tables, that the last figures should be 412, not 413.                                      In
 deed the cost of time, labour and attention must have been
 immense, to have avoided a greater number of errors. Some
idea of the difficulty may be formed, when it is seen that even
 Mr. Babbage, with                     all
                            his most laudable anxiety for accuracy,
has not been able                 to

him that Vlacq's logarithms for 24626 was wrong, and that
the last figures      the seven decimals are, therefore, not 940,

higher between them than on the opposite or other sides.

der the overhanging side of either will rise to a greater per
pendicular height than when they are vertical; but on the op
posite side the elevation will be so much diminished as to be
nearly insensible.    (4). When two plates of glass, inclined to
each other, are immersed in water with the line of their inter
section vertical, the water will ascend between them, and form
a hyperbola. (5). One end of a vertical tube having a bore

fecting a junction with the air previously introduced at the

zontally out of the water, at the middle of the length of the

                   Mr. Nixon's Theory of the Spirit-Level.                                               359
equal to 15 feet. But as the levity of the water near the ex
tremities of the arc is greater than under the vertex, it must
stand higher there than in the latter place, or an equili
brium cannot be effected.       From this cause the length of the
bubble becomes reduced from 15 feet to little more than as
many tenths of an inch: however, as the reduction will be the
same at each end, provided the tube be a perfect ring, the
middle of the bubble will still coincide with the vertex of the
arc. For reasons already assigned, it is nevertheless requisite
that the bubble should be of a proper length and depth.
   When a vertical plane describes any arc of revolution about
a horizontal line or axis, a straight line, as the radius or chord
of a circle, previously drawn anywhere on that plane, will have
 its inclination      the horizon varied
                             to                   angular quantity          by   an
equal      to
           that arc               of
                         revolution. This will            obvious for                 be   as
 an excentric line           for one intersecting the axis, when
                                  as   it   is
we consider that their parallelism          angle      inclination or                 of                    to
each other remains constant.                                If
                                       we therefore describe with

the same radius two circles        the vertical plane, one concen

points before, and also after any partial revolution        the plane,                      of
the lineal distance      the two points
                                      of      the one circle will       on                                  be

     The measurement of the angular inclination of  a line lying
in a vertical  plane does not differ essentially from that of a
line of maximum inclination described on an inclined plane,
but is susceptible of more evident demonstration. Let AB
and CD be two straight lines lying in the same vertical plane
and equally inclined to the horizontal line HH.               Place the
under edge of either (vertical) side of a level on AB, and,
having marked the ends of the bubble, reverse the level, and
make the (opposite) under edge coincide with DC; when the
bubble, as the same end of the level is equally elevated as be
fore, will come to rest at the initial marks. Depress this ele
 vated end until the under edge coincides with AB, when the
bubble must have passed over a distance on the scale equal
to the angle CDB, evidently the sum of the two equal angles
 CDH and HDB, either of which is equal to the inclination
of the line AB (or that of CD). In depressing the reversed
level from       its
                  position       DC that
                                   on         to  AB,    on         its
                                                            under edge
must have coincided       with,         or
                                     been  parallel      the horizontal
                                                               to
line HH when the bubble had run over half the distance an
swering     to
             the double inclination          AB, equal angle CDB.

Hence the under surface of the level will be horizontal when
(its sides being vertical) the middle               of

                         any inclined line.     When this point falls
exactly between the two marks drawn                      on

                                        is     adjusted.    When this
is not the case, turn the adjusting screws until the bubble set

  there was very little difference between these two products,
    albumen and fibrin.
        The only character that appears to distinguish one from
    the other,           is,
                    that whilst albumen requires high temperature                        a

strongly, Mr. H. says, the disposition of the fibrin to coagulate
is proportionably diminished. On the contrary, when an animal
is bled to death, or when the vessels are acting with the lowest
degree of strength, the blood was more and more disposed to
coagulate in proportion as the animal was reduced. Temporary
exertion of strength, moreover, even the struggles of the dying
 animal, he thought might lessen this tendency for a short time;
 for the struggles of dying sheep, he says, seemed to alter the
 lymph or fibrin; and he adds, that although it must be ad
 mitted it is very difficult to conceive how the blood-vessels
 should do this, yet he hopes that ingenious men will not merely
 on that account reject his conclusion; but would consider, that

colour of the blood: for when the structure of the crassamen
tum is viewed by the microscope, it not only appears fibrous or
thread-like, but also reticulated, the interstices of the network
being occupied by a greater or less number of red globules,
and by a quantity of the serum or watery part; the effect of
the coagulation being to entangle a part of the red globules
and serum : whence, if the coagulum be sliced and cut into
small pieces, a quantity of serum makes               escape,     additionits              in

       Mr. R. Phillips          on the Chlorides           of Lime and Soda.                        377
   The chloride of lime has long been known under the name
of oxymuriate of lime, or bleaching powder: it is prepared, as
is well known, by passing chlorine gas over hydrate of lime;
the resulting compound, put into water, yields the chloride of
lime in question; it is also sometimes formed by passing the
gas into water containing lime in suspension: this chloride is
now proposed to be employed, and it appears with great suc
cess, as a disinfecting substance.
   The existence of such a compound as chloride of soda, or
potash, has hitherto not been so clearly ascertained as that of
the chloride of lime. Two modes of preparing this compound
have been proposed,—one by M. Labarraque, and the other
by M. Payen; the former passes chlorine gas into a solution
of carbonate of soda, while the latter proposes to decompose
chloride of lime by carbonate of soda.
   I have tried both methods, and both are very easy of execu
tion. When chlorine gas is passed into the solution of car
bonate of soda, it is very readily absorbed, and this absorption
takes place without expelling a particle of carbonic acid : the
solution has a faint smell of chlorine; when heated scarcely
any chlorine is evolved, and the solution first acts as an alkali
upon turmeric paper, and then bleaches                             it:
                                                          the addition    on                         of
 an acid, chlorine and carbonic acid gases are evolved.

                                                                                                     is of

capillary attraction           of
                          the crystals.     When these crystals have
been separated, the solution yields minute crystals                  carbo               of
nate   ofsoda,   possessing  the usual form         that substance.of
    These filamentous crystals are too minute               admit       any    to             of

the uncombined chlorine gas which the water holds in solu
tion. Now admitting for a moment this to be the case, and
that no such compound as chloride of soda exists, the same
explanation cannot apply to the action of chloride of lime: and
it is singular that Dr. Granville has taken no notice of this
substance, although according to M. Labarraque it is gene
rally employed for disinfecting apartments, while the chloride
of soda “is especially employed in topical and external ap
plications to wounds and ulcers affected with hospital gan
grenes, &c.”     (Alcock on the Use of the Chlorurets, p. 126.)

ner that the explanation which Dr. Granville has offered, is
not a correct view of what actually occurs. M. Gaultier de

 Elements of Chemistry, including the recent Discoveries and Doctrines
   of that Science. By Edward TURNER, M.D. F.R.S.E., &c. &c.
         R.TURNER is already advantageously known to the chemical
        student as the author of an “Introduction to the Study and
 Laws of Chemical Combination,” &c. and the present work will not
 detract from his merit as a clear, and in general a correct, narrator
 of the numerous facts and theories embraced by, and constituting,
 chemical science; indeed it would be difficult to name any work of
 similar extent on the subject, which contains so much information.
     After a few pages of introductory matter, relating principally to
 the physical properties of bodies, and the definition of chemical sci
 ence, Dr. Turner divides his work into four principal parts. In the
 first of these, the imponderables are treated of; the second comprises
 inorganic chemistry, including the doctrine of affinity and the laws
 of combination; the elementary bodies are divided into nonmetallic
 and metallie, and the author has deviated, and we think with great
 propriety, from the usual practice of dividing elementary bodies
 into supporters of combustion and combustibles, or into electro
 negative and electro-positive bodies: we agree with him, that an ar
 rangement founded on these principles is not free from objection
 in theory, and that it offers no advantage in facilitating the study
 of the science. The third general division of the work is on organic
 chemistry, comprehending the products of vegetable and animal
 life; while the fourth division contains brief directions for the per
 formance of analysis.
    Although our limits will not permit us minutely to follow Dr. Tur
 ner through the details and execution of his plan, we shall offer such
 observations upon many parts of it which may appear to require no
 tice; and if the author should find that we are free in our remarks,
 we trust he will receive them in the same spirit as that by which
 they are dictated; and we hope we may not only be useful to him
 in a second edition, which we have no doubt will soon be required,
 but we trust that utility may also arise to those who may possess
 the work in        its
                  present form.

gases, and a very volatile solid, is not only difficult                                 of decomposi
tion, but is not volatilized at a red heat; many similar examples
might be quoted.
    In refuting an error respecting the action of quantity in modify
ing affinity (p. 114), it appears to us that the author has not been
fortunate in the selection of his example:—Thus he states, that
“ acids and alkalies have a tendency to unite in more than one pro
portion, and will readily form salts with excess of acid or of base
when circumstances are favourable to their production.”               If by this
it is meant that the alkalies form compounds with acids which con
tain less than one atom of acid, we do not remember any such case;
but we readily admit the formation of salts with excess of acid; and
this, according to Dr. Turner, “explains why nitrate of potash can
not be entirely decomposed by a quantity of sulphuric acid; which
is just sufficient for neutralizing the alkali: the sulphuric acid,” he
 continues, “instead of taking the whole of the potash, unites with
a part of it and forms the bisulphate. This tendency to the forma
tion of an acid salt accounts for the fact quite satisfactorily; nor is
there any reason to infer the co-operation of any other catse.”
We are enabled by the results of direct experiment to show the
inaccuracy of these statements. When 100 parts of nitre were de.
 composed by the equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid, more than
+3+ of the whole quantity of nitric acid were procured, and the salt
 left in the retort weighed 862 parts, which is the precise atomic
 quantity of sulphate of potash obtainable by decomposing the nitrate
 by

Dr. Thomson    has also mentioned that if the peroxide be exposed
to too high a temperature,   it loses more oxygen, not indeed suffi
cient to convert it into protoxide,  but there is obtained a compound
of 1 atom of  protoxide   with 2 atoms of deutoxide.     Now Dr. Tur
ner says, that by the action of sulphuric acid “the peroxide loses a
whole proportion of oxygen, and is converted into protoxide, which
unites with the acid, forming a sulphate of the protoxide of man
ganese.”     This statement is at variance with both Dr. Thomson's
and also with the results of our experiments; for we find that 44
or 1 atom of peroxide of manganese yield 4.2 of oxygen, which is
so much nearer 4 than 8, that there is no question but that the
deutoxide and not the protoxide is obtained by the action of sul
phuric acid; that this is the case is further proved by the deep red
colour of the solution of the sulphate, and by             losing that colour,       its

of sulphuric acid for decomposing    1 atom of nitre, is stated by
Dr. Turner to be the facility which it affords of removing the resi
dual salt from the retort;-this we will admit : he continues, how
ever; “but though it is advisable to use more than 1 atom of
sulphuric acid, it is important to employ no more than is really re
quired for decomposing the nitre with advantage.     An unnecessary
excess,” he continues, “is not only unoeconomical, but positively
                                                                                off

The   combining proportion of carbonic oxide is therefore 14, and that
of carbonic acid   22. The italics are ours; and we use them to mark
the circumstance that three different terms are used in the space of
as many lines, to express the same meaning.         In p. 215, a similar
CaSe OCCurS.
   In p. 217, the sulphuric acid obtained by decomposing sulphate
of iron is stated to be colourless: the fact is well known to be other
wise; but    we believe the cause of the dark colour has not been
ascertained: Dr. Thomson, if we remember right, suspects that it
may be derived from the presence of selenium.
   We proceed now to the Metals, the arrangement of which, if we
may use the expression, is too chemical, and not sufficiently depend
ent upon obvious or physical properties. The metals are divided into
two classes; First, those the oxides of which cannot be reduced to
the metallic state by the sole action of heat; Secondly, those metals
the oxides of which are reducible by heat only.        As however the
metals of the first class are divided into four orders, the arrange
ment is in fact equivalent to five classes.    The first order includes
the metals which decompose water at common temperatures; these
are stated to be six, viz. Potassium, Sodium, Lithium, Barium, Stron
tium, and Calcium.       Now to those ought to be added, Magnesium
from the second order, and Zinc and Manganese from the third order.
That the two former metals decompose water at common tempera
ture, is stated by Davy. The action of manganese we have witnessed.
   The second order of metals includes Magnesium, Glucinum,           Yt
trium, Aluminum, Zirconium, and Silicium.
   One of the characteristics of these metals is stated to be, that
their oxides are very sparingly soluble in water; but on referring
to the account given of each of them, three of them, viz. alumina,
glucina, and zirconia, are stated by Dr. Turner himself, to be
“quite insoluble in water;” and the same might also have been men
tioned with respect to yttria.      The late experiments of Berzelius
have nearly demonstrated that neither silicium nor zirconium has
any claims to be considered as metals: indeed two circumstances
mentioned by Dr. Turner with respect to silicium,-viz., that it is
a non-conductor of electricity, and has no metallic lustre,  are almost
decisive with respect to that substance.
   The third order includes those metals which decompose water at
a red heat; they are stated to be Manganese, Zinc, Iron, Tin, and
Cadmium. Now, as already noticed, two of these decompose water
at common temperatures; and according to Davy, antimony pro
duces the same effect at a red heat.     The remaining order includes
metals which do not     decompose   water at any temperature; and the
second class contains     those, the oxides of which are decomposed
at a red heat.
   From the length to which our observations have already extend
ed, we shall be unable to allot more than a very limited space to
the remaining parts of Dr. Turner's work.       We may however ob
serve, that his account of the crystalline form of muriate of barytes
will, we think, justify an observation wehave previously made respect
ing the little attention which Dr. Turner has paid to the subject of
                                                         crystalization.

ments with the experience already gained, and in the same locality.
   The Appendix to this paper by Mr. Airy contains the formulae
of computation used, and their application to the observed cases.
The observations were made by the method of disappearances and
re-appearances, the vibrations being continued till the arc of vibra
tion had become so small as to produce a complete obscuration of
the disk, for more than 40" in some instances, and thus entailing
errors on the method of disappearances alone, which Mr. Airy cha
racterizes as most enormous, as he also states to be, the interval be
tween the disappearance on one side and the disappearance on the
other, as the arc of vibration diminishes. It therefore became ne
cessary to find some rule for determining the exact time of coinci
dence, which was found to be a mean of the first disappearance and
the last re-appearance, or that of the first re-appearance and last
disappearance; or rather a mean of       these four times. Mr. Airy

beration produced when it is struck sharply, to the cellular nature of
the beds of indurated clay which form this floor, and have been de
posited from the washings of the surrounding slopes, and hardened
by the influence of heat and moisture.
    The author accounts for the production of two varieties of Piso
lite, which occur in the tufa and decomposed lava of the Solfatara.
This hill is recorded to have been in eruption in A. D. 1180; and
the present crater may have been formed at that late epoch. The
hill which supports the Camaldoli, 1643 feet above the sea, is a re
markable mass of indurated tufa ; from beneath which, on the N. E.
side, crops out a bed of gray-stone, in which a singular concretion
ary separation has taken place, of the augitic from the felspathose
parts; the former appearing as lenticular patches in a base consist
ing of the latter. This and other somewhat similar lavas in the
same neighbourhood, give rise to important inferences as to the
condition of such substances at the period of their emission from the
earth. The solid tufa of Capo di Monte and other hills envelops
shells of the same species with those which at present inhabit the
 Bay of Naples. It is likewise in some points traversed by vertical
veins of a finer and harder matter, seeming to have exuded from
the sides of a fissure formed in the rock, before it was completely
 desiccated.
    The author attributes the formation of all these volcanic hills to
successive eruptions from below the surface of the sea, though on
a shallow shore: and, from the existence of loose tufa over the
 whole plane of the Campagna, and even to some distance up                  prin         its
 cipal valleys,     he
                    infers that the sea once washed the foot                 the          of
Appenines behind Capua; and that this plain has since suffered                                  an
elevation     of
               200 feet          least,--an elevation

    April 11.—A paper by Colonel Beaufoy, was read, containing his
 Observations of Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites, from January 2 to
 May 15, 1826, together with some Observations of occultations of
 stars by the moon.
    A paper was also read “On the Longitude of Madras, as deduced
from Observations of Eclipses of the first and second Satellites of
Jupiter, taken between the years 1817 and 1826.        By John Gold
ingham, Esq. F.R.S."
    The eclipses stated in this paper are 96 in number, being Immer
sions and Emersions of the 1st and 2nd Satellites only. Of these,
 11 are directly comparable with those of Colonel Beaufoy, made
at Bushey Heath, viz.8 of the 1st, and 3 of the 2nd; and their mean
result, which of course is independent of the errors of the tables, is
stated by Mr. Goldingham at 5' 21" 9-3, being the longitude of
Madras east of Greenwich.       The remainder, consisting of 34 Emer
sions and 35 Immersions of the first Satellite, and 12 Emersions and
4 Immersions of the second, are not directly comparable with Colo
nel Beaufoy's. Mr. Goldingham endeavours, however, to render them
so, or at least to eliminate the errors of the tables, by determining
the latter from Colonel Beaufoy's observations made nearly about
the same time, and then applying it to the results of a comparison
of his own with the Nautical Almanac as a correction ; and in this
way deduces a conclusion agreeing almost exactly with the fore
                                                                                                                    -

 Malta; and some apples called the Bess Poole, and the Thoresby
 Seedling, the names of which deserve record from their great beauty

 any apple could have been at Christmas. There was also some fine
 fruit of the Beurrée de Pâques, commonly called the Paddington

on each Wednesday, between the hours of one and five, for the pur
pose of inspecting the museum.        This department consists of ex
 tensive and instructive collections in every branch of zoology; the
value of which is enhanced by the consideration of their being ex
clusively the result of the liberality and public spirit of some of the
leading members.       Lectures on various subjects of interest in zoo
logy have also been given at 3 o'clock during these meetings. Mr.
 Vigors, the Secretary, has delivered some discourses on the Affini
ties of Birds, illustrated by specimens from the Society's museum;
and Mr. Brookes has commenced a series of lectures on Comparative
 Anatomy, selecting the structure of the Ostrich as the subject of
the first lecture on Wednesday the 25th. Several valuable prepa
rations from a specimen of this bird, which His Majesty was gra
ciously pleased to present to the Society, were brought forward to
illustrate this lecture. The gardens of the Society are stated to be
in great forwardness, and it is expected that they will be opened
during the ensuing summer.
               ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN.
    Feb. 23.—Dr. Harwood read a paper from the lecture-table, On
the natural history of the seal.    It was illustrated by numerous fine
specimens and preparations of the animal, from the collection of Mr.
 Brookes and other sources, and by many specimens of the fur and
skin, in the state into which they are brought by the furrier. Dr.
 Harwood particularly remarked upon the amazing expansion of the
olfactory nerves in the Seal, from which, and other circumstances,
he was induced to suggest as probable, that these animals often hunt
 their prey upon the surface of the water by scent. He expressed
his surprise to, that they had not as yet been brought under sub
jection to man, and made to perform the same good offices for him
 in the water that the dog does on land.
    In the library were the contents of a Tumulus found near the Falls
 of Niagara, Upper Canada, and of another in the back settlements of
 Ohio; several Egyptian antiquities, presented by General Tolly;
 and new American and English publications.
    March 2.—The librarian, Mr. Singer, read a paper communi
cated by a member of the Institution, On the principles of the struc
 ture of language. The investigations had been made upon the
  Hebrew tongue, and were illustrated by numerous diagrams.
    The head of the Ghurial of the Ganges, with other fine specimens
 in Natural History, and presents of books, were laid upon the        li
 brary tables.
    March 9.—Mr. Holdsworth made some observations in the lec
 ture-room on the structure of Shipping : they were merely intro
 ductory to some practical and experimental illustrations which are
 to be submitted to the members.           -
    In the library was a specimen of gas for illumination, made by
 Mr. Daniell's process from resin. Resin, tar, and numerous other
sources of highly carbonated combustible gases have hitherto been
objectionable only because during decomposition they choke the
                                                                 retorts

retorts and pipes with carbonaceous matter. Mr. Daniell's process
obviates this objection, and renders these substances readily, oeco
nomically, and in consequence advantageously, available.
     Several new works of art, and presents, were laid upon the tables,
with some very ancient and scarce books.
     March 16–Mr. Ainger gave a brief sketch of the history and
principles of suspension bridges. Simple communications of this
kind were observed to be very numerous and ancient, especially in
Asia; but in them the road was laid on the curved lines of suspen
sion, whereas in the suspension bridges of the last twenty years it has
been hung from these lines in such a manner as to form a horizontal
surface. The credit of the latter application was given to America.
The causes of the great superiority in oeconomy, of suspension over
insistent bridges, was pointed out; and the peculiar advantages
united in iron over those of any other substance explained.                     The
direction and amount of the forces exerted, the necessary strength
required to sustain them, and many other circumstances in their
construction, were then developed and explained by models and
diagrams.
     Numerous specimens of Natural History and of expensive and
rare literary works were laid upon the library tables.
     March 23.-Mr. Reinagle of the Royal Academy delivered a
discourse On the property of beauty contained in the oval. The
peculiar beauty of the ever-varying curve of the oval was pointed
 out, and the manner in which, by the combination of different parts
 of different ovals, arranged according to a certain order,                       the               all

    MM. Thenard and Chevreul reported on a Memoir of M. Sérullas
on the constituents of bromine. “Bromine, with which M. Balard has
lately enriched chemical science, has so great analogy with chlorine
and iodine, that it forms similar combinations with other bodies :
this results from the experiments of M. Balard, and it is confirmed
by the new results of M. Sérullas. These results are the production
of hydrobromic aether and a cyanuret of bromine, which are ob
tained like hydriodic aether and cyanuret of iodine, and which they
resemble very much in their appearance and properties.            Hydro
bromic aether is a colourless    liquid, heavier than   water, very vola
tile, of a strong aethereal odour, a sharp taste, very soluble in alco
hol, from which it is precipitated by water.—As to the cyanuret of
bromine, it crystallizes in long fine needles, it is colourless, very
solid, a very pungent smell, and acts so strongly upon the animal
Geconomy, that a grain of the cyanuret dissolved in water is suffi
cient to kill a rabbit. Added to this, in      the experiments      whichall                          to

                    bromine has been     subjected,  M. Sérullas did not
observe any circumstance which induced him            think that bromine             to
isa   compound body.       M. Sérullas not only repeated before       the                                  us

   General Observations.—The first part of this month to the 16th was wet
and windy, and the latter part cloudy and fine, with occasional showers of
rain and hail. After so dry a winter the rain was very seasonable, and the
subsequent mild sunny days brought on a sudden spring, which has accele
rated the budding, and is rapidly unfolding the leaves of the trees.
    Although the thermometer has only receded twice to the freezing point,
and the weather mild for March, yet the spring is comparatively backward,
which is a favourable circumstance, as an early spring is not very desirable
in this latitude, in consequence of the night frosts which generally follow.
On the 15th at 1 P.M. we had a smart shower of snow, which is later than
we remember to have seen snow here: it was brought on by a change of
wind from W. to N.W. About the same time of the day on the 29th, a
heavy shower of hail fell, and lay on the ground a short time: this was
 also brought on by the inosculations of two winds, one from S.W. the other
from N.W.

 LXXVIII.      Observations on the Crystalline Form of Sillimanite.
                By W. PHILLIPs, F.L.S. G.S. &c."
THIS   mineral was first described by Bowen in the Ameri
  can Journal of Science for May 1824, and is therein said
 to occur in rhomboidal prisms of about 106° 30' and 78° 30',
 the inclination of the base on the axis of the prism being 113°;
 and as having one cleavage parallel to the longest diagonal
 of the prism. In the translation by Haidinger, of Mohs,
 System, &c. the measurements quoted are the same as those
 given by Bowen.                          -
    This mineral being always found, I believe, imbedded, and
 chiefly in quartz,         its
                           prisms are frequently somewhat bent,
 sometimes even twisted; and their planes being generally far
 from bright, and occasionally somewhat convex, are mostly
 unfit for accurate measurement.        Having attempted         mea      to
 sure several     by means        of
                                the reflective goniometer,         was    I
 unable to  find any one affording the measurements above men
 tioned; but almost uniformly found the prism bounded                             by
several longitudinal planes,            of
                                    which however        was difficult
                                                                     it
to  obtain the measurements, for the reasons already stated. At
length I    succeeded       detaching from the matrix some very
                             in
thin  prisms   presenting  but four lateral planes, which afforded
constantly angles       ofabout 88° and 92°; but they were far
from   bright:   these slender prisms are nearly transparent and
colourless,       have only    slight tinge     yellow; and

                                        am led to believe, that
a rhombic prism    of 88° and 92° may, in default of better evi
dence, be adopted as the primary form of this mineral: the
planes of this prism are brighter than the other planes.    The
terminations of the prism are, according to Bowen, oblique to
the axis; but               I
                   have not succeeded in my attempts to find
any indications of cleavage in that direction, nor at right an
gles to the axis. The crystals, indeed, are often separable
with ease nearly in that direction, owing apparently to natural
                            it;
                   but the surfaces produced     the fracture are        by
fissures across
neither even nor brilliant, nor          constant angle with the
                                                      at   a

                                             Philosophy.
        Gentlemen,
 I HAVE        experienced much gratification in reading in your
     Number for February a paper by Mr. John Taylor On
 the explosion of steam-boilers.        The public are
  him for bringing forward a subject of so much interest and
                                                                    to                      iºd

 importance; and am glad to observe that he has set an ex
 ample which I hope to see followed,—that of discussing practi.
 cal subjects in a scientific Journal.
    Having been professionally engaged in the application of
                                                                          its
                                                                 to all
 high-pressure and common steam in               branches, the sub
ject   ofsteam-boilers and the accidents      which they are liable
 have    of
          course occupied my attention.
      have accordingly availed myself         every opportunity                                         af.
 I                                                               or of

                    of        examining      inquiring  into the cir
 cumstances which have attended such explosions                steam                          of

                                                        to
 of  my inquiries has generally been, that these accidents have
 originated either from the carelessness          ignorance       the     or                       of
persons attending the boilers,                         or
                                      from the bad construction                                         of
 the boilers themselves.
    The extreme difficulty       obtaining any thing like informa

often happened, that the only person          persons competent   or                                    to
give such information, have lost their lives        the effect    the           by                 of
explosion; and where this lamentable result does not take
place,   it  too much
               is         expect that men will confess their care

  406                       Remarks on      Mr. J. Taylor's Paper
   steam; and the consequence is the passing over of a quan
   tity of water into the cylinder, to the injury, and sometimes to
   the destruction of the engine itself. On the other hand, if this
   space be divided, not in depth but in cubical contents, there
   is great reason to apprehend the water being allowed to get
   below the top of the tube: a temporary derangement of the
   feed-pump might occasion this, without any very great neglect
   on the part of the engine-man. If this takes place, I scarcely,
   need point out what must be the result.           The expansive force
   of the steam exerted upon the plates rendered soft by the ac
   tion of the fire, would bring down the upper surface; and when
   once the cylindrical form was lost, a further depression would
  be rendered easy. It is quite clear that the upper surface of
  the tube cannot be depressed, without such a strain being
  thrown upon the ends where they form a junction with the
  angle iron, as finally to rend them off. I should observe here,
  that the sort of fracture described by Mr. Taylor in the boiler
  at East Crennis, would in this case present itself; the angle
  iron would appear to be wrenched off by a force -drawing it
  inwards.
      Even where the water is not so far reduced in the boiler as
  to be below the top of the tube, I am by no means inclined
  to consider this boiler in a safe state. At                all

  part       of

that a boiler was not safe where there was only a foot of water
over the fire.            I

than the projection of the tube at Polgooth, which is equally
unaccountable. It by no means follows, because the sides of
the tube were flattened, that these were the first parts to give

          Mr. Henwood                on the Explosion                 of Steam-Boilers.              409
 almost immediately succeeded by an explosion.”—“In this
 case had the rush of flame from the fireplace any thing to do
 with the subsequent explosion ?” I think there can be but
 little doubt that the rush of flame was in consequence of some
 fracture having already taken place in the boiler; probably
 the fissure was not at first of very considerable size, as we
 know that wrought iron does not break at once (as is the case
 with cast iron), but rends.          The rent being at first small, it
 would have occasioned the rush; but as the fissure once made
 weakened the boiler, and the aperture not being sufficiently
 large to permit the escape of a very considerable quantity of
 water or steam, a moment between the gust of flame and the
 explosion would in              all
                               probability have elapsed.         “And ad
 mitting that the steam was                        so
                                           far within the     pressure   that
 could    by  mere expansive force regularly exerted injure such
a   boiler,-might not the rupture                  occasioned    be  the aid               by

 Mr. Taylor as well as myself has doubtless observed the es
cape of large quantities of steam through the stacks: of course
the water in such cases does not undergo decomposition.
   The sudden bursts of flame from the chimneys of steam
engines when observed at night, are in my opinion much
more satisfactorily accounted for, by supposing the flame to be
carried further up the flue at some times than at others, by
the action of gusts of air, which always operate more or less.
This is perhaps more frequently observed on the chimneys of
founderies or tin-smelting houses, than on those of steam-en
gines; and we are very sure that in the former cases no explo
sions ever obtain.        am, &c.   I

engines have often exploded on their being stopped; and that
the immediate cause of explosion, in these cases, is probably an
additional strain on the boiler from within, produced by the
steam, which previously had a free passage, being prevented
from escaping anywhere but at the safety-valve; the aperture
of which, compared with the content of the cylinder, into
which the steam passed before, is very small. Mr. Moore
also suggests, for the purpose of obviating accidents from such
a cause, the application of a large valve on the tube, adjacent
to the part where the steam is prevented from passing to the
engine.—EDIT.

argument which militates mainly against the hypothesis, is
drawn from the phaenomena of expansion and contraction,
which are impossible, as it is framed at present, which is ex
cessively nearly, and in most parts precisely, the same with
Dr. Hooke's (See Micrographia).
    In a number of the Annals of Philosophy, (but at what time                                                              I
cannot exactly state, since I have not the series at hand,) I en
deavoured to show how the particles of solid matter, being al
ways in contact with each other, and obeying the laws which are
known to exist, may alter their relative position, and thereby
produce a change in the volume of the entire mass. The parti
cles being always in contact with each other in certain points,
their order of arrangement admits of every variety between the
angles of 60° and 90°, being held in equilibrio by the balance
of two opposite forces: hence may result every variety of form
in crystals, as well as the direction of the cleavages, as also
the phaenomenon of the enlargement of the acute, and dimi
nution of the obtuse angles.       According to this hypothesis, the
force of cohesion is    produced    by the actual contact of the par
ticles of matter, which force is so greatly diminished by se
paration to the least distance, (Newtoni Principia, lib. i. sect.
 12, 13,) that it is commonly said to vanish: the first sepa
ration to even the least distance destroys that force which is
i.
properly termed cohesive; and the particles are then held to
  ether by the force of the whole particle, as in liquids, as has
        shown in the former papers.

LXXXII.             On retaining              Water in Rocks for Summer Use.
         By Mr. WILLIAM SMITH, Engineer, M.Y.P.S.*
   practical applications of knowledge acquired from geo
ASlogy in relation to the comforts and conveniences of man
in a most essential article of life, must be considered                           matter
of importance,          I
                   hope to be excused for troubling the Society
                                                 I
with a detailed account of what may call a Geological Reser
voir of water made in the hills near Scarborough in the dry
est summer this country has experienced for sixty years.
   We know from the annual variation of springs, that rocks
hold a much greater quantity of water in winter than in sum
mer; and we further know, that in wet seasons rocks hold pe
riodically much more than their annual average quantity both
in winter and summer: and hence the question as to the pos
sibility of retaining water in rocks for summer use is decided
by the annual and periodical operations of nature.
   For the means of altering or improving some of these na
tural operations, so as to render the irregular supply of water
which falls upon the earth more convenient to the general
purposes of man, we must resort to geology;-to find what
stratum is fitting for the object, and what site in the range
thereof; what the rock lies upon; what stratum or diluvium
covers    it,
           and the dip, rises, and troughs    undulations   theor                  in
Strata.

water,    some cases extensive enough for the use
          in                                           canals:               of

issue from a bore-hole made several years since for draining
the land. On cutting an open channel up to this, the dis
charge increased and at the depth of nine or ten feet amounted
to twenty-four hogsheads per hour.   This encouraged them to
 proceed; and the channel under my direction was deepened
 four feet, when the discharge became for some time fifty or
 sixty hogsheads per hour.
                        an intermediate and subsequent diminu
 tion that we had drawn off a confined stock of water, and that
 the regular run of the spring at the end of a dry summer
 might not be found sufficient, I suggested the propriety of
 damming up the produce of this spring for summer use, as
 the previous supply was more than sufficient for the town in
 winter.
    The circumstances were favourable for the purpose, as there
 was no other known issue of water from the rock in that hill,
 which is about a mile long, narrow on the top, and insulated
in   allthe upper part                  of    its
                                 stratification. The same rock                                      is

 between the clay and the face of the rock tapered downward
 “to nothing” in the bottom of the excavation.
    About two yards within the edge of the rock (which was
nearly as upright as a wall) a basin six feet in diameter and four
 feet deep was excavated, to receive the water flowing from the
joints of the rock. Cast-iron pipes branching from the main
line of pipes were laid up to this basin, to receive the regular
flow of the spring, which before the end of summer was re
duced to less than six hogsheads per hour. The clay chan
nel, in the bottom of which the pipes were laid, was refilled
with clay and puddled, so that no water could pass from the
rock but through the pipes. The end of the last pipe was closed,
and a vertical aperture made for receiving the run of the
spring. No further contrivance was required for stopping the
water and damming it up in the rock, than an open vertical
pipe ground to          tight into the aperture

the blood to the air, some time before the component parts of
the air were discovered: and Priestley fully proved that this
is owing to the oxygenous part of the air alone; and that car
bonic acid and azote have the contrary effect, reducing bright
scarlet blood to a purple colour. And it is conjectured that
this change is owing to the presence of iron, and experienced
by the red globules alone.
   The preservation of the life of the blood, and thence of the
body, would seem greatly to depend upon the change by which
this bright scarlet colour is constantly renewed and preserved;

does he mention the investing vesicle or the central nucleus:
and what is singular, he never could discover them in some
animals, as in the silkworm and lobster. He regards these
bodies as liquids possessing a central attraction, which deter
mines their figure.    Torré stated them to be like flattened
annular bodies, or like rings composed of a number of se
parate parts cemented together.       To Monro, they appeared
as circular flattened bodies like coins, with a dark spot in the
centre, which he conceived was     owing  to a depression, and
not to     a    perforation.             Cavallo believes                 them          to be simple
spheres.The account recently given of these bodies by Dr.
Young confirms in a degree the statement of Hewson. He
remarks, that if the globules be viewed by a strong light, they
will appear like simple transparent spheres; but that if we
examine them by a confined and diversified light, we shall be
better able to ascertain their real figure and structure.             The
red particles of the skate, as being larger and more distinct, are
better fitted for such an examination. These are almond-shaped,
and consist of an external envelope containing a central nu
cleus.     This central nucleus is independent of the envelope;
for when this latter has been removed or destroyed, the mu
                                               of its
cleus still appears to retain           original form                            *.
     With regard          to

 422              Dr. Spurgin's Outlines of a Philosophical
amined a small portion of human blood on a glass plate, to                                              :
ascertain the real shape and size of the globules.   then found                 I
in one square of the micrometer (which was the 160,000dth
part of a square inch) two of these globules, which were se
parated to a considerable distance from the rest; they were
entirely disengaged from the colouring substance, and lay in
pure clear serum, which covered the surface of the whole square
inch of the micrometer.   Having placed this particular square
immediately under the focus of the microscope, I attentively
examined the globules for about six or eight minutes, when                                         I
perceived two extremely minute opaque spots arising in the
clear serum within the same square of the micrometer, and
which seemed increasing in size. In a few minutes more I
perceived five or six more such opaque spots arising and gra
dually increasing, and assuming the same form and appear
ance as the two original globules; but the moisture of the
serum being nearly evaporated,                        I
                                    diluted it with water, when
 all the seven new    globules,   well    the two original ones,

                                        precisely the same shape
and white colour; and three        the new globules were
                                              of                the                       of

                  on as
same size     the             ones,  but the rest were smaller.
When left      the glass     dry, the globules remained
                                     to                         the                       of

     To do justice, however, to the labours and ingenuity of the
past age, we are bound to confess that but little more is known
at this day, concerning the proximate elements or ingredients
of the blood than at the time alluded to: and that whilst some
addition has been made to the store of our knowledge on this
head, some material facts known to the physiologists of that age
have either been lost or overlooked; and what is worse, certain
facts have been recently regarded as new discoveries and ob
servations, which are not so. The illustrious men to whose
labour and ingenuity we are now adverting more especially, are
Leeuwenhoek, Lancisius, Boérhaave, Gulielmus, Malpighi,
 Heister, and others. To adduce an instance or two: Leeuwen
hoek distinctly speaks of the globules in the serum, which Sir
 E. Home informs us were first seen and described by Mr. Bauer,
and the existence of which Mr. Faraday afterwards confirmed.
 The opinion of the spherules arranging themselves into right
 lines and forming fibres, was entertained by Leeuwenhoek be
 fore Prevost and Dumas or Mr. Bauer were in existence.
 The destructive distillation of the mass of the blood, as per
 formed by modern chemists, differs but little in                  results      its
from those      of    an
                      earlier date; but            as

the contrary, in narrow entrances, like the haven of Yar
mouth, the tidal waters speedily sustain a material decrease
in their height; and in this instance, we have seen that the
level of Lake Breydon is from one to three feet lower than
the ocean, from which it is separated by an alluvial bank
not half a mile across.       If to the thickness of the bed of ooze

     That the same causes which finally closed the aestuary at
  Caister, were simultaneously operating to bar the ancient
  haven at Kirkley, and probably to exclude the sea from the
  more northerly inlets.
     That as soon as the admission of the tide was limited to
 one narrow and obstructed inlet, the quantity thenceforward
  was so trifling that “many thousand acres became dry, and
  in time good pasturage for cattle.” With the assistance of em
  bankments, the entire level of marshes became firm land; rich
  vegetation covered                 its
                                surface, and the rivers were restricted
 to   their  deep   channels.

               is                  that change whose traces are yet

444             Professor  Airy in reply    to  Mr. Ivory.
which    I  paid to Mr. Ivory's.        This is merely to account for
the introduction of the note.            What foundation Mr. Ivory
 can find for the    charges  of  “injury    on the authority of mere
assertion,” “flippancy,” and “supercilious importance,”                I
 cannot imagine. I have simply stated my difference of opinion
from Mr. Ivory on a point which            I  was unable, from the na
ture of the     paper,  to explain   at  greater  length. The note is
now before      your   readers;   and I appeal to them whether         I
have said any thing which can justify the use of such expres
 sions.   Upon the whole,       I  think that I have reason to com
plain of the terms in which Mr. Ivory has mentioned me, as
most improper, and most unworthy of the respect which a
   entleman ought to have for himself, as well as for any other
who claims that title.
    The only probable cause for Mr. Ivory's anger, independent
º
of our difference of opinion, appears to be my omission of
the reasons for that difference of opinion.           The cause of that
omission    I  have  explained:    but that Mr.     Ivory  may have for
the future no     ground   of complaint,     I shall state here my rea
sons for disagreeing with him.           Mr. Ivory's opinion was first
              in the Phil. Trans. for 1824, p. 101–108; but he
 has explained it in nearly the same terms in the Philosophical
Magazine for July 1826.         I shall request your readers, there
fore, to refer to page 4 of that Number; and I shall begin
my remarks at line 25.          By the common theory it is known
that if the forces which act on a fluid satisfy a certain equation,
any level surface (couche de niveau) may, by the removal of a
part of the fluid, become the external surface of the remaining
fluid which is still in equilibrium. But this is true as a general
proposition only when the forces are expressed by the same
functions of the coordinates, whether the quantity of fluid be
great or small. It appears then, from the common theory of
fluids, that Mr. Ivory's proposition advanced in the sentence
beginning in line 25, is certainly true, if there be no mutual
attraction of the particles; but is not certainly true, if there be
such attraction.      It may happen, and in the particular case of
which he treats it does happen, to be true, when the mutual
attraction is taken into account, but this is quite accidental.
The two following sentences are elucidations of the preceding:
the latter of them is of course to be taken with the same re
strictions as that of which      I  have treated; namely, it is to be
supposed that the particles have no mutual attraction. With
this supposition the reasoning of the next sentence, which
depends entirely on the existence of attraction, falls to the
ground.                                           I
             And after much consideration am quite unable to
see  any  force in the reasoning upon which I have commented.
                                                              Whatever

                            Professor Airy in reply to                          Mr. Ivory.                             445
Whatever may be the meaning of the expression “similar
forces,”         I
             am quite unable to discover in the sentence begin
ning at line 22, any grounds for the inference in line 25.
Perhaps              I
               may place the question in a clearer point of view,
in the following manner. If a fluid mass in equilibrium, acted
on by any external forces, and by the mutual attraction of                                                                its
particles, were inclosed            thin shell      the same shape, there      of
                                               on in
                                                   a
would            be      no
                  pressure         the shell.     Or,          pressure were           if    a
communicated            the fluid (by slightly contracting the shell,
                              bya to
                       force acting                          on
                                             small piston), the pressure
                      of or
suppose,                                                         a

        a        surface would           the same       beevery part         the    in                            of

                                                                     spread                      to    be                 on
the shell, and (from the action             the external forces, the at
                                                             of
               the inclosed fluid, and the mutual attraction
                  of                                                                                                      its

 own particles)                    to
                         receive the form         equilibrium.            of not                            I
 see the slightest reason         believe that the pressure
                                               to                     the shell,                            on

equal. Though the whole force which acted                       every particle                   on
     the original external surface must have been perpendicular
to inthat surface, and consequently the whole force arising from
 the external forces and the attraction                   the original fluid        of

to remind Mr. Ivory, that the equilibrium would not be dis
turbed if the resultant of these attractions were a force ex
pressed by a function of the coordinates of the attracted point,
similar to the function expressing the previously-acting forces
(including the attraction), and that there does not therefore
appear to be any reason for saying that it must be evanes
Cent.
   These are my reasons for not admitting Mr. Ivory's new
equation.       I
               have stated them plainly, but I hope not unci
villy: if I am wrong, I shall be glad to have my errors pointed
out in the same manner.            I              I
                                trust that shall not be exposed
to the  charge  of presumption   for holding the opinion of            La
place and Poisson, in opposition to that of which Mr. Ivory
is (I believe) the sole advocate.
   But Mr. Ivory says that             I
                                   misapprehend his conditions,
which he has always limited to the case of homogeneity.
        I
When wrote the note in question, I was perfectly aware that
the algebraical investigations which Mr. Ivory had founded
on his equation were confined to homogeneous fluids: but
I  did not so clearly know that the reasoning was equally re
stricted.   I have since examined the reasoning with some at
tention; and         I
                 declare, that I cannot discover any part of it
which is not as applicable to heterogeneous fluids as to homo
geneous fluids. Judging from my own feelings, think that       I
the scientific world would be much obliged to Mr. Ivory, if he
would point out the parts of his reasoning which are not ap
plicable to heterogeneous fluids.
   Mr. Ivory “consoles himself because he knows with the
certainty of demonstration, that my problem is not solved, and
cannot possibly be solved except by his theory.”         console   I
myself by thinking that Mr. Ivory has not reasoned with his
usual accuracy upon a point which is somewhat abstruse, and
by believing that my problem is solved (as far as such a pro
blem can be solved) without the assistance of Mr. Ivory's
equation.
    I  had intended to confine my remarks to the offensive
note in which Mr. Ivory has treated me so unhandsomely.
But as Mr. Ivory has in the preceding page mentioned an
other point on which we are at variance, I will endeavour
to lay before your readers a more complete statement of the
argument than he has given. I think it proper to say, that              I
have no reason whatever to complain of the terms in which
he has there mentioned my name.
   The first part of my paper (as Mr. Ivory has correctly
stated) is employed in attempting to prove that Laplace's fun
damental equation (Méc, Cél. liv.          iii.

fesses to be general; mine applies  only  to the cases in which

ages in three different directions, two of which are at right
angles to each other, like the two principal cleavages of com
mon felspar, are obtained with the same facility, and present
the same characters.       The third has a nacreous appearance,
is obtained as  easily  as the other two, and is found by the re
flective  goniometer   to be perpendicular to one of them, and
to make with the other an angle of 106° 50'.         So that the
solid obtained by cleavage is a tetrahedral prism, such as
fig. 1, the incidences of the planes of which are as follow:
         P, g =               90°.               P, h = 106° 50'.                          g', h = 90°.
  This substance in the specimens from Dawlish, is white
with a slight tinge of red, and is opake; it is accompanied by
quartz, a little mica, and very minute crystals of black tour
maline disseminated throughout the mass. The whole forms
rather a compact rock; but in some specimens the substance is
partly or entirely disintegrated, almost pulverulent, and of a
pure white colour.
   Mr. Brayley jun. having kindly given me for examination se
veral specimens he had himself collected, of the conglomerate
of Heavitree, near Exeter, I found disseminated among the
minerals and rocks which compose                   great many crystals    it,   a                                           of

specimens from     Dawlish; and instead of the silvery reflection
of  light of the latter, presents a gold-yellow reflection, ge
nerally not uniform but in spots.        It somewhat resembles in
this respect the variety of felspar called sun-stone, and when
cut in a proper manner gives a similar play of light: but the
red marl which is generally disseminated throughout the
crystal, prevents the effect from being so great as it may rea
sonably be supposed it would have been had not that circum
stance interfered.     A further comparison between this sub
stance and sun-stone would have been very interesting; but
I  could not procure the sight of a rough sun-stone, to examine
whether it had any indication of cleavage; and the very high
value set upon those which are cut, does not leave much hope
of our being allowed to cleave them.                               -
    The natural plane itself parallel to the nacreous cleavage
presents frequently a gold-yellow reflection. Simple and ma
cled crystals are also found divided in two parts by a thin
layer of red marl in a direction parallel to the nacreous
cleavage, as if the crystal had been broken and cemented
again.     Small perihexahedral crystals of black mica are
sometimes found in the interior of the crystals. Thin laminae
parallel to either of the two cleavages perpendicular to one
another, are sometimes transparent. The hardness of the sub
stance is rather less than that of felspar.       Mr. Kent has been
so good as to take with great care the specific gravity, and has
found it to be 2.5091:     I  had found it somewhat lower, but    I
give in preference his result, as being determined with greater
accuracy. Mr. R. Phillips has also had the kindness to ana
lyse the substance, and has found the following result:
              Silica . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 68-6
              Alumina .     . . . . . . . . . . .   16-6

                                                   100-0
,   I have now to state the reasons which induce me to consi
der these crystals as belonging to a species distinct from fel
spar. The characters which are common to both are very
apparent: they both possess cleavages in two directions per
 pendicular to each other; they have nearly the same hardness,
nearly the same specific gravity; and the analysis, although
indicating a greater proportion of silica and a smaller propor
tion of alumina than the adularia analysed by Vauquelin, and
 the common felspar analysed by Klaproth, presents precisely
 the same result as the analysis of glassy-felspar by the latter.
 Finally, the macled crystals have a very remarkable resem
blance to the macled crystals of felspar found in Auvergne
                                                                and

and in Bohemia, and represented in the translation of Mohs's
“Mineralogy,” by figures 80 and 81. For in both, the axis of
revolution is perpendicular to one of the two cleavages at
right angles to each other, and in felspar the second cleavage
of one of the individual crystals forming the macle is inclined
upon the second cleavage of the other, at an angle of 127°3',
 according to the dimensions I have assigned to the primitive
 form of felspar; whilst in the crystals under consideration, the
 same angle is about 128°.
    The only difference which is now left to distinguish this
 mineral from felspar, whether in                 laminar form,        its  the                       as   in

 Heavitree,       therefore the nacreous cleavage which
                  is                                                       pos                        it

 felspar.    But not only this cleavage does not exist                 the va                        in
 rieties of felspar  which have hitherto been examined, but                                                   it   is

   In the Philosophical Transactions for 1825, the author alluded
to the derangement of the Cambridge Transit Instrument, arising
from unequal expansion of                    its

  THE ordinary      business of the evening being now terminated, it
  remains to fulfil the object for which we are especially convened
  this night, which is one of no less interest than the distribution of
  the Honorary Medals awarded by your Council, in pursuance of the
  principle of encouraging works of great labour, high practical utility,
  and steady perseverance in astronomical observation, and in re

  origin of this Society, explanatory of             its

   scope has been found for selection in the merits of our own com
   patriots, and in the home list of our members.      It is not that great
  and    important   Astronomical works have not emanated from our
  continental neighbours: on the contrary, the spirit of research and
  discovery appears to have prevailed with extraordinary activity; and
  the last year has even witnessed the addition to our system of an
  other of those singular bodies, the discovery of which has conferred
  so much lustre on the names of Halley and Encke.            No less than
  three independent claimants to the almost simultaneous disclosure
 of this interesting fact may be enumerated; and this circumstance,
  while it marks the spirit of the age more forcibly perhaps than any
  trait which could be produced, must obviously render it impossible
  for this Society to interfere or decide on the priority and rank of
  the competitors.      But though unmarked by any tangible memorial
  of our approbation, the names of Biela, Clausen, and Gambart
 will not the less be cherished among us, and enrolled by posterity
  in the choicest and most permanent annals of Astronomical ce
 lebrity.
     It is however for labours of a very different kind that our medals
 are this day to be conferred: labours, if less brilliant, yet more
 vital; if less associated with lofty speculations on the nature of the
 universe, yet more intimately linked with the practical uses of this
 world.     The first award of your Council is that of a gold and silver
 medal    respectively  to your late excellent President Mr. Baily, and
 your indefatigable Secretary Mr. Stratford, for their joint labours
 in the construction of the Catalogue of 2881 principal fixed stars,
 which forms the Appendix to the second volume of the Memoirs
 of this Society.
     A catalogue of stars may be considered in two very distinct lights,
 either as a mere list of objects placed on record, to fix on them the
 attention of astronomers, and to afford them matter for observation,
 or as a collection of well-determined zero points, offering ready
 means of comparing their observations with those of others, and of
detecting and allowing for instrumental errors.        In this light onlyI
shall now consider it as chiefly of importance to the practical as
 tronomer.      It is for his uses that an amount of pains, labour, and
 expense, both national and individual, has been bestowed on the per
 fection of such catalogues, which on a superficial view must appear
 in the last degree lavish, but which yet has been no more than the
necessity of the case demands.         If we ask to what end magnificent
establishments are maintained       by  states and sovereigns, furnished
with    master-pieces   of art, and placed  under the direction of men of
first-rate talent, and high-minded enthusiasm, sought out for those
qualities among the foremost in the ranks of science:—if we demand
cui bono? for what good a Bradley has toiled, or a Maskelyne or a
Piazzi worn out his venerable age in watching? the answer is,-not
to settle mere speculative points in the doctrine of the universe; not
to cater for the pride of man, by refined inquiries into the remoter
mysteries of nature, to trace the path of our system through infinite
space, or  its  history through past and future eternities. These in
deed are noble ends, and which am far from any thought

     MR. BAILY,
   Accept this Medal, which    the Astronomical Society bestows on
you, by an award which every astronomer in Europe will confirm.
The work you have accomplished will identify you with the future
progress of that Science, into almost every department of which it is
calculated to infuse new life ; since every practical astronomer has
in it to thank you for an accession of power. It is needless for me
to accompany this testimony of the sense the Society entertains of
your distinguished merits, with the expression of a hope that your
exertions in the cause of Astronomy will continue.     You could not
struggle against nature so far as to desist from pursuits which, de
 manding of ordinary men a total devotion of their time, and con
centration of their whole intellectual powers, have been to you a
relaxation from the most active business. Possessing thus within
yourself a source of pure and exalted enjoyment, enhanced by the
consciousness of public utility, and a certainty of the approval and
admiration of those whom you esteem, we can only add our wishes
that length of years, and continuance of health, may render your
distinguished talents, and rare zeal for the promotion of your favour

the first mighty     step which pointed out a connection between spe
culative   Astronomy      and practical utility, and which, replacing the
fast  dissipating   dreams of astrology by nobler visions, showed how
the stars   might   really and without fiction be called arbiters of the
destinies of empires,--we owe to the satellites of Jupiter; to those
atoms, imperceptible to the naked eye, and floating like motes in
the beam of their primary—itself an atom to our sight—noticed
only by the careless vulgar as a large star, and by the philosophers
of former ages as something moving among the stars—they knew not
what—nor why; perhaps only to perplex the wise with fruitless
conjectures, and harass the weak with fears as idle as their theories.
    No wonder now that the eclipses of the satellites were watched
with anxious, earnest interest; they were soon to afford matter for
yet greater wonder and deeper contemplation. Roemer's discovery
of the velocity of light from the retardation of their eclipses about
the end of the 17th century, was the next in order, and the subli
mest truth they were destined to be the means of unfolding; a
truth so amazing, so overwhelming to human faculties, that (not to
mention the feebler names of Cassini, Maraldi and Fontenelle) even
the comprehensive genius of a Hooke quailed before                  and refused                  it,
to admit the existence of            motion so little short of infinite                                          in

              ACTION OF AFTHERS ON VARIOUS BODIES.
       M. Henry, senior, has made numerous experiments on the above
  named subject, and has arrived at the following conclusions:—first,
  with respect to sulphuric ather. In this the easily oxidable metals
  and oxides, capable of combining with acetic acid, give rise to the
  formation of acetates, probably by decomposing, not the sulphuric
 aether, but the acetic aether which is always found in          The author                       it.

      NEUTRALIZING THE MAGNETISM                               OF WATCH-WORKS.
    Mr. Abraham, of Sheffield, has contrived an extremely easy and
effectual mode of divesting watch-works of their magnetism. The
process consists in dipping the part to be divested of magnetism, as
a balance-wheel, into fine steel filings, and then presenting a fine
magnet to the part covered with them, at a distance of a quarter
to one inch, according to the power to be neutralized.       It will be
directly observed whether the polarity of the magnet be of the
same kind as that in the apparatus; if so, the filings will gradually
fall from the part as the power becomes neutralized. When           the                           all
filings have fallen from the part submitted        experiment, dip       to                             it

   General Observations.—The first part of this month to the 16th was mild
 and generally dry; but the latter part, excepting the last three days, was
cold, with frequent showers of rain and hail, and hoar-frost in the morn
ings. The mean temperature of the air was so low on the 22nd, 23rd,
24th, and 25th, that it became necessary to resume office fires, which had
been dispensed with from the beginning of the month.
   On the 24th we had several smart showers of pulpy hail without icy
nuclei, sufficient to whiten the surrounding hills; and in the northern parts
of Hampshire the hills were lightly covered with snow : on the same day
the snow on Malvern hills in Worcestershire, and on Blagdon hills in So
mersetshire, is said to have been several inches deep.     It was brought on
by the union of a Westerly wind with an upper current which had blown
several days from the North-east.      During one week of the low tempera
ture and frosty mornings the spring lay dormant, and no progress appeared
in the bloom of the fruit-trees.      -
   The Swallows returned here on the 13th, but from the change in the
weather they were very little on the wing for a fortnight afterwards.
   The Barometer has been remarkably steady this month, on some days
it was quiescent; and the number of changes is comparatively few for April.
The mean temperature of the external air for this period is nearly one
degree higher than the mean of April for the last eleven years.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are two parhelia, three solar and three lunar halos,
four meteors, and two gales of wind from the North-east.
