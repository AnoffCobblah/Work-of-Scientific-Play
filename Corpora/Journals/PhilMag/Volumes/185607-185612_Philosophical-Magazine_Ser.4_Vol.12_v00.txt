                          We have determined this work to be in the public domain
                          in the United States of America. It may not be in the
                          public domain in other countries. Copies are provided
                          as a preservation service. Particularly outside of the
                          United States, persons receiving copies should make
                          appropriate efforts to determine the copyright status
                          of the work in their country and use the work accordingly.
                          It is possible that current copyright holders, heirs or
                          the estate of the authors of individual portions of the
                          work, such as illustrations or photographs, assert copyrights
                          over these portions. Depending on the nature of subsequent
                          use that is made, additional rights may need to be obtained
                          independently of anything we can address. The digital

I.    On the Demonstration of Fresnel's Formulas for Reflected and
     Refracted Light; and their Applications. By the Rev. BADEN
     Powell, M.A., F.R.S. &c., Savilian Professor of Geometry in
     the University of Oaford+.
l,
      A. QUESTION
          of the theory
                                  between two fundamentally different views
                                     of polarization, which has been long
agitated among inquirers into the undulatory theory, viz. as to
the direction of the plane of vibrations in relation to that of
polarization, has of late excited more peculiar interest, partly
from the announcement, a few years ago, of a remarkable crucial
experiment by Professor Stokes, and partly from several subse
quent investigations, especially the recent elaborate discussion of
the general bearing of the experimental evidence by M. Haidinger.
    The revival of this question recalls the attention of the student
to the very unsatisfactory condition in which the elementary de
monstration of those parts of the theory on which it depends has
long been left, and from which recent speculations have done
little to deliver it,
    2. The well-known and remarkable formulas originally given
by Fresnel to express the amplitudes of the vibrations, and thence
the intensities, of reflected and refracted rays of polarized light
 (for singly-refracting media), which are found to represent so
beautifully     all
                 the observed changes,       fact including the whole
                                                    in
doctrine   of plane polarization, and thus invaluable        inductive as
laws, yet long remained confessedly defective            their system
                                                             as   to
atic deduction from    theory.
     3. Fresnel, indeed, with that marvellous sagacity for which
 he  was  soconspicuous, satisfied himself             of
                                               their truth     reason       by
                       *    Communicated    by the Author.

2         Prof. Powell         on the Demonstration         of Fresnel's         Formulas
ing on assumptions in some instances confessedly empirical, in
others dependent on analogies, or hypotheses not free from doubt,
and at any rate little connected into a system.
   4. This investigation, whose questionable points are so fairly
stated, and ably grappled with, by Mr. Airy in his tract on the
Undulatory Theory (1831, art. 128 et seq.), has been since pur
sued on different principles by M. Cauchy, and especially by the
late Prof. Maccullagh in his memoir “On the Laws of Crystal
line Reflexion and Refraction” (Mem. Roy. Irish Acad. vol. xviii.
1838), whose views have been ably but briefly expounded by
Dr. Lloyd in his Lectures on the Wave Theory (part 2. p. 30,
1841).    More recently, Mr. Power has investigated the subject
by a systematic analysis, directed to other objects, but including
an important element in these deductions (“On Absorption of
Rays,” &c., Phil. Trans. 1854, part                       1).
       But among these distinguished philosophers there exists
      5.
considerable diversity, and even contradiction     views.  Nor,           of                            so

                                                                                     to as
far    I  am aware, has the subject been      discussed        enable                     to
to as  trace the source   these      of
                                 discrepancies,    fairly    estimate or
the claims     the opposing theories,
                         of                the force  or  the experi           of
mental results which bear upon them. Thus              seems highly        it
desirable, that questions affecting      fundamental part
                                                     so           the           a

undulatory theory should        cleared    beand  placed   up     un                  on

   Having long ago thrown aside some investigations                the                            on

the respective rays deduced on the supposition that the vibra
tions are perpendicular to the plane of incidence, another set (K)
on the supposition that they are parallel to that plane. Now
those of Maccullagh, which correspond closely to Fresnel's first
set (H), are deduced on the contrary supposition of vibrations
parallel to incidence, while those corresponding to Fresnel's
second set (K) are for vibrations perpendicular to that plane.
   8. In either investigation the formulas (K) are those which
represent evanescence of the light at the polarizing angle, while
the formulas (H) represent brightness at that incidence.

   plane,      this second incidence, must

        18. It may here be observed, that if we admit equal densities,
    we must nevertheless suppose some retarding power in the aether
    within the denser medium. It is still conceivable that this may
    follow the same law as that of increased density, and that thus
    Fresnel's formula might still apply.
       Or again, this reduces itself to the condition, that for perpen

   Such is the principle of equivalent vibrations, according to
Prof. Maccullagh; in other words, it is founded on the pro
position that “the incident and reflected vibrations are equivalent
to the refracted.”
   30. It does not appear to what extent Fresnel had adopted
any generalized view of this kind; but in the deduction of his
formula, he introduces an equation which is equivalent to
                                      h–W-           “<U+017F>h"
                                                     cosi
    for vibrations parallel to the plane of incidence; and if we sup
    pose this to be the expression for the law of equivalence, in that
    case we must also take for that of perpendicular vibrations,
-                                           h—h'=h.
    In   other words, the law of equivalent vibration, according to
    Fresnel's view, will differ from that of Maccullagh in that it
    affirms the proposition that “the refracted and reflected vibrations
    are equivalent to the incident.”
        These values of h, which we will call (L), may be combined
    in the same expression as before (L). .
                                    Equation         of vis    viva.
       31. That the amplitudes of the vibrations are the measures of
    the velocities of those vibrations whose time is constant, is obvious;
    and further, that the square of the amplitude or velocity, multi
    plied by the vibrating mass, is the true measure of the intensity;
    and consequently that the principle of vis viva, of which it is a
    simple application, is true, undoubtedly receives ample proof
    à posteriori, inasmuch as all the calculations founded on this
    principle agree to such extreme accuracy with the experimental
    results, whatever question may have existed as to    establish              its
    ment   à   priori.
       32. Mr. Power, assuming the general principle, but following
     an  original analytical method, deduces directly expressions for
    the vis viva     the incident, reflected, and refracted ray respect

              consider, first, a single line of vibrating molecules,
we may investigate the vis viva of that line; but from this pro
ceeding to the vibrating mass, we must multiply the previous ex
pression by the density (or equivalent retarding property), which
we may express generally by 8 and 8, for the external and                                                in
ternal aether; and by the rectangular breadths of the oblique
rays on the same base or section of the surface, which will be
respectively proportional to cos i and cos r thus we shall have
in general for the multipliers, 8 cos i and 8, cos r ; the former for
the incident and reflected, the latter for the refracted ray.

   36. In some of these investigations, reference has been made
to the mechanical doctrine of the impact of elastic bodies, to
which the communication of vibratory motion in aether presents
so striking an analogy. The well-known equations expressing
the law of impact are adopted directly as the basis of Fresnel's
proof in the case of vibrations perpendicular to the plane of                                            in
cidence, giving rise to his formulas (H).
   The very same equation is deduced by Maccullagh from his
abstract dynamical principles, without reference to the above
mentioned analogy; but applied on the same hypothesis as to
the vibrations, and on his assumption as to the density, it pro
duces his formulas (K).                             -

those of Fresnel, as before given, in that the numerator of k is
here negative for i < w and positive for i > a.
   This difference is traceable to the process by which the deduc

means     of two equations             (see    Airy's Tract,        S    129), one of which

Or
                       a    cos i(sin        2rsin 2i)= cos r(sin”2i);
whence, substituting                   in     this equation the value from (P),                         it
becomes

16      Prof. Powell on the Demonstration         of Fresnel's      Formulas
as they fulfil the conditions with the upper or lower sign: in
this way we reproduce the foregoing results, which it is needless
here to repeat.
                       Eagerimental Evidence.
   53. That the whole series of experimental results relative to
polarization are accurately represented by the foregoing formulas,
has been fully substantiated by the researches of Fresnel, Arago,
Brewster, and others; but these changes afford no distinctive
test between the several theories here adverted to.
   54. It may be desirable more particularly here to notice the
interpretation of the change of sign in these formulas,
   In general it is obvious, that in the elementary formula
                       u-h sinº (ºt-º);
if we   suppose a increased to a +
                                       § we have

           X.                     X.     X.
                                                                                 2
or that a difference   of sign indicates    a change       of 180° in       phase,
and that this is equivalent to a change        of   : in   route,
    55. This conclusion includes the solution of the difficulty as
to the loss or gain of half a wave-length between reflexion at the
first surface of a dense medium represented by sin (i-r), where
we have i > r, and at the second, where we have i < r, which
gives —sin (i-r),      a difficulty which so long embarrassed the
early history of the theory, and which it is perhaps desirable to
state thus clearly, though of so elementary a character, as it
would sometimes appear to be still felt.
    There are, however, other cases when this change of sign is
material.
                         Intensities   of Light.
   56. The intensities of the reflected and refracted rays at dif
ferent incidences, as compared with that of the incident light,
are measured by the vires viva, that        is,   by
                                             the vibrating masses
multiplied      by
               the squares    the amplitudes
                             of                        or
                                                 velocities.
   Thus, considering the intensity      the incident ray
                                          of                 unity,    as
for (H) let
                        I=mh”,         I,-m/h,”,
and for   (K)    let
                        J–mk”, Ji-m,k};

                                          J– k”, J-ºk';
whence, calculating the values of h, h, and k, k, for the several
incidences, we have the intensities directly.
   But from the equation of vis viva we have
                                              (1–h!”)= ##,
                                              (1–4)=##.
Thus, knowing only the values h' and                obtain    once those k',     we              at
ke,of
        the refracted intensities, instead   having     calculateof  and                  to              h,
        which   is  troublesome
                    a             process; thus we take  simply
                                     I,-1—h”,                 J–1—k”.
And this,       it   will       be   observed,           is   independent                 of   any hypothesis
as to densities.
   57.         If   we
             calculate   and   directly   I,          J,                       as  above, the values            of
the amplitudes will differ according                                             the hypotheses          of
                                                                         as to
                                                                                                     the
density: but then                    we   have      to     before, that (denoting

Thus, either way, the calculated intensities will                                               be   the same   on

 perpendicular to the plane of polarization, has been lately dis
 cussed at large by M. Haidinger, who, after an extended com
 parative view of the experimental consequences involved in con
 nexion with various optical phaenomena on either supposition,
 decides in favour of the superior simplicity and consistency of
 Fresnel's view, that the plane of vibration is perpendicular to the
 plane of polarization.          (See Phil. Mag. March 1856, vol.                                              xi.

20           Mr. A. Cayley                on the Cones which pass through
that is the perpendicular position, the changes in the inclination
of the diffracted ray will be much less rapid, or the indications
more crowded together, than near the parallel position (90°), or
the plane of diffraction.
    But we can observe the changes only in the plane of polariza
tion.       If,
            then, these changes are more slow near the perpen

also satisfied per se when P=0, Q=0, R=0, i. e. when the

of the equation, and in fact the cone is in this case of the second

showing that it is a cone.

          is      more importance, and         more peculiar and         of  a
interesting character, than has generally been supposed.
    It has been asserted       principle that sand filtration can

only remove bodies mechanically suspended in water, but        am                      I
not aware that this statement has been established by experi
ment; in fact,            I
                    am not acquainted with any published ana
lytical examination of the effects of sand filtration.
   These experiments supply the deficiency, and show moreover,
that these porous media are not only capable of removing sus
pended matter (80 to 92 per cent.), but even of separating a
certain appreciable quantity of the SALTs from solution in water |
viz. from 5 to 15 per cent. of the amount originally present,
9 to 19 per cent. of the common salt, 3 per cent. of the lime,
and 5 of the sulphuric acid.
   It is curious also that the proportion of matter removed in
this way depends to a certain extent upon the degree of impurity
of the water; the greater the quantity of matter originally
present in the water, the larger the per-centage ratio of the
salts removed,           e.g.:—
                                           In Sept.      In Dec.    In May.

Per-centage of salts removed           .   15.69          5:42       15:04,
   This point will, however, become more apparent by comparing
these experiments with those made at Kingston, where the
water is much purer, to which                            I
                                            shall have occasion hereafter
more particularly to refer.
   This fact, of the power possessed by sand and other porous
media, which rests for demonstration not only upon the three
preceding experiments, but also upon others to be presently
described, is one of great importance, not only in a hygienic
and oeconomic point of view as relating to the great question
of water supply, but also in                       its
                                         bearings upon agriculture and
geology.
  It   ispossible that soils may remove matters from solution                              in
water, not only            by
                         decompositions between the contained salts
and the aluminous silicates                    of
                                      the soil (as demonstrated        Mr.            by
Way), but also        virtue
                          in      this peculiar action.

 a little remarkable that the fresh water should regularly ebb

charcoal, for we had learnt that the results thus obtained did not
admit of comparison with those of filtration through sand at
Chelsea, on account of the great difference in the original com
position of the water; therefore, in order to establish at the
same time the absolute effect of charcoal as a filtering medium
upon the purer water at Kingston, and also to compare it with
that of sand, two experiments were made simultaneously with
the same water, the one of filtration through charcoal alone, and
the other through sand alone, both under precisely similar cir
cumstances.     In both these experiments the filtration was not
effected laterally as in the foregoing case, but downwards in the
usual way through beds of the same size of the respective filter
ing media contained in wooden troughs, the water being ad
mitted at the top and passing off from below.

      Lastly, these experiments upon the comparatively pure water
 of Kingston show that chARcoAL, as well                                 as sand, is capable of
 separating mineral salts from solution in                            water,       as is evident by
 an inspection of the              foregoing          Tables.
      The     following     is  a   brief      summary       of the most important results
 of this investigation             :-It        has been shown,
                                                                                                  media,
      1st. That sand, charcoal, and probably other porous
 possess the very peculiar property of removing, not merely sus
 pended impurities, but even dissolved salts from solution in water.
      2nd. That charcoal enjoys pre-eminently the power of ab
  stracting organic matter from solution: but that even sand like
  wise is capable of effecting the same result, though to a far less
  extent.
      3rd. That these powers, possessed by both these media,                                           in
  crease in intensity to a certain extent with the degree of im
  purity of the solution.
      4th. That these properties of porous media have important
  bearings upon hygienic science, agricultural principles, and geo
  logical phaenomena.
       The reader will not fail to have noticed, by the various ana
  lyses given above, great variations in the composition of the river
  water, between the two points at which experiments were made,
  viz. at Chelsea and Kingston, as well as at the different seasons
   of the year. To a number of analyses made during the year

Here also in this mass of bismuth we have an example of this con
fused crystallization; but in the crucible behind me a slower pro
cess is going on : here there is an architect at work “who makes
no chips, no din,” and who is now building the particles into
crystals, similar in shape and structure to those beautiful masses
which we see upon the table.       By permitting alum to crystal
lize in this slow   way, we obtain these perfect octahedrons; by
allowing carbonate of lime to crystallize, nature produces these
beautiful rhomboids; when silica crystallizes, we have formed
these hexagonal prisms capped at the ends by pyramids; by
allowing saltpetre to crystallize we have these prismatic masses,
and when carbon crystallizes, we have the diamond. If we wish
to obtain a perfect crystal, we must allow the molecular forces
free play: if the crystallizing mass be permitted to rest upon a
surface it will be flattened, and to prevent this a small crystal
must be so suspended as to be surrounded on         sides     the                all         by
liquid, or,    rest upon

46                        Prof. Tyndall on        the Cleavage          of
a   high temperature   during the conflagration of Mr. Scott Rus
sell’s premises.    I invite you to compare this structure with
that of a biscuit; air or vapour within the mass has caused it
to swell, and the mechanical structure it reveals is precisely that
of a biscuit.        I
                   have gone a little into the mysteries of baking
while conducting my inquiries on this subject, and have received
much instruction from a lady friend in the manufacture of puff
paste.    Here is some such paste baked in this house under my
own superintendence.       The cleavage of our hills is accidental
cleavage, but this is cleavage with intention.       The volition of
the   pastrycook  has entered into the formation of the mass, and
it has been his aim to preserve a series of surfaces of structural
weakness, along which the dough divides into layers. Puff-paste
must not be handled too much, for then the continuity of the
surfaces is broken; it ought to be rolled on a cold slab, to
prevent the butter from melting, and diffusing itself through the
mass, thus rendering it more homogeneous and less liable to
split. This is the whole philosophy of puff-paste; it is a grossly
exaggerated case of slaty cleavage.
   As time passed on cases multiplied, illustrating the influence
of pressure in producing lamination. Mr. Warren De la Rue                              in
forms me that he once wished to obtain white-lead in a fine
granular state, and to accomplish this he first compressed the
mass: the mould was conical, and permitted the mass to spread
a little laterally under the pressure.       The lamination was as
perfect as that of slate, and quite defeated him in his effort to
obtain a granular powder. Mr. Brodie, as you are aware, has
recently discovered a new kind of graphite: here is the substance
in powder, of exquisite fineness. This powder has the peculia
rity of clinging together in little confederacies; it cannot be
shaken asunder like lycopodium ; and when the mass is squeezed,
these groups of particles flatten, and a perfect cleavage is pro
duced. Mr. Brodie himself has been kind enough to furnish me
with specimens for this evening’s lecture.          will cleave themI
before you : you see they split up into plates which are perpen
dicular to the line in which the pressure was exerted.           This
testimony is      all
                   the more   valuable,               as
                                            the facts were obtained

S9).       time ago the following density of the earth was de
      duced by me, by the aid of very simple considerations, from
the pendulum   observations of the Astronomer Royal in Harton
Coal-pit, South Shields, as reported in the newspapers.
   The method of deducing the density is rough, and cannot be
considered as having the same value as the more precise and
detailed  considerations on which Mr. Airy has based his own
calculations; yet as it is simple, and easily understood, it may
prove of some interest to the readers of the Philosophical Maga
zine. It is based on the following facts:—
   1st. From the fact that the seconds' pendulum gains 24
seconds per day at the bottom of the coal-pit,     infer that gra               I
vity at the surface is to gravity at the bottom of the pit as 19200
to 1920.1.
   2nd.      If
             a spheroidal shell be drawn through the bottom of the
coal-pit similar to the spheroid forming the surface of the sea,
the mass of the whole earth is equal to the mass of this spheroid,
plus the matter exterior to                    it,
                                   including sea and land.
   The two    foregoing  propositions,   being facts, will easily       ad                      be
mitted;    I now add       them   to  hypothesis which very probably
                                                     an
does not deviate far from the truth;                follows:—          as
                                                                  it

52        M. Berthelot             on the Decomposition                 of Hydrobromic Acid.
     On this relation Berthelot founds        method for the forma

tion of formic acid, which consists in placing carbonic oxide under
conditions favourable to the fixation of the elements of water.
By enclosing carbonic oxide along with moist potash in a flask,
and heating for several days, this condition is satisfied: the car
bonic oxide is perfectly absorbed by the potash, which is con
verted into formiate of potash, from which formic acid is obtained
by appropriate methods.
   In the hope of uniting directly nascent carbonic oxide with
the elements of water, Berthelot investigated the decomposition
of oxalic acid at 100° C. under different circumstances; heated
alone,         it   is,   to   a   slight extent, decomposed into carbonic acid
and carbonic oxide.     This decomposition     much accelerated by       is

   Boussingault   communicates some experiments on the use of
arsenic in steeping grain for seed. This process has two objects, the
one to protect the harvest from disease, the other to prevent the
seed from being devoured by vermin. The substances generally
used are salt, glauber salt, lime, and sulphate of copper.     But
although these may hinder the development of cryptogamic
sporules, they have little effect in preventing the seed from being
eaten.   The greatest part of the substance used remains in the
husk, which the animal rejects.
  The most effectual means is the employment of arsenic; this
not only preserves the seed from decay, but if eaten by the
vermin it destroys them, being so strongly poisonous. By using
arsenic in a soluble form, such as the arsenite of soda, it may be
added to the grain in perfectly definite proportions.
   Boussingault’s process is as follows:–A solution of arsenite
of soda is prepared, which contains 57 grammes of arsenious
acid in the litre. Of this arsenical solution 3} litres are taken and
added to 12% litres of water.       A hectolitre of corn is placed in
a large tub, and these 16 litres of mixture are added, the corn
being continually stirred. In about an hour the whole of the
                                                                                 is,

   4. The anhydrous fluorides are remarkable for their stability;
the hydrated fluorides, on the contrary, are only slightly stable,
and are decomposed even by being dried in vacuo, hydrofluoric acid
being disengaged, and a residue of oxyfluoride or oxide being left.
   5. The anhydrous fluorides have a strong tendency to form
double fluorides; this property is seen even with insoluble
fluorides. These last compounds cannot be obtained by double
decomposition, as they always retain, as a double salt, part of
the soluble salt used in their preparation.

takes  place here analogous   to that observed when hydrochloric
acid is passed into a solution of an organic acid in alcohol.                                 Hy
drochloric acid acting on one of the aldehydes may produce the
compound Cl C*H* or Cl C7H8; and this acting on the other
aldehyde, would produce hydrochloric acid and hydride of cin
namyle. Adopting the notation used by Chiozza, the change
would be thus expressed:—

large quantity of a new body, having the greatest similarity
with leucine, both in appearance and chemical relation.    It

   Carius describes a compound of sesquioxide of manganese and
sulphuric acid. It is obtained by heating binoxide of manga
nese with concentrated sulphuric acid.   The excess of sulphuric
acid is removed by washing with strong nitric acid, as the sub
stance is decomposed by water, and the nitric acid is afterwards
expelled by a gentle heat.    It has the formula Mn” O°, 3S0°.
It forms a deep green powder, without a trace of crystallization;
attracts moisture with great avidity, and must be kept in closed
tubes.      By treatment with water it is converted into hydrated
oxide     of manganese, and is indeed the best source for this
body.
   The Para nuts, the produce of a tree, the Bertholletia excelsa,
which belongs to the family of the Lecythodea, contain upwards
of 50 per cent. of a fatty oil. This oil, according to an inves
tigation of Caldwell, consists of stearine, palmitine, and oleine.
   According to Grimm and Ramdohr, the gas produced by the
action of sulphuric acid on ferrocyanide of potassium is not pure
carbonic oxide, but contains 11 per cent. of sulphurous acid.
This appears to be reduced from the sulphuric acid by some
of the carbon in the ferrocyanide.
    Liebig gives a new method for silvering glass in the cold,

The solution of copper, when freed from nitric acid and metals
which might hinder the action, is precipitated by means of pure
metallic zinc, and the precipitated copper well washed out. It
is then dissolved in an acid solution of perchloride of iron: this
takes place very rapidly, and gives twice the quantity of proto
chloride of iron, which may be estimated by permanganate of
potash in the usual way.
  Wicke investigated the quantity of butter contained in goat’s
milk taken in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.       The

The average quantity of butter is 4.9 per cent. Cow's milk
contains, according to Playfair, the same amount.

   Action of dilute Sulphuric Acid on Datiscine.—When an aqueous
solution of datiscine is boiled for a few minutes with very dilute sul
phuric acid, it deposits a crystalline substance. On examining the
solution filtered from the crystals, very distinct evidences of the
presence of sugar were obtained. These experiments show there
fore that datiscine, like salicine and similar bodies, belongs to the
class of glucosides, and is a copulated compound of sugar and
another substance which I shall call “datiscetine.”

 datiscine, converting it into datiscetine and sugar.      On boiling an
 aqueous solution of pure datiscine for some hours, traces of sugar
 could be detected, thus showing that a small portion of the datiscine
 had been decomposed.
    It has been already shown that datiscine dissolves in cold so
 lutions of potash without decomposition.          When boiled, however,
with a   strong  solution of potash  for some  time,  decomposition takes
place, and the precipitate, thrown down by the addition of an acid,
has all the properties of datiscetine.       In this respect, therefore,
 datiscine agrees with tannin and similar glucosides, which yield the
 same products when acted upon by acids and alkalies.          Yeast and
emulsine appeared to exert no action on solutions of datiscine.
    Action of Nitric Acid on Datiscine and Datiscetine.—Cold nitric
acid of the ordinary strength acts violently upon datiscetine, brown
vapours are disengaged, and a resinous substance is produced,
which is ultimately dissolved, forming a dark red liquid, which,
when evaporated, yields crystals of nitropicric acid.
    Datiscine treated in the same way yields nitropicric and oxalic
acids.
    When datiscine is boiled with dilute nitric acid it dissolves, and
the solution obtained, when cooled, deposits pale yellow crystals,
which agree in every way with the properties ascribed to nitrosali
cylic acid.
    On allowing datiscine to stand in contact with dilute nitric acid
in the cold it gradually dissolves, the solution, when left to eva
porate in vacuo, depositing a mixture of oxalic and nitropicric acids.
    Action of Potash on Datiscine and Datiscetine.—It was stated in a
previous part of this paper that datiscine and datiscetine dissolve in
cold solutions of the alkalies without decomposition, and that datis
cine, when boiled with potash, is decomposed with the formation of
datiscetine.    It only remained, therefore, to try the action of fused
hydrate of potash.       Datiscetine, when added in small successive
portions to fused hydrate of potash, assumed a deep orange colour,
and then dissolved with the evolution of hydrogen gas. When the
disengagement of hydrogen had ceased, the mass was dissolved in
water and supersaturated with hydrochloric acid. A partly resinous
substance separated, which, by sublimation, yielded perfectly colour
less, long crystals closely resembling benzoic acid. Their solution
in water on the addition of perchloride of iron gave that deep violet
tint which disappears on the addition of hydrochloric acid, and is so
characteristic of salicylic acid.
    Action of Chromic Acid on Datiscetine.—On distilling datiscetine
with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid a liquid came over,
containing no oily drops, but having the smell of salicylous acid,
and which, when tested with a persalt of iron, formed a purple
coloured solution characteristic of that acid.
    It follows therefore, I think, from the experiments already de
tailed, that datiscine, like salicine, phloridzine, &c., is a glucoside,
and that it approaches nearer to salicine than any other glucoside,
with the exception of populine, yet known.

   I will conclude this account of datiscine by proposing the follow
ing practical application.   As is well known, the colouring matter
of madder, when boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, is changed into
sugar and garancine, a new dye-stuff, which, for many purposes, is
found superior to that originally present in the madder. Within
the last twelve months Mr. Lieshing, by treating the colouring
matters in weld and quercitron bark with dilute sulphuric acid, has
resolved them into new colouring matters, which are but slightly
soluble in water, and are found nearly three times more powerful as
dye-stuffs than the original colouring matters from which they had
been produced.
   As datiscine, when boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, undergoes
a  perfectly similar transformation, being resolved into sugar and
datiscetine, which has a much higher colouring power than the
datiscine which has produced                            it,

towards the middle of the section are schists with graptolites, which
latter, from the general southern dip of the strata and the frequent
absence of the axial arches, appear to overlie the former.         The
graptolite-schists, however, are the equivalent of the graptolitic and
anthracitic schists of Dumfriesshire, Selkirkshire, and Peebleshire,
 and are really lower in stratigraphical position than the conglo
merates of Corswall Point and the conglomerates and limestone of
 the south of Ayrshire, of which the Wrae limestone, with its asso
 ciated conglomerate, is the counterpart.     The abnormal relative
 position of the conglomerates and graptolite-schists on the western
 coast of Wigtonshire is due, in the author's opinion, to an inversion
 of the rock-masses, similar to the great inverted flexures of strata
 seen in the Ardennes, the Eifel, the Appalachians, &c.    This great
 folding up of the Silurian strata has thrown them into axial folds
 which have an E.N.E. strike, similar to that prevailing over the
 north of Ireland, the south of Scotland, and even in Norway, and
 must be due to some physical cause which has operated on a mag
 nificent scale. In the author's opinion, the granites of Cairnsmuir,
 Criffel, &c. have been protruded subsequently to the great move
 ments above alluded to, and have somewhat deranged the E.N.E.
 strike.

Strata of the Earth.”      By C. Babbage, Esq., F.R.S. Communi
cated  by W. H.   Fitton, M.D.,   F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In the first part  of this paper the author traced out the laws
which regulate the distribution of very finely divided earthy matter,
borne outwards from river-mouths and sea-cliffs into the ocean
currents, over extensive areas. The time that a particle of matter
requires to fall through a given distance in a resisting medium
depends—
   1st. On the specific gravity of the particle itself.
  2nd. On       its
                greater    less magnitude.
                                or
   3rd. On its form.
  4th. On the law          of
                        the resistance     the medium through which

it   falls.
     These several points were treated                        by
                                                     the author, who then

indeed, either to outliers or disconnected masses, which might be
 sometimes supposed to have been due to subsequent denudation.
    Sedimentary matter carried by ocean-currents to the profound
depths of the ocean subside into these depths beyond the reach both
of currents and of wave-action. The downward motion becomes
continually diminished, and the particles ultimately come to ab
solute rest, or move through water of increasing density with ex
cessive slowness, so as to cover the ocean-bottom with an incoherent
 pulpy mass of fluid mud, of great thickness, and less dense for the
most part in the upper than in the lower part,           or to form a similar
mass of sediment suspended in mid-water.
    It was also pointed out that in the immense period of time during
which this sediment is subsiding into the profound ocean-depths and
massing itself into a mud-bed, various hydrographical changes might
take place and cause new currents to bring different sediments over
the same area, which newer deposits would descend into and be
mingled with the older precipitates.
   The author proceeded to treat of the effects of an alteration of
isothermal surfaces, caused by the interference of this more or less
suspended mud-cloud with the conduction of heat from the earth's
surface.    Consolidation of the lower strata would be caused by the
isothermal surfaces below the ocean rising upwards.                Currents of
heated water, similarly caused, might variously disturb the sediment
and give it flexuous stratification.     Heated water might be retained
in portions of the sedimentary masses, and alter by                    solvent        its
power the constituent materials;             the heated water might
                                                     or                                           be
converted into steam,        orgenerate permanent gases, which might
derange     oralter the suspended material           various ways.

the heated water and the downward pressure              the overlying water.

few inches; 2. Reddish marl, 4 inches; 3. Green marl, 4 inches;
4. Light-coloured, fine-grained sandstone divided by marls, 3 feet,
with Posidonomya minuta, Fish-bones, and Ripple-mark; 5. Gritty
sandstone, with teeth of Acrodus, and fish-bones and spines, 8 inches;
6. Green marl,        inch ; 7. Hard sandstone, with Posidonomya, 10
inches; 8. Sandstone divided by green marls, 10 feet, with remains
of Plants, Voltzia and Calamites ? 9. Red marl. Bones of Labyrin
thodon were met with ; and Foot-tracks also occur, but their place
in the series was not determined. Fucoidal markings are frequent
throughout ; and ripple-mark is common in the sandstones. The
Warwickshire Keupervery nearly agrees with that of Worcestershire,
 as described by the Rev. Mr. Symonds, but at Pendock the bed
No. 5 is coarser, is still richer in osseous remains, and contains car
bonaceous matter.
    3.  “On    a  new genus    of Cephalopoda, Diploceras (Orthoceras
 bisiphonatum    of Sowerby).    By J. W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S.
     In this communication the author pointed out the apparent rela
 tions of this peculiar form, which has been figured in the “Silu
 rian System' and in “Siluria.’ It possessed ordinary septa, pierced
 by an excentric beaded siphuncle, and also had a deep lateral cavity
 passing down side by side with the siphuncle, and affecting at least
 seven, if not more of the uppermost septa.
    Mr. Salter remarked that the structural peculiarities of Ortho
 ceras paradoricum and of Gonioceras might elucidate the character of
 the shell in question; but he thought that the study of Ascoceras and
 Cameroceras would be still more likely to throw light on the subject.
 Mr. Salter also described a new species of Ascoceras (A. Barrandii),
 found not long since in the upper Ludlow rock, at Ludlow, and at
 Stansbatch in Herefordshire.
    4.  “On   an Orthoceras from China.”     By S. P. Woodward, Esq.,
 F.G.S.
    The specimen in question was one of several that were imported
 from China in 1854 by Mr. D. Hanbury. They are longitudinal
 sections in thin, polished slabs of limestone, and were obtained by
 Mr. Lockhart, of Shanghae, from some place 200 miles distant.
 They seem to have been used as screens, having been mounted in
 carved wooden frames with stands. Mr. Woodward described in
 detail the appearances presented by the fossil in question, which is
 probably of Devonian age, and offers some interesting facts as to
 the original relations of the siphuncle, the lining membrane of the
 shell, and other parts of the animal. The specimen exhibits appear
ances attributed to the gradual separation and ultimate collapse of
the lining membrane from the wails of the air-chambers towards the
apex of the spire, during the life-time of the animal.
    He stated that the changes which this specimen has undergone
appear to be these,_1. When buried in the sea-bed, the mud entered
the siphuncle and filled the interior of those chambers in which the
siphuncle was incomplete.       2. Water, containing carbonate of lime
in solution, penetrated the air-chambers and other closed spaces,

           GENTLEMEN,                                      Parsonstown, June 1856.
        an abstract of a paper sent by me to the Royal Society, pub
IN   lished in the ‘ Proceedings’ for January last, I claim the discovery
of the law that “decomposition absorbs as much heat as the com
bination of the elements originally produced.”                 In the ‘Proceedings’
of the     Society    for March     following,    Mr. Joule disputes my claim,
and refers to       papers   of his  published   in the Philosophical Magazine,
October 1841. He also              says  he sent a memoir to the French Aca
demy in 1846, which however was not published until 1852, in the
Philosophical Magazine.
   As to the paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for
October 1841, after carefully reading                                         it,

after mine can only affect me by offering additional evidence of the
truth of my experiments.
   Since I published my paper in the Philosophical Magazine for Octo
ber 1851, thermo-chemical researches have been extensively carried
on, and all based on the truth of the proposition I there proved, viz.
“that decomposition of a compound body absorbs as much heat as
combination of the elements produced.”         Before that date no such
                                                        no is,
experiments were thought of, that         the amount      heat produced                    of
by  the union        of
                   elements was           instance calculated from any
                                                  in
process taking decomposition into account.         The reason why the
combustion      of compound    body,  such    alcohol, does not produce
                                                                     as
as much heat         as a
                    the elements would when      separately ignited, was
not even   understood,    proofs  that philosophers  were not aware                                                   of
the principle before my paper was published, and consequently had
not perceived         Mr. Joule's.

 years ago, during my private course of lectures, I passed a piece of
the metal, about a quarter of an inch square, into a tube filled with
 water, 18 inches in length by 1 in diameter. When the action was
nearly over, a powerful explosion occurred, which forced the tube
(weighing upwards of a pound) violently through my hand and
dashed it to pieces against the ceiling.            As I had often before per
formed the     experiment     with  perfect  safety,    I presumed that air must
have somehow       got   mixed with the    hydrogen;       the more so as, simply
holding the sodium in the fingers, I had, to slip it under more
quickly, brought the mouth of the tube very near the surface of the
water.     On         all
                     subsequent occasions placed the sodium  I                   little        in   a
tube closed       one end, which
                  at                    almost filled, and stopping the mouth
                                                 it
with the finger, opened          below the larger tube, which was kept
                                       it                                                               at
least   a couple      inches under water,

                         any sudden    jerk      otherwise.  or All went off well
for several times, till          public lecture
                                  at   a                Devonshire an explosion
                                                                      in
resulted more violent than the first, and the tube was blown into
splinters which strewed the floor           one half   of  the room, and slightly
                                                                            of

The cause        of
                 the detonation remains                 explained.
                                                                 to    be   the last
instance    atany rate,        quite certain that
                                 it   is                                no
                                                          explosive mixture with
air was formed, and         have little doubt that the effect proceeds from
                                 I
the water round the sodium being thrown into the spheroidal state.
This view seems confirmed by the fact, that                  the first momentat                         of
contact     large quantity
            a                      gas     always liberated, but the action

speedily becomes weaker, and the evolution                   hydrogen extremely

    small,      disappears tranquilly          this    way; in when           larger,     it
so is

I noticed a sudden downward rush of the liquid the moment before
the explosion.
   The detonation, with occasional fracture of the vessel, observed by
Wagner and Couerbe" to take place when sodium floating fused on
water is struck with a spatula, probably proceeds from the same
cause, the highly heated globule being forced mechanically into sud
den intimate contact with the liquid.
    While on the subject of sodium, I may add that when it is melted
with a little naphtha in a sealed tube containing no air, it presents
to the full extent the high lustre and mobility of mercury, from which
indeed it cannot be distinguished by the eye; but as soon as it so
lidifies, it assumes a slightly crystalline and dead white surface, more
nearly resembling frosted silver.

might assume this as known from my former memoirs or from
those of other authors, but to refer back would be inconvenient;
and besides this, the demonstration I shall here give is prefer
able to my former one, because                                     it is at once more general and
more concise.
                   Theorem               of the     equivalence         of Heat and Work.
   Whenever a moving force generated by heat acts against an
other force, and motion in the one direction or the other ensues,
positive work is performed by the one force at the same time that
negative work is done by the other.      As this work has only to
be considered as a simple quantity in calculation, it is perfectly

                                            positive the work done            as
  byheat    overcoming any other force, and
                  in                             negative the work                       as

                           of                                                                 a
of the general relation between vis viva and mechanical work,
can         be   briefly enunciated                 thus:–
   Mechanical work may          transformed into heat, and conversely
                                                    be
heat into  work,  the  magnituda      the one being always proportional

to  that         of
            the other.
   The forces which here enter into consideration may             divided                                be
into two classes: those which the atoms            body exert  upon   each    of   a
other, and which depend,                            of

                                                                    forces                                   of

     Inorder to give special forms to equation (I), in which it
shall express definite properties of bodies, we must make special
assumptions with respect to the foreign influences to which the
body is exposed.     For instance, we will assume that the only
active external force, or at least the only one requiring consi
deration in the determination of work, is an external pressure
everywhere normal to the surface, and equally intense at every
point of the same, which is always the case with liquid and
gaseous bodies when other foreign forces are absent, and might
at least be the case with solid bodies.   It will be seen that under
this condition it is not necessary, in determining the external
work, to consider the variations in form experienced by the
body, and             its
                expansion      contraction      different directions,
                                                    in or                        in
but only the total change        volume.            its
                                            We will further assume
that the pressure always changes very gradually,         that     any                              so             at
moment      shall differ
             it                              so
                            little from the opposite expansive force
of the body, that both may            counted     equal.       be
                                                           Thus the                   as
pressure constitutes     property      the body itself, which can
                                       a                          of                                                         be
determined from                      its
                       other contemporaneous properties.

second  according   to t. In  doing  so we may apply to U the well
known theorem, that when a function of two independent varia
bles is successively differentiated according to both, the order in
which this is done does not affect the result.      This theorem,
however, does not apply to the magnitude Q, and we must use
symbols which will show the order of differentiation. This is
done in the following equations:—
                                   d2U
                                #(;

By subtraction, we have
an equation which no longer contains U.
  The equations (2) and (3) can be still further specialized by
applying them to particular classes of bodies. In my former
memoir       I
          have shown these special applications in two of the
most  important cases, viz. permanent gases and vapours at a
                                                      I
maximum density. On this account will not here pursue the
subject further, but pass on to the consideration of the second
fundamental theorem in the mechanical theory of heat.
                 Theorem    of the   equivalence   of transformations.
   Carnot's theorem, when brought into agreement with the first
fundamental theorem, expresses a relation between two kinds of
transformations, the transformation of heat into work, and the
passage of heat from a warmer to a colder body, which may be
regarded as the transformation of heat at a higher into heat at a
lower temperature.      In            its
                               original form   may       enunciated
                                                          it                be

quantity      of

                       is

warmer        colder body; and the magnitude

   This principle, upon which the whole      the following deve          of

     Fundamental Theorem in the Mechanical Theory of Heat.                                                 89
neous transformations above described, we shall first assume that
the temperatures of the three reservoirs of heat remain the same,
but that the circular processes through which the transform
ations are effected are different.      This will be the case when,
instead of a gas, some other body is submitted to similar trans
formations, or when the circular processes are of any other kind,
subject only to the conditions that the three bodies K, K, and
K2 are the only ones which receive or impart heat, and of the
two latter the one receives as much as the other loses. These
several processes can be either reversible, as in the foregoing
case, or not, and the law which governs the transformations will
vary accordingly.    Nevertheless, the modification which the law
for non-reversible  processes   suffers may be easily applied after
wards, so that at present we will confine ourselves to the con
sideration of reversible circular processes.
   With respect to      these   all
                                  may     proved from the foregoing

wherein,       being the same,
                Q                       was different, then the two pro
cesses could          be
                      executed successively, the one          which       was        in               Qi

difference, because the temperature of the generated heat is
arbitrary, and may therefore have the same value as the tem
perature of one of the two bodies, in which case a third body
would be superfluous.   Consequently, for the two quantities of
heat Q and   Q'—Q,
                -   an equation of the same form as (6) must
hold, i. e.                -

Eliminating the magnitude Q' by means of (7), and dividing by
Q, this equation becomes

so that the temperatures t and t'being arbitrary, the function
of two temperatures which applies to the second kind of trans

one temperature which applies to the first kind.

transformations having the same sign.        By means         finite                           of  a

Further, were those transformations positive,          would only                    it

   A transformation which thus                              remains          at the conclusion                      of
a circular process without another opposite one, and which
according to this theorem can only be positive, we shall, for
brevity, call an uncompensated transformation.
   The different kinds of operations giving rise to uncompensated
transformations are, as far as external appearances are concerned,
rather numerous, even though they may not differ very essen
tially. One of the most frequently occurring examples is that
of the transmission of heat by mere conduction, when two bodies
of different temperatures are brought into immediate contact;
other cases are the production of heat by friction, and by an
electric current when overcoming the resistance due to imper
fect conductibility, together with         cases where      all

100                       Prof. Hennessy on the Influence of the
the vitreous condition up to that of complete crystalline struc
ture, it is at once apparent that the influence of changes of the
state of molecular aggregation of such masses must exercise an
important influence on the general structure of the earth, as well
as the slow cubical contraction of the entire mass during the
process of its refrigeration.
   In my second memoir, I showed the way in which the former
species of contraction would affect the internal structure of the
earth supposed to consist of a solid shell and included nucleus
of fluid. The process of solidification of the fluid, commencing
from the centre and ending at the surface, according to the
views of Poisson, was proved to be impossible; and the only way
in which the process could take place, was shown to be by suc
cessive additions of matter from the surface of the nucleus to the
inner surface of the solid shell. Each outer stratum of the
nucleus would thus successively become a stratum of the shell.
But the density of any stratum of equal pressure in the fluid
depends on the pressure of          the strata       which  all enve               by               it   is
loped, and therefore the removal        these strata     regular suc

cession, gradually tending     decrease the pressure, must decrease
                                                     to

                 the stratum      question.   This action, operating

not only the external form, but in several cases their internal
structure, shows that these bodies have revolved in their acrial
course.    One of these bombs when broken through presented
the  following  appearances:–1. The central part was highly cel
lular, the cells decreasing in size from the centre towards the
exterior. 2. These cells terminated at a shell-like case of com
pact stone about a third of an inch in thickness. 3. Outside
this case was a crust of finely cellular lava.   Mr. Darwin ex
plains these phaenomena very rationally, by saying that the outer
most crust cooled rapidly into the state in which it came under
his observation; then the enclosed fluid was pressed against the
shell so formed by centrifugal force arising from the rapid rota
tion of the mass, thus producing the compact stony casing;
lastly, the action of the same force relieving the pressure of the
fluid at       its
               central portions, the expansive tendency                   the in                       of
cluded elastic vapours would ultimately produce the coarse cel
lular structure        the centre.

 sion another is immediately deduced, which is of fundamental
 importance in connexion with the question now under considera
 tion.    It follows that the shell and nucleus must rotate together
 very nearly as if one mass, for otherwise, according to a result
 obtained by Mr. Hopkins*, the annual precession of the equi
 moxes would greatly differ from that which is observed.       Hence
 it follows that great friction and pressure must exist at the sur
 face of contact of the nucleus and shell, and probably also even
 between the particles of the fluid.    Such a state of things should
 indeed be expected a priori from the highly crystalline structure,
 and probably unequal surface of the shell, as well as the viscous
 nature of the fused materials of the earth, so far as we can judge
 from those coming under our noticef. The existence of great
 pressure has been already indicated in connexion with the gradual
                                                                      in its
tendency             of the nucleus to expand    volume.

a recapitulation of the primary principles on which the several
investigations proceed, and which are fully discussed in my former
paper. These are,

bered that Dr. Lloyd's paper was communicated and published
in  1834, and refers     Fresnel's formulas
                                        to     the form     which                in                    in                he
originally gave them, and before any modifications        the theory                              of
had been   contemplated.    Prof. Maccullagh's   new views and for
mulas were first communicated            the Royal Irish Academy  to                                                     in
 1837, and published           Memoirs    in   its
                                             1838.     Thus Dr. Lloyd'sin
reasoning         necessity wholly independent
                   is   of                               any speculations              of

occurring only for h"; and          the formulas (C) (as

   This result would therefore seem decisive          favour     Fresnel’s        in                 of
original formulas (D),        the eaclusion not only

   20. In the case of Fresnel’s and Arago’s result (see above, (9))
of the change in the plane of polarization after reflexion, it should
be remarked that the reasoning turns wholly upon the signs of
the resulting equation for the tangents of the two related arcs;
and these are derived from the relative signs of the quantities
which enter into the numerator and denominator simply as alge
braic quantities, and without any reference whatever to the inter
pretation of those signs as expressive of difference of phase, or any
other physical conditions.    The resulting relation is a purely tri
gonometrical one, and the direction in which the arcs are to be
relatively measured would be just the same whatever might be
the physical theory to which they were to apply.              This case
therefore can in no way be affected by any theory of the change
of direction due to the position of the vibrations. Here, then,
Fresnel's original formulas exclusively apply.
   21. The case then stands thus:—From the experiment of Prof.
Stokes, Maccullagh's formulas are set aside.          From the experi
ments of   Lloyd  and  Arago,   so far as relates to vibrations perpen
dicular to the  plane  of  incidence,  Fresnel’s formula (Ch') is set
aside, since it does not apply directly; and for such vibrations
the subsidiary theory as to the signs is inapplicable; while Fres
nel's formula (Bh') fully agrees with experiment without any
 subsidiary explanation. This formula then must necessarily be
adopted eaclusively.
   22. It is only, then, in the case of vibrations parallel to the
plane of incidence that the question remains between Fresnel’s
formula (Ck), which applies directly to the experimental results,
but rests on an hypothesis (No. III.) of equivalent vibrations
open to question,-and his formula (Bk'), which rests on Maccul
lagh's law of equivalent vibrations (No. II.), but does not apply
to the experimental facts without a subsidiary interpretation
                                                           -        as
to the  signs.
   23. Now any subsidiary construction, if necessary for the right
interpretation of a formula, only shows that that formula is sym
bolically incomplete, and does not include the expression of the
whole case it is designed to represent.    This, then, would be an
additional reason for rejecting that formula and adopting the
former in preference.
   24. But this construction (19) is in itself not free from question
and difficulty. For     let
                          only consider the case        point upon the

I imagine this circle has been  long known for the case of the
point of projection being in the field, but it may have escaped
notice for the more general case.    The equality between the fall
and the excursion for the  angle  of maximum range subsists, not
merely for a rectilinear or curved section, but for the ground
itself (whatever     form          its

carefully and accurately executed, represents only the composition

              Chemical Composition                              of the       Thames Water.                                115
between the 1stof September 1854 and the beginning of the
year 1855; but it is obvious that this includes only a quarter of
a year, and, moreover, only that particular quarter following the
drought and heat of summer and autumn, the effect of the spring
rains being altogether omitted.
   The analyses detailed below extended over the whole year, viz.
from May 1855 to May 1856; so that from them the maximum,
minimum, and mean composition may be deduced for the whole
year.
   Two series were undertaken, the one at Kingston, the present
source of supply of the Chelsea and Lambeth Waterworks’ Com
panies, the other at Chelsea, with the view of comparing the
mean composition at these two points: the analyses of the former
series were repeated about once a month (and, indeed, during a
certain period when great fluctuations took place, once a week),
and those of the latter four times in the year, viz. in June,
October, and December 1855, and May 1856.
    At the commencement of the inquiry a complete analysis was
made at each point, the results of which are given in detail; but
subsequently only the most important constituents were deter
mined, and the analyses are given as the direct results of expe
riments (without arranging the acids and bases together), to faci
litate present and future comparison.
    To commence with the composition of the water at Kingston:
the following are the results of the original complete analysis.
  This sample was collected at the Chelsea Waterworks Com
pany’s new works at Kingston (in common with         the other                                         all

  To  proceed with the composition of the water of the river at
Chelsea: the following are the results of the complete analysis
made at the beginning of the investigation.
   The sample was collected by myself from the Chelsea Water
works Company's reservoir, at the time that it was being pumped
in from the middle of the river on the 14th of June, 1855. The
temperature of the water at the time was                                           62°F. (17°5 C.), that
of the air being 58° F. (14°44 C.).

  The following points cannot fail- to be remarked in considering
these   numbers:–
   1st. The very much greater variations in the composition of
the water here than at Kingston.
   2nd. The great decrease in impurity generally, but especially
in the suspended matter which takes place during the winter,
and increase in the summer, above the mean for the whole year.
   3rd. The extraordinary fluctuations in the quantity of common
salt present, the chlorine varying from 11:14 grs. in the gallon
in September 1855 to 1-667 in December of the same year.
   4th. That the amounts of sulphuric acid, and of lime and
magnesia salts, remain, however, much more constant.
   But in order to present in the most striking form the supe
riority of the water at Kingston over that at Chelsea as a source
for the supply of London,                I

taining little or no mica, but made up of more or less fine quartz
sand and decomposed felspar in very variable proportions, but these
have only an imperfect cleavage.     Other slates, as is well known,
contain much chlorite and other minerals.     On the present occasion
I shall  chiefly confine myself to the consideration of such slate as
has a perfect cleavage.

case is so like that of iron, adduced in illustration of my views,
that had it occurred to me, I should undoubtedly have referred
to it in my lecture. To this class of facts Mr. Sorby ingeniously
endeavours to attach my experiment with the wax.            When a
thin stratum of this    substance, melted on a   plate  of glass  and
permitted to solidify, was examined by the microscope, he found
it to be composed of unequiaxed prismatic crystals. Without
entering into the question as to the amount of cohesion between
these crystals, I would say

                                  Dr. Tyndall on Slaty Cleavage.                                        135
       To Mr. Williams of Basingstoke I                                    have been recently indebted
for some very interesting specimens of iron plates, peeled off by the
compressing and sliding action of railway trains. The specimens
exhibit the laminated structure in a very striking degree. “Prac
tically,” says my intelligent correspondent, “it is a constant
fault in rails: the men who are always handling and taking them
up say that it is worst near the stations, where the break acts;
but sometimes they find one here and there upon the main road
—not very often.” One of the specimens sent to me was of this
latter class, and it had probably been submitted to the rolling of
the trains for a period of eighteen years. In addition to the
pressure, which of itself causes the granules of iron gradually to
spread out, and thus tends to destroy their natural cohesion,
when the wheel slides it has a tendency to displace the upper
surface of the rail in the direction of motion.    Suppose the rail
to be divided into distinct strata, each of these being held to                                            its
neighbours              by

   slight displacement occurs, and every such displacement tends
to arupture the cohesion            the particles which hold each pair                                     of

strata together.      The act repeated, perhaps thousands              times,
until  finally  the rail  yields       the   place where,

I
      GENTLEMEN,
     HAVE duly considered Dr. Riess's notice of my memoir in
      your May Number, “On Electrical Discharge.”                    regret                            I
exceedingly that it should have been treated by Dr. Riess in so
dictatorial and intolerant a spirit.         It will be my endeavour,
however, in the few concluding observations              have to make, to          I
avoid   every  thing    calculated to   provoke    angry  discussion, and
confine myself strictly to facts and to the scientific merits of
the question at issue between us, without any discourteous com
ment on the several personal animadversions and reflections on
me, in which Dr. Riess has thought                 indulge.        fit   to
    Dr. Riess says that had “long since set
                                       I                     law upon the              up

tery,” and that                  he
                        “ascertained this law           incorrect, and set   to   be
 up  another                its
                      place.” All this, however,

 to  my view       the question, Dr. Riess has quite failed
                        of                                               his                               in

again I am informed that my paper is full of errors, that without
the     necessary knowledge,                          I
                                have deduced results unintelligible
both to Dr. Riess and    others, and he is “not aware that any one,
either here or in   England,   had found these results more intel
ligible than he had done.” All these things are very easily said;
but here is an extract from Faraday’s Researches, 12th series, 1363:
“Many     philosophers have examined the circumstances of this
limiting action in air, but as far as I know none have come near
Mr. Harris as to the accuracy with, and the extent          which                                          to,                 he

I   have “ascertained                     by

 communication.
   Again, Dr. Riess observes, “It   not true that   ascribed the       is                            I

   138        Sir W. Snow Harris        on certain Phaenomena
   into his cylinder, I consider as a mere coincidence, quite a
   secondary affair; the experiments         came to nothing, and the
   “Immortal” Franklin         gave  these   experiments   with the “wet
   thread,” “blade of green grass,” &c., fairly quoted by Dr. Riess,
   no encouragement whatever, as resulting from heat, and so the
   whole matter dropped; and it has not, so far as know, beenI
   ever revived until the present time.         Now Dr. Riess labours to
  show that    my   instrument was a studied copy of these old instru
  ments, Kinnersley’s more especially, much in the same way as
  he improved upon Behrens' electroscope, or copied my instru
  ment; whereas at the time I first invented my instrument,               I
  can most    rigidly affirm that   I  had not the shadow of Kinners
  ley’s air-electrometer in my mind.           As I have stated, it origi
  nated at a    pressing    moment,   in a   necessity for demonstrating
  experimentally to the Naval Department of the Government,
  and the Scientific Commission appointed to investigate and
  report on my method of securing the Royal Navy from light
  ning, the relative superiority of copper for that purpose over
 iron, and some other metals; at that time no very exact expe
 riments had appeared, more especially with the ordinary elec
 trical discharge.      Now Dr. Wollaston, one of the most distin
 guished philosophers in Europe of that day, did not consider
 the experiments I made with this instrument “unintelligible,”
 as Dr. Riess says he has found them.                On the contrary, in
 reply to an inquiry whether he saw “any danger or liability
 to objection in the method proposed by Mr. Harris, of carrying
 off lightning from ships,” &c., he observes, “Mr. Harris appears
 to me to be well acquainted with the subject, and fairly to esti
 mate the operation of the element with which we have to con
 tend,” &c.      I  find it of course somewhat painful to be obliged
 to refer to such quotations; but in justice to myself think    I       I
 am called on to expose, by an appeal to facts, how ill-supported
are Dr. Riess's assertions of my want of knowledge, &c. of the
question I have undertaken to discuss, and the “unintelligible”
nature of my experiments, both to himself and “others.”
     With respect to Dr. Riess's assertion, that       I  must be unac
 quainted with the use of the thermometer, being still “unaware
of the necessity of employing a calculation,” &c., I think it may
be seen by reference to what       I  stated, that I neither asserted nor
denied the necessity of “calculation.”             I in no way meddled
with the very loose ground on which Dr. Riess builds his con
clusion, and    I  took very especial care to explain my view of the
operation of the instrument.          In the present imperfect state of
our knowledge of the causes of heat and electricity, and of our
equally imperfect apprehension of the precise way in which my
thermo-electrometer operates,         I  cannot but conclude that the

their    age and situation.   Those situated about the centre, and form
ing    the chief part of its bulk, are collected together into rounded
masses, giving to many of the animalcules an obscurely annulose
 appearance.      They are of an elliptical, or rather reniform figure.
 This form, however, is not essential to these cells, but merely re
 sults from the circular shape of the masses into which they enter,
 the convexity of each cell being a part of the outline of its
 respective mass.       These cells contain minute granules, or rather
 molecules, which are variously disposed in different cells, so as to
 present a variety of appearances, such as circular spaces, which
 might be mistaken for nuclei, but which seem rather to be pro
  duced by a deficiency of the cell's contents at these parts, than by
 any distinct nucleus. The mode of formation of these cells must be
 examined in the growing parts of the animal, and for this purpose its
  extreme ends are best adapted. When one of these ends is about
 to have an addition made to its length, the investing membrane
 at this part becomes at first very thin, and then disappears. A
 clear space is next seen, having in some specimens the form of the
  part which is about to be added to the extremity of the entozoon;
 in others it has no defined limit. This space contains, in some
 cases,    nothing but extremely minute molecules, of different
 shapes; in others, these molecules are mixed with granules of
 various sizes, which have every appearance of having been pro
 duced by the coalescence of the molecules; and lastly, with these
 molecules and granules, there are in other examples very distinct
 globular cells, of a bright aspect, looking more like nuclei than
 perfect cells; these soon become flattened oval, and ultimately take
 the elliptical form before described. All the time these changes are
 taking place in the molecules and cells, the membrane has been in
 progress of formation, so that when the molecules have disappeared,
 and their place has become occupied by perfect cells, the end of the
 animal is completed.       The cilia are soon afterwards added. The
 lateral growth of these animals takes place in the same manner: the
 first indication is a separation of the cilia, which, it must be observed,
 are larger at the sides of an entozoon than at the extreme ends;
 and then a thinning of the membrane supporting them ; and, lastly,
 the formation of globular cells, as before noticed. After the animals
 have become of a considerable size, and forced their way from the
 interior of the primary fasciculi into the cellular spaces between
 the larger muscular fibres, they still continue to grow, especially
 in breadth; but they lose their cilia, and gradually acquire those
 parts which have been described as belonging to the neck.              The
 first evidence of this addition is the appearance of inversion of the
 middle part of the cyst, forming a small hollow, the sides of which
 look as if thrown into folds containing granular matter, and the
 bottom presents a circular space in which are granular particles of
 various forms and sizes, but those in the centre are darker than the
 rest.    It is from these particles that the suctorial disks, the hook
 lets, and the first of the laminated bodies are about to be formed,
  but as yet none of these parts are recognizable.        At a stage a little

more advanced, this apparent inversion of the cyst has increased,
the neck has become longer, and the appearance of disks, hook
lets, and laminated bodies is sufficiently distinct to be perfectly
recognizable. The process of development is particularly apparent in
                                                                                                                º

an animal tissue which presents such facilities for the examination
                                                                                                                º
of the manner in which it is effected.               First, because the part of
the entozoon on which these organs are formed, is sufficiently trans
parent to admit of examination by the highest magnifying powers
without any previous dissection. Secondly, because the material
of which they are composed is so characteristic, and so dissimilar
to the surrounding parts, that it can be detected in the minutest
possible quantities.      And, thirdly, as only a few of these hooklets
are in progress of development at one time, and as these are in all
stages of formation, every step in the progress of their growth can
be traced from the merest molecule to a perfect hooklet.                   This is                              s
important in reference to the general theory of development, as it
furnishes an example of the formation of a complete set of organs,
 on a plan more simple, and at variance with the cell-theory of
 Schwann and others.          Before one of these hooklets takes on a
recognizable form, it exists as a group of exceedingly refractive
particles,       all
                  apparently       the same composition, and
                                               of                         more            of               or
less  globular   form,  but     very    different sizes, some being
                                          of                               minute              so a

These two  series of acids are connected by the closest ties, and very
conclusive experiments have demonstrated that the members of the
former may be easily converted into those of the latter; such is the
case of the transformation of butyric into succinic acid, effected by
M. Dessaignes under the influence of oxidizing agents.

   “Anatomical and Physiological Observations on the Organ of
Vision, for the purpose of ascertaining the alterations caused by sec
tion of the Optic Nerve.” By Augustus Waller, M.D., F.R.S.
   The author begins by referring to experimental researches already
published by him on the effects produced on the nerves of living
animals by section at different points in their course; and he briefly
recapitulates the chief results of these experiments, as follows, viz.                                             –

from these experiments, which have been varied                   different ways,   in                                is

that the anterior spinal roots derive their nutritive influence from
the spinal cord; and                  he
                             has little doubt “that every nerve-fibre                                           is   in
 connexion with nerve-cell, which exerts over

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “Note on a Section of Mont Lacha near Mont Blanc.”            By
Major S. Charters, F.G.S.
    In a letter to Dr. Fitton, the author enclosed a section of the
anthraciferous     schist of M. Lacha (containing Ammonites and
Belemnites), that he had taken during a tour five years ago, and
which shows the strata dipping northward at an angle of 75°; whilst
the lines of cleavage are perpendicular to the stratification.   At first
sight, says the author, the cleavage-planes might easily have been mis
taken for stratification, but the strata are evident on careful obser
vation, and do not dip towards or under Mont Blanc, but their dip
is normal, supposing Mont Blanc to be the centre of upheaval.
    2.  “Notice of the late Eruption of Manna Loa, Owhyhee.” By
W.    Miller, Esq., H.M. Consul, Sandwich Islands. (Forwarded from
the Foreign Office by order of Lord Clarendon.)
    In a letter dated January 9, 1856, Mr. Miller stated that the laya
 stream originating in the eruption which broke out in August last,
continued flowing to the date of his letter, at which time it appeared
to have been arrested in the forest at a distance of about ten miles
from Hilo. In a later communication, dated March 1, 1856, Mr. Miller .
describes the lava-stream as being sixty miles in length, and as
having now reached within five or six miles of Hilo. There still
intervenes about three miles' width of dense forest between it and
the open ground towards Hilo, Byron's Bay. It has burnt its way
through the forest at the rate of about one mile in two weeks.
    3. “On the Geology of Varna and Neighbourhood, Bulgaria.”
By Capt. Spratt, R.N., F.G.S.
    Capt. Spratt first noticed a series of whitish calcareous sandstones
and marls, nearly 1000 feet thick, overlaid by reddish sands and
marls.     The former are of marine origin and of Eocene tertiary
 date; the latter are chiefly of freshwater origin. Near Varna the
 freshwater beds have been much denuded, and are not anywhere
 more than 200 feet thick. At Cape Aspro, fifteen miles south of
 Varna, both of the series—the grey and the red deposits—are seen
 disturbed, and dipping to the south, but unconformably, one series
 (the lower) having an angle of 30°, whilst the upper dips at 20°.
 At Cape Emineh, south of Cape Aspro, and forming the termination of
 the Balkan, these beds are still more disturbed and dip to the north.
 Capt. Spratt then described the geological appearances along the
 coast southward.       At the Gulf of Bourgas and in the vicinity are
 igneous rocks, and deposits formed from their waste. Granite occurs
  on the southern point of the bay.
     Returning to Varna, Capt. Spratt pointed out the localities of the
 fossils collected in the neighbourhood.       The calcareous sandstones  :
  abound in casts of shells and in Oysters and Pectens immediately
  around Varna ; and contain Nummulites in profusion at the upper
  part of the Lake near Allahdyn.      In this last-named neighbourhood
  the uppermost strata, left by the denuding agencies that have affected

 have     thickness

 mass      Nummulites,
              of           Operculinae,   and  Orbitoides,     with  Pectines,   Tere
 uratula, and Ostratae.     This harder portion           the superficial rock has      of
 become apparently weather-worn into vertical pillars, either isolated
 or  still connected above               horizontal layerby    an  hard rock which                    of
 has resisted the destructive action              the weather.         Capt. Spratt
                                                                             of
 observed that         some   places

                                                    by

                                                                        the fact  be                        by                     of

depth.      But Capt. Spratt leans            the opinion that the columnar
                                                                        to

                              is                        actual progress.               in

F       s
    The northern                    district         of    the Island             of    Trinidad, with the islands

                 -
152                        Geological Society:—
between it and the mainland, is composed of flagstones, slates, and
schists, with quartz-veins and some dark-coloured intercalated lime
stone. These rocks are all apparently unfossiliferous; the slates
often abound with iron, and some of the quartz-veins are slightly
auriferous.     Stalactitic caves occur in the limestone of the Island of
Gaspar Grande, and at Las Cuevas and Arouca.            Alluvial beds of
clay and gravel are extensive in this district, and are sometimes
60 feet thick.      At Lateen Bay, in Chicachicare Island, a patch of
aluminous     clay-slate  occurs, with seams of crystalline limestone.
The soil of this northern district is fertile on the limestone, and
barren on the slates. The slate-rocks appear to be the same as those
of Venezuela, which overlie quartz-rock at Upata; and rounded
boulders of quartz-rock occur in the flagstones.
   In the south of the Island of Trinidad, red sandstone abounds,
often ferruginous, and associated with clays which are often either
bituminous or pyritous, and contain lignite and impressions of dico
tyledonous leaves.       In the Erin district the clay-beds have been
sometimes indurated and jasperized by heat. They afford also small
chalybeate and sulphuretted hydrogen springs, and in the blue-clay
formation are found hillocks throwing up mud and water, and ponds
covered by a film of mineral tar. The mud-volcanoes throw up saline
water and greyish mud, in a cold state, with iron-pyrites and water
worn pebbles of blue limestone like that of the northern part of the
Island, and sometimes of sandstone. They do not appear to be
connected with the sea; and are most active at the close of the
rainy season.      At Moruga small hills of granular limestone occur.     -
The succession of deposits in this southern part of Trinidad appears
to be—beginning from below—1. Sandstone, variegated sands,
lignitiferous clays (sometimes jasperized), and the Moruga lime
stone; 2. Blue and brown clays, with bitumen; comprising the
pitch-lakes, salt and alum springs, &c.; 3. Modern marine sand
formation, from 50 to 100 feet thick; and alluvial deposits, seldom
more than 30 feet thick.
   The eastern coast of Trinidad appears to consist of the red sand
stones and bituminous clays as far north as Matura, beyond which
the clay-slates set in.
   The western coast of the island, south of Port of Spain, which is
built of the slate-rocks and limestone, exhibits only modern alluvial
deposits, sometimes calcareous, frequently ferruginous, and resting
towards the south on the red sandstone of the southern district.

    A notice of the occurrence of chalk-flints and greensand in Aber

lists of the fossils had been given. This communication showed
the presence of characteristic Upper Greensand fossils in the low
ground at Moreseat: Thetis minor, Arca carinata, Pinna tetragona,
and Galerites castanea.      The Lima elegans of Nilsson is a new fossil

in Aberdeenshire. The probable continuity, therefore, of these beds
with those of the south of Sweden, where the same order of suc
cession prevails, is inferred; the extension of the Upper Greensand
so far north is a point of much interest.   The Antrim beds are pro
bably Lower Greensand only ; at least their age is doubtful.

England, France, and Belgium.” By                               J.
                                             Prestwich, Esq., F.R.S.,
Treas. G.S.
        In
         former paper the author had shown the correlation of the
              a
strata beneath the Bracklesham series in England, the Calcaire
grossier and Lits Coquilliers in France, and the Upper Ypresian
 system in Belgium, and which he had proposed to designate as the
 “London Tertiary Group,” from the circumstance of these strata at
taining the largest and most distinct development in the English area.
 In the present paper Mr. Prestwich entered into an account of the
structures of the deposits next above. In France this is the Calcaire
grossier, which the French geologists have divided into four stages:
—l. a lower one of green sands, with few fossils; 2. a middle one,
of a calcareous freestone, abounding in marine organic remains
(Grignon, Courtagnon, and other celebrated localities being in beds
of this zone); 3. an upper division, of harder and more flaggy cal
careous rock, rich in Miliolites and Cerithium, mixed with a few fresh
water shells and the remains of plants and land animals; and 4. a
series of white and light green marls, apparently of freshwater origin.
Each division attains at places a thickness of 30 to 40 feet, but the
lower ones are thickest in the centre and west of the Paris basin;
whilst the upper ones, on the contrary, are thickest to the eastward.
The total thickness of the deposit, therefore, rarely at any one place
exceeds 100 feet, whilst the Upper Bracklesham series, with which
it corresponds, is more than 500 feet thick. This difference the
author attributed to a more rapid subsidence of the English area than
of the French at that geological period. This, he showed, was accom
                                                       through the English
                                                                     of all
panied by more marine conditions prevailing
deposit, and          by
                  the continuance throughout          the same green sands
which         in
            France were confined                       to
                                          the lower division.      That the
whole series was, however, synchronous with the Calcaire grossier
 he considered proved            by
                            the circumstance, that, although the fresh

 with the underlying beds than does the mass of the Calcaire grossier,
 in which the proportion is as 28 to 100. The total number of
  Molluscs in the Calcaire grossier of the Oise is 651, and in the
 Bracklesham series of Hampshire 368.
    Above this zone is the series of the Grès Moyen in France and
  Barton clays in England.     Owing to the number of Calcaire gros
 sier fossils which had been found at Barton, these beds had been
 considered synchronous with the Calcaire grossier, a view which
 the author himself had formerly adopted with reserve. Seeing,
 however, that the Bracklesham series probably represented all the
 divisions of the Calcaire grossier, and that the distinction between
 the Bracklesham and Barton series was of equal value to that
 between the Calcaire grossier and the Sables moyens, the author now
 correlated the Barton clays with the Sables moyens, as suggested by
 M. Graves, M<U+017F>. Dumont, Sir Charles Lyell, and M. Hébert. He,
 however, alluded to the difficulty of doing this upon the evidence of
 any small number of organic remains, or even of a few species con
 sidered characteristic in one area; and he showed that in the Barton
 clay itself, although there were many Grès moyen species (63), still
 there were a greater number of Calcaire grossier species (69).      In
 the same way in the Laekenian system of Belgium, which overlaid
 the Bruxellian system (the equivalent of the Calcaire grossier),
 there are forty-five Calcaire grossier and Bracklesham sand species,
 and only forty-four Barton and Grès moyen species. But Mr.
 Prestwich showed that, taking the per-centage of species which
 range from the lower to the higher series, each area offered nearly
 an equal amount of distinction, as out of 100 species of the lower
 series there are in England 30, in France 35, and in Belgium 32,
                                                  -
 which range upwards.
    Mr. Prestwich mentioned that M. Graves had recognized several
 well-known Barton species, such as the Voluta depauperata, V. athleta,
 Oliva Branderi, Conus scabriusculus, &c., in the Sables moyens
 of the Oise. The total known number of the Sables moyens species
is 377, and of the Barton clays 252.
    These series the author proposed to term the “Paris Tertiary
 Group” (its lower part), as the several members of it were more
complete in France than in England, and contained a richer and better
preserved fauna.      This Paris group forms the great Nummulitic
zone.    Hitherto none of these Rhizopoda have been found in the
London group. The author concluded with some general observations
on the extent of the ancient seas and the position of the dry land,
and took occasion to observe on the fact, that, although the several
deposits in each country were so rich in organic remains, yet only
a small proportion of them had hitherto been identified as com
mon to the several areas.     Nevertheless the same genera prevailed,
and the relative number of species of each genus was generally
tolerably well maintained.     He hoped, therefore, that Palaeontolo
gists would, in cases where there was now good reason to believe the
strata to be synchronous, inquire into the extent of variation which
the same species might undergo in areas where the sea had presented

                 Intelligence   and Miscellaneous    Articles.           155
such different conditions of depth, mineral composition of sea-bottom,
&c. A certain number of peculiar species must necessarily result
from such different conditions, but the author considered it pro
bable that the same causes would lead to the existence of such
marked varieties as might, viewing each area separately and inde
pendently, cause some varieties to assume the permanence and
importance of specific differences.        Until the exact synchronism of
any deposit is established, the Palaeontologist cannot always fully
take these causes into consideration, and many admirable monographs
on Tertiary fossils have necessarily been founded, in a great measure,
upon the differences actually apparent, and persistent in the several
areas.
    Mr. Prestwich stated that it was his intention to continue this
inquiry at a future period, and to examine into the correlation of the
curious and interesting freshwater and fluviatile series overlying the
Barton clay on the Hampshire coast and in the Isle of Wight.

     ON THE HEAT ABSORBED IN CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITIONS.
       To  the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,                               Manchester,  July 4, 1856.
       your Number for this month, p. 74, Dr. Woods mis-states the
 IN results    I arrived at fifteen years ago, and endeavours to support
 his own claims as an original discoverer by setting up one portion of
 my papers in contradiction to another. He says that when I caused the
 current to pass through an electrolyte, I did not find the same law to
 exist as when it passed through a metallic conductor.           On the con
 trary, he will find in my paper (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1841, pp. 270–274) the
 account of seven experiments, by which it was proved, that in an elec
 trolytic cell the heat is evolved proportionally to the resistance to con
 duction and the square of the current,      the same law which I had shown
 to exist in the case of a metallic wire and in that of the cell of a bat
 tery. Also at p. 275, he will see a general rule expressed as follows:–
 “When any voltaic arrangement, whether simple or compound, passes
 a current of electricity through any substance, whether an electrolyte
 or not, the total voltaic heat which is generated in any time is pro
 portional to the number of atoms which are electrolyzed in each cell
 of the circuit, multiplied by the virtual intensity of the battery.”       A
 foot-note to the word “virtual '     explains its meaning   by  saying, that
 “If  a decomposing cell be in the circuit, the virtual intensity of the
 battery is reduced in proportion to its resistance to electrolyzation.”
 I think that the meaning of the above proposition is sufficiently clear,
 but will nevertheless illustrate it by two examples.          Suppose, first,
 we take a voltaic      battery of 20 iron-zinc  pairs, and connect its ter
 minals by a metallic wire.        After a certain interval of time, we find
  100 atoms or chemical equivalents of zinc dissolved in each cell of

156               Intelligence   and Miscellaneous Articles.
the battery.     Then the entire amount of heat evolved will be ex
pressed by 100X20=2000.           Suppose, secondly, we employ the same
battery to decompose water; the virtual intensity of the entire bat
tery circuit will then be 20–3}=163 (see p. 272 of the above
named memoir); and when 100 atoms of zinc in each cell of the bat
tery have been dissolved, or what comes to the same thing, when
100 atoms of hydrogen have been liberated in the decomposing
cell, the heat evolved by the entire circuit will be expressed by
100 x 163=1666. The difference between 2000 and 1666, or 334,
represents of course the heat taken up in effecting the separation of
100 atoms of hydrogen from 100 atoms of oxygen, and liberating
them in the gaseous state.
   In p. 276 it will be seen that I deduced the heat of combustion
of hydrogen from the quantity of heat due to the intensity of battery
required to electrolyze water.      In other words, I found the heat of
combustion of     hydrogen  by  observing   the heat lost in the voltaic cir
cuit when water was decomposed.
   My subsequent papers confirm and extend the facts arrived at in
1841, and indicate the effects of secondary actions in the battery,
the laws which regulate the evolution of heat when positive metals,
such as zinc, are employed as electrodes evolving hydrogen, the
mechanical value of chemical changes, &c.           It is in giving a more
defined expression to the law of the evolution of heat by combustion
that Dr. Woods erroneously supposes I have contradicted myself.
The passage he refers to (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1843, pp. 442, 443) sim
ply states “more explicitly, that it is not precisely the attraction of
affinity, but rather the mechanical force expended by the atoms in
falling towards one another, which determines the intensity of the
current, and consequently the quantity of heat evolved.”          This mo
dification appeared to me necessary, inasmuch as, according to the
mechanical theory of heat, the product of the attraction of particles
into the distance they have to traverse in order to combine, rather
than the attraction itself, is to be considered as the source of heat.
   If, therefore, my paper        on

     MY   DEAR   TYNDALL,                                 July      21, 1856.
   In an account of your lecture “On the Cleavage of Crystals and
Slate Rocks” (Phil. Mag. vol. xii. p. 46), you have noticed my ex
perience in the consolidation of precipitated white lead, and have
correctly stated the unfavourable results of my first attempts with
comical moulds.    It may be of interest to the readers of the Philo
sophical Magazine to learn that the difficulty was entirely overcome
by substituting cylindrical moulds. By their employment the lateral
spreading of the mass was prevented, and cakes of white lead were
produced which broke with a conchoidal fracture, and which con
sequently could readily be ground to a granular powder.

   The yellow precipitate furnished by iodide of potassium with ni
trate of silver, is not dissolved by ammonia, but acquires a paler
colour therein. The author has found that this change of colour is
owing to a combination of the iodide of silver with ammonia.--

      ELECTROLYTICAL INVESTIGATIONS.                    B.Y.   M. MAGNU.S.
   It is well known that saline solutions do not follow the law of
equivalent decomposition by the galvanic current, as established
by Faraday, for Daniell found that they are decomposed in such a
manner that, besides 1 equiv. of acid and base, l equiv. of hydrogen
and oxygen are separated.      Thus when a voltameter with dilute
sulphuric acid is interposed in the circuit together with the saline
solution, equal quantities of gas are evolved from both the saline
solution and the voltameter; but besides this, the salt is decomposed,
and 1 equiv. of free acid is separated at the positive electrode, and
1 equiv. of free base at the negative. The decomposition in the saline
solution is therefore twice as great as that in the voltameter.
   To explain this remarkable phaenomenon, or bring it into agree
ment with Faraday's law, Daniell found himself compelled to regard
sulphate of soda, not as consisting of base and acid in accordance
with the general view, but as composed of sodium with a compound
of 1 atom of sulphur and 4 atoms of oxygen. He gave the name of
oxysulphion to this compound, and was of opinion that          oxysalts  all
have  a  similar  composition;      so
                                    that sulphate     copper   of
                                                               must              be
regarded  as  consisting   copper and oxysulphion, nitrate

of potassium and oxynitrion, and           so forth, an opinion which he has
subsequently endeavoured to establish in a more comprehensive                                                                in
quiry published in conjunction with Professor Miller.
    Although this view agrees with that first put forward by Sir

                  on the Polarity   of the  Diamagnetic   Force.            163
ence to even the most recent experiments of M. Weber—those
to which he has referred at the conclusion of the above citation
—it is strongly urged that there is no assurance that the sepa
ration referred to has been effected.           In those experiments, as
already stated, a cylinder of bismuth was suspended within a
vertical helix of covered copper wire, and the action of the
cylinder upon a magnet suspended opposite to the centre or
neutral point of the helix was observed.            To increase the action,
the    position     of the  cylinder  was  changed   at each termination of
the minute swing of the magnet, the amplitude of the oscillations
being thus increased, and the effect rendered more sensible to
the eye. Now, it is urged, there is every reason to believe that
in these motions of a metallic mass within an excited helix
induced currents will be developed, which, acting upon the
magnet,        will produce the motions observed. The failure indeed
to demonstrate the existence of diamagnetic polarity by other
means has, in the case of some investigators, converted this
 belief into     a  certainty.
     Among the number whom M. Weber’s experiments have failed
 to convince, M. Matteucci occupies a prominent place.                    With
 reference to the question before us this philosopher writes as
 follows%:—“In reading the description of the experiments of
 M. Weber, we are struck on beholding the effects produced by
 moving the bismuth when there is no current in the spiral.
 Although the direction of oscillation in this latter case is opposed
 to that observed when the spiral is active, still the fact excites
 doubts as to the truth of the conclusions which have been drawn
 from these experimentst.             To deduce rigorously the demonstra
 tion of      diamagnetic   polarity, it would be necessary to substitute for
 the bismuth, masses formed of insulated fragments of the metalf,
 to vary the dimensions of the cylinder, and above all, to compare
 the effects thus obtained with those which would probably be obtained
 with cylinders of copper and silver in a state of purity.
      “We are obliged to make the same remarks on another series
 of experiments which this physicist has made to obtain anew,
 by the effects of induction, the proof of diamagnetic polarity.
     *   Cours Spécial sur l’Induction, p. 206.
     t   It is not my place to account for the effect here referred to.   I  may
 however remark, that there appears to be no difficulty in referring it to the
 ordinary action of a diamagnetic body upon a magnet.            It is the result
 which Brugmann published upwards of half a century ago; the peculiar
 form of this resultin one of the series of experiments quoted by M. Weber
 must,     I think, be regarded as purely accidental.—J. T.

164                 Professor Tyndall’s further Researches
It is astonishing, that after having sought to neutralize the
development of induced currents in the moving cylinders of
bismuth, by means of a very ingenious disposition of the spiral
—it is astonishing, I repeat, that no attempt was made to prove
by preliminary essays with metals possessing a higher conducti
bility than bismuth, that the same end could be obtained.                                I
cannot leave you ignorant that the doubts which have ventured              I
to advance against the experiments of M. Weber are supported
by the negative result which                 I
                               have obtained in endeavouring to
excite diamagnetic polarity in bismuth by the discharge of the
Leyden jar.”
     It   will be  in the following pages that the conditions laid
                    seen
down by M. Matteucci for the rigorous demonstration of diamag
netic polarity are more than fulfilled.
    The conclusions of M. Weber find a still more strenuous
opponent in his countryman Professor v. Fellitzsch, who has
repeated Weber’s experiments, obtained his results, but who
denies the validity of his inferences.       M. v. Feilitzsch argues,
that in the  experiments   referred to it is impossible to shut out
ordinary induction, and for the rigorous proof of diamagnetic
polarity proposes the following conditions*.         “To render the
experiment free from the action of induced currents two ways
are open. The currents can be so guided that they shall mutually
neutralize each other's action upon the magnet, or the induced
currents can be completely got rid of by using, instead of a dia
magnetic conductor, a diamagnetic insulator.” To test the ques
tion, M. v. Feilitzsch resorted to the latter method: instead of
cylinders of bismuth he made use of cylinders of wax, and also
of a prism of heavy glass, but in neither case was he able to
detect the slightest action upon the magnet.           “However the
motions of the prism might be varied, it was not possible either
to cause the motionless magnet to oscillate, or to bring the
magnet from a state of oscillation to one of rest.” M. v. Fei
litzsch pushes his experiments further, and finds that when the
bismuth is motionless within                     its
                                     spiral, the position    the mag            of
net    just
      is    the same         as
                         when the bismuth        entirely withdrawn;
                                                                is
hence his final conclusion, that the deflection         the magnet        of             in
Weber’s experiments       due  is  induced currents, which are ex
                                             to

resolved to write to the constructor of his apparatus, but pre
vious to doing so the thought occurred to me of writing to
M. Weber, to inquire whether his further reflections on the
subject had suggested to him any desirable modification of his
first instrument.    In reply to my question he undertook to devise
for me an    apparatus,  surpassing in delicacy any hitherto made

according to the method applied to the magnetometer of Gauss.
The rectangle da, d'a', fig. 2, is the outline of a copper damper,
which, owing to the currents induced in it by the motion of the
magnet, soon brings the latter to rest, and thus expedites                       ex
periment.
     It is well known that one end of a magnet attracts, while the
other end repels the same pole of a magnetic needle; and that
between both there is a neutral point which neither attracts nor
repels.     The same is the case with the helices HE, H'E'; so that
when a current is sent through them, if the astatic magnet be
exactly opposite the neutral point, it is unaffected by the helices.
This is scarcely attainable in practice; a slight residual action
remains which draws the magnets against the helices; but this
is very easily neutralized by disposing an external portion of
the circuit so as to act upon the magnets in a direction opposed
to that of the residual action.      Here then we have a pair of
spirals which, when excited, do not act upon the magnets,
and which therefore permit us to examine the pure action
of any body capable of magnetic excitement placed within
them.      In the experiments to be described, it was always
arranged that the current flowed in opposite directions through
the two spirals; so that if the bodies within them were polar,
the two upper ends of these bodies should be poles of opposite
names, and consequently the two lower ends opposed also.
 Supposing now our two cylinders to occupy the central position
 indicated in fig. 2: even if the cylinders became polar through
 the action of the surrounding current, the magnets, being oppo
 site to the neutral points of the cylinders, would experience no
 action from the latter. But suppose the wheel W' to be so
 turned that the two cylinders are brought into the position
 shown in fig. 1, the upper end o of op and the lower end n of
 mn will act simultaneously upon the suspended magnets.         For
the sake of illustration,           let   us

the latter the suspending fibre can be twisted or untwisted with
out altering the level of the magnets.

   As the positions here referred to will be the subject of frequent
reference, for the sake of convenience                      I
                                            will call the position of
the cylinders sketched in fig. 1, Position 1; that sketched in fig.
2, Position 2; and that sketched in fig. 3, Position 3. The re
sults which we have just described, tabulated with reference to
these terms, would then stand thus:—

In changing therefore from position 1 to position 3, a deflection
corresponding to twenty-five divisions of the scale was produced.
   Wishing to place myself beyond the possibility of illusion as
regards the fact of deflection,                I
                                   repeated the experiment with
successive batteries of two, three and four cells.  The following

     Itmay       first sight appear strange that the amount

deflection did not increase with the battery power; the reason,
    part,    that the magnet, when the current circulated, was held
 in in
             is
     aposition free from the spirals,                     by
                                               forces emanating partly

When the current increased, the magnetization            the bismuth     of                     in

  doubt that the     bismuth cylinders produce the motion of the mag
  nets in virtue     of their excitement by the voltaic current; for it
 is not certain      that these cylinders would not produce the same
  motion wholly      independent of the current. Something of this
 kind has occurred to M. Leyser * in his experiments, and why
  not here 7
     In answer to this, I reply, that if the case be as here suggested,
 the motion of the magnet will not be changed when the current

  Here is the experiment.

     Position    1.  764       Position 2. 742          Position 3. 704
 We observe here that in passing from position 2 to position 1
 the motion is from smaller to larger numbers; while in passing
 from position 2 to position 3 the motion is from larger to smaller
numbers. This is the opposite result to that obtained when the
 current flowed in the opposite direction; and it proves that the
 polarity of the bismuth cylinders depends upon the direction of
 the current, changing as the latter changes.            It was pleasant to
 observe the prompt and steady march of the magnet as the cylin
 ders were shifted in the helices.          When the magnets, operated
 on   by  the bars of     bismuth,    were moving in any direction, by
 bringing the two opposite ends of the bismuth bars into action,
 the motion could be promptly checked; the magnets could be
 brought to rest, or their movement converted into one in the
 opposite direction.
    I  may add to the above a series of results obtained some days
subsequently in the presence of Professors Faraday, De la Rive
and Marcet.

    Position   1.   670        Position 2. 650          Position 3. 630
The difference between positions 1 and 3 amounts here to forty
divisions of the scale; subsequent experience enabled me to
make    it still  greater.
    It was found by experiment, that when the motion was from
lower to higher numbers it denoted that the poles NN', fig. 4,
were repelled from the spirals, and the poles SS attracted towards
them. When, on the contrary, the motion was from larger to
smaller numbers, it indicated that the poles NN' were attracted
and the poles SS' repelled.          In the position fig. 1, therefore, of
Tables III. and IV. the        poles  NN' were repelled by the ends no
of the bismuth cylinders, and the poles SS' attracted; while in

the position fig. 3, the poles NN' were attracted by the ends MP,
 and the poles SS' repelled; the ends n and o, therefore, acted as
 two north poles, while the ends m and p acted as two south
 poles. Now the direction of the current in the experiments re
 corded in the two tables referred to was that shown by the arrows
 in fig. 4. Standing in front of the instrument, the direction in
 the adjacent face of the spiral H'E' was from right to left, while
 it was from left to right in HE. From this we may infer that
 the polarity of the bismuth cylinders was the reverse of that
 which would be excited in cylinders of iron under the same cir
 cumstances.       The assertion however shall be transferred from
 the domain of deduction to that of fact before we conclude.

Now if the effects obtained with bismuth were due to induced
currents, we should have the same effects forty times multiplied
in the case of copper, in place of which we have scarcely any
sensible effect at all.
   Bismuth is the only substance which has hitherto produced
an action in experiments of this nature; another illustration,
however, is furnished by the metal antimony, which possesses a
greater conductive power, but a less diamagnetic power than
bismuth.    The following results were obtained with this sub
stance:—
                                             VI.
                          Cylinders of Antimony.

                         Position 2.             688                     252

On comparing these numbers with those already obtained with
bismuth, we observe that for like positions the actions of both
metals are alike in direction. We further observe that the results
are determined, not by the relative conductive powers of the two
metals, but by their relative diamagnetic powers.      the former              If
were the  determining  cause,  we should have  greater deflections
than with the bismuth, which is not the case; if the latter, we
should have less deflections, which is the case.
   The third and severest condition proposed by those who object
to the experiments of M. Weber is to substitute insulators for
 conductors. I call this condition severe for the following rea
 sons:—according to the experiments of Faraday<U+017F>, when bismuth
 and sulphur are submitted to the same magnetic force, the re
pulsion of the former being expressed by the number 1968, that
of the latter will be expressed by 118.     Hence an action which,
 with the means hitherto     used, was difficult of detection in the
 case of bismuth, must wholly escape observation in the case of
sulphur, the intensity of whose excitement is nearly twenty times
less.  The same remarks apply, in a great measure, - to         other               all
insulators.
   But the admirable apparatus made use            this investigation
                                                               of   in
has enabled me       satisfy this condition also.

I am indebted for the loan of two prisms of the self-same heavy
glass with which he made the discovery of diamagnetism. The
bismuth cylinders were withdrawn from the helices and the prisms
of glass put in their places. It was now necessary to have a
perfectly steady magnet, the expected result being so small as to
be readily masked by, or confounded with, a motion arising from
some extraneous disturbance.        The feeble warmth developed in
the helices by a current from two cells I found able to create air
                                                                     upall

    Here, asin the other cases, the deflection was permanent, and could
    be augmented by the suitable raising or lowering of the respect
    ive cylinders. The action is small, but perfectly certain.     The
    magnet was steady and moved promptly and invariably in the
    directions indicated by the numbers. It will be observed that
    the deflections are the same in kind as those produced by bis
    muth.
       The intrusion of other employments compelled me to post
    pone the continuation of these experiments for several weeks.
    On taking up the subject again, my first care was to assure
    myself that the instrument retained          sensibility. Since the      its

The action is very small, but it is nevertheless perfectly certain.
The argument founded on the negative deportment of this sub
stance must therefore give way.    When we consider the feeble
ness of the action with so delicate a means of examination, the
failure of M. v. Feilitzsch to obtain the effect, with an instru
                                                                -
ment constructed by himself, will not excite surprise.
   Thus in the case of seven insulating bodies the existence of
diamagnetic polarity has been proved; the list might be aug
mented without difficulty; but sufficient, I trust, has been done
to remove the scruples of those who saw in M. Weber's results
an action produced by induced currents.
   A portion of the subject hitherto untouched, but one of great
interest, has reference to the polar condition of liquid bodies
while under magnetic influence. The first liquid examined was
distilled water; it was enclosed in thin glass tubes, corked at
the ends, and by means of a loop passing round the cork the
tubes were attached to the string passing round the wheels
WW'. Previous to use, the corks were carefully cleansed, so
that any impurity contracted in cutting, or by contact with fer
ruginous matters, was completely removed.       The following are
the results obtained with this          liquid:—                        º

The experiment        was many times repeated,          but always with the
same result; indeed the polarity of the liquid mass is as safely
established   that of iron.
               as             Pure water is diamagnetic, and the
deflections produced by it are the same as those of     the other all
diamagnetic bodies submitted      examination,

As in the   case  of distilled water, we observe a deflection in one
direction when the current is “ direct” and in the other when it
is “reversed,” the action in the first case, in passing from posi

sions of the scale. The polarity exhibited is that of diamagnetic
bodies.
                   Deportment    of Magnetic     Bodies.
    Thus far we have confined our examination to diamagnetic
 substances; turn we now to the deportment of magnetic bodies
 when submitted to the same conditions of experiment.                 Here
 we must select the substances suitable for examination, for all
 are not so.    Cylinders of iron, for example, of the same size as
 our  diamagnetic   cylinders, would, through the intensity of their
 action, quite derange the apparatus; so that we are obliged to
 have recourse to bodies of smaller size or of feebler magnetic
 capacity.    Besides, the remarks of writers on this subject render
 it of  importance   to examine whether bodies through which the
 magnetic constituents are very sparingly distributed present a
 veritable polarity the same as that exhibited by iron itself.
     Slate rock usually contains from eight to ten per cent. of oxide
 of iron, and a fragment of the substance presented to the single
 pole of an electro-magnet is attracted by the pole. A cylinder of
 slate from the Penrhyn quarries near Bangor was first examined.
 It was not found necessary to increase the effect by using two
 cylinders, and the single one used was suspended in the right-hand
 helix H'E'. The deportment of the substance was as follows:—

    Comparing these deflections with those obtained with diamag
 netic bodies, we see that they are in the opposite direction.
 With the direct current a change from position 1 to 3 is fol
 lowed, in the case of diamagnetic bodies, by a motion from
 higher to lower numbers; while in the present instance the
 motion is from lower numbers to higher.        In the former case
 the north poles of the astatic magnet are attracted, in the latter
 they are repelled. We also see that a direct current acting on
 diamagnetic bodies produces the same deflection as a reverse cur
 rent on magnetic ones. Thus, as we promised at a former
 page, the opposite polarities of diamagnetic and magnetic bodies
are transferred from the region of deduction to that of fact.

action was very powerful. When swiftly moving in any direc
tion, a change in the position of the cylinder instantly checked
the magnet in its course, brought it to rest, or drove it forcibl
in the       opposite

indeed the utmost limit between which it was possible for the
magnet to move; here it rested against the helices.
  Two glass tubes were filled with red oxide of iron and exa
mined. The action of the poles of these cylinders upon the
magnets was so strong, as to efface, by the velocity imparted to
the magnets, all distinct impression of the numbers on the scale.
By changing the position of the tubes within the helices, the
magnets could be driven violently through the field of view, or
could be held rigidly against the respective helices.           As in                              all

    Every substance in each of these lists has been proved to be
 polar under magnetic influence, the polarity of the diamagnetic
 bodies being invariably opposed to that of the magnetic ones.
    In his investigation on the supposed polarity of diamagnetic
 bodies, Mr. Faraday made use of a core of sixpenny pieces, and
 obtained with it the results he sought. Wishing to add the
 testimony of silver as a good conductor to that of copper, two
 cylinders were formed of sixpenny pieces, covered with paper,
 and submitted to experiment.             The following are the results
 obtained:—
                                  XXVIII.

    Position   1.  724         Position 2. 774           Position 3. 804
    The action here was prompt and energetic, strongly contrasted
 with the neutrality of copper; but the deflection was permanent,
 and could not therefore be the result of induced currents. Fur
 ther, it was a deflection which shows magnetic polarity, whereas
 pure silver is feebly diamagnetic.         The cylinders were removed

 proved to be magnetic.

    On observing this deportment of the silver, tried the copper
 cylinders once more.        The results with a direct current were,

 Here almost the same neutrality as before is evidenced.
   Deeming that the magnetism of the cores of silver was due to

182                Professor Tyndall's further Researches
magnetic impurity attaching itself to the paper which covered
them, a number of fourpenny pieces were procured, washed in
ammonia and water, and enclosed in thin glass tubes. The fol
lowing were the results:-

Here also we have a very considerable action indicative of mag
netic polarity.    On examining the cylinders between the poles
of an electro-magnet, they were found decidedly magnetic.
This, therefore, appears to be the common character of our silver
coins. The tubes which contained the pieces were sensibly neutral.
   Knowing the difficulty of demonstrating the existence of dia
magnetic polarity in ordinary insulators, M. Matteucci suggested
that insulated fragments of bismuth ought to be employed, the
insulation being effected by a coat of         resin.     lac   or
                                                         constructed          I
a pair    cylinders
            of          accordance with the suggestion
                              in                             M. Mat                of

                        780
Here we have      very marked action, but the polarity indicated
                        a
is magnetic polarity.   On subsequent examination, the cylinders
proved       to   be
              magnetic.   This was due     impurities attaching to
themselves to the resin.
   But the resin may               be
                         done away with and the powdered metal
still rendered           an
                  insulator.  This thought was suggested      me                              to

satisfactory explanation of these phaenomena until the publication,
by the present Astronomer Royal, of the article on Tides and Waves

explanations of many of the phaenomena in question are given
from the analytical results of most unpromising hypotheses,<
hypotheses admitted to be so much at variance with the real
state of things, that the coincidence of the results is very extra
 ordinary and unexpected.      Though undoubtedly these results
 would take   place on the hypotheses  alluded        now venture            to, I                             to

            explanation          the    phaenomenon     of  observed          rivers,

                between   High-water and Slack-water.               187
modified of course by the quantity of fresh water in ordinary
r1VerS.
    That this is the true theory of the interval between high-water
and slack-water, may also be inferred in a simpler manner from
the following considerations.          Let an observer station himself
at any point in a tidal river, say at Putney Bridge, just before
high-water: the tide will then be flowing up strongly in the
middle of the river, slowly along the shore (see below); at high
water it will cease flowing along the shore and rise no higher,
and in a short time will begin to fall, but will still run up in the
middle.     Now we know that high-water at Richmond and other
places will not take place for more than an hour after high-water
at Putney, and that the level of the water at Richmond is at this
time lower than at Putney.            But where is the water to come
from which makes high-water at Richmond? obviously it must
come from below through Putney Bridge: and it is the water
flowing up to make high-water at Richmond which causes the
middle of the river to continue flowing at Putney after high
water; and when a sufficient quantity of water has flowed to
make the level at Richmond as high or a little higher than
at Putney, the tide will turn at Putney.
Eaplanation   of   the turn    of tide near the shore before it turns in
                                 the offing.
    Let us now suppose an obstacle OB in the channel C, then
whilst the tide is flowing, the water in OBM will not run with
the same velocity as that in the main channel, but will merely
 have the velocity necessary to bring sufficient water into OBM,
 so that the water in OBM may continue to rise with the rise of
 tide. Now when the tide has ceased to rise, the water in OBM
 will cease to run at all, though, as before shown, the water in C
 will continue to flow: and when the tide begins to fall, the
 water in OBM will ebb (with the velocity necessary to take the
 water out of OBM, at such a rate as that the water in OBM
 may fall with the fall of tide), though the water in C will still
 continue to flow.      It is obvious that OBM is a representation
 of the ordinary  slack-water along the margin of rivers, occasioned
 either by actual projections or by the friction of the shore and
 shoals, or by the set of tide.
    I add a few observations taken by me at Putney on a very
 calm afternoon, 9th of Nov. 1851, when there were many leaves,
 &c. floating on the stream.           There was nothing particularly
 remarkable in the       tide,   but   I  am not aware that a similar
 set  of observations are to be found in print, and the study
 of a tide of this sort may be instructive.

Kopp on the Boiling-points of BromineandChlorineCompounds.                                                         191
place of Cl, boil also by w x 32 degrees higher than the latter.
From this, he reasoned, a criterion was obtained as to how many
equivalents of chlorine or bromine were contained in correspond
ing bromine and chlorine    compounds.    As bromide and chloride
of silicon differ by 3 x 32 degrees in their boiling-points, Kopp
inferred that their formulae were respectively Si Brº and Si Cl*.
   The observations on boiling-points made at that time in cor
responding chlorine and bromine compounds justified the assump
tion of that relation, but Kopp thinks now that that remark in
 its original generality                  no

many new compounds have been discovered whose boiling-points
 do   not agree with this rule, and the boiling-points                      many                        in of

194        Prof. Schmidt on    the   Boracic Acid Fumaroles.
the assertion of Payen, that the fumarole vapours, before their
passage through the waters of the lagoons, contain no boracic
acid, the following experiment was made.     A large glass funnel
was fastened over one of the     jets of vapour  issuing from the
ground, and connected by means of a leaden pipe and several
long wide glass tubes with empty glass balloons, which served
as condensers.    The gas evolved was a mixture of much carbonic
acid with a small quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen. Small
quantities only of nitrogen, and no oxygen were found. The
liquid condensed in the receiver reddened litmus paper, but ren
dered turmeric paper brown; and a quantity of it evaporated to
dryness and treated with sulphuric acid, imparted to the alcohol
flame the characteristic green colour of boracic acid, proving
that boracic acid exists preformed in the fumarole vapours.  The
condensed liquid contained, besides, carbonic acid and ammonia
in considerable quantity. Distinctly estimable amounts of silica,
baryta, iron, alumina, lime and magnesia, were also found. From
a series of experiments,Schmidt supposes that the fumarole liquid
contains about 0.1 per cent. of boracic acid, and thinks that it
is in the form of borate of baryta.
   Hessel” found that by the addition of a certain quantity of cal
cined gypsum to muddy wines, they were clarified and rendered
somewhat stronger, retaining their original taste and flavour.
Gypsum has the same effect on muddy beer, with the exception
that it is rendered more bitter.
  Two important methods for the artificial production of urea
are given by Natanson't.    He shows that carbamide and urea are
identical. When carbonic aether is heated with excess of am
monia in a closed tube to 100° C., urethane alone is formed;
but if the temperature of the tube be raised to 180°, the boiling
point of urethane, it is converted by the excess of ammonia into
urea.   In the empty parts of the tube a sublimate of undecom
posed urethane is deposited: the aqueous solution contains urea.
If this solution be evaporated to dryness and kept some time at
100° C., the urethane volatilizes and urea remains behind.
   In 1838 Regnault obtained, by the action of phosgene gas on
ammonia, a white saline mass, which comported itself as a mix
ture of carbamide and sal-ammoniac.       In this mass urea must
probably have been contained; but if the gases had not been
well dried,   its
                quantity would have been small      comparison
                                                      in                 to
the other substances, and     might easily have escaped detection.

through perchloride  of antimony.    It was conducted along with
ammonia,    both gases  being quite dry, into a capacious vessel.
The mass obtained was treated with absolute alcohol, the alco
holic solution evaporated to dryness, and the residue dissolved in
a small      quantityof cold water. On the addition of nitric acid,
the    characteristic nitrate of urea is obtained. The presence of
urea was          confirmed by other reagents.
  Natanson* found that by the action of chloride of elayle on
ammonia, a base,  the oxide of acetylammonium, was produced.

XXVI.    Remarks on Slaty Cleavage, and the Contortions                  of Rocks.
       By Sir John F. W. HERschEL, Bart., F.R.S.                    &c.
      DEAR SIR,                            Collingwood, July 27, 1856.
Lº        me thank you for several instances of obliging attention
       in forwarding me copies of your scientific papers on diamag
netism, and quite recently of your lecture on the Slaty Cleavage,
which appears to me a singularly happy explanation of that odd
phaenomenon.        I
                    may mention an illustration of the same nature
with some others you have introduced, which occurs in the
manufacture of the coin of the realm. One part of the process
consists in “ringing” each piece of gold or silver coin (after
receiving the impression).     Every piece which will not ring on
dashing it against a stone is rejected and re-melted; and such are
numerous. Now the cause of this can be no other than minute
air-blebs in the bars out of which the laminae of metal are rolled
by a flatting-mill, each bleb being flattened out into an infinite
simally thin film of air parallel to the faces of the coin, and so
producing a solution of continuity, and of course destroying the
harmonic vibration.
   There are one or two points suggested by your views of the
slaty cleavage which harmonize so entirely with certain ideas                    I
have long held about geological stratification in general, that                  I
cannot forbear mentioning them.                   I
                                     refer to the contortions of
strata which are usually accounted for (as Poulett Scrope has
done) by the protrusive violence of igneous rocks crushing
together and doubling up the strata. To me it has always
seemed that this feature might be more tranquilly produced
thus:—
  Suppose  A A the ocean surface, and BBB                 its
                                                    bed, forming                a

                             to   a,
sion. Then   up     to  certain point the friction
                         a                                     of
                                                       the bed will
retain the deposited mud               on   its
                                     slope, and     this way strata
                                                          in
nearly  ofuniform thickness (and parallel) will            be
                                                     formed.

   But as the thickness of the whole increases, the weight will
overcome the friction, and the still soft strata will yield inwards
from     all
          sides towards the central portion            the bed, increasing   of
the thickness              of
                   the strata    there,   and   the same time crumpling at
 up the strata into contortions, &c. The whole affair may
                                                                                                               go   on
with any degree                 of
                       slowness*.
   Now      this process goes on, the middle thickness will increase,
              as

which your theory requires for the slaty cleavage, which (be                                                        it
observed) does not absolutely require violent force (for mere force
cannot produce any rearrangement               molecules), but only inter
                                                                   of

XXVII.      Preliminary Notice on the Electric Conducting Power     of
       the Alkaline Metals.       By A. MATTHIEssen, Ph.D.4
 OF alkaline
         the physical properties of the metals of the alkalies and
                  earths very little is at present known; and having
some   of them at my disposal, I thought it would be interesting
to study some of their most important properties. I have com
menced, under the direction of Professor Kirchhoff, in the Hei
delberg Physical Laboratory, with the electric conducting power
of the alkaline metals, and have found that of potassium at ordi
nary temperature, compared with that of silver at 0°-100, to be—
                                               20.1
                    Of sodium      .  .    .   86-6
                    Of lithium     .   .   .    18.7
   The manner in which the wires were pressed and the method
of observation I shall describe as soon as I have determined their
conducting power at different temperatures, as well as that of
the metals of the alkaline earths.
   An interesting fact is the rapid diminishing of the conducting
power at the point of fusion.            With potassium it diminishes
gradually between the temperatures 50° to 57°C.; whereas with
sodium, suddenly at about 96°, as the following data show:—
   The conducting power of
potassium is at—                            That of sodium is  at
        40° C. . .        17:21                75° C.  .  .  24:44
        49° C. . . 16:44                       85°C.   .  .  23:41
        53° C.    .   .   14-81                95° C.  .  .  22.42
        58° C. . .        12.91                97° C.  .  .   16-23
        56° C. . .        12'21               110° C.  .  .   15-36
        57° C. . . 11-54                      120° C.  .  .   14-17
        70° C. . . 11
        80° C. . .        10-65
                  Compared with silver at 0°= 100.
   This difference in the behaviour of these metals may be ex
plained by the observation lately made by Regnault, in his paper
“On the Specific Heat of Simple Bodies” (Ann. de Chim. ei de
Phys. vol. xlvi. p. 257), wherein he states that potassium does
not pass directly from the liquid to the solid state, like sodium,
but becomes first semi-fluid and then gradually solid, which fact
is plainly shown by comparing the conducting power of the two
metals at their fusing-points.

   The formula C*H* 0°, to which these analyses lead, differs
from the one formerly given, C*H* O°, by 1 equivalent of
water.       I
           prefer the former, since the substance employed in the
last analyses was evidently purer than that used in any previous
one.   It will be seen also, that the formula just given is con
firmed by an examination of the products of decomposition of
rubian with chlorine.

XXIX.          Doctrine of Parallel Lines considered in a new
             The
   Method.    By  JoHN STEVELLY, LL.D., Professor of Natural
   Philosophy in Queen's University, Ireland.
    To the Editors        of the Philosophical Magazine     and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                                        Belfast,   July   3, 1856.
                been lately engaged teaching my youngest son
HAYING  the elements of Euclid,              I
                                     was again induced to waste
some hours on a subject on which in my schoolboy and college
days I, in common I suppose with every schoolboy and collegian
since the days of Euclid, had over and over again wearied myself
in vain. On this occasion, however, the matter presented itself
to my mind in a form which, to me at least, was quite new, and
which seems to afford a solid foundation for the doctrine of
parallel lines, and to place the subject in a form not perhaps un
suited to elementary instruction.
   If you agree with me, and think     it worth           a place     in your
valuable Magazine, it is at your service.
                 I
           am, Gentlemen, with much respect,

                                                         John STEveLLY.
                                     Definition.
   Let two straight lines in to                 A.           ..?"
the same plane (ww.and y2)be
said to be parallel when both
stand at right angles to the
same straight line (A, B).      3/             | B           2.
   Cor. I. Hence two parallel lines, if produced indefinitely on
either side, can never meet.       (Otherwise a triangle would be
formed with an external angle equal to an internal remote angle,
as both are right. This would contradict the 16th of Euclid's first
book.)
   Cor. II.  Hence equally distant points from       and A   taken   B,
along   waand        y2   on
                      each side      AB, are equally distant from

                           considered in a new Method.                                  221
each other.   (This can be shown as a simple consequence of the
4th of Euclid's first book; but is manifest more simply by
supposing waby to be folded over upon AB; for, on account of
the right angles, wA, Aw and yB, B2 would coincide throughout
their entire length.)
                               Proposition. Lemma            I.
   Let wa and y2 be two parallel lines,
AB   the line to which both are perpen
dicular. Take D and E, equally distant
from A and B, on the same side of AB.
Bisect AB in C.   Erect Cu perpendicular
to AB. Then shall Cu meet DE as in m,
a  point which bisects DE; and Cu shall
stand perpendicularly to DE.                  A.      C      E.
   For Cuis parallel to both wa and y2, and
therefore, if produced, can never meet either
(Cor. I. Def). Therefore if produced, it
must cross DE between D and E. Suppose
                                                 JC        Z
at m, now join Am and Bm. Then in the
triangles ACm and BCm we have the sides
AC and Cm respectively equal to BC and Cm, and the angles
contained by these sides (both right) equal, therefore (4th, first
book of Euclid) Am=Bm, and the angles CmA=CmB, and
CAm=CBm; and since the angle DAC=EBC (both right),
hence ma<U+017F>)=mBE.          Then in the triangles mAD and mBE we
have the sides DA and Am respectively equal to EB and Bm,
and the angles contained by those sides also equal; therefore
 (4th, Euclid's first book) Dm-Em; and the angle DmA=EmA.
Therefore we have DmC-DmA+AmC=Emb-H Bm0 = EmC,
and therefore mC perpendicular to DE, and bisects        Q.E.D.         it.

   “Account of Pendulum Experiments undertaken in the Harton
Colliery for the purpose of determining the Mean Density of the
Earth.”     By G. B. Airy, Esq., Astronomer Royal.
   In the first section of this paper, the author explains the reasons,
founded on calculation, which appeared to make it probable that
the comparison of gravity at the top and the bottom of a mine
would give means of determining the earth's mean density with
accuracy, perhaps superior to that obtained in the Schehallien or the
Cavendish experiment; and which induced him first in the summer
of 1826 (in concert with Dr. Whewell), and again in 1828 (with
Dr. Whewell, Mr. Sheepshanks and others), to try the experiment in
the Dolcoath mine near Camborne in Cornwall.      These attempts were
both frustrated by accidents having no connexion with the essential
parts of the experiment. After a lapse of many years, he found that
several circumstances (of which one was the general familiarity with
the manipulation of the galvanic telegraph and the facility of applying
it to the comparison of widely separated clocks) were very favourable
to a repetition of the experiment; and having selected the Harton
Colliery in the neighbourhood of South Shields as a          place,     fit            in
which two stations could           be

circuit through the battery, the journeyman-clock,            and the two
galvanometers.
   The working party consisted        Mr. Dunkin (superintendent) and
                                         of

      Mr. G. B. Airy    on the  Mean Density of the Earth.          229
Mr. Ellis from the Royal Observatory, Mr. Pogson from the Obser
vatory of Oxford, Mr. Creswick from the Observatory of Cambridge,
Mr. G. Rümker from the Observatory of Durham, and Mr. Sim
monds from Mr. Carrington's Red Hill Observatory.
   The plan of operations was this. Simultaneous observations of
the two pendulums (one in the upper and the other in the lower
station) were kept up incessantly during the whole working time
(day and night) of one week; then the pendulums were interchanged
and were observed in the same manner through another week; after
this the pendulums were twice interchanged, but the two last series
of observations were so much shortened that both were included in
one week.      Each pendulum had six swings of nearly four hours
each, on every day of observation; and between the end of one
swing and the beginning of the next, numerous galvanic signals were
passed for the comparison of the clocks.
   The second section gives the details (as far as space permits)
of the comparisons of clocks by the galvanic signals. On examining
the proportion of rates, it was found that there was distinctly a per
sonal equation in the observation of the galvanic signals.     Approxi
mate values for the different observers were obtained, and the pro
portion of rates was corrected (where necessary) for these equations.
   The third section describes the general system of observing the
pendulums and reducing the observations.           For ascertaining the
time of a coincidence of the vibration of the detached pendulum
with that of the clock pendulum, the mean of the times of the first
disappearance and the last re-appearance was employed.           Several
coincidences were observed at the beginning of a swing and the mean
was taken : and several were observed, and the mean taken, at the
end of the swing.      From these means, a mean interval of coin
cidences was obtained; from which the ratio of the actual rate of
the detached pendulum to that of the clock pendulum was found.
This requires several corrections.
   The correction depending on the arc of vibration, with no data
except the first and last arcs of vibration, and no assumption of a
mathematical law for the intermediate arcs, is made to depend on
the results of experimental observations on the numerical decrease of
the arc by a peculiar process.
   The corrections depending on the temperature and the atmospheric
pressure are based mainly on Sabine's experiments,
   The fourth section contains an abstract of the Pendulum Obser
vations at the Upper Station, with the corrected logarithm of the
rate of the detached pendulum on the clock pendulum for every
swing; and the fifth section contains a similar abstract for the
Lower Station.
   The sixth section gives the computation of the logarithm of the
rate of the lower detached pendulum upon the upper detached pen
dulum (for which the preceding sections have furnished the ele
ments).     Then is given in detail the investigation, by the Theory of
Probabilities, of the formula for the best combination of the results
of the different swings. The advantage of the method of incessant

230                        Royal Society:—
observations with numerous comparisons of the clocks is pointed out.
The formula is applied to the four series of observations; and the
results of the first and third series agree very closely, and those of
the second and fourth series agree very closely, showing that the
pendulums had undergone no sensible change.         By comparing the
mean of the first and third series with the mean of the second and
fourth, the proportion of pendulum rates at the upper and lower
stations is obtained independently of the pendulums employed.
The conclusion is that gravity below is greater than gravity above
by Twº gath part, with an uncertainty of ###th part of the excess;
or that the acceleration of a seconds' pendulum below is 2*24 per
day, with an uncertainty of less than 0-01.      Reasons however are
given for believing that the uncertainty is greater than this quan
tity.
   #he seventh section contains a description of the operation for
measuring the depth of the mine.         It then treats of the process to
be employed for, computing the proportion of gravity at the upper
and lower stations (without reference to the experiments), on an
assumed proportion of the density of the mine-rocks to the earth's
mean density.     It is shown that, supposing the upper surface of the
ground about Harton to have the true spheroidal form, it is unne
cessary to give any attention to the irregularities of the surface on
distant parts of the earth.     It is also shown that there is no reason
to doubt the correctness of the law of decrease of the attraction of
the earth's nucleus as depending on the elevation of the station, un
less there be some serious irregularity in the arrangement or density
of the matter immediately below Harton. Assuming this to be in
sensible, the theory of correction for the inequalities of ground in
the neighbourhood of Harton is then considered. The elevation of
the upper station is about 74 feet above high water; and as it ap
pears from this that the depth of inequality can in no case amount
to one-tenth of the depth of the lower station, it is easily found that
the excess or defect of attraction will be computed with sufficient
accuracy by supposing the excess or defect of matter to exist abso
                                                     .
lutely at the surface; in which case the effect on the upper station
is mothing, and that on the lower station is easily computed. For
depressions like that of the sea bounded (at least        the purposes of
computation) by a straight line near the mine, but unlimited in the
 other direction, a simple formula is found.
    For the application of these theorems it was necessary to have
a map giving the elevations of the ground at various points. By
instruction of the Mayor and Corporation of South Shields, the
 Corporation Surveyor, Christopher Thompson, Esq., prepared such
 a map.    In the use of   it,    was found convenient     toadopt
                                    it                                unit

2:6.     The fusing-point was found, 39°. The boiling-point was
examined by Mr. Duppa with a considerable quantity of substance,
the purity of which had been ascertained by analysis.                 It was
observed to be 230°C.           The boiling-point of the chloride of tita
mium, as observed by Dumas, and confirmed by Mr. Duppa, is 135°.
The difference, 230–135=95=3 × 31, is exactly the same as that
observed between the boiling-points of chloride and bromide of silicium.
    This observation furnishes an additional support to the analogy
of silicium and titanium, while it points unequivocally to the formulae
                                TiCl,  and TiBra,
as representing the atomic constitution       of these two compounds.
    Titanic acid, hitherto universally represented as a binoxide TiO,
would then assume the formula
                                       TiO,
in perfect analogy with that of silicic acid.
    The equivalent of titanium would then be changed from 24'29,
the number at present adopted, to 36-39.              The protoxide of tita
nium would in this case become a sesquioxide, and the compound
 hitherto viewed as sesquioxide would have to be considered as an in
 termediate oxide—as a combination of the sesquioxide with the ter
 oxide, in fact, as a bititanate of sesquioxide of titanium.

     It is scarcely necessary to observe, that an alteration of the equiva
 lent of titanium on the ground of the difference of the two boiling
 points, would be hazardous, if not supported by additional experi
 mental evidence, and that further researches on the series of titanium
 are required in order to establish whether the proposed alteration
 actually affords a simpler expression for the combining relations of
 this remarkable element”.

quantity of galvanic current except what is caused by the bad con
ducting power of the electrolyte, and the same amount of heat is
evolved in a solid and liquid conductorby the same electromotive power
if it acts against the same resistance; but part of the heat so pro
duced is absorbed by the decomposition or separation of the elements.
It is not that the galvanic current is diminished by effecting elec
trolysis, otherwise than it is when it passes through a badly conducting
solid, for the whole current is effective, and the whole amount of heat
due to it is produced; but simply that part of that heat is rendered
latent by the decomposition.
    If a compound body is decomposed without using the battery at
all, and that heat is absorbed, or does not make its appearance, that
loss of heat cannot be ascribed to diminished intensity of galvanic
current.          If,

decomposed.        Now does the combination                 the potassium and          of
 oxygen produce          much heat  as    this case        in the elements were    as   if

 all.  I  say this, because Mr. Joule brings forward his paper         1841                                               it

236                Intelligence    and Miscellaneous          Articles.
          I
about it would point to that paper.        In the first place, he does not
speak of it; and in the second place, when about to calculate the
amount of heat produced in the cell of a voltaic pair composed of
zinc and silver, he says (p. 266 of the paper he refers to in vol. xix.
Phil. Mag. 1841), “Before I proceed to give an account of some
experiments on heat evolved in cells of voltaic pairs, it is important
to observe that every kind of action not essentially electrolytic must
be eliminated,” &c.      He then, in calculating the heat produced,
makes allowance for the combination of the oxide of zinc and sul
phuric acid, but does not at all mention the absorption of heat pro
duced by decomposition of the water, which is of greater amount, in
the opposite direction.
    The several data to be taken into account in calculating the amount
of heat produced by the solution of zinc in sulphuric acid are, the
oxidation of the zinc, the combination of the oxide of zinc and acid,
and the absorption of heat by decomposition.         This last Mr. Joule
does not allude to at all; and when it is considered that he sets
out with the determination to eliminate all actions which might in
terfere with the proper amount of heat being arrived at, it must be
concluded that at that time he did not know that heat was absorbed
by decomposition.
    Now as to Mr. Joule's second charge, that I set up one part of
his papers against another, I can only say I merely quote his own
words to show that opinions he once held he afterwards altered, and
that I endeavoured to show his first opinions were correct. If any
contradiction appears, he should rather blame himself than me. He
      I
says erroneously suppose he contradicts himself. The matter stands
thus:—Mr. Joule proved experimentally (vol. xx. Phil. Mag. 1842)
that the amount of heat produced by oxidation might be taken as a
measure of the intensity of the attraction of affinity between the
combining bodies; but in a subsequent paper (Phil, Mag. vol. xxiii.
p. 442) he says that “it is not precisely the attraction of affinity, &c.
which determines the intensity of the current and consequently the
amount of heat evolved.”      This is the contradiction he says I erro
neously imagine.     Without being aware that these papers had been
published,    I
              had myself proved experimentally the first proposition;
and when Mr. Joule claimed               it,
                                         once, on referring

OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS UPON THE EMPLOYMENT OF
IODIDE OF POTASSIUM As A REAGENT FOR ozoNE. BY S. CLoíz.
   The experiments of Marignac, Fremy, and Becquerel have done
most to clear up the question of the nature of ozone; they prove
completely the possibility of imparting to chemically pure oxygen
all the properties of this mysterious substance.
   Iodide of potassium being one of those substances upon which
ozone is capable of acting, paper soaked in a solution of starch con
taining 0.002 of its weight of this iodide has been proposed, under
the name of the ozonometric reagent, not only to indicate the presence
of ozone, but also to measure the quantity contained in the air. If
the coloration of this paper could only be produced by ozonized
oxygen,      its
               employment would leave nothing                  desired.   Butto    be
this  is not the case; acid vapours act upon iodide             potassium           of                      in
the same manner         active oxygen; the essential oils exhaled by plants
                             as
have the same action, and prove that moist air, under the influence
of  the direct light      the sun, colours the reagent, although we can
                                 of
not suppose the air                to

ON   THE PRESENCE OF MERCURY IN THE NATIVE ARGENTIFEROUS
        COPPER OF LAKE SUPERIOR.       B.Y. M. HAUTEFEUILLE.
   The author received 200  kilogrammes      this mineral    ascertain     of                           to
its  value.  Its gangue consisted principally        calcareous spar,                    of
which was got rid             of   by
                        dilute muriatic acid;      weight was 50'476                  its
kilogrms.   The copper was covered with larger and smaller tufts
                                                                                                                      on of of
metallic silver, which were removed        the graver.   Fragments    by
copper were selected which did not appear       have had any silver             to
the surface, and cut into the centre; the author found     them 0-002                              in
of silver; the whole gave 0.008                          of
                                     silver when melted. The total
weight     copper was 138'560 kilogrms.

  The silver removed by the graver was assayed by the humid way
and estimated     0.993, but the assay presented the following phae
                       at
nomena:–1, the liquid was scarcely limpid;       the chloride    silver          2,                           of

did not acquire colour when exposed to a bright light, hence the
author concluded that mercury was present.        To settle this point,
the author boiled the chloride of silver with a plate of gold, a little
tin, and muriatic acid; the gold plate was amalgamated. He then
treated 150 grims. of the silver separated by the graver by M. Levol's
process, seeking for the mercury in the liquid deprived of silver and
containing the double acetate of ammonia and mercury.        By means
of protochloride of tin he obtained of metallic mercury 0.0035=0.038
kilogrms., the silver being 10.906 kilogrims.        Thus this copper
contains,—

1.
     A*    our present modified views respecting the nature and
           deportment of heat, which constitute the mechanical
theory of heat, had their origin in the well-known fact that heat
may be employed for producing mechanical work, we may natu
rally anticipate that the theory so originated will in
                                                                                            Atits

to place this application     heat         of

the more general views thus obtained must enable                 pro                             us   to
nounce safely upon the efficiency                           of
                                          the several machines for
thus applying heat,           whether they already perfectly fulfil
                                 as       to
their purpose,      or
                   whether and      what extent they are capable
                                                      to
of being perfected.
   Besides these reasons, which apply               thermo-dynamic    to       all
machines, there are others, applicable more particularly          the                                     to

                     Theory        of Heat   to the Steam-engine.                         243
   3. These two examples will suffice to show, that the principles
upon which our former theory of steam-engines was founded have
suffered such essential modifications through the mechanical
theory of heat, as to render a new investigation of the subject
necessary.
                                       I
   In the present memoir have attempted to develope the prin
ciples of the calculation of the work of the steam-engine in
accordance with the mechanical theory of heat.        have, how        I
ever, limited myself to the steam-engines now in use, without at
present entering into a consideration of the more recent and cer
tainly very interesting attempts to employ vapour in a super
heated state.
   In recording the results of      my investigation, I shall only
assume   my   last memoir,   “On a modified Form of the Second
Fundamental Theorem in the Mechanical Theory of Heat”,” as
known.     This will of course necessitate the deduction, in a
somewhat different manner, of results which are no longer new,
but have already been found by myself or others; I believe,
however, that this repetition, by leading to greater unity and
facility of comprehension, will not be found superfluous.    At the
proper places            I
                   shall, to the best of my ability, cite the works
wherein these results first appeared.
   4. The expression “a machine is driven by heat,” is not of
course strictly accurate.     By it we must understand, that, in
consequence of the changes produced by heat upon some kind
of matter in the machine, the parts of the latter are set in motion.
 We shall refer to this matter as that which manifests the action
 of heat.
   If a continuously-acting machine is in uniform action,                                   all
 accompanying changes occur periodically,   that the condition    so
 which     given time prevails
           at                     the machine and all
                                                 in      parts                      its
             at a
 returns    equal intervals.   Hence the matter which manifests
 the action   the applied
                    of     heat must    such regularly-recurring
                                                        at
 periods     be
            present    the machinein   equal quantity, and
                                                      in      the                     in
 same state.             This condition can
                                       fulfilled  betwo different ways.
                                                                  in
    First. One and the same  quantity      matter   mayofalways remain
 in the  machine, when the modifications which this matter suffers
 during the action      the machine will

 each period     will regain
                    it                     its
                                original condition and recommence
 the same cycle     changes. of
    Secondly. The machine may always expel the matter which
            produce the effect during
            to                                 period, and         place            its
                                                                            of in

mum of work is first found, and the losses occasioned by the
several imperfections of the process are subsequently deducted

 at  the commencement the vessel contains           water       liquid      no                          in       a

 place.     If the vessel has to be compressed, then the assumption
that at the commencement it contained no liquid could not be
 made, because in such a case the vapour would not remain at a
 maximum density, but would become over-heated by the heat
 generated through compression.           During expansion, however,
not   only   does the   vapour   remain at a maximum density, but a
part of it is actually condensed; and it is the diminution of m
                                                                      ;
 consequent thereon which is exhibited in the Table.            The initial
 temperature     is supposed to be 150° C., and the values of            are
given which correspond to the periods when, by expansion, the
temperature is reduced to 125°, 100°, &c. . . . . As before, in
order to distinguish it from the absolute temperature T, the tem
perature counted from the freezing-point is represented by t.

    16. In order to express the relation which exists between the
 volume v and the temperature, we must employ the equa
 tion (6), i. e.
                               v=mu + Mo'.
 The magnitude a herein involved, which represents the volume
 of a unit of weight of liquid, changes very little with the tempe
 rature; and these small changes may be the more safely neglected,
because the whole value of a is very small in comparison to u;
we shall consequently consider a, as well as the product Ma, as
 constant. The product mu therefore alone remains to be deter
 mined. For this purpose we have only to substitute the value
of r, as given in equation (WI), in equation (VII), and we obtain
                         dp                  _Mello...T.

The differential coefficient
                                 # which    here appears, is to be     con
sidered as known, p itself being given as a function of the tem
perature.       Hence the product mu is determined by this equation,
and   by  the addition of Ma the required value of v will also result
from it.
    The same assumptions being made as before, the following
Table shows a series of values of the fraction

     For instance, machines driven by heated air will only attain a
decided advantage over steam-engines when a method is found
of allowing them to work at a far higher temperature than steam
engines, in consequence of the danger of explosions, can bear.
The same advantage, however, could be attained with over-heated
vapour; for as soon as the vapour is separated from the liquid,
it is just as safe to heat it further as to heat a permanent gas.
Machines employing vapour in this condition may possess many
of the advantages of the steam-engine besides those of air
machines, so that a practical improvement may sooner be ex
pected from these than from air-machines.
   In the machines above mentioned, where, besides water, a
second   more vaporizable substance was employed, the interval
Ti-To is increased by lowering To. It has already been sug
gested, that this interval might be increased in a similar manner
on the upper side, by the addition of a third liquid less vapor
izable than water. In such a case the fire would be immediately
applied to the evaporation of the least vaporizable of the three
substances, the condensation of this to the evaporation of the
second, and the condensation of the second to the evaporation of
the third.   Theoretically, there is no doubt that such a combi
nation would be advantageous; the practical difficulties, how
ever, which would have to be overcome in realizing such a scheme
cannot of course be predicted.
   26. Besides the above-mentioned     defect, arising out of the
very nature of our ordinary steam-engines, these machines suffer
from many other imperfections, which may be ascribed more
immediately to defective construction.
   One of these has already been considered in the foregoing
development, and allowed for in equation (X), that is to say, the
expansion cannot be continued nearly far enough to allow the
vapour in the cylinder to reach the temperature of the condenser.

principles, the original formulas of Fresnel are apparently neces

    In opposition to this, however, another view has been sug

angle formed by the known directions of the rays, and conse
quently of the amplitudes at right angles to them, and in the
same plane (first paper, $23). In this triangle, the angles being
(i–r), (i+r),          and      (tr—2i), the ratios of the sides will be (as
                                                                       -

   5. On Maccullagh's theory of equal densities, it will be remem
bered that this construction represents the mechanical equiva
lence, and the sides thus give the values of the amplitudes.
   The close agreement of these values with those for the ampli
tudes in case (2) deduced on the hypothesis of increased density,
—to which no such construction can apply,–has been already
remarked (first paper, $$ 25, 41).
   But these values cannot be those of the amplitudes in case (3)
on the hypothesis of increased density, since experimental results
essentially require a different relation in this case from that in
case (2).
   6. From the triangle, however, we have this obvious and
 simple relation of equivalence,

           Mr.   J.   P. Hennessy on the Theory of Parallels.                                                  283
  It   appears, therefore, that in passing into perchlororubian,
chlororubian loses 9 equivalents of water and 9 of hydrogen, 8
of the latter being substituted by chlorine, since
      C44 H.27 ClO24+ 17Cl–C44 H9Cl5O15+9HO +9CIH.
  It is a singular
                 circumstance, that the 9 equivalents of chlorine
in this compound are much more firmly combined with the other
constituents than the                    l
                        equivalent contained in chlororubian,
which the mere action of alkali is sufficient to separate.
  From the experiments just described it may be inferred, that
chlororubian is a conjugate compound containing sugar. It
resembles Piria’s chlorosalicine, which, by the action of acids,
yields chlorosaligenine and sugar, just as chlororubian gives
chlororubiadine and sugar. Though chlororubian is not, strictly
speaking, a product of substitution of rubian, still it retains some
of the properties of the latter; for instance, that of giving, with
alkalies, products of decomposition differing from those formed
by acids.    In            all
                     the processes       decomposition previouslyof
described, rubian      decomposed                             in
                                           less than three different     no
modes, just           as
                       were
                       if    it is

ferent bodies, whereas, when acted               chlorine,     yields    on   by                     it
only one series         products.

   Now when we regard a pair of parallel lines, just as we regard
a square or a circle, as a simple geometrical figure, and when we
seek for its definition, we find that there are a large number
of properties (propria) from which to choose.          A different
property has been chosen by Wolfius, D'Alembert, Varignon,
 R. Simson, and a host of others who have written on the sub
ject. The definition given by Wolfius, but which a distinguished
 writer* suggests was borrowed by him from Clavius, seems to
 me, according to analogy, to be the most philosophical.     None
of these geometers attempted to solve the difficulty by going
back to the fundamental principles of definition, or by carefully
 analysing those other definitions which have been found to suc
 ceed.   It         is,
               however,  remarkable fact, that
                                         a         we now adopt                  if

                            in        definition exactly the same

as  that borrowed from the Geometria Practica.
        Euclid defines     circle
                               a      be,     to
   “A     plain figure     bounded                   by
                                           one continued line, called        cir                            its
cumference; and having                certain point within          from which              it,

                                     to
    It  thus   has,  like      system
                                   a        parallel lines, two essential ele
                                                       of
ments.         In
              the one there         continued line and point,
                                         is   a                        the othera                 in
there are two right lines. The definition                                  of
                                                          the circle depends
 on
 a      property possessed                    by
                                     every possible right line drawn from
the   point      the continued line. That property
                    to                                            mutual equa              is,
lity. Now we know that the right lines from the point                        the                            to
continued line are                 all
                              perpendicular                  that Euclid's de

finition depends essentially upon the equality                        perpendi        of         all
culars drawn from one element of the circle to the other. This
leads         us
            very naturally         Wolfius's definition:—
                                          to
    “Parallel    right   lines are such, that perpendiculars from every
point         in
            one  upon     the other are equal.”
   From this,              as
                        well             as
                                   from the one        formerly gave,I       the                            all

is, that this definition makes the demonstrations rather complex.

288        M. T. Plateau               on the recent Theories               of the Constitution of
liquid; which tension, at a sufficient distance from the orifice,
becomes strong enough to overcome the cohesion between two
adjoining sections of the jet.
  Lastly, Maus adopts, with Dejean, the hypothesis of pulsations,
the production of which he, on his part, explains by considera
tions of his own ; but convinced that pulsations alone could not
 determine the formation of the isolated masses, he assigns the
discontinuity of the jet to the same cause as Magnus.
   The above theories are based, therefore, upon two hypotheses,—
that of pulsations at the orifice, and that of rupture caused by
the acceleration in the descent of the liquid.                  will now endea     I
vour to show that both these hypotheses are inadmissible.

            Jets of Liquid issuing from Circular Orifices.                                      289
charges and small orifices, this inclination, and consequently the
variations in velocity and diameter, are insignificant in the part
of the jet we are considering, so that we should conclude that
the jet ought to be perfectly uniform; nevertheless it resolves
itself into drops at a determinate point.”
   To these facts we may add another deduced from Savart's
experiments.    When a jet issues obliquely upwards, within cer
tain limits of inclination, the discontinuous part becomes scat
tered in a vertical plane and forms a kind of sheaf.        Now a
glance at the figure which represents such a jet in the plates
accompanying Savart's memoir, will show that the sheaf has                                           its
origin very near the summit                    of
                                         the curvature      the jet, and con
                                                                       of
sequently         at
                  a point where the velocity, retarded from the orifice,
has not yet become sensibly accelerated.
    Thus,       the first place,
                 in                     jets issuing horizontally under
                                              in                                                     a

tinuity first occurs         at
                             a   point where the velocity         scarcely      is               in
creased, and consequently where the tension between two conti
guous sections cannot have become considerable;                    the second    in

            in                                                         a

                       a
point where the increase             velocity
                                          of       still less; and lastly,

 Magnus might nevertheless reply that neither Savart nor Hagen

and afterwards by employing the precautions indicated by Savart
for deadening these effects.    In the first case, the result was sen
sibly conformable to the engraved figure of which spoke, which                            I
figure no doubt corresponds to conditions of change and orifice
analogous to those in my experiment; and in the second case,
the result, as will be seen, was not essentially different. The jet
issued from an orifice 3 millims. in diameter at an angle of about
35° with the horizon; the amplitude of the jet, that is to say,
the horizontal distance from the orifice to the most exterior part
of the sheaf, varied, according to the diminution of the charge,
from 1.45 metre to 1.27 metre; and the height of the summit
of the jet above the level of the orifice varied from 0.34 metre to
0.32 metre.    In the second observation, a carpet folded several
times until             its
                thickness amounted          centims, was interposed
                                                                 to  8

upon     atruss     hay, and the sheaf glided down

                                 the small vibrations proceeding from
exterior noises was not completely annulled; for the continuous
and limpid portion          the jet suffered intermittent shortenings,

however, that the vibrations which still remained must have been
very feeble; nevertheless the sheaf manifested itself quite              well                               as
as  under the free influence             these vibrations, and

For under the same charge, the total tension between two con
tiguous strata                of

the same, will evidently each             proportional  be   the number              to                           of

portion.  On the contrary, however, experiment shows that the
length of the continuous portion is nearly proportional to the
diameter of the orifice.
    Lastly,        it is  easy to see, & priori, that the tension due to acce
leration of           velocity does not in reality produce any tendency to
disunion.              In fact, if this tension separated the liquid molecules,
the density of the continuous part would diminish from above
downwards;    now a little reflection on the relative mobility of
molecules of liquid will soon convince us that this diminution of
density is impossible; for as soon as two molecules tend to se
parate, another is displaced and steps between them, whence it
follows that the only effect of tension will be to lengthen the
jet     by
         making       thinner; and

292      M. T. Plateau              on the recent Theories              of the Constitution of
of his own for this kind of observations, affirms the same thing
in his memoir above cited.     Hence if these protuberances, which
are carried by the translatory motion of the liquid, proceed from
the orifice itself, they there project very little.  But, according
to Savart's experiments, they are more perceptible the further
they are observed from the orifice, until near the extremity of the
continuous part they become greatly developed, and finally at
the extremity they detach themselves successively as isolated
masses.     Savart does not expressly mention the contractions
which alternate with these expansions, but it is evident that the
latter cannot become developed and acquire greater volume ex
cept at the expense of the intermediate portions, so that these
parts must necessarily become hollower and thinner the more
the protuberances project. Now                           let
                                               suppose for     us

294        M. T. Plateau         on the recent Theories              of the     Constitution     of
equilibrium, into a series of isolated spheres, equal in diameter,
equidistant, and having their centres on the line which forms
the axis of the cylinder; in the intervals between these are
spherules of different diameters, having their centres on the
same line.
   4. This transformation commences with the origination of
regularly placed contractions alternating with expansions; after
wards both one and the other become more developed; the con
tracted parts becoming thinner, the expanded ones thicker. When
the centres of the contracted parts become sufficiently thin, they
do not rupture suddenly, but the liquid, receding on both sides
of each of the centres towards the expanded parts, still leaves the
latter for an instant connected two and two by a thread sensibly
cylindrical.   Lastly, these threads transform themselves in the
same manner as the cylinders; and by the rupture of threads
still more attenuated, resulting from their own contractions, they
leave the isolated masses which form the above spherules, whilst
the larger masses proceeding from the expanded parts of the
original cylinder, and which are at equal distances asunder,
assume spherical figures.
   5. This spontaneous alteration and this transformation, whose
final result is the formation of isolated spheres with spherules
arranged in the intervals, are not peculiar to cylinders: they
accompany every other liquid figure of which one dimension is
considerable compared to the other two.
   Lastly,       I
               recognized many other properties which will be
found described in my Second Series, but which need not be here
repeated.

I   will here mention, in support of the above facts, a phaenomenon

are   only    the    limits,  which are more and more          approached    the

which the tabulated observations of the illustrious French philo
sopher fully confirm.
  I  have still to establish the connexion between my theory and
the phaenomena resulting from the influence of tones; as already
stated, this was done in my Third Series.   When vibrations are in
reality communicated to the vessel and the liquid it contains, the
principle of pulsations at the orifice ceases to be a vague and
improbable hypothesis, and becomes almost a certainty. Now                                                I
have demonstrated that when the tone which acts upon the jet
is exactly in unison with the one which the shock of the discon
tinuous part against a stretched membrane would produce, the
expansions and contractions caused by the vibrations executed at
the orifice coincide perfectly with the expansions and contractions
due to the molecular forces, so that there is absolute concurrence
between the two actions.        From this simple principle     have                             I
afterwards deduced               the explanation                of       all   the phaenomena            ob
served          by
          Savart.

 298       M. Heintz      on some Experiments with Chloroform.
 temperature was kept for some time at 200°C. When potassium
 is heated in chloroform vapour a violent explosion takes place.
     By acting on formiate of lead with chloroform, he hoped to
 get anhydrous formic acid, thus:–
        3(PbO C3HO8) -- C*H Cl3 = 8PbCl 4-4(C2HO°).
        Formiate of lead.     Chloroform.                   Anhydrous
                                                           formic acid.
 But formiate of lead is not acted upon by chloroform at any
 temperature at which it would not be decomposed if heated
 alone.    For he found, on heating formiate of lead to about
 200° C. under exclusion of air, that it is decomposed into me
 tallic lead, carbonic acid, and hydrogen.
     Heintz thought that by acting on chloroform with ammonia,
 if any  action took place which was not accompanied by decompo
 sition of the formyle, it might be according to two equations:—
             C*H C13+4NH3=3(NH4CI)+C*H N,
            Chloroform.
             C2H Cl3+6NH3=3NH4C14-3(NH2)C*H.
By the first of these actions      a nitride of formyle might be ob
tained, and by the second a formyltriamine.
    At ordinary temperatures the two substances do not act on
each other.     When chloroform is passed with excess of ammonia
through a heated tube, no action takes place till the temperature
approaches a red heat, when chloride and cyanide of ammonium
are   formed:—
             C*H Cl3+5NH8–3(NH4Cl)+NH4C*N;
           Chloroform.              Chloride of    Cyanide of
                                    ammonluln.     anarnonlumn.
and if the temperature be raised high enough, paracyanogen is
produced from the decomposition of the cyanide.
    The action is different in the presence of water.           In that case
it may be expressed by the formula—
      C*H C13+4HO +NH3-NH4O, C*HO8+3(NH4CI).
                                 Formiate of ammonia.
    If the aqueous    solution of ammonia with chloroform be heated
to 180°C., formiate of ammonia and chloride of ammonium are                  \
formed. If the alcoholic solution of ammonia be heated with
chloroform to 190°, some formiate of ammonia is formed, together
with cyanide of ammonium. Sometimes neither the one nor the
other of these bodies is produced; when this is the case, para
cyanogen is formed in some quantity.            Along with these bodies
a little  aethylamine    is formed;   but this arises from the action
of ammonia on the alcohol, and is quite independent of the
chloroform.

      Action     of Chloride of Sulphur            on Formiate    of Baryta.        299
   The same chemist investigated” the action of chloride of sul
phur on formiate of baryta and acetate and benzoate of soda.
By the first of these actions he hoped to get anhydrous formic
acid.  But such is not the product of the action; there are
formed monohydrated formic acid and carbonic oxide: thus—
4(BaO,C*HO3)4-3CIS=2S,BaOSO3,3BaCl,4CO,2(C*HO3HO).
  Formiate of                                                           Monohydrated
     baryta.                                                             formic acid.
The reaction gives a method for the preparation of monohydrated
formic acid, which consists in mixing four equivalents of an an
hydrous formiate with four equivalents of water, and then adding
three equivalents of chloride of sulphur.     By distilling the mix
ture at a temperature of 100°C. to 120°C., pure monohydrated
formic acid is obtained.
   An acid formiate of soda or potash cannot be formed, and hence
themethodused by Melsens for producing monohydrated aceticacid
from binacetate of potash is inapplicable in the case of formic acid.
   Heintz found that chloride of sulphur acts on anhydrous organic
salts in such a manner, that a chloride and sulphate of the metal
are produced and sulphur separated; and the sulphur separated
crystallizes from boiling alcohol partly in the form of rhombic
octahedra, and partly in that of long acicular crystals.         The
same is the case with sulphur separated by acids from solution
 of sulphide of sodium or potassium.
    Anhydrous acetate of soda gives with chloride of sulphur
 anhydrous acetic acid according to the equation—
 4(NaO, C4H8O3)+3Cl S=NaCl, NaOSOs, 2S, 4(C4H8O3).

But there are formed at the same time various collateral products,
especially sulphur compounds, and in certain cases a liquid
heavier and less volatile than water, and not miscible with                         it.

from that proposed by Breunlinº, who considers it to be a com
pound of a mineral of the formula of nepheline with pentasul
phide of sodium.
    But both chemists agree in the fact, that when decomposed
by acids, one equivalent of sulphur is liberated as sulphuretted
 hydrogen, and four equivs. as free sulphur.        Wilkens thinks
 that hyposulphite of soda, with sulphide of sodium, is the colour
 ing principle of a silicate of alumina. The sulphur in ultra
 marine cannot be replaced by any other body, nor can the sodium.
 Experiments carefully made with this view, with potash, lime,
 and magnesia, afforded no ultramarine.    Iron exerts no influence
 in producing the blue colour.
     Green ultramarine, which always precedes the formation of
 blue, is considered by Wilkens to be a sulphide of sodium com
                                                                                        it its

   Dr. Wohlºk describes a triple salt of sulphate of magnesia,
manganese, and zinc.      It is obtained by leaving to spontaneous
evaporation, at a temperature of 9°C., a mixture in equivalent
proportions of the sulphates of magnesia, zinc, and manganese.
It crystallizes in large plates, and columns of a clear rose colour
of the form of sulphate of magnesia, and has the following com
position:—
                MgO, SO3+MnO, SO3+ZnO, SO3+21HO.
If  sulphate of potash or ammonia be added, the corresponding
triple salt, with 18 equivs. of water, is obtained, 3 equivs. of
water being replaced by an alkaline sulphate.
   The same chemist obtainedit from the unripe fruit of the
Phaseolus vulgaris, a new saccharine matter. The fresh unripe
fruit is heated some time in steam, or dipped in boiling water

and submitted to fermentation, then neutralized with chalk,

    MY DEAR SIR,-In               a letter which          I   had the honour to address to

results of observations therein described may aid in solving the
question as to the period, the age, at which the impregnated ova of
fish are most retentive of life, and consequently are in the state best
fitted for transport without loss of life.

  The ninth experiment        was made on the 24th               Six ova

were exposed   for two hours and four minutes to a   temperature  falling
from 72° to 70°.     Examined a   quarter of an hour   after, and before
the water was cold, the circulation was found vigorous in all. One
was hatched on the 2nd of January, the remainder between the 5th
and 8th.
   The tenth experiment, and the last of its kind that           have to      I
describe, was made on the 2nd of January. Six ova, in each of which
the circulation was distinct, were exposed for four hours to a tem
perature varying from 70° to 72°–the greater part of the time 72°.
Examined immediately on being taken out, the circulation was seen
uninterrupted in three, arrested in the other three.   In three-quarters
of an  hour,  when the water had cooled   nearly  to the temperature of
the room, 55°, the circulation was found to be renewed in the latter.
In the interval, one of the former was hatched, and a vigorous fish
produced; on the following morning four more had come forth, and
in the one remaining egg the foetal circulation was vigorous; it was
hatched on the 4th of January.
  I  beg now to pass to the other series of experiments referred to,
those in which trial of the vitality of the ova was made by sending
them to a distance. The method was briefly the following.         The
ova were lightly packed in wet wool contained in a tin-plate box per
forated in its bottom to admit air, and covered with a wooden cover
that had been soaked in water, with the intent of preserving moisture.
The box was wrapped in tow, loosely covered with oiled paper, and
the whole, in an envelope of common writing-paper, was well secured
by a binding of thread.   Thus prepared, the ova were sent by post
to Penzance, in Cornwall, a distance exceeding 500 miles, with the
request that they should be sent back by return of post unopened.
  The first experiment was made on the 9th of November. The number
of ova sent  was thirty, taken from the common stock without selec
tion.   They were received on their return on the 14th of the same
month.     On taking them out,         all
                                      were found transparent; but, with
the exception    of one,   allbecame opaque          being put into water,

and that one, after   a few days, also underwent the same change.
   The second experiment was made             on

308                                       Royal Society    —
have been much the same throughout England.                     When examined,
eleven of the ova      immediately     became   opaque    on immersion in water.
In the other eleven there was no loss of transparency, and in these,
under the microscope, the circulation was found active.                      Those
which had become opaque were placed in a pretty strong solution of
common salt, by which their transparency was restored, the saline
solution dissolving the coagulum.              Now examined, no traces of
development could be detected under the microscope in any one of
them,-showing that they had been dead before they were sent away.
    On the following day, the 18th of December, the eleven transpa
rent ova were repacked, and again sent the same distance. They
came back on the 22nd ; they retained then their transparency;
placed in water, a feeble circulation was to be seen in two under the
microscope; in nine the blood-corpuscles had ceased to flow; these
became opaque. Of the two in which the circulation was perceptible,
one was hatched on the 28th of December; the young fish in the
other died, it would appear, in the act of breaking the membrane,                                      its
head,        onthe 29th, having been found protruding, but the heart’s
action stopped.
    The fifth experiment was made                    on
                                                 the 26th                   of
                                                                 December. Ten
ova,    in which the circulation was active, and the foetus               each well          in
advanced, were sent off                    on
                                    the day mentioned, and returned              the              on
31st.      The weather, during the whole time, was mild, the frost
having ceased.         When opened, the ova were                          all
                                                              found hatched, and
the young fish dead,            might have been expected. When put into
                                     as
water, not one           of
                        them showed any signs           remaining vitality; they

  MM. Cahours                 and Hofmann on a new Class                           of Alcohols.              309
under the microscope, and the embryos were visible even to the
unaided eye,         I
                  examined the whole number then remaining, viz. 405,
thus reduced, owing to 67 having been removed, one after another
having become opaque, and 152 having been taken out for the pur
pose of experiments. Of these 405 remaining, 138 were found alive,
each containing a well-formed embryo, and 267, though still trans
parent, without life, no marks of organization being to be seen in
them, either with the naked eye or under the microscope.                   Hence,
irrespective of the 152 experimented on, the proportion of living to
dead on the 14th of December would appear to be as 138 to 364,
or about 25 per cent. And, with the exception of two which died
after the 14th, all those them alive were hatched, the first on the
31st of the same month, the last on the 9th of January.
   What are the conclusions to be drawn from these results?                 From
those of the first series of experiments, may it not be considered as
proved that the power of resisting an undue increase of temperature
is possessed in a higher degree by the ova in an advanced than in an
early stage of development,          the degree probably being in the ratio
of the age? From those of the second series, is it not as manifest
that the power of bearing distant transport, and of retaining life in
moist air, is in like degree increasing with age? And from both,
may not the general conclusion be drawn, that the strength of vi
tality of the impregnated ovum, or                 power           its
                                                               resisting agencies  of
unfavourable         to life, its
                              gradually  increases with    age   and the progress
           development?                                                            of

    facility.                                      compounds, the study of
                        We will specify the following
    which we have more or less      completed.
        Acryle-oramethane, or oramate of acryle, is readily formed by
     adding alcoholic ammonia in small quantities to oxalate of acryle,
     until a permanent precipitate is produced. The filtered solution de
     posits on evaporation the oxamate in magnificent crystals.
         Carbonate of acryle is an aromatic oily liquid, lighter than water.
     It is formed like the other carbonic ethers, by the action of sodium
     upon the oxalate. An alcoholic solution of this substance, when
     treated with baryta, furnished carbonate of barium and acrylic alcohol.
        Benzoate of acryle is readily produced by the action of chloride of
     benzoyle upon acrylic alcohol.      It is a liquid heavier than water,
     which boils at 220°,  and possesses an aromatic odour, similar to that
     of benzoic ether. The analysis of this substance leads to the
    formula
                       C20H10O3=Cli [HA (C6H5)].O.
        The same  body  is easily produced by the mutual reaction of iodide
     of acryle and benzoate of silver.
        Acetate of acryle, obtained by the action of iodide of acryle upon
    acetate of silver, is a liquid lighter than water, of an odour resem
    bling that of common acetic ether. According to our analysis, it
    Contains
                          Clo HsO4=C, Ha (C6H5) Or.
        Cyanate of silver is most violently attacked by iodide of acryle,
    even in the cold.      The heat generated during this reaction is so
    powerful that the whole of the new product distils over. The sub
    stance thus obtained has an incredibly penetrating odour, and causes
    lacrymation in the highest degree.      The analysis of this colourless
    transparent liquid, which boils at 82°, led to the formula
                        Cs H, NO,-C, (C, H,) NO.
      This is the cyanate of acryle. Gently warmed with a solution of am
    monia, this liquid readily dissolves, and the solution deposits upon
    evaporation magnificent crystals, which are nothing but acrylic urea,

       Aniline  produces   with cyanate of acryle an analogous substance,
    which   crystallizes remarkably  well.
       When treated with water, cyanate of acryle is gradually converted
    into a solid crystalline substance. The compound obtained in this
    manner has the composition and          the properties

   The experiments detailed in the preceding sketch incontestably
demonstrate the existence of a new series of alcohols, the third term
of which is acrylic alcohol.
   Like ordinary alcohol, this new alcohol furnishes a series of deriva
tives, which may be formulated in a similar manner.

prepared in juxtaposition with the corresponding members of the

  Acrylic alcohol, the history of which we have endeavoured to
sketch in the preceding pages, and in the study of which we are now
engaged, is the third term of a series of alcohols, which is parallel to
the ordinary alcohols of the formula
                            Cng Hng 12 O2,
and the prototype of which is ethylic alcohol.         The acid corre
sponding to this alcohol is acrylic acid, as has been stated. Che
mists are already acquainted with several homologues of acrylic acid,
which stand to the series of fatty acids in the same relation which
exists between our new alcohol and common alcohol.           Cyanide of
acryle, which is readily procured by the action of iodide of acryle upon
cyanide of silver, but which as yet we have not been able to obtain
in a state of perfect purity, when submitted to the action of potassa,
will obviously furnish an acid, homologous to acrylic acid equally as
cyanide of propyle is transformed into butylic acid.
   We terminate this note with a synoptical table of the two homo
logous groups.

ably deflected at several of the principal Trigonometrical Stations,
and at almost every station the cause of the deflection is apparent in
the configuration of the surrounding country.
     The deflection of the plumb-line at Arthur's Seat is 5"1, and at
the Royal Observatory at Edinburgh it amounts to 5".63 to the
 South.      The unequal distribution of matter in the vicinity of these
 Stations—the great trough of the Firth of Forth being on the North
and the range of the Pentland Hills on the South—presents an
obvious cause for the deflection; but as the contoured plans of the
county of Edinburgh have been published and the best attainable
 data acquired for estimating the amount of local attraction at the
 above-mentioned stations, it appeared desirable specially to investi
 gate the matter, both on account of its scientific interest and with a
view to confirm the results arrived at from the previous investigation
 of    all the observed latitudes.        Col. James accordingly decided                                             on
 having observations taken with Airy's Zenith Sector                    the summit                on

    After   these preliminary    explanations, a detailed account is given
of the mathematical        investigation,  and the paper, which was illus
trated with     plans  and   geological  sections,  and a model of Arthur's
Seat, concludes with the following statement of the principal re
sults:—
    1. “The     effect of the attraction of the Pentland Hills is observed
in nearly equal amount at         each   of the three stations on Arthur's
Seat.
    2. “The calculated attractions        of the   mass of Arthur's Seat at
the three stations are,
           South Station.         Arthur's Seat.        North Station.
          2"-25 North.            0"-34 South.          1'''98 South.
and, since the observed deflection at Arthur's Seat is 5":27, the
apparent effect of the Pentlands is 4".93 at the summit of the hill.
    3. “Of this deflection of 4".93, the computed attraction due to the
configuration of the ground within a radius of fifteen miles accounts
for about 2".6; and, inasmuch as we know that the igneous rocks
of Arthur's Seat and the Pentland Hills have an origin at a great
depth below the surface of the earth, the difference between the
observed and computed attraction is probably owing in part to the
high specific gravity of the mass of rock beneath them.
    4. “The deflection at the Royal Observatory, Calton Hill, being
 5".63 South, exceeds that at Arthur's Seat by 0".70.            Of this de
 flection, 0"60 is due to the configuration of the ground comprised
within a circle of a mile and a quarter round the Observatory.
    5. “The latitude of Arthur's Seat or points in the neighbourhood
varies to the amount of 0"-02 between high and low water.
    6. “The mean density of the earth, determined from the observa
tions at the three stations on Arthur's Seat, is 5:14, with a probable
error of +'07 due to the probable errors of the astronomical ampli
tudes.”

    Feb. 11, 1856.-A paper was read by Mr. Maxwell of Trinity
 College, on Faraday's Lines of Force, in continuation of a former
paper (Phil. Mag. vol. xi. p. 404).
    This paper was chiefly occupied with the extension of the method
 of lines of force to the phaenomena of electro-magnetism, by means
of a mathematical method founded on Faraday's idea of an “electro
 tonic state.”
    In order to obtain a clear view of the phaenomena to be explained,
 we must begin with some general definitions of quantity and inten
sity as applicable to electric currents and to magnetic induction.        It
 was shown in the first part of this paper, that electrical and mag
netic phaenomena present a mathematical analogy to the case of a
 fluid whose steady motion is affected by certain moving forces and
 resistances.      [The purely imaginary nature of this fluid has been

                 Mr. Maxwell                    on Faraday's Lines                  of   Force.               317
already insisted on..]   Now the amount of fluid passing through any
area in unit of time measures the quantity of action over this area;
and the moving forces which act on any element in order to over
come the resistance, represent the total intensity of action within the
element.
   In electric currents, the quantity of the current in any given direc
tion is measured by the quantity of electricity which crosses a unit
area perpendicularly to this direction; and the intensity, by the
resolved part of the whole electromotive forces acting in that direc
tion.   In a closed circuit, whose length =l, coefficient of resistance
=k, and section = C2, if F be the whole electromotive force round
the circuit, and I the whole quantity of the current,

   The laws of Ohm with respect to electric currents were then ap
plied to cases in which the conducting power of the medium is dif
ferent in different directions.      The general equations were given and
several cases solved.
   In magnetic phaenomena, the distinction of quantity and intensity
is less obvious, though equally necessary. It is found, that what
Faraday calls the quantity of inductive magnetic action over any
surface, depends only on the number of lines of magnetic force which
pass through            it,
                     and that the total electromotive effect           conduct                    ona

ment, either of translation, rotation, or disfigurement, then the dif
ference of potential before and after displacement will represent the
force urging the conductor in the direction of displacement.      The
force acting on any element of a conductor will be perpendicular to
the plane of the current and the lines of magnetic force, and will be
measured by the product of the quantities of electric and magnetic
action into the sine of the angle between the direction of the electric
and magnetic lines of force.
   The second law enables us to determine the quantity and direction

    We have seen that from certain expressions for magnetic intensity
 we could deduce those for the quantity of currents, so that the cur
 rents which pass through a given closed curve may be measured by
 the total magnetic intensity round that curve.        Here we have an
 integration round the curve itself instead of one over the enclosed sur
face. In the same way, if we assume the mathematical existence of
 a state, bearing the same relation to magnetic quantity that mag
 netic intensity bears to electric quantity, we shall have an expression
 for the quantity of magnetic induction passing through a closed cir
 cuit in terms of quantities depending on the circuit itself, and not
 on the enclosed space.

     ON THE HEAT ABSORBED IN CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITIONS.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
         GENTLEMEN,
I
                                    e           Manchester, Sept. 15, 1856.
    AM    sorry  to have to trouble the     patience  of your readers on a
      matter  personal   between Dr. Woods and       myself,  but his letter
in your last Number leaves me no alternative.         My reply shall be as
brief as possible.
   Dr. Woods seems to be ignorant of the necessary and important
distinction I have always drawn in my papers between resistance to
conduction and resistance to electrolysis.       I stated in my last, that
I found that the heat evolved was in an       electrolytic  cell, as well as
in a metallic   conductor,   proportional to the resistance to conduction
and the square of the quantity (commonly called intensity) of cur
rent passed in a given time. I therefore still maintain, that his
remarks in page 74 involve a mis-statement of my results.           The law
of which I adduced the example requoted by Dr. Woods, shows
clearly the position I had arrived at in 1841, for it proves that I
was well aware that resistance to electrolysis reacts upon the inten
sity of the battery, so as to cause a loss of heat to the entire circuit
for a given quantity of current passed.       That the actual amount of
this loss is equal to the heat evolved by the reverse operation of
chemical union was proved, as I said in my last, in vol. xix. p. 276
of this Magazine.      Dr. Woods next says, that I “published a paper
in the Philosophical Magazine proving that the heat developed by a
galvanic current is proportional to its intensity.”          I did no such
thing. My law was, that the “heat which is produced by any pair
is proportional to its intensity and the number of atoms which are
electrolysed in it.”      He goes on to say, that when the current was
passed through an electrolyte, I thought part of the intensity was
used up in causing electrolysis, and that the remainder only was
effective in producing heat. Of course the intensity or electromo
tive force of the battery is so used up ; and hence it arises (as I
proved), that after a certain amount of battery action has taken place,
a loss of heat evolved is observed, not in the electrolytic cell alone,
but in the entire circuit, the amount of such loss being, as I proved,
equal to the heat which would be produced by the reunion of the
separated elements.
   But Dr. Woods is mistaken if he thinks that my claim rests for
support on this individual paper of 1841.            He will find in the
Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester for
 1846, a paper of mine, “On the Heat evolved during the Elec
trolysis of Water,” read before that Society in January 1843, in
which, after distinguishing between various kinds of resistance to the
electrical current, I remark, p. 103, “that in the resistance accom
panied by chemical changes the heat due to its reaction is rendered
latent, and is thus lost by the circuit;” and p. 104, “that however
we arrange the voltaic apparatus, and whatever cells of electrolysis

 we include in the circuit, the whole caloric of the circuit is exactly
 accounted for by the whole of the chemical changes.”           The same
 thing is reiterated in p. 105, in which I state, that in the electrolysis
 of water a “transfer of latent heat, equal to 8°-27 per equivalent,
 takes place from the battery to the electrolytic cell.”
    I still maintain, therefore, and with additional proofs, that the law
 claimed by Dr. Woods was proved by me in my papers from 1841
 downwards; and I now pass on to my paper of 1846, of which Dr.
 Woods says, “Has it been published exactly as it is in their hands?
 Perhaps the absorption of heat might not be shown in it at all.”         I
have fortunately the means of rebutting the injurious insinuation
 conveyed by these words.         I herewith send you the rough copy of
 the translation of my original manuscript which M. Mordacque, Pro
 fessor of the French language in this town, was so good as to make
me. You will observe at the head of it the attestation of M. Mor
 dacque, that it was prepared by him for me in 1845*.
    I observe that Dr. Woods, in endeavouring to clear himself of my
 second charge, viz. that he endeavours to support his own claims as
an original discoverer by setting up one portion of my papers in con
tradiction to another, merely reiterates the erroneous supposition he
advanced in p. 75. I have only therefore to refer to my last letter
                               I
in reply. Who is right, or he, I leave with full confidence to the
determination of any one who will read my papers with candour.
          I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen,
                                   Yours very respectfully,

        ON A LAW OF      ELECTRICAL HEAT.         BY DR. P. RIESS.
       To the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
    I was in hopes that my reply to the attack of Sir W. Snow Harris
would have been met by a substantial, tangible rejoinder, namely an
exact description of the experiments which Sir William regards as
incompatible with the law of electrical heat established by me.        He
has, however, preferred to come forward, in the August Number of
the Magazine, with some scattered remarks, which are partly ines
sential and partly unproved, and to produce testimonies which are
to confute me.      I will briefly examine these observations in the order
in which    they  occur;   but I must for the future take care, that ob
jections which I leave unanswered are not on that account regarded
as well founded.
    The author complains of the tone and mode of expression which
prevail in my short reply to his long attack.        I will not appeal to
the fact that   my  letter,  like the present one, was written in German
and translated in England; for if one expression appears strength
    * We have compared the French translation with the paper published
in the Magazine for 1852, and find them to be exactly the same.—EDs.

  ened in English, in return another is softened.          But, then, does Sir
  William think that the proper tone is hit in his memoir, in which
 such expressions as “clumsy way,” “commonplace and unsound
 objection,” and “somewhat learned endeavour,” are made use of
 against me 2 If so, I need no excuse for having adopted a tone
 which he thinks improper.
     In reference to his memoir in the Philosophical Transactions for
  1834, I have charged Sir W. Harris with want of the necessary
 knowledge.      Such a charge must be put up with by every one who
 draws from experiments untenable results, which it would have been
 impossible for him to have done had he been acquainted with the
 works of Franklin, AEpinus, Coulomb, and Poisson.
      Iam compelled to assume, that, nineteen years ago, I demonstrated
 that law of electrical heat which is attacked by Sir William, and
 that it has not yet been refuted. This law is not one of the points
 of my electrical labours regarding which doubts have been raised;
                                                                          be all

 electricity      detail, and has proved

          in                  Sir William supposes the resistance between

he throws over his own law of electrical heat.

myself, have employed his paper in experiments on the atmo
sphere, have adopted as the most probable opinion that which
attributes to ozone the bluish colour produced in the natural atmo
sphere. The probability of this opinion does not appear to me to be
invalidated by the results of M. Cloéz.
    Thus, 1. At a distance from laboratories or workshops whence
hyponitric acid is evolved, the existence of rutilant vapours in the
atmosphere appears to me very improbable.        Again, I do not believe
that the nitric acid produced by storms remains long without being
neutralized, either by ammonia, or by the lime of the calcareous
particles which float in the air in most countries; and especially I
do not think that this acid exists beyond the drops of rain, the in
fluence of which MI. Schönbein has recommended to be carefully
avoided. Moreover, the hypothesis of the coloration of iodized
starch by the nitric acid existing in the air has already been dis
cussed by M. Schönbein, in consequence of observations made by
M. Heller at Vienna. The latter having observed the nitrification
of potash in the air, attributed this effect, and also the spontaneous
coloration of iodized starch-paper, to atmospheric nitric acid.      But
M. Schönbein ascertained that this acid, diffused in the air in suffi
cient quantity to redden litmus paper rapidly, acted but slowly upon
paper with iodized starch; from which he concluded, that if the
natural air contains minute quantities of this acid insensible to     lit
mus, they can have no action upon iodized paper.
     2. M. Cloéz has observed the production of a blue colour in paper
exposed to the emanations of aromatic plants; but is it not the
 same with regard to phosphorus * Do we not see the oxidation of
 this body accompanied by an appearance of ozone, when the too
active excess of the phosphorized vapours does not destroy the effect
 first produced 2 and do we there attribute the coloration of the paper
 to other bodies than ozone *
     3. If light be capable of giving moist air the property of acting
 upon ozonometric paper only in a closed space, this fact, whatever
 interest it may possess, has no bearing upon the usual meteorolo
 gical observations relating to ozone. I may add, that the exposure
 of the paper to the sun has one incontestable inconvenience, that of
 increasing the fugacity of the colorations produced, by the too rapid
 volatilization of the iodine.   Therefore I have always recommended
 the observers who have lent me their assistance to avoid, as a general
 rule, the influence of the direct solar rays.-Comptes Rendus, July 21,

       NOTE ON THE ENDOSMOSE OF GASES.              BY   J. JAMIN.
   Döbereiner once filled a cracked bell-glass, standing in water in a
pneumatic trough, with hydrogen gas. Although the sides of the
crack were very closely pressed together, the hydrogen filtered slowly
through this fissure and became diffused in the atmosphere.      What
was remarkable in this experiment      is,
                                         that during the issue       of

hydrogen   apartial vacuum was produced      inthe bell-glass, and that
the water rose several inches above the exterior level. This inter
 esting observation was not then carried any further, but     M. Magnus

 afterwards took it up, using designedly-cracked glasses, and demon
 strated that         if,    on
                          the one hand, the hydrogen escapes outwards, the
 air,      the other, travels
          on                               opposite direction and penetrates into

 to  circumscribe the exterior atmosphere, Magnus also ascertained that
 the pressure increased           the air whilst
                                         in            diminished        the hydrogen.                   in

   It will be easily understood that the inverse experiments might be
made with equal success. The porous vase might be surrounded
with hydrogen and filled with air, when the interior pressure would
increase instead of diminish.
   Almost all the gases which I have studied furnish the same mani
festations with less energy, and it appeared to me that the pressure
always diminished with the gas which filters best, and increased with
that which is the worst to filter.    These experiments, like all those
 on the endosmose of    liquids, must be explained, as it appears to me,
by the theory proposed by M. Magnus, which makes endosmose
 depend, in the first place, on an unequal power of filtration of the
 two liquids in presence; and secondly, on a special force which sets
them in motion,-a force which may be an affinity, an electrical
action, or even a simple molecular action.—Comptes Rendus, July 28,

XLI. A        Theory          of the        Composition  of Colours on the Hypothesis
                   of   Undulations.              By Professor CHALL1s +.
     ECENT                 have added largely to the class of facts
                        experiments
       that relate to the composition of colours, but nothing, as
          I
far as am aware, has been done towards explaining the facts
by any theory of light.    The undulatory theory, if it be true,
must admit of this     application. In a communication to the
British Association, published in the Report of 1834         544),                            (p.

composition         of
                colours and the composition     small vibrations. To    of
this subject    propose

                                                       circumstances.
But experiment has proved that when the external circumstances
are the same, the sensations are not always the same          different               in
individuals.    The difference consists for the most       part     the                         in
absence       in
             some                 of

that if the parts of the eye were acted upon by the aetherial un
dulations in exactly the same manner in two individuals, the
sensations would be different.    Now the undulatory theory of
light ought to be capable of giving a reason for every positive
sensation perceived by a great number of persons, but is not
required to account for the absence of the sensation, or for a
different sensation, in a few persons; because it may be pre
sumed that these exceptional cases are due to causes unconnected
with the laws of aetherial undulations.
   In the undulatory theory of light, the formula which expresses
the physical circumstances corresponding to the sensation of a
pure colour is the following,

theory assumes that the colour-sensation produced                 simple                           by   a
series     of
          undulations   depends  only                                     on   X.
   Hence      may it    theoretically inferred that the colours
                                      be                                                                         of

pure prismatic spectrum are uncompounded.             For experiment
has  proved  that both the colour and the       angle     refraction for                     of
a given angle      incidence depend, the substance being given,

sorption.
     We owe            to   Sir David Brewster the remarkable discovery, that
a   ray   of          pure spectrum,                    on entering certain absorbing media
               do a
which        not allow                 of      its   free transmission, may give rise   rays                to
of   various colours; and                          to   Professor Stokes the additional dis

                                  on the Hypothesis       of Undulations.                            331
covery, that this effect is produced even by rays more refrangible
than those of the visible spectrum.   This property, without dimi
mishing the intensity of the colours which are freely transmitted,
causes a peculiar dispersion to take place at the surface of the
medium, and from points contiguous to the surface, the quality
and quantity of which may be modified by the thickness of the
absorbing substance.     Do these facts, it may be asked, prove
that a ray of definite refrangibility is composed of rays of differ
ent colours? A good theory of light ought to give an answer to
this question.   Not being able to form the slightest conception
how a theory of light which makes the vibrations of individual
atoms of the aether the exponents of visible properties of light
can be  brought to bear on this point, I venture to state that the
question may be answered if the undulatory theory be based on
hydrodynamical        principles.     In the pages of this Journal                                     I
proved long since, by general hydrodynamical equations, that
the function which, as stated above, expresses the properties of
an uncompounded ray, is not arbitrary, nor due to the mode of
disturbance, but arises out of relations of a compressible fluid to
time and space, which are shown by the analysis to be indepen
dent of particular disturbances.          Consequently any disturbance
proper for producing light will in general give rise to rays of all
refrangibilities.     When a ray of the spectrum enters an absorb
ing medium whose atomic arrangement does not allow of                                                 its
transmission, the ray-undulations must                  broken up, and the
                                                                     of be

aether suffers disturbance           the action        the atoms        rest               at         on
the undulations,         really    as
                                    when atoms                         by
                                                        their motion disturb
the aether      rest.    According
                            at           this view, the generation
                                                     to                    new                  of
light          absorbing medium does not prove that the intromitted
                   in   an
ray was compounded, since there                   resolution
                                                          is    nothe original       of
ray, but      new disturbance.

At             will leave out of consideration the term contain
        present we
ing u. The other term taken by itself shows that the axis of a
will be cut by the curve at a series of points separated by the
common interval                 L, which is
                              an harmonic mean between X and
M, and at another series of points separated by the common
interval l. As the ratio of the greatest and least values of X for
light is nearly that of 3 to 2, l will be at least equal to 5L.
 Hence the second series of recurrences will always be slower than
the first; and in case A' be not much larger than X, they will be
much slower.     The following considerations will show that in
this case this second trigonometrical factor will have little or no
sensible effect on the quality of the compound light. It is known
from experiment, that if a stream of light be interrupted at short
intervals by breaks, the sensation of light is still continuous.
Suppose, therefore, the parts of the curve contiguous to those
points of           its
              intersection with the axis                    of

  and if a be considerable, the whiteness may overcome the sensa
  tion of colour. Also it is evident, that, to produce the interme
  diate colour, the quantities of the two colours must be mixed in
  certain proportions.      The effect of an excess of one of the colours
  will be to alter the tint; but as the change of tint must be con
  tinuous, the only change that can occur is an approach of the
  compound colour to that of the rays which are in excess. Speak
  ing theoretically, the intermediate colour is most perfectly pro
  duced when the number of rays of each kind is the same, and
  when m=m' for each pair of rays.
       (5) The following passage occurs in Sir John Herschel's
  Treatise on Light (art. 516):—“Blue and yellow combined
  produce green. The green thus arising is vivid and rich; and,
  when proper proportions of the elementary colours are used, no
  way to be distinguished from the prismatic green.        Nothing can
  be more striking, and even surprising, than the effect of mixing
  together a blue and yellow powder, or of covering a paper with
  blue and yellow limes drawn close together and alternating with
  each other. The elementary tints totally disappear, and cannot
  even be recalled by the imagination.       One of the most marked
  facts in favour of the existence of three primary colours, and of
  the possibility of an analysis of white light distinct from that of
º the prism, is to see the prismatic green thus completely imitated
  by a mixture of adjacent rays totally distinct from it both in
  refrangibility and colour.”     According to this statement, a mix
  ture of blue and yellow powders has the same effect as a mixture
  of blue and yellow light; for in the second mode of making the
  experiment, it is clear that the eye receives a mixture of blue and
  yellow rays.    I have made this experiment in another manner,
  by placing one upon the other two pieces of blue and yellow rib
  bon, and holding them up to the light.        The resulting green is
  very decided, and is plainly due to a mixture of lights., M.
  Helmholtz has established by his experiments, that the mixing
  of coloured substances produces effects different from those of
  mixing prismatic colours, and in particular that prismatic blue
  and yellow do not produce green, or only a greenish-white. The
  existence of green, in however small a degree, is a phaenomenon
  which the theory ought to account for, and which in fact it does
  account for in the manner explained in art. (4). Why the green
  is so much less conspicuous than the white will be shortly con
  sidered.    At present it is important to remark, that the experi
  ment above adduced proves that blue and yellow light may pro
  duce a vivid green.      Consequently it must be concluded that a
   difference of some kind distinct from tint exists between the blue
   and yellow of that experiment, and prismatic blue and yellow.

  Now the theory am proposing involves a mathematical condition

                            on the Hypothesis          of Undulations.                           335
which points to such a difference.              It is possible that, in the
prismatic colours, the condition m=m' may be less exactly ful
filled than in the colours of substances.            A probable reason may
be given for such a circumstance.             Sunlight is generated within
the sun’s atmosphere at a great depth below the exterior bound
ary, and the ray-undulations have consequently to traverse a
medium which may absorb them in different degrees according
to the value of X.             The absorption might stifle particular
rays, and change the value of m for others; and if one colour,
as yellow, were transmitted more readily than the rest, the
value of m for this colour would be larger than for the others,
supposing that originally m was the same for all. Thus the
excess of brightness in the yellow part of the spectrum may be
owing, not only to a greater number of yellow rays, but also
to greater intrinsic brightness of each yellow ray. Now the
coloured light of substances, though derived from sunlight, is yet
new light, because it is produced at their surfaces, or within a
 small depth below their surfaces, by disturbances of the solar
undulations similar to those already described with reference to
absorption, which                 is,

differing only       degree. This terrestrial light, not having passed

through        large extent
                a                 atmosphere, may satisfy the condition

theory,   must adopt his method.
          I
   Pambour determines the pressure existing        the cylinder                     in                                    at

                disconnexion    means     the relation,by
                                                        established     of

               Theory   of Heat   to the Steam-engine.                    341
by him, between volume and pressure; assuming at the same
time that the quantity of steam which passes from the boiler
into the cylinder in a unit of time, and therefore the quantity
which passes during a stroke of the piston, is known from special
observations.    As before, we will represent by M the whole mass
which enters the cylinder during a stroke, and by m the vaporous
part of the same.     As this mass, of which Pambour only con
siders the  vaporous part,  fills the space ev'at the moment of dis
connexion, we have, according to (29), the equation
-
                             eve    tºB
                                    b-Hp.’
where p, represents the pressure at the same moment.                     From
this equation we deduce
                             p3 =   ++-b.         .   .   .     .    .   (30)
   Multiplying this magnitude by (e–e)v', the space described
by the surface of the piston up to the same moment, we obtain
the following expression for the first part of the work:-
                     W=m.B.:-w(e–).                             .    .   (31)
   The law according to which the pressure changes during the
expansion which now follows, is also given by equation (29). If
at any moment v represents the variable volume, and p the cor
responding pressure, then
                                    m. B — b.
                               T      v
This expression must be substituted in the integral
                               fpdv,
and the integration effected between the limits       v-ev' and v=v';
whence, as second part of the work, we obtain
                     wº-mb          log}-vu-ºº.           .
                                                                .    .   (32)
    In order to determine the negative work done by the reacting
pressure   during the descent of the piston, this reaction must
itself be known. Without at present inquiring into the relation
which exists between the reaction and the pressure in the con
denser, we will represent the mean reaction by            po,   so
                                                         that the
work done    byit will  beexpressed       by

    where pi and po respectively represent the pressures in the boiler
    and condenser.    This expression, it is true, is not quite correct
    for our  present case,  because by po we do not understand the
    pressure in the condenser itself, but in the parts of the cylinder
    in communication with the condenser.          Nevertheless we will
    retain the expression  in    present form,    its

that the machine goes so slowly, or that the influx canal is so
wide, that the same pressure p, exists in the cylinder as in the
boiler. This case therefore gives the maximum of work.          If
with equal influx of vapour the velocity of motion is greater, or
with equal velocity of motion the influx of vapour is smaller, we
obtain from the same quantity of vapour a less quantity of work.

series of processes according to the mechanical theory of heat, it
will be best to submit one of the same, which requires especial                                               in
vestigation, to a separate treatment in order at once to establish
the results which have reference thereto.   I refer to the entrance
of vapour   into the vicious space and into the cylinder, when it has
 there to overcome a smaller pressure than that with which it was
forced out of the boiler.    In this investigation can proceed ac                   I

    The vapour from the boiler first enters the vicious space, here
 compresses the vapour of small density which still remains from
 the former stroke, fills up the space thus becoming free, and
 then presses against the piston, which, in consequence of                                                     its
 assumed comparatively small charge, recedes         quickly that the          so

    350           Prof. Clausius on the Application of the Mechanical
    work occasioned by incomplete expansion. To do so it would
    only be necessary to calculate the uncompensated transformation
    produced in the passage of the vapour from the cylinder to the
    condenser, and to include the same in N.    By this calculation,
    which need not here be executed, we obtain precisely the expres
    sion for the work which is given in (XIV).
       40. In order next to be able to apply the equations (XIV) to
    a numerical calculation, it will be necessary first to determine
    the magnitudes p'i, p'o, and p"o more precisely.
       With respect to the manner in which the pressure in the
    cylinder varies during the entrance of the steam, no general law
    can be instituted, because the entrance canal is opened and closed
    in such a variety of ways in different machines.        Hence no defi
    mite universal value can be found for the relation between the
    mean pressure p'i, and the final pressure p, as long as the latter
    is strictly interpreted. Nevertheless this will be possible if the
    signification of p2 be slightly changed.
       The cylinder and boiler cannot of course be instantaneously
    disconnected; more or less time is always required to move the
    necessary valves or slides, and during this interval the vapour in
    the cylinder expands a little, because, the orifice being diminished,
    the steam which enters is less than that which corresponds to
    the velocity of the piston.      In general, therefore, we may assume
    that at the end of this time the pressure is already somewhat
    smaller than the mean pressure p'i.
       But        if,

   In this case an exact determination of the difference is essen

352.      Prof. Clausius on                 the    Application            of the Mechanical
   42.  In these equations it is assumed that—besides the masses
M,  mi, a, and uo, of which the first two must be known from
direct observation, and the last two may be approximately deter
mined from the magnitude of the vicious space,—the four pres
sures, pi, p.2, ps, and po, or what amounts to the same, the four
temperatures T1, T2, Ts, and To, are given. In practice, however,
this condition is only partially fulfilled, so that in calculation we
must have recourse to other data.
   Of the four pressures, only two, pi and po, can be assumed as
known. The first is given immediately by the manometer on
the boiler, and the second may at least be approximately deduced
from the indications of the manometer attached to the condenser.
The two others, p, and ps, are not given; but in their place we
know the dimensions of the cylinder, and at what position of the
piston the cylinder is cut off from the boiler.          From these we
may deduce the volumes occupied by the steam at the moment
of disconnexion and at the end of the expansion, and these two
volumes will then serve as data in place of the pressures p, and ps.
   We must now bring the equations into such a form that the
calculation may be made by means of these data.
   43. Let      v',  the explanation

           Similarly, by means of the last of these equations, we may
        eliminate the mass po; and as to the other mass u, although it
        may be a little greater than pio, yet the terms which contain it
        as factor are altogether so unimportant, that we may without
        hesitation give it the same value as we have found for uo; in
        other words, for the numerical calculation we may give up the
        assumption, made for the sake of generality, that the mass in
        the vicious space is partially liquid and partially vaporous, and
        suppose that the mass in question consists entirely of vapour.
           The substitutions here mentioned may be made in the general
        equations (XIV), as well as in the simplified equations (XV).
        As they present no difficulties, however, we will here limit our
        selves to the last, in order to obtain the equations in a form con
        venient for numerical calculation.

XLIV.       On the Action of Nitric Acid on Alcohol at common Tem
                   peratures. By Dr. H. DEBUs”.
       ITROUS      aether is decomposed, according to Berzelius, by
          contact with water, lime-water, or a solution of sulphate
of  iron,  into saccharic or malic acid, nitric oxide, and other sub
stances.      Although the observation on which this assertion is
founded was made-fifty years ago, no contradiction of it seems
to have become public, as it is still repeated in some of the latest
handbooks on organic chemistry. The formation of saccharic
acid from the radical aethyle appeared to me interesting enough
to deserve a more minute examination, in order to determine the
conditions on which it depends.         I  repeated carefully the expe
riments of Berzelius with pure hyponitrite of oxide of aethyle,
water, and lime-water.       In employing the latter, large quantities
of nitrite of lime and traces of formiate of lime were produced.
Pure water caused a great evolution of nitric oxide.          After the
decomposition was completed, the water contained nitric acid
and very small quantities of an organic acid, which gave the
reactions of formic acid. Similar results were obtained with sul
 phate of iron and nitrous aether. In no case was malic or sac
 charic, or any other organic acid except formic or oxalic acid,
 produced.
     These facts are fully explained if it is assumed that nitrous
 aether is decomposed into alcohol and nitrous acid; the latter
 would form, according to circumstances, either nitrite of lime,
 or be converted into nitric oxide and nitric acid. A portion of the
 alcohol is oxidized to formic and oxalic acids.
     The acid mother-liquor from which, according to Black's
 method, the hyponitrite of oxide of aethyle separates, is said
 to contain large quantities of saccharic acid. The examination
 of this liquid did not confirm this assertion, but led to other not
 less interesting results.
     In order to obtain this liquid the following method was em
 ployed:—A narrow and tall bottle, of about 700 cubic centims.
 capacity, was charged with 220 grims. alcohol of 0-863 sp. gr. at
  60°F., and put in a place where it could remain undisturbed during
 the period the experiment was going on. By means of a tube which
 had been drawn out to a narrow point at one end, 100 grms. of
  water were permitted to collect slowly under the alcohol, and 200
  grms. of red fuming mitric acid under the water, in such a way
  that alcohol, water, and acid formed three distinct layers.       The
  mouth of the bottle was them provided with a perforated cork,
  holding a bent glass tube, the other end of which dipped into a

constant at 20°C. The nitric acid from one side and the alcohol
from the other mix slowly with the water and meet each other.

and partly oxidized.     An evolution of gas is observed, weak at
the beginning, but strong at the end of the process.          After the

160° or 170° C. without undergoing any alteration in weight.
They become yellow at 180°C., lose water and carbonic acid,
whilst oxalate and glycolate of lime and a resinous substance
remain. Exposed to a higher temperature on a piece of platinum
foil, the smell of burning sugar is emitted, and carbonate of lime
formed. One part dissolves in 177 parts of water at 8°C. The

solution may be boiled without producing any decomposition of
the glyoxylate of lime; it is precipitated by alcohol, and shows
the            behaviour with reagents: nitrate of silver or baryta
and chloride of copper do not produce a precipitate; acetate of
lead throws down a white crystalline salt, which easily dissolves
in acetic acid; lime-water acts in a similar manner. The pre

                                                               forms a
white  crystalline  powder,  more  easily soluble in hot than in cold
water.    The warm saturated solution solidifies on cooling, form
ing a mass like gelatine, which after a few days’ standing becomes
crystalline.                                           -
   Nitrate of  silver, chloride of copper,  acetate of lead, and lime

are therefore equal to each other; the angles
DAE and CAE are also equal to two right                                                                         U
angles; therefore the four angles at A are
right angles.     In the triangles BAC and
BAD, two sides of the one (BA and AC) are                 w
equal to two sides of the other (BA and AD),             K.
and the included angles are equal; hence BC is equal to BD, and
the angles ABC and ACB are equal to ABD and ADB. In the
same way the sides DE and EC can be shown to be equal to
each other and to DB and BC; and the angles in each triangle
to be respectively equal.   Hence (from the definition of a square)
these four angles are right angles; and ABC and ACB are half
right angles. Therefore the right-angled isosceles triangle ABC
contains two right angles.

       Prof. Stevelly on the Doctrine of Parallel Lines.           375
  It was in the attempt to establish this theorem that M,          Le
gendre deviated from the method of Euclid by employing the
doctrine of limits.     Setting out from this theorem, the demon
strations of the various properties of parallels are simple and
obvious. To give these final propositions would be only to repeat
what M. Legendre has done; for to that distinguished geometer
must belong the merit of having shown that the whole question
depended upon a proof of the 32nd proposition.            His proof of
that  proposition  is inadmissible;  but his subsequent demonstra
tions are in accordance with the principles of plane geometry.
   Although the proof just given of this theorem will probably
be acknowledged to be consistent both with the definitions and
with the method of Euclid, nevertheless          I cannot regard it as
the most   satisfactory  solution of the   difficulty.  It may be      in
teresting as the first successful attempt of the class to which it
belongs. But the real solution            I
                                      still believe to consist in treat
ing the conception of parallel lines, as we treat any other geo
metrical conception, with a clear and unequivocal definition.

            XLVI.         On the Doctrine of Parallel Lines.
                           By Professor STEvelLY.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                               Holywood, Oct. 13, 1856.
Fo:       the personally kind terms in which Mr. Hennessy has
       stated his objections to the method of treating the doctrine
                             I
of parallel lines which lately communicated to you, beg to ex  I
press my acknowledgements.            I
                                     also feel much gratified that he
does not   profess to have detected any defect in the chain of rea
soning on which the proofs are founded.
   I trust, however, Mr. Hennessy will not consider me deficient
in courtesy   when    I
                      add, that regard for scientific truth compels
me to  say,  that there is scarcely an assertion which he has made
in that paper, or in the one to which he refers in (the fifth not)
the third volume of the present series of this Journal, in which        I
Can COIn Cur.                                                      -
   Since a detailed examination of the defective logic and incor
rect statements contained in those papers would far exceed any
reasonable limits, and since an examination of even two or three
of the most obvious would wear too much the appearance of con
troversy, and seem to invest the entire subject with a very undue
share of importance, I shall simply select one as an example,
because of      its
               close connexion with the subject     my communi
                                                       of

        376              Prof. Stevelly on the Doctrine of Parallel Lines.
        cation, and because it affords a fair specimen of the defective
        logic and incorrect reasoning which pervade the whole.
           To sustain his position, that the method of limits resorted to
        by me, if allowable, was unnecessary, Mr. Hennessy asserts that
        he has shown in the third (fifth 7) volume of the present series
        of this Journal, that the entire doctrine of parallel lines may be
        derived from the following definition:—“Parallel lines are such,
        that if they meet a third line, the two interior angles on the
        same side will be (together) equal to two right angles.”
           Now it is quite certain that this definition, as such, does not
        give a solid foundation for the doctrine of parallel lines, neither
        does it warrant the deductions derived from it in the paper
    t
        referred         to.
                       Let      examine  even partially.

378                      Mr.   J.   N. Hearder              on a      powerful Form
of investigations with my instrument    I had occasion to relay the
secondary    wire, and in doing so                           I
                                     only put on five-sixths of the
original quantity, but                I
                           have had the satisfaction to find the sta
tical power of the machine nearly doubled. I exhibited this new
arrangement at the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Institution on
the 17th of September last, and was honoured by the Society's
first silver medal.   The main object of the present paper is to
detail some of the results of my investigations with it on the
character of the induced current, as  have discovered some facts      I
which, as far as I know, are quite new, and which seem to deve
lope   a new law of electrical action.
    2. Hitherto, I believe, the only thermal effects observed in
 metallic conductors by the action of the induced current of the
induction coil, have been the incandescence of the end of the
negative terminal, which, when made of very fine wire, melts and
burns, and the partial combustion of portions of metallic filings
when the spark passes between them as they                   strewed upon                 lie                          a
non-conducting surface,                                               the sparkby                      of

varying with the nature           the metal used. Whilst the spark                                                    in

between the terminals will inflame gunpowder, yet the discharge

with frictional electricity.
   3.  Ihad often felt that    any definite thermal results could

be obtained from the action     the Leyden jar     of

                        of the      Induction Coil.                                379
racter of frictional and voltaic electricity, and I believe that                     I
have now succeeded in indicating a path through which this
important object may be obtained.         In order to examine the
thermal effects of the  Leyden   jar,     I
                                       had recourse to a modifica
tion of Sir W. Snow Harris’s thermo-electrometer, which I intro
duced about twenty-six years since, in order to adapt the instru
ment for voltaic as well as frictional electricity, and for which,
in 1844, I received the first bronze medal of the Devonport and
Stonehouse Polytechnic Exhibition.
    4. My apparatus differs from that of Sir W. Snow Harris only
in the construction and arrangement of the air-vessel which
contains the wire.     In Sir W. Snow Harris's instrument (Phil.
 Mag. No. 73. May 1856, p. 343, fig. 5), the wire passes hori
zontally and diametrically through a glass globe, having external
brass caps on the ends of the wire for the purpose of making
 connexions.     The air-chamber which              I
                                              employ is a cylinder
 about 3% inches diameter, with two necks like a small electrical
cylinder placed vertically. The necks are capped with brass; the
 lower one screws upon the reservoir of the bent indicating tube,
 and the upper one is furnished with a stuffing-box, through
 which passes vertically a sliding wire surmounted with a binding
 screw, and formed at the lower and inner extremity into a for
 ceps.   The test wire hangs vertically in the axis of the cylinder,
 the  upper  end being attached to the sliding forceps, whilst from
 the lower end hangs a short detached forceps, the tail of which
 can be lowered into a brass cup containing mercury.       This cup
 is in connexion with the brass screw of the reservoir  upon  which
 the cylinder is screwed, and to which is also attached a second
 binding screw for completing the circuit. There is also an ad
justing valve in the cap of the reservoir. The advantages of this
arrangement are, that it affords the greatest facility for changing

Leyden jar, when charged            by
                                   the induced current, possessed the
same character    as that obtained from the charge                of    an

380             Mr.   J.   N. Hearder   on a   powerful Form
through an interval of 0-5 of an inch, the jar was really as fully
charged as when charged in the ordinary way.      I therefore                   in
stituted a set of experiments which have developed some curious
and interesting results, and which, as far as               I
                                                know at present,
are quite new.
   6. I introduced between the secondary terminals of the coil a
thermo-electrometer  in connexion with a Lane's discharger, but
although I varied the length of the sparks from 0 to 1 inch, no
heating effect was produced upon the wire in the instrument.
   7. I connected the coatings of an insulated Leyden jar, con
taining about 33 square feet of surface, respectively with the two
terminals of the coil, and completed the circuit of the jar by a
thermo-electrometer    in connexion with a graduated Lane's dis
charger. On causing a rapid series of discharges to pass, the
fluid instantly rose in the stem and remained fixed pretty perma
nently at nearly 100 degrees, or about one hundred times higher
than it would have risen with a single discharge from the same
jar with the ordinary electrical machine.    The platina wire hang
ing in the cylinder of the electrometer was thrown into the most
energetic vibration during the passage of the sparks, so as to
become crippled in several places.
   8. The thermo-electrometer was removed, and a piece of very
fine iron wire, about 4 inches long, placed between insulated for
ceps, was substituted for it in the circuit.    On passing the dis
charges, the wire became blue, vibrated rapidly, and crippled in
several places; and whilst occasionally suspending and repro
ducing the action of the coil, the wire suddenly melted at one of
the crippled places.
   9. Another piece of the same wire, about 3 inches in length,
was next introduced, and on passing the discharges it instantly
became red-hot through nearly           its
                                     whole length and fused into
globules. The experiment was repeated with shorter pieces with
nearly the same results, the wire sometimes fusing throughout
its whole length, and sometimes breaking into fragments par
tially burnt.
   10. The foregoing remarkable change              it in
                                               the thermal character
of the current when intercepted and,           as
                                              were, measured out                by
the jar, induced the following experiment:-The thermo-electro
meter was introduced into the circuit     the jar
                                               of               as
                                                     before, and two
other thermo-electrometers were introduced into the portions                    of
the circuit leading from the terminals          of
                                            the coil    the coatings to
of the jar.   By this arrangement, the current which charged the
jar had   topass through these electrometers        course.  On
                                                            in       its
setting the machine     action, the electrometer which completed
                           in
the circuit   the jar indicated the same thermal effect upon the
               of
included wire, whilst the other two electrometers were not     the         in
slightest degree affected, clearly showing      marked difference
                                                        a

                         of the Induction Coil.                   381
 in the velocity    of the current under the two different con
 ditions.
    11. In the foregoing experiments, the discharging electrometer
 was fitted with platina points, between which discharges can be
 obtained of a greater length than between balls; but in order to
 place the experiment under conditions which would admit of
 better comparison with the effects of the ordinary electrical
            I
 machine, substituted balls for points in the discharger. On
 placing them at such a distance from each other as to allow the
 discharges to pass, the fluid instantly rose to a definite height in
the tube, nearly 100 degrees; and whilst thus permanent, the
balls of the discharger were gradually approximated to each other,
with no diminution of effect, until they were in absolute contact,
 when, the circuit being closed and the jar no longer capable of
receiving a charge, the fluid instantly fell nearly to zero, the
residual amount of expansion being due to the heat absorbed by
the glass surface, &c. during the continuation of the experiment.
On the slightest separation of the balls from each other the fluid
rose to 100 degrees, and remained tolerably permanent until
they were separated beyond the striking interval, when the fluid
again fell as soon as the discharges ceased.
    12. The balls were next placed rather within the greatest
striking distance; and instead of allowing the spring to vibrate
and produce the ordinary rapid succession of discharges,       I held
it in my hand and broke contact at successive single slow inter
vals, in order to ascertain the value of a single discharge; this
I  found to be only 1 degree on the scale of the instrument. On
making an interruption of the circuit, the action of the fluid was
precisely of the same character as if the jar had been charged by
the electrical machine, that is to say, the fluid rose with a sudden
impulse and instantly subsided. On repeating the interruptions
at rather quicker intervals, so as to make each successive inter
ruption before the effect of the preceding one had quite subsided,
the fluid was made to rise 1 degree in succession for each dis
charge, so that 1, 2, 3, and so on to 12 discharges, just raised
the fluid correspondingly to 1, 2, 3, to 12 degrees. There was
some little difficulty in manipulating in this way, as the discharge
did not always take place at each interruption in the circuit,
owing to variations in the character of the metallic contact at
the interruptor, arising from the oxidation of the platina surfaces;
but as far as they went they were sufficient to show that the extra
ordinary result first noticed was due to a rapid succession of
units of effect gradually accumulating in the transmitting wire.
    13. Having thus established a means of comparing the effects
of the coil with those of the ordinary electrical machine, and
having ascertained the value of a unit of discharge under the
influence of the induction coil, it next became necessary to com

382               Mr.         J.   N. Hearder    on a   powerful Form
pare this with a similar unit when charged by the electrical
                                   I
machine; and this found, with the striking distance which I
had employed, as nearly the same as so small an indication on
the scale as 1 degree would enable me to judge. On increasing
or diminishing the striking distance of the balls when using the
electrical machine, the fluid indicated the action of the well
established law, that the effect is in proportion to the square of
the striking distance, the charged surface being constant.     No
such law as this was however observable with the induced cur
rent; for, on the contrary, it was ascertained by subsequent ex
periments that the effect on the wire was diminished when the
striking distance was prolonged beyond a certain limit, a fact at
variance with hitherto-recognized laws of electrical action.
   As the foregoing experiments were performed with a large
jar, which required that the induction coil should be very in
tensely excited, thereby rendering                   its
                                         action less permanent,
subsequently employed smaller jars, and found the same class                                     of I
results    accompany their action, but with others which the
            to
conditions    the first experiments had not enabled me
                 of                                       discover.                    to
   14. Having satisfied myself that the nature       the charge             of                   in
the jar was the       with the induction coil
                      same                       with the machine,     as
I   next proceeded             to
                      examine the effect      varying         of
                                                       the extent                                 of

                                           to                                                    a

discharges when the jar is connected only disperse it without
inflammation.     Hence it would appear that there is a difference
in the velocity with which the wave or current is transmitted;

been able to convince myself.     This atmospheric wire was about
400 feet in length,  suspended  between the top of my own house
and the turret of a distant  chapel,  and insulated at the two ex
tremities by silk strings which were under cover.          A second
insulated wire proceeded from the first into my laboratory, and
was there in connexion with a battery of three Leyden jars,
containing together about 10 square feet of surface; these
were connected with a discharging electrometer, terminated by
balls, and which was capable of being adjusted by silk strings
 and cranks, carried like bell-wires to a place of safety.   During
the continuance of a thunder-storm, I have frequently noticed
the extraordinary inductive action produced upon the wire at the
instant of a flash of lightning, though at a distance of two, and
even three miles, as evidenced by the number of seconds elapsing
before hearing the thunder. This action was frequently so great
as to cause an instantaneous torrent of discharges from this
battery, over an interval of three-tenths of an inch, of precisely
the same character as those produced by the induction coil, but
very much louder. Never having employed any test of the
quantity thus discharged, I could scarcely imagine that the jars
were really charged and discharged at so rapid a rate from so
small a wire; but the experiments with the coil now perfectly
satisfy me as to the identity of the character of these atmospheric
discharges, and            I
                    merely allude to them as the only ones ap
proximating in effect to those developed by the induction coil
          I
that have ever witnessed.

THE      “A Description of a new Sphygmoscope, an Instrument for
indicating the Movements of the Heart and Blood-vessels;          with an
Account of Observations obtained by the aid of that Instrument.” By
 S. Scott Alison, M.D.
     The sphygmoscope (fig. 1) consists of a small chamber containing
 spirits of wine or other liquid, provided with a thin india-rubber
 wall, where it is to be applied to the chest.     At the opposite extre
 mity the chamber communicates with a glass tube, which rises to some
 height above the level of the chamber.        Liquid is supplied to the
 instrument until it stands in the tube a little above the level of the
  chamber.      The pressure of the column of liquid in the tube acts
 upon the elastic or yielding wall of india-rubber and causes it to pro
  trude. This protruding part or chest-piece is very readily affected
  by external impulse; it yields to the slightest touch, and being
  pushed inwards, causes a displacement of the liquid in the non-elastic
  chamber, and forces a portion of liquid up the fube.   The protruding
  wall of india-rubber is driven inwards when it is brought in contact
   with that portion of the chest which is struck by the apex of the
  heart, and a rise in the tube takes place. When the heart retires,

forced in by the       apex of the heart is denoted by a corresponding
rise in the tube,     and the amount of protrusion of the india-rubber
wall which takes      place when the heart retires is denoted by a corre
sponding fall in      the tube.       The tube is supplied with a graduated
scale to denote the rise and fall with exactitude.               The glass tube is
provided at the top with some contrivance, such as a brass screw
and collar, to prevent the egress of the liquid when the instrument
is not in use, or a bulb with an orifice may be supplied. When
employed, the glass tube is left open to permit of the passage of                                                             the

excited heart, it is sensibly acted on at the scapular and infra-dorsal
regions.
     By    means                      the observer can ascertain the fre
                          of this instrument
quency         of the     beats      of the heart, but
                                           as this can be effected in most
cases with accuracy at the radial artery, no particular advantage is
gained from it in respect to this point.
   The duration of the impulse of the heart upon the chest is well
measured by this instrument: the time occupied by the rise, is the
time occupied by the impulse.         A slow rise after a rapid rise shows
a slow beat after a rapid one, and vice versá, a slow fall after an
ordinary fall, shows a slow retirement after an ordinary one. An
intermittent pulse is marked by an imperfect rise, followed by an
ordinary fall, and then by a long rise. The rise is sometimes slower
than the fall, which is occasionally found to be abrupt.              This is
observed when the heart, by reason of           great size, and       its
                                                                   the some                             of

normally sized heart affects more exclusively when it is placed upon
the fifth intercostal space.
   The sphygmoscope indicates with exactitude both the absolute and
the comparative influence upon the heart, of food, cordials, stimu
lants, and tonic medicines.          It does the same in respect to depress.
ing causes, such as hunger, cold, and sedatives.
    With the aid of this instrument the fact is demonstrated, that
the action of the heart may be great when the pulse is small,—
that the heart may strike the instrument with force when the
pulse scarcely affects the liquid of the hand-sphygmoscope.                     It
affords a remarkable proof that the pulse is one thing and the heart's
action another, and teaches that the pulse is only an approximate
sign of the state of the heart.          It is found also, that while cold at
the surface and extremities          may   depress the pulse, the heart may
remain little enfeebled, or even become excited, and that warmth
and friction applied to the extremities may cause an excited pulse
without there being any accompanying increased force of the heart.
    The influence of respiration upon the action of the heart is mani
fested, in some degree, by the instrument placed over the region of
the heart.             If
                    the breath be stopped after an ordinary expiration,
the movement of the liquid is seen to be increased.                  a very long          If
and forcible     inspiration   be made and the breath then suspended,
the movement is somewhat reduced; but when the respiration Fig. 2.
is again allowed to take                a its
                                  normal course, the movement                                   is
seen   to be increased for       short time.

The rise in the instrument is greater in liquid than in aériform
tumours on account of the compressibility of air, and the fall is more
rapid and decided when the contents of the tumour are liquid.
    For the most part, the hand-sphygmoscope is best applied simply
with the aid of the fingers.  It is delicately held between the tips of
the thumb, fore- and middle-fingers, the nails resting on the examinee.
The elastic wall is on no account to be pressed down with a dead
weight upon the vessel.  It is to be micely lowered to the level of the
artery when collapsed.   When the artery rises, it will strike the
elastic wall, and as the chamber is fixed by the fingers, the entire
blow is communicated to the liquid and it rises in the tube.              During
the retirement or collapse of the artery, the elastic wall resumes                                                   its
level condition and draws the liquid down the tube. This motion

annealing on zinc wire, making it brittle and crystalline, which might
give a different condition, as the “annealed” in Magnus's experi
ment, and the “unhammered” in the experiment now adduced.
Setting aside this case, the author concludes that generally the effect
of permanent lateral compression is the same as that of permanent
longitudinal extension, or of hardening by wire-drawing, upon the
thermo-electric quality of a wire placed longitudinally in an electric
circuit; that in iron it is a deviation from the constrained metal
towards bismuth, and that in all the other metals mentioned it is a
deviation towards antimony; and that in copper and iron it is the
reverse of the effect experienced by the same metal while under the
stress that caused the strain.      Since no kind of strain, except uni
form condensation or dilatation in all directions, is free from the
directional attribute, it appeared probable to the author that the
thermo-electric effects remaining in a metal left with a longitudinal
 strain, retained after the stress that caused it is removed, must be
 different in different directions.   He therefore experimented on iron
hardened by longitudinal compression, and found that it deviates
 from soft iron towards antimony, or in the contrary way to iron
 hardened by longitudinal traction.       From this, and from the results
 quoted above, it follows that in iron hardened by compression in one
 direction, the thermo-electric qualities in this direction differ from
those in lines perpendicular to                 it,

  4. In this part of the communication, attempts made by the author
to find the effects of various influences on electric conductivities of
metals are described.        One of these, with a very unsatisfactory
method for testing resistances, led to the conclusion that longitudinal
magnetization diminishes the conducting quality of iron wire.                The
general plan for testing resistances, which he subsequently adopted
as the best he could find, and which has proved very satisfactory, is
next explained ; and as an illustration, a single experiment on the
relative effect of an equal longitudinal extension on the resistances of
iron and copper wires is described. The conclusion established by
this experiment                 is,

regard to elasticity of gases, the weight of any single particle is so
small as not to affect the result.        The question remains, whether
we know     anything   of the masses of different particles relatively to
this  repulsive  force. To determine their masses we have these data.
In several different gases equivalent volumes under the same pressure
occupy the same space, that is (assuming the Daltonian theory, that
 equivalent volumes contain the same number of particles), that each
 particle of the two different gases exerts an equal pressure on the
 adjacent particles: and hence with reference to this law, the mass
 of a single particle in each of these two different gases is the same,
 and therefore the “vis viva” of equivalent weight or volumes subject
 to the same motion is the same for both ; that             the quantity                   is,                        of

    From the foregoing arguments and facts, it was urged that mo
 tions and forces, which certainly exist in cases of combustion, would
 produce phaenomena exactly similar to those of heat, and therefore
 that part of the phaenomena usually attributed to heat are due to
 this motion; and if part of them, probably the whole.    And further,
 that if the phaenomena  of radiation of heat are   explained by this
 motion of the particles of matter,  light is simply radiated heat of
 considerable intensity; and that imponderable substances, whether
 under the names of aether, caloric, or phlogiston, are equally ima

   Also, a paper was read by Mr. Maxwell on the Elementary Theory
 of Optical Instruments.
   The object of this communication was to show how the magnitude
  and position of the image of any object seen through an optical                                       in
  strument could be ascertained without knowing the construction of
  the instrument, by means of data derived from two experiments on
  the instrument.        Optical questions are generally treated of with
  respect to the pencils of rays which pass through the instrument.
  A pencil is a collection of rays which have passed through one point,
  and may again do so, by some optical contrivance.                  Now if we sup

they give off, the ear recognizes a distinct tone conformable with that
of the vibrating plate.
   At the same time that it regulates the sparks, this new inter
ruptor, when applied to the ordinary machines in use, is capable of in
creasing their power to a certain extent. It generally acts so as to
render the effects proportionate to the intensities of the current dis
tributed, whence it follows that it is particularly in the employment
of strong currents that it presents a marked advantage over the
                                                                         -

terruptors with solid points of contact.
    It is even imprudent with a single machine of ordinary dimen
sions, to attempt to force the intensity of the inducing current
beyond a certain limit, for this will infallibly cause the induced
coil to burst internally.          But by combining several machines, the
sum of the tensions being divided between the various elements of
this kind of battery, we may direct upon the whole the action of a
number of couples proportional to that of the machines, which                                                          in
creases in the same proportion the distance passed over by the spark
between the two extremities of the induced series. This system of
combination applies without difficulty to the excellent machines con
structed by M. Ruhmkorff, provided they are only combined in pairs.
   The hammers are suppressed and replaced by permanent conduct
ors, the two inducing wires are united one after the other, and the
interruptor, accompanied by the condenser of the extra-current, is
introduced into the circuit. By this precaution each machine must
retain      its
              discharge wires              normal distance; both also retain
                                                at   a

oN A zEoLITIC        MINERAL (ALLIED To STILBITE) FROM THE IsLE
           of SKYE,       SCOTLAND.             BY J. W. MALLET, PH.D.
   The specimen to which the following description refers has been
in my possession for several years, and has attached to it a lable
bearing the name “Hypostilbite;” but analysis shows it to be a
mineral quite distinct from Beudant's hypostilbite of the Faroe
Islands, and differing also from both stilbite proper and epistilbite.
   It occurs as a mass of minute crystals, resembling white loaf
sugar, breaking easily, and crushing under the fingers into a coarsish
crystalline powder.          The separate grains, viewed under the micro
scope, appear as single prismatic crystals, or little groups of three or
four, nearly transparent, colourless, and with a pearlylustre, especially
on two opposite faces, closely resembling stilbite in fact in general
appearance.
   The crystalline form could not be satisfactorily made out, but
seemed to be monoclinic.                 Hardness a little greater than that of
calcite.   Specific gravity =2°252.
   Strong muriatic acid poured over the pulverized mineral at night
had the next morning formed a distinct jelly.
   On analysis the following results were obtained:—
                                                                    Atoms.

  Neglecting the small quantity of alkali,                  these numbers lead us
nearly to the formula
                 2(CaO, SiO3)+2(Al2O3,               2SiO3)+7HO,
which differs completely from that of stilbite,
                 CaO, SiO3 + Al2O", 3SiO3 + 6HO,
or that of epistilbite,
                       CaO, SiO3 + Al2O3, 3SiO3 + 5HO.
The per-centage of water is also far too small for hypostilbite.
   The mineral appears to be a distinct one, and     does not seem to
have resulted from the gradual decomposition or change of any other;
but it is perhaps scarcely desirable to add to the already numerous
names of stilbite-like minerals by adopting a new one for this sub
stance until additional analyses of these nearly related species shall
permit of their more accurate classification.—Silliman's     American

THEward
     first                           who
         a purely mechanical theory of slaty cleavage, was the
late Mr. Sharpe, in two papers read before the Geological Society
of London, December 2, 1846, and November 1, 1848. These
papers are published in the third and fifth volumes of the Quar
terly Journal of that Society, and form a most valuable basis of
well-observed facts on which to establish a mechanical theory of
slaty cleavage.   At the close of the second of these papers, Mr.
Sharpe sums up his observations as follows:—
   “Thus           all
                our observations and deductions ultimately con
verge    to
          the conclusion,    that the cleavage must        attributed       be                 to
pressure caused             by
                      the elevation      great masses  of    rock under      of
conditions     which we are ignorant.
                   of                       And         this conclusion
                                                                  if   to
it should      be
              objected that                 no
                                  similar results can      produced         be                 by
experiment,    Ireply that              we
                                 have never tried the  experiment    with
a power       at      all
                       compared with that employed; and that this
                              be
                   of
may     be        many cases where our attempts
                      to                                     imitate the
                                                                            we of to

                                 of    during  which        can employ
them.”
   The objection thus alluded                          by
                                         Mr. Sharpe has been com

410             The Rev. S. Haughton                           on    Slaty Cleavage,
with many geologists I adopted Mr. Sharpe's views, and have
from time to time collected data for forming a more precise me
chanical theory than that put forward in general terms by Mr.
Sharpe.         I
              was, in short, convinced that if the theory were true,
it would bear accurate numerical investigation, and admit of
being stated with great precision.     With a view to this numerical
testing of the theory,                   I
                             have accumulated a great number of
observations and measurements of distorted fossils, which I think
are sufficient to enable me to state precisely the laws of slaty
cleavage and distortion of fossils.
     Ishall now proceed to state the results I have arrived      and
                                                                                                            at,
to illustrate them              by
                         detailed examples; and     shall afterwards             I
point out the extent        which Mr. Sharpe's results agree with
                                     to
my own, and how far they anticipate them.
   The first fact observed                    by
                                 me was the following:—

fossils lying     the plane
                     in         bedding      of
                                           parallel    this intersection.
                                                               is                   to

when we examine         distorted fossil, we can calculate the amount

examine what effect the angle between the planes of cleavage and
bedding produced on the amount of distortion. The following
law expresses the result of my measurements:—
     II.The distortion of fossils produced by cleavage—estimated in
a given   direction, such as parallel to the intersection of the planes
of cleavage and bedding—varies with the angle between these planes,
being greatest when the angle is greatest, and least when the angle
is least.
   The distortion depending upon the angle between the planes
of cleavage and bedding may be calculated numerically from the
following expression:—

should agree. The agreement is very good, as appears from the

     It
     is remarkable that the compression in this case, perpendi
cular to the cleavage planes, is very small compared with the
compressions determined in the slates already discussed. This
doubtless arises from the fact, that sandstones resist the cleavage
action or pressure better than slate or mud. This singular fact,
of a less compression existing in sandstones than in slates, and
accurate knowledge of the forms of the palaeozoic fossils was of the greatest
service to me, and he allowed me free access to              by
                                                       the specimens      the                     in

418         The Rev. S. Haughton on Slaty Cleavage,
a proportionably less-developed cleavage, is a solid argument in
support of the mechanical theory of cleavage.
   In addition to the examples already given, have measured      I
several others in which I could only obtain a single position of
the plane of bedding in relation to the cleavage plane ; this is
not sufficient to determine the three axes of the ellipsoid of dis
tortion; but if we assume, as is probable, that this ellipsoid is
one of revolution, we can readily obtain an approximate value of
              |-vº
the compression due to cleavage as follows:–Assuming b equal
to unity in one of the equations (3), we find, after some simple
reductions,—

taken from my note-book:—
  ExAMPLE 6.—Silurian Black Slates of Moel Benddu, Dinas
             Mowddy, South of Bala, North Wales.
  The fossil whose distortion was measured in this                   case   was the
Asaphus Powisii, and  its
                        normal shape was assumed                     as   follows:–

                         madoc, North Wales.
   The fossil used in this example was a tail of the Ogygia scu
tator, whose normal dimensions were found to be as follows:—
                Ogygia scutator         .   Breadth of tail =355
                                            Length of tail =203
    From these measurements,                compared with the distorted        fos

   This result corresponds to a greater amount of compression
than   Ifound in any other case, not even excepting Tintagel,
where the cleavage is uncommonly well developed.
  ExAMPLE 8.—Carboniferous Slates of Carrigaline, Co. Cork.
   The carboniferous slates of this district are of the same geo
logical age as the slates of Ardoginna, Co. Waterford, and of the
same mineral character, being dark and carbonaceous at inter
vals, with patches of smooth brown shale between the dark mud
bands. The fossil used to determine the amount of compression
is the Orthis crenistria, whose breadth equals      length    theits          in
normal condition. The measurements of the distorted fossil are
as   follow:—
                   Orthis crenistria         .   Length =193
                                                 Breadth=409
     From the specimen,       on   which these measurements were taken,
I obtained the following data:—
                          $=80°,                         ;

                                                 2. 44
   This result indicates an amount of compression quite com
parable with that observed in the Ardoginna and Ardmore slates
of the same age, and may be considered as characteristic of the
carboniferous slates of the entire south of Ireland.
   It now remains to state how far the results have obtained               I
correspond  with those arrived at by Mr. Sharpe.
  At the 87th page of the Quarterly Journal of the Geological
Society of London, Mr. Sharpe sums up the results of his obser
vations as follows:—
   1st. In cleaved rocks there is a compression of the mass in a
direction everywhere perpendicular to the planes of cleavage.
   2nd. An eagansion of the mass in the direction of the dip of the
cleavage.
   3rd. No proof has been found that the rocks have suffered any
change in the direction of the strike of the cleavage planes.
   Mr. Sharpe also mentions incidentally in the course of his
paper the following fact, of the importance of which he does not
           cº
seem to have been aware:—
   4th. When the plane of bedding is considered, the shells all
appear             in a direction perpendicular to the strike of the
cleavage plane across the bed.
   On comparing these results with the laws of cleavage distor
tion given in the preceding part of this paper, it will be observed
that the first and fourth fall in with Laws            and I. The         III.
second and third statements do not accord with my observations,
      I
and am inclined to think that they are hasty generalizations,
as it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the absolute com
pression or expansion undergone by the rock in any direction.
   It is evident that the whole subject of cleavage and mecha                         its
nical origin    very imperfectly understood, and desire
                is                                          throw         a             to

422            Prof. Stokes's Remarks on Prof. Challis's paper,
to the extent of some researches of my own.                                                  I    have, however,
on some points expressed opinions, respecting the justice of which
it is only one who is familiar with certain classes of optical expe
riments who can feel the confidence that I entertain.
   From the paragraph commencing at the foot of page 330, it
is plain that Professor Challis has made some confusion between
three perfectly distinct things: Sir David Brewster’s controverted
analysis of the solar spectrum by means of absorbing media+;
his discovery of the phaenomenon of internal dispersiont; and my
own discovery, that a beam of rays of prismatic purity (whether
belonging to the visible or invisible portion of the spectrum is
indifferent) may, by their action on certain media, produce light
which may be decomposed by the prism into portions extending
over a wide range of refrangibility, and having colours answering
to their refrangibilities i.
   As to the first, it was asserted by Sir David Brewster that
light of prismatic purity may have             colour changed          passing
                                                                         its                             by
through absorbing media. This has nothing                    with “internal”         to     do
or   “epipolic” dispersion,            “fluorescence.”  or     Glass coloured
blue      by
           cobalt, for instance, has none       these properties, althoughof
it   is one    ofthe media which exhibit most strikingly the phae
nomena adduced                         by
                            Sir David Brewster. Were such               change                           a
    colour made out,                      point     the utmost importance

                        not changed; and Helmholtz has attributed

coloured solutions, and having repeatedly seen the phaenomena
 on  which Sir David Brewster relies, may                    permitted   I ex            be                    to

clear coloured fluids or solids, and the light transmitted through
or reflected from dyed or other coloured substances, must be
forced to admit, that, setting aside a comparatively small number
of cases in which the colour observed is referrible to other causes,
the colours of natural bodies are due to absorption. The excep
tions are colours due to fluorescence, as in the case of solutions
of quinine, or to regular chromatic reflexion, as in the case of
gold, copper, platino-cyanide of magnesium, murexide, &c., not
to mention such colours as those of the rainbow, &c., which
result from the general properties of bodies with regard to their
action on light, not from any speciality of the substance by which
the colours happen to be produced. The mode in which I con
ceive absorption to operate in occasioning the colours observed
in dyed ribbons, flowers, coloured powders, &c., I have more fully
explained elsewhere”.        Now absorption is best studied in clear
 solids or solutions,   where it is not complicated by irregular re
 flexions or refractions.     But when such media are studied by the
 aid of a pure spectrum, there cannot be a moment’s hesitation that
 the colour of the transmitted light is due to the abstraction from
 the incident white light of some of the component rays, as ex
 plained by Newton. The colour results, not from the light acted
 on by the medium, but precisely from the portion left unaffected.
 Hence      its
             origin     celestial (supposing the sun
                         is                                     the source

calculation of T. g also is attended with no further difficulty,
because T is determined from the simple equation
                                                 T=273 +t.
     I have                    of g and T. g and given them in a
                     collected the values
Table at the end of this memoir. For the sake of completeness,
I have also added the corresponding values of p; those above
100° being calculated by Regnault, those below by Moritz. To
each of these three series of numbers are attached the differences
between every two successive numbers; so that from the Table
the values of the three magnitudes can be found for every tem
perature; and conversely, for any given value of one of the three
magnitudes the corresponding temperature can be seen.
   After what was before said of the calculation of g, it need
scarcely be mentioned that the numbers of this table are not to
be considered as exact, they being only communicated in the
absence of better ones.   As, however, the calculations with refer
ence to  steam-engines  are always based upon rather uncertain
data, the numbers can without hesitation be used for this pur
pose, there being no fear that the uncertainty of the result will
be much increased thereby.
   As to the method of application, however, another remark is
still necessary.    In the equations (XVII), it is assumed that the
pressure p and                   its
                      differential coefficient   are expressed   kilog                      in

  we  will determine the work for this velocity.

  setting this value of V in the two last of equations (XVII). For
  the machine without a condenser, the determination of tº has
  been sufficiently explained; and as the present case differs from
  that one only by a different value for e, which was there equal
  to 1, it will be sufficient to state here that the final result is

several imperfections  have  upon  the work,      have added the fol          I
lowing cases:–
   (1) The case       machine having
                                 ofa        vicious space, and where  no

in the condenser, this case will be the one to which equation (XI)
refers, and which for a given quantity of heat—the temperatures
at which the heat is received and imparted being also considered
as given—furnishes the greatest possible quantity of work.
   (2) The case of a machine, again, having no vicious space, and
when the pressure in the cylinder is again equal to that in the
boiler, but where the expansion is not, as before, complete, but
only continued until the ratio e : 1 is obtained. This is the case
to which equation (X) refers; only in order to determine the
amount of expansion, the change caused by the same in the
temperature of the vapour was before supposed to be known,
whilst here the expansion is determined according to the volume,
and the change                  of temperature               must be afterwards calculated
therefrom.
   (3) The case of a machine with vicious space and incomplete
expansion,    and where, of the former favourable conditions, the
only one which remains is that during the entrance of the vapour
the pressure in the cylinder is the same as in the boiler, so that
the volume has                its
                       smallest possible value.
   To these cases    may     added the one already mentioned, where
                                           be
the last favourable condition       relinquished, and the volume has
                                                  is
                             of its
a  greater than       minimum value.
    For the sake      comparison,                      all
                                        these cases, with the exception
of  the first, are also calculated according        Pambour's theory. to

    58. The quantities of work in this Table, as well as those in
the former Table for machines without condensers, refer to a
kilogramme of vapour coming from the boiler.          It is easy,
however, to refer the work to a unit of heat furnished by the
source of heat; for every kilogramme of vapour requires as
much heat as is necessary, first to raise the mass l (somewhat
more than one kilogramme) from the temperature it had when
entering the boiler up to the general temperature of the same,
and then at that temperature to convert a kilogramme of it into
vapour. This quantity of heat can be calculated from former
data.
    59. In conclusion,              I
                             will add a few remarks on friction, re
stricting myself, however, to a justification of my having hitherto
disregarded friction in the developed equations, by showing that
instead of introducing the same at once into the first general
expressions for the work, as Pambour has done, it may also, ac
cording to the same principles, and according to the manner of
other authors, be afterwards brought into calculation.
    The forces which the machine has to overcome during                                              its
action may         thus distinguished:—(1)
                   be                              The resistance exter
nally opposed           to andit,   overcomingin   which      performs the         it
required useful work.        Pambour calls this resistance the charge
of  the machine.      (2) The resistances which have their source                                    in
 the machine itself,            so
                            that the work expended             overcoming          in
 them    isnot externally      use.    All these resistances are included
                                        of
in  the term friction; although, besides friction             more limited    in   its
 sense, they comprise other forces, particularly the resistances
 caused       by
              pumps belonging         the machine, exclusive
                                                   to               the one                  of
 which feeds the boiler, and which has already been considered.
    Pambour brings both these kinds                                of
                                                 resistances into calcula
 tion   asforces opposing     the motion       the piston; and  of    order                    in
 conveniently       combine them with the pressures
                   to                                           the vapour          of
 on  both sides     ofthe piston,      also adopts he   notation similar  a                          to
 the one   ordinarily   used for  vapour   pressures;    that       say, the            is   to

              , Theory  of Heat  to the Steam-engine.            439
symbol denotes, not the whole force, but that part of it which
corresponds to a unit of surface of the piston. In this sense let
the letter R represent the charge.
    A further distinction must still be made in the case of friction,
for it has not a constant value in each machine, but increases
with the charge.       Accordingly Pambour divides it into two
parts: that which is already present when the machine moves
without charge, and that which the charge itself occasions.
With respect to the last, he assumes that it is proportional to
the charge. Accordingly, the friction referred to the unit of sur
face is expressed by
                              f--8.   R,
where   f and 6 are magnitudes which, although dependent upon
the construction and dimensions of the machine, are, according
to Pambour, to be considered as constant in any given machine.
    We can now refer the work of the machine to these resisting
forces instead of, as before, to the driving force of steam; for the
negative work done by the former must be equal to the positive
work done by the latter, otherwise an acceleration or retardation
of motion would ensue, which would be contradictory to the
hypothesis of uniform motion hitherto made.         During the time
that a unit of weight of vapour enters the cylinder, the surface       .
of the piston describes the space (1—e)W, hence for the work W
we obtain the expression
                    W=(1–e)V((1+8). R+f].
On the other hand, the useful part of this work, which for di
stinction from the whole work shall be symbolized by (W), is
 expressed thus,
                          (W) = (1–e)W. R.
Eliminating R from this equation by means of the former, we
 have the equation
                               W–(1—e)W.f
                        (W)=         1 +8
                                                2                 (58)
 by means of which, V being known, the useful work (W) can be
 deduced from the whole work W as soon as the quantities        f  and
 8 are given.
    I will not here enter into Pambour's method of finding the
 latter quantities, as this determination still rests upon a too    in
 secure basis, and as friction is altogether foreign to the subject
 of this memoir.

               LV. On a new Arrangement of the Induction Coil.
                  By JonATHAN N. HEARDER, Plymouth*.
1.
        IN phical
            my communication to the last Number of the Philoso
                  Magazine, I confined myself to the announcement
of a few of the novel results which     had obtained from investiga          I
tions with   my induction coil.   might                           I
                                          have given many more, but
purposely refrained from doing so until I had had an opportunity
of repeating my experiments with a still more powerful machine,
as certain indications had led me to believe that many of the results
which have hitherto been announced as peculiar to the action of
the induction coil, have been disguised by the mode of construc
tion of the instruments of M. Ruhmkorff; such, for example, as
the ignition of the negative terminal only, and the comparative
inertness of the terminal proceeding from the inner portion of
the coil. These and other effects appeared to me to indicate
that M. Ruhmkorff’s secondary coil could not be perfectly insu
lated from the primary one, and that the true statical condition
of the two terminals could not consequently be accurately ascer
tained and compared.
   2. It happened in the first arrangement of my machine, that
I was led to construct                               all   its
                                elements separate and independent
                         purpose    ascertaining how modifications
of of
   each  other, for the                                            of
   any        of
           them influenced the action      the rest.  The secondary                of
coil     this case was perfectly insulated, and
         in                                           was frequently                                 I

          my first machine alluded         my  last paper, since both        to    in
terminals would sometimes become heated, and the inner terminal
was possessed        such high statical intensity that
                                    of                     could not                                          it
be   handled with   impunity.         still more powerful machin   In      a

     5. Each secondary terminal gives sparks                    uninsulated     to       an
 conductor, which are longer when the opposite terminal                 com                          is
municating with the ground, sometimes more than                     inch                       an               in
length; and          on
                  connecting the terminals with graduated Lane's               a
discharger furnished with platina points, torrents                sparks                      of                in
bundles   pass between them          distance at

inch, both become white-hot, the negative being rather hotter
than the positive; and on substituting fine iron wires for the
platina points, both enter into combustion.        Fine platina wires
become white-hot at the ends, melt, and run back into globules.
    7. Through the flame of alcohol a flood of sparks will pass
between 8 and 9 inches in length, producing a curious zigzag
 circuit, and accompanied with very loud crepitations.
     8. In an exhausted receiver, 3 feet in length and 4 inches in dia
 meter, a splendid ribbon of light is produced of the most exqui
 site colours, the centre line being bright, and surrounded by an
intense crimson light, shading offinto violet and purple.         have            I
 only yet tried a receiver of these dimensions, but should consider
from appearances that the light would pervade a much longer-          -
Vacuum.
    9. I   have only tried Gassiot’s cascade in a flower vase 10
inches high, but there can be no doubt that a flower vase of 2
or 3 feet in height would be equally well illuminated, as                 was         I
obliged to use only 3 or 4 cells, otherwise the action of the machine
was too strong.        The contrast in the appearance of the light on
reversing the current is most beautifully exhibited. On making
the inside of the vase positive, the electricity appears to flow in
an immense sheet out over the edge to a considerable distance,
and fall upon the plate of the pump; but on reversing the cur
rent, a totally different appearance is produced: the sheet appears
 now to envelope the vase more closely, and to flow up and turn
in over the rim, the direction of the current in each case being
too decided to be mistaken.
     10.   I have not yet heard of any effects from a single machine
which have at        all
                      approximated        these results; and
                                         to                                  as

 that the    arrangement       not
                              is     only  more    powerful,   but  possesses

LVI.  Memorandum respecting a new System of Roots of Unity.
  By Sir WILLIAM RowAN HAMILTON, LL.D., M.R.I.A.,

  versity of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland”.
I      HAVE  lately been led to the conception of a new system,
     or rather family of systems, of non-commutative roots of unity,
which are entirely distinct from the                         ijk
                                            the quaternions, thoughof
having some general analogy thereto; and which admit, even
more easily than the quaternion symbols do,        geometrical inter             of
pretation.      the   In
                    system   which seems     present        the most   at                  to   be

             MY       DEAR    SIR,
 A”     you have with much kindness hitherto afforded me space
         in the Philosophical Magazine for the publication, in
eatenso, of everything                    I
                           have had leisure to bring before the
public on the much-vexed question of the Weald Denudation, I
beg the favour of a continuance of your good offices in the same
direction.
   By some the subject may be considered rather stale; but so
long as there exists a doubt on the public mind of whether we
are to refer the phaenomena of the great denudations around us
to the slow sempiternal erosion of weather and water, as we see
them now in operation, or to call in the assistance of seasons of
paroxysmal violence and activity under other conditions, any
contribution which tends to throw light on such a subject can

450              Mr. P.   J.   Martin       on the   Anticlinal Line      of
tertiary,   pit of which was some few years since open by the road
            a
side near the nursery garden.       Further west, at Crocker Hill
and Boxgrove, the angular flints are largely mixed up with eocene
shingle, and so it continues on to Goodwood.       At West Hamp
net  they  are closely impacted with clays derived from the stratum
above mentioned.       Further on, between the workhouse and the
city, close by the Lavant, and near the public-house at the turn
ing to Goodwood, a pit was open three or four years ago, from
whence flints were turned out with so much chalk-rubble about
them and so white as to look like chalk-stones.      I have not seen
anything like it except at Brighton, and under the Downs at
Boxhill in Surrey. Further west in the Portfield the gravels are
again smaller and more washed. At Rumboldswick, again, they
become larger, and the same in the direction of Donnington and
Appledram, and are here again mixed and impacted with the
subjacent clays.     South from these points the surface of the
Manwode country is chiefly tertiary clay and sand, till the
boulder-drift falls in from the coast.
   If any  stress be laid on the difference of colour in these gra
vels as indicative of their age or of their aera of formation, let it
be admitted.     The flints by the side of the Lavant are not so much
pounded as those at the West Hampnet brick-yard, where they
are for the most part broken into small fragments and impacted
with clay-loam ; and they are white, because they have not been
washed out of the chalk rubble that surrounds them.              Even
their superposition,       if it
                            be clearly made out, argues nothing
more than that they have been outspread after the washing,
smashing, and impaction of the brown (brown because mixed up
with ferruginous) clay, near or on which they lie.     Unwashed
flints are spread out in like manner at Brighton, in the valley of
the Mole near Boxhill, and on the outskirts of the foot of the
North Downs from Dorking to Reigate;—and are here and there
to be found in chalk-rubble drift on the plateau of the upper
greensand in West Sussex.       This white gravel, if it may be so
called, was brought into notice in my former publication on ter
tiary drift (see Phil. Mag. for October 1851); and           super         its
position,     that granted, argues nothing more than another
                be
diluvial sweep,-else, why          is      it,

            Chichester, towards Emsworth and the foot         Ports            of

with the débris of the tertiaries still persistent on the chalk, to
the back of the North Downs, where the same zone is resumed
with the same appearances, and extends from Guildford to Can
terbury. There is an important break in the series between
Basingstoke and Guildford, owing to the peculiar upcast of the
chalk between Crondall and the last-mentioned place.                     With
this exception, the same general character is to be observed in
all this spread            of
                      supracretaceous gravel.            have dwelt more       I                                       on

    Mr. Hopkins walls himself up, as have elsewhere said, in an
imaginary line of demarcation, and fails of carrying his specu
lations out to their legitimate conclusion.     He breaks up the
Weald, but does not dispose of the materials.       Does he leave
them to be disposed of by the gentle means of erosion, by sea
boards or under-currents, or by atmospheric wear?     The erosion
by sea-boards it cannot be, for there are no beaches; there are
lacerated escarpments, but there are no cliffs; there are chasms
 and ravines, but these do not bear the marks of having been
 “fiords” or estuaries; and there are bare rocks, but these have
 no stratified beds with their attendant fossils at their feet, nor
 are accompanied by any of the other ordinary signs of sea-beds.

LVIII.        On the Importance of an Adequate Definition in developing
          the Theory of Parallel Lines.   By J. P. HENNEssy +
      ROFESSOR STEVELLY'S criticism, in         the last Number
        of the Philosophical Magazine, on a paper of mine
which was published nearly four years ago, raises two distinct
questions.   It raises, in the first place, a question as to the
logical value of the reasoning in my paper.     On this do not                               I
think it necessary to offer any observations.  To do so, would be
to approach too close to what every man of science must wish
to avoid, a personal discussion.                              I
                                          am quite certain that a
discussion of such a nature could have no claims whatever to
occupy the valuable space of the Philosophical Magazine.                                                   I
trust, therefore, that Mr. Stevelly will not feel I am treating
him with any discourtesy if        allow            I
                                               the assertions      all                               as   to

looking over the voluminous history of the subject, one is struck
by the large number of persons who object to anything like a
full and adequate definition. The objection is generally made
on the ground that the definition “assumes” something; or that
it contains   a “property;” or that it “involves a petitio prin
cipii.” It is hardly necessary to say, that such objections imply
a misapprehension        of the first principles of formal logic. In
framing a definition, something must be assumed; and that
something must be a property. When the property is incor
porated in the definition, it becomes              differentia.         speak

which states that the exterior angle is equal to the interior and op
posite. From this, down to Mr. Stevelly's, we have had definitions
of all sorts. The list commences with such as fulfil Dr. Whate
ly’s idea of what a mathematical definition should be, and ter
minates with such as are inadequate and useless.     There is one
test that every logician would employ in examining the practical
value of ordinary definitions, which should be applied to these.
It depends on the relative ease with which we find the properties
flow from the definitions.     The number of writers who have

    The blue liquid obtained on shaking copper powder with aqueous
ammonia and oxygen or atmospheric air, also contains, besides
oxide of copper, nitrite of ammonia; for if you add some soda to it
and boil it to drive off the ammonia and throw down the black
oxide of copper, a solution is obtained which, after being evapo
rated to dryness, leaves behind a yellowish salt which consists
principally of nitrite of soda. This substance, on being mixed

460          Mr. H. Wedgwood      on a System   of Geometry
the conception of sameness of direction at different points of a
system; the species defined in the two first being traced out by
a point actually moving in the same direction under certain con
ditions, and in the third by a point moving under the sole con
dition of a negation of motion in a certain constant direction.
   When a point is made to describe a line of any shape, it must
begin to move in some one direction; and as long as the stroke
is continued in the same unaltered direction, the result will be a
straight line under the proposed definition. So if a straight
line AB be given, and it be required to draw a straight line
parallel to it through a point C, the definition instructs us to
draw the line CD in the same direction from C with that marked
by the straight line AB at A. If the problem be to draw a
plane through A under the guidance of the definition, a direction
AN must be given in which the generating point is to be wholly
void of motion on setting out from A.; and if B be any subse
quent point in the plane, the generating point in passing through
B must be wholly void of motion in a direction identical with
that marked by the line AN at A.
    As the motion of a point along a straight line is constantly
directed to the point at the extremity of the line, little difficulty
is commonly felt with respect to the first definition, but an am
biguity is suspected when the term is applied to parallel lines.
It is asserted that the only meaning of the sameness of direction
 of two straight lines passing through the points A and B, and
having no points in common; is the equality of the angles made
with the straight line joining AB; and it is asserted, that there
is a covert assumption that if the straight lines make equal
 angles with AB, they will make equal angles with a straight line
intersecting the parallels at any other points.
    To others, perhaps, the objection does not present itself in S0
 definite a form ; but they feel uncertain whether the expression
 of ‘sameness of direction’ be not used in a somewhat different
 sense in respect of parallel lines than when applied to successive
 portions of the same straight line, and in the former case they
 are inclined to doubt whether the standard of identity of direc
tion be not derived from the notion of parallelism rather than
vice versä.
    In  answer to these objections,  I propose to indicate the sense
 in which   identity of direction is  uniformly  to be understood in
these definitions, and the reasoning founded upon them, by
reference to a moveable scale which admits of application to
directions measured from different points in a system, and en
ables us to form an estimate of their identity or divergence.

investigation, the directions diverging from any point in the
system must be understood as defined by reference to the stand
ard directions of the observer's own body; and a direction in the
external system at B will be the same with a given direction at
A when it occupies the same position in respect of up and down,
right and left, fore and aft. A straight line in the external
system extending directly in front of the observer, or directly to
his right when he is stationed at B, will be recognized as lying
in the same direction with a straight line directly in front or
directly to the right when stationed at A ; and so of straight
lines extending from A and B respectively, and lying in similar
intermediate positions between fore and aft and right and left.
    Now let us examine the import of these conditions applied to
the case of straight lines AC, BD passing in parallel directions
through the points A and B respectively.            The meaning of pa
rallelism under the definition will      be, that the line BD occupies
the same position among the standard directions in the body of
an observer moving from A to B without rotation in the system,
with that which was filled by the line AC when the observer was
at A.     On thus comparing the directions of AC and BD by the
standard of his own bodily structure, the observer must pass from
A to B by some definite path, to which alone the relation of
parallelism would seem to refer. . But what if he had gone by
any other track? Would he then have found the line BD in the
 same position among the lines of his own bodily standard?
    Here we have the condition that the observer is brought to
the same point B by a straight line AB, and by a track of some
other nature; and as points are known in geometry by position
alone, it must be supposed that the position attained by the
 straight line AB is recognized as identical with that attained by
the other track. Let AB be supposed, for example, to extend
directly to the right of the observer in his original position at A,
whence it follows that A will                   lie

      Number of the Philosophical Magazine.  By Prof. CLAUSIUs”.
      N the November Number of this Journal a note appears from
        Mr. Joule, which refers to a passage in my memoir “On the
 Application of the Mechanical Theory of Heat to the Steam
 engine,” where the experiments conducted by Mr. Joule and
 Mr. Thomson are mentioned. The note concludes with the fol
 lowing words:–“The results we have arrived at in our joint                                                        in
 vestigation have tended certainly to develope our views, and to
 give a more definite knowledge of the constitution of elastic fluids,
 but they do not contradict our original statements, published
 before the appearance of Prof. Clausius's papers.”           can only                              I
 explain this note, and particularly the conclusion of           far                            it,      so        as

                           report on the building materials of all kinds,
                           or artificial, which were displayed at the Paris
Exhibition. M. Delesse was peculiarly qualified to undertake the
task of drawing up this report, from his intimate acquaintance both
with geology and chemistry, and from his former researches on the
chemical composition of rocks.         The report contains the results of a
large number of chemical analyses, as well as of experiments on the
strength and other physical properties of the materials exhibited.
We may refer particularly to the chapters on marbles and cements,
as containing a large amount of novel and interesting information.
From the latter we extract the following observations on the cements
of Canada.
   Thorold Cement.—This cement, from Thorold near St. Catherine
in Upper Canada, is prepared by calcining an argillaceous limestone
of the Upper Silurian formation.          The limestone is grayish-black,
and emits an   argillaceous    odour when breathed on; but the cement
itself has a  yellow   colour.    The specimen examined did not effer
vesce with   acids, and contained only 3:37 per cent. of water.          It
set in fifteen minutes with a disengagement of heat. A specimen
immersed in water ten minutes after being moistened, set under the
water, and presented finally the same cohesion as another specimen
which was not immersed till two hours after it had set. The resist
ance to traction of this cement was about 0.85 kil. It was found to
consist of

William Thomson, F.R.S., and                        J.

    A  very   great    depression  of  temperature     has been remarked by
some observers when steam of            high    pressure   issues from a small
orifice into the open air. After the experiments we have made on
the rush of air in similar circumstances, it could not be doubted that
a great elevation of temperature of the issuing steam might be
observed as well as the great depression usually supposed to be the
only result. The method to obtain the entire thermal effect is
obviously that which we have already employed in our experiments
on permanently elastic fluids, viz. to transmit the steam through a
porous material and to ascertain                    its
                                            temperature           enters into and

issues from the resisting medium.             We have made            preliminary      a
experiment          this kind which may

    As am indebted for the greatest part of the materials to English
observations,     I  have found it my duty to render my thanks to
English science, and to express my hopes of future exertions towards
the solution of this, in my thought, most interesting problem of the
general physics of the globe.

    “Supplement to the ‘Account of Pendulum Experiments under
taken in the Harton Colliery;' being an Account of Experiments
undertaken to determine the correction for the Temperature of the
Pendulum.” By G. B. Airy, Esq., Astronomer Royal.
    Adverting to the circumstance that, in the Harton Experiment,
there was a mean difference of 7° between the temperature above and
below, and that a careful determination of the coefficient for tem
perature-correction was therefore necessary, the author describes the
process by which the correction was now investigated by experiment
on the same pendulums which were used in the Harton Experiment.
Two rooms were selected at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
having firm stone floors, and admitting of being heated, one by a
 stove in the room, the other by a hot-air-apparatus below.             One
pendulum was mounted upon its iron stand, with clock and other
 apparatus, in one room, and the other in the other room.          Care was
 taken that the pendulums and their thermometers should be effec
tually protected from radiation.         The two clocks were compared by
 carrying a chronometer from one to the other, and remarking the time
 of coincidence of beats; a method which admits of very great accu
 racy, when (as in this instance) the distance through which the
 chronometer is to be carried is small.       In the Fifth Series (counting
 the series in sequence    to those of the Harton Experiment), Pendulum
 1821 was    kept   in heat,  and Pendulum 8 cool, and continuous obser
 vations were   kept   up  during  forty hours.   In the Sixth Series, Pen
 dulum 8     only   was  kept   in heat, and observations were again kept
 up during forty hours. The Seventh and Eighth Series were similar,
 respectively, to the Fifth and Sixth. The temperatures are referred
 to two of the thermometers used in the Harton Experiment, and to
 two other thermometers supplying the place of two of the Harton

                                 cannot be found.
ducted entirely by Messrs. Dunkin and Ellis, Assistants of the Royal
Observatory.
   On discussing the results of the observations, there appears to be
reason for supposing that a change has taken place in one of the
pendulums after the Seventh Series. This appears from the circum
stance that, though the Fifth and Seventh Series agree well, the Sixth
and Eighth are discordant; and also from this circumstance, that the
abstract relation between the two pendulums given by the Fifth,
Sixth, and Seventh Series, agrees closely with that found at Harton;
but if the Eighth Series is included, there is a considerable dis
cordance.
  If   the Eighth Series is rejected, it appears that Colonel Sabine's
coefficient ought to be increased by about ºth part; and on intro
 ducing this correction into the computations of the Harton Experi
ment, the result for the earth's mean density is 6-809.             the                     If
 Eighth Series is retained, the correction is reduced to less than one
 fourth of that just mentioned, and the earth's mean density is
 6'623.
   The author subjoins an investigation with which he has been
favoured by Professor Stokes on the effect of the rotation and ellip
ticity of the earth in modifying the numerical results of the Harton
Experiment.     It appears that the numbers found in the paper ought
to be multiplied by

   “On the presence of fibrils of soft tissue in the Dentinal Tubes.”
By John Tomes, Esq., F.R.S.
   Referring to the structural characters of dentine, and to the pre
vailing belief that the dentinal tubes in the normal condition contain
fluid, the author goes on to show that the recognized histological
characters fail to account for the high degree of sensibility exhibited
by the dentine when diseased, or when suddenly exposed by the
removal of the enamel.
   It is found, moreover, that the dentine is not uniformly sensitive
throughout, but possesses a much higher degree of sensibility at the
peripheral distribution of the dentinal tubes than deeper in the sub
stance of the tooth; and it is urged that these facts cannot be
accounted for by the presence of a fluid in the dentinal tubes, nor
by supposing that the hard unyielding dentine is intrinsically en
dowed with sensation. This view of the matter is borne out by the
fact, that     all
                sensibility      once lost
                                is   at       the pulp
                                                  if       the tooth of                  be
                                           -
destroyed.
     Finding that the dentine owed         its   sensibility   to
                                                          the presence                   of
the dentinal pulp, and knowing that the tubes have open extremities
in  contact with the pulp, the author was induced           examine care
                                                                    to
fully the contents      the tubes. The investigation resulted
                       of                                           disco       in
vering that the dentinal tubes, instead          of
                                               containing fluid only, give
passage   to fibrils   ofsoft tissue, which pass from the pulp into the
tubes where these open upon the surface            of
                                                the pulp-cavity, and from
thence may        be
                 traced into the branches.     The fibrils may     demon       be
strated   byfracturing     perfectly fresh tooth, and then with
                            a                                        sharp      a
knife taking very thin sections from the dentine near the edge                           of
the pulp-cavity.     The dentine will, when cut, break          into smallup
fragments, and from the edges             of
                                          these the fibrils may        seen         be

this manipulation, the fibrils will be dragged out from one fragment,
and will be seen projecting from the edge of the other.
   The fibrils, when isolated and examined with a high power, with
out the presence of a reagent, show some indications of tubularity,
but not with sufficient distinctness to enable the author to determine
whether they are tubes or solid bodies. Their appearance is very
like that of the ultimate fibrils of spinal nerves, and they possess a
character in common with these, in the presence of minute globules
of dense transparent matter exuded from the broken ends, and some
times from the surface of the fibril.      It is not easy to determine in
what manner the fibrils commence in the pulp.             In some prepa
rations  they   appear  to be connected with cells situated a short
distance within the pulp, in others they may be traced to a greater
depth, where they are lost in the tissue of the pulp, and may possibly
be connected with the nerves, which in this part are very abundant.
But in the absence of exact knowledge as to the manner in which the
dentinal fibrils are related to the elements of the pulp, the author
considers that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion
that they are organs of sensation, the distribution of which through
the substance of the dentine endows that tissue with          sensibility.           its
   This conclusion       borne out by the occurrence
                             is                             the following          of

   The stomach being exposed was found distended with food. Gal
vanism of the sound vagus caused evident contractions of this organ,
which were strongest at the neck or constriction which it usually
presents (in the rabbit), from whence they radiated in both direc
tions, becoming more and more faint.         On stimulating the other
vagus, from which the accessory had been virtually eliminated, no
perceptible influence was observed.
   Microscopic examination showed that the cervical part of the
vagus of the side operated on contained numerous disorganized
fibres, almost            all
                    collected together      single fasciculus, which in

motor fibres contained       the vagus, which govern the movement

the larynx, the heart, and the stomach.        He likewise infers from

                                    the vagus below the recurrent, that

                      must observe that the most distant outliers of
the crater have not been included,” &c.
  “Notes on the Drawing of ‘Copernicus,” presented to the Royal
Society byP. A. Secchi.” By John Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
  Of the few attempts which have been made of late years to pre
pare drawingst, on a large scale, of selected lunar mountains, this
contribution from the Roman Observatory appears to be one of the
most successful.     It is on a scale of magnitude (about 10 geogra
phical miles to one inch) such as only the larger modern telescopes
can command, and characterized by such firmness of definition as to
do honour alike to the maker of the instrument and to the artist
engaged in the delineation.        It may assist those who have not
attempted, with their own hands, any drawings of this kind, and
desire to form a right judgement of the value of this work of
P. Secchi, if I send for comparison a drawing of Gassendi, executed
from my object-glass of 64 inches (Cook), with a focal length of
 11 feet.   The drawing is on a scale of 20 geographical miles to an
inch, and Gassendi thus appears of half the linear dimension of
Copernicus, being really almost of the same diameter.
    Placing together the two drawings, and remembering the appear
ance of Copernicus, as I have seen it through telescopes, some re
flections arise which it may be permitted me to express, in the hope
that we are now fairly entered on the long career of discoveries in
the moon, to which the attention of astronomers has been of late
systematically drawn by the Earl of Rosse and a Committee of the
British Association.
    In proportion as the power of the telescope rises, the seemingly
simple “ring mountains’ of the moon exhibit as much diversity of
outline and structure as the larger terrestrial volcanoes when accu
rately mapped. Thus while Gassendi,          40° from the central meri
dian of the moon, and 17° southf of the equator,         has the obliquely
elliptical contour due to a circle in that position, Copernicus, 20°
from the central meridian, and 10° north of the equator, has                               its
most conspicuous peripheral crest formed            seven principal nearly
straight elements, approaching        equality

478                                           Royal Society:—
errors; one in denying any deviation towards the equator, the other
in his calculation of the amount of the deviation towards the east.
   This is followed by an investigation of the motion or direction of
flight of a cannon-ball or shell fired in a northerly or southerly
direction, from which it appears that a large shell will be subject to
a deviation from the true line of projection, in consequence of the
earth's rotation, amounting to no less than 22 feet.
   The author then refers to the well-known experiment of M. Fou
cault for proving sensibly the rotation of the earth, and shows from
calculation that the errors which would be sufficient to vitiate the
results in this experiment are so extremely minute and so difficult of
avoidance by any perfection of manipulation which can be employed,
that      its
          performance cannot perhaps       safely adduced     proving  be                           as

    It thus appears that the oxygen exerted a much more powerful
action on the coagulum, which contained the fibrine and blood-cor
puscles, than on the serum, which contained only albumen.                         The ex
periment thus corroborated the results previously obtained with pure
fibrine and pure albumen.          The pure fibrine was seem to produce a
much    greater change  in the  composition          of the atmospheric air than the
pure albumen from the hen's egg. The difference in the case of the
coagulum and the serum was so much marked, that the author felt
anxious to find out whence it proceeded; and under the impression
that the haematine in the corpuscles might have mainly contributed to
the result (as other organic colouring matters possess the property of
absorbing oxygen and giving off carbonic acid gas), he took a small
quantity of pure blood-haematine prepared by Verdeil's process, and
put it into a vessel along with 1000 volumes of ordinary air. After
the air had been kept in contact with the haematine for some months,
the gas was analysed and found to contain—

The pure colouring principle of the blood, therefore, by exposure to
 ordinary air, gives off carbonic acid gas, and becomes oxidized in two
 ways; first by a loss of carbon, and secondly by direct combination
 with oxygen. The author considers that this last result furnishes
 additional evidence of the correctness of an opinion he hazarded two
 years ago", imputing to the colouring matters of the vegetable and
 animal economy a more important office in the function of respiration
 than they before had been             considered to possess,              and regarding
 their principal function       in organized beings as the absorbing of
 oxygen and exhaling of carbonic acid—a view altogether irrespective
 of Liebig’s well-known hypothesis, which assigns the above office to
 the iron of the blood-haematine.
     The author concludes by expressing the hope that his experi
 ments will be considered as at least serving to establish one import
 ant fact respecting which further evidence was wanted, namely, that
 the entire volume of the respired oxygen is not transmitted in an
 uncombined state (as Magnus believes) to the various organs and
 tissues of the body, but that a portion of it enters into chemical                   com
bination with some of the organic constituents of the blood.

     The following communication was read:—
     “On    the Stereognathus Ooliticus, from the Stonesfield-slate.”
By Prof. Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The subject of this paper was a small mammal, represented by a
fragment of a lower jaw retaining three molar teeth, which was ob
tained by the Rev.     J. Dennis from the Stonesfield-slate of Oxford
shire, and named Stereognathus         Ooliticus by Mr. E. Charlesworth.
This specimen, described in detail by Prof. Owen at the British                  As
sociation Meeting in September last, indicated, in the author's opi
nion, an animal allied to some extinct genera of even-toed pachy
derms, viz. the Hyracotherium, Microtherium, and Hyopotamus of the
Tertiary deposits; and he concluded therefore that the Stereognathus
was most probably a diminutive non-ruminant Artiodactyle of omni
vorous habits.
   With regard to the zoological reasons for referring this peculiar
and ancient fossil to the type of animal form above alluded to, the
Professor entered at some length into the analysis of the mental pro
cesses by which the palaeontologist aims at the restoration of an
unknown mammal from such a fragment as the fossil under notice.
Its mammalian character is decided by the two-fanged implantation
of the teeth, and its pachydermatous affinities are evidenced by the
peculiar sex-cuspid and cingulated molars.           These zoological rela
tions are determined from the      knowledge     that such structural pecu
liarities obtain in certain known     pachydermata.      Morphology, there
fore, or the study of form, rather than physiology, or the known
relation of organs to function, is the guide in this determination;
but the Professor expressed his opinion that this example could not
be cited as showing that there is no physiological, comprehensible,
or rational law (in contradistinction to the morphological or empiri
cal) which can be a guide in the determination of fossil remains.
He did not think that         such determinations rest upon the applica

NOTE ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF TRANSPARENT                                                BODIES
   SUBMITTED TO THE ACTION OF MAGNETISM.                                      B.Y. M. VERDET.
MA.             physicists have indicated the relations between the rotation
          of the plane of polarization produced under the influence of
magnetism and various physical properties of transparent bodies.
M. De la Rive, in the first volume of his Traité de l’Electricité, in refer
ring to the experiments of M. Bertin, calls attention to the fact that
the rotation is generally stronger in proportion as the index of re
fraction is greater.           Two substances cited in the Table which M.
Bertin has inserted in his memoir *, form exceptions to this rule;
these are alcohol and aether, which are more refractive than
water, and which, nevertheless, under the influence of magnetism,
rotate the plane of polarization of light at an angle considerably less.
In commencing my investigation I have had more particularly in
view to determine the extent of application of De la Rive's rule,
which various reasons, unnecessary to be reproduced here, led me to
regard as well founded.              I have consequently measured the index of
refraction of a considerable number of substances, and I have then
compared the action which they exert upon polarized light, when
placed between the poles of an electro-magnet.                               So as only to em
ploy well-defined bodies and such as can be easily obtained of equal
thickness, I have operated exclusively upon liquids, and particularly
upon saline solutions.            My experiments on the whole have not been
favourable to the rule which I was endeavouring to verify, and I
think that I may conclude from them that there exists no relation
between the index of refraction, and that which, for the sake of
brevity, I may be allowed to call the magnetic rotatory power. The
following Table contains the results of a certain number of experi
ments in which the rule proposed by De la Rive is shown to be very
evidently in the wrong.

diminish the magnetic rotatory power of the solution.                M. E. Bec
querel has made an analogous observation upon the protochloride of
iron, and he believed that it might be said in a general way, that
the rotation of the plane of polarization due to the influence of mag
netism varies in an opposite ratio to the magnetic power of the
bodies. The experiments referred to by M. E. Becquerel do not
allow us to consider this law as absolute. Thus we see by them,
that the rotation of water being represented by 10, those of the two
unequally concentrated solutions of protochloride of iron are repre
sented by 9 and by 3, and that of a solution of sulphate of nickel by
 13:55; in other words, of these magnetic solutions there are two
which produce a weaker rotation than water, whilst the third pro
duces a stronger one.          Nevertheless, the extreme weakness of the
rotation of a concentrated solution of protochloride of iron, approach
ing the observation of M. Bertin on the protosulphate of iron, seems
to indicate that there is a peculiar mode of action in the ferruginous
compounds deserving of careful study.
    I have dissolved in water a certain number of proto- and per-salts
of iron (chlorides, sulphates, nitrates), and found that in all cases the
rotatory power of the solution was less than that of water.                   But
what is more,          if,
                       taking into account the density and composition
of  the solution, we calculate the rotation that would              produced by          be

                                                     the rotation observed.

salts of iron submitted to the action of magnetism exert an action
opposite to that of the generality of transparent substances upon
polarized light.
   I   shall propose to call the magnetic rotatory power of water, heavy
glass, sulphuret of carbon, and most transparent bodies direct, and
that of the salts of iron inverse.
    It was natural to inquire whether any other magnetic salts, besides
those of iron, would not present analogous phaenomena.             I am not in
a position to give a certain opinion except upon the salts of nickel
and manganese; of these I have examined a certain number, such
as the sulphate, nitrate, and chloride of nickel, and the sulphate and
chloride of manganese; and I have ascertained that in solution they
possess a direct rotatory power, which is added to that of the water.
They present no difference therefore from the ordinary metallic salts.
I can say nothing certain as to the salts of chrome and cobalt : these
compounds have such a great colouring power that their solutions
must be very dilute if we wish to have them sufficiently transparent;
the influence of the dissolved salts is then very weak in comparison
with that of the solvent, and I have been unable to ascertain posi

          able physical law, that “the specific heats of simple bodies
 are   reciprocally   proportional to their atomic weights.” The
experiments on which they had established this law were not
 numerous, and many of them have been found to be contradictory,
 in consequence of the considerable changes which more exact
 analyses, and a more complete knowledgé of chemical compounds,
 have produced in the adopted atomic weights of some simple
bodies.      Nevertheless the numerous experiments which               made                  I

490           M. Regnault             on the Specific               Heat of Simple Bodies,
   To be convinced of this, it is sufficient to compare between
themselves the specific heats of some simple bodies taken at differ
ent points of the thermometric scale; it is immediately seen that
their relations change sensibly with the temperature; and as the
atomic weights remain the same, it is evident that the product
of the specific heat by the atomic weight may vary with the
temperature unequally in each case.
    In short, the specific heat of the same body is often very dif
ferent, according as it is estimated in the solid, liquid, or gaseous
 state.   Thus, while for                  all
                                   the solid simple bodies which         studied                          I

for chlorine and gaseous bromine, which show                       considerable                a
deviation. Further, the gases which follow Mariotte's law pretty
closely, maintain their calorific capacity sensibly constant                 dif                                  at

little influence on the results.
    The method of proceeding was as follows:—
    1. The variation of temperature A6, which the calorimeter
underwent from disturbing causes alone, was observed during
three minutes, the water being continually agitated by means of
a small stirrer which formed part of the apparatus.
    2. The calorimeter was placed rapidly under the oven, in
which the little basket containing the substance experimented
upon had been raised to a temperature accurately determined,
and about 100 degrees. The basket was then quickly lowered
into the water of the calorimeter, and this was then returned
to      its
        original position     front                  of

    I owe to the kindness of M. Fremy the osmium which has
 served for my experiments; the metal was in the form of spongy
 masses loosely aggregated, and of a bluish metallic lustre. The
 following are the results of three experiments:—

   The equivalent of osmium, according to Berzelius, is 1244-2,
which would give to osmic acid the formula OsO".         The pro
duct of the equivalent by   the specific heat we have found to be
38-109; it is therefore comprised within the two limits 36 and
41 which we have met with in other simple bodies.      Hence the
value found for the specific heat of osmium verifies the formula
which chemists usually assign to the compounds of this metal.
                                                       Rhodium.
   The rhodium on which I experimented formed part of the
beautiful display of MM. Desmoutis, Chapuis and Co., manu
facturers of platinum; it formed a simple forged cylinder, resem
bling in appearance metallic platinum. In the experiment of
determining           its  heat, the cylinder was attached simply
                                specific

 a    very fine steel wire, the calorific capacity which might                   of                  be

494      M. Regnault               on the Specific Heat                of Simple Bodies,
might arise from the presence of a small quantity                                          of foreign
metal, probably of iridium.
                                              Iridium.
  I have  already given, in my first memoir on the specific heats
of simple  bodies, some experiments on a specimen of iridium
which had been lent to me by M. de Meyendorff.          had found                     I
for the specific heat 0.03683, which, multiplied by the equivalent
generally adopted, 1233-2, gave 45-43. This number being far
too high,     I
             supposed that the metal was impure.
   The new specimen on which I experimented came from the Ex
hibition of MM. Desmoutis, Chapuis and Co.; it formed half of
a disc strongly aggregated by percussion, and weighed 509&r-21.
In the experiment the metal was attached by a fine steel wire.

    This value differs very little from that which found for the                 I
iridium of M. de Meyendorff. The product of the specific heat
by the atomic weight is 44-76, which is not comprised within
the limits of variation which we have observed in other simple
bodies.     This anomaly may be explained in two ways: either
 the metal is impure, or                      its
                                   atomic weight        inexact.     the    is                 If
 metal   isnot  pure,  which  appears  probable   from the low   density
 which I   found,     could only

 specific heat, since they have the same atomic weight.                                              It is
                                                                                                of of

   The product of this specific heat by the atomic weight 369-7,
usually given to nickel, is 41.00. It is probable that the specific
heat of pure nickel is considerably less, and that it does not
exceed 0-103.
                                                     Sodium.
    My former researches on the calorific capacity of the binary
compounds, and of the salts formed by the alkaline metals,
showed that it was necessary to divide by 2 the atomic weights
which have hitherto been adopted by chemists+.               Direct re
searches on metallic potassium have led me since then to the
same conclusiont.        It was of importance to verify this result
with metallic sodium, which is now procured so easily in a great
state of purity, and the manipulation of which does not present
so many difficulties as does that of potassium.         M. Liebig sent
me, about six years ago, a certain quantity of sodium which he
had had expressly prepared for this purpose in his laboratory at
Giessen; but my various occupations have until now prevented
me from making the experiment.                                  I
                                           made determinations on the
sodium of M. Liebig which had been perfectly well kept in her
metically sealed tubes, and on sodium recently prepared by M.
                                                        -
Rousseau.
    On breaking the tubes which contained the sodium of M. Liebig,
I  was able to confirm the fact that the metal presented two very
distinct physical conditions. In the one, the sodium was per
fectly malleable, could be bent in every direction without break
ing, and presented no trace of crystallization.        In the other, on
the contrary, the metal was extremely brittle, and exhibited in
its fracture pentagonal dodecahedra         the most perfect regularity.
                                                                of
These dodecahedra could be even detached from the mass with
the greatest ease, and presented then most perfect crystals, whose
diameter sometimes exceeded          millimetres. This difference was
                                                       3
owing probably         the presence
                              to          small quantity   ofpotassium.

   It will be seen from this Table that the rapidity diminished
regularly up to the third minute, as it ought to do according to
the law of Newton, for the quantity of heat lost is proportional
to the excess of the temperature of the body above the surround
ing medium. From the third minute, the heat disengaged by
solidification commenced to disturb the law of cooling; a remark
able point is observed on the curve, which is disturbed in its
former course up to the thirteenth minute at which the observa
tion is discontinued.   Hence when the potassium had attained
the  temperature  of 35 degrees in its cooling after liquefaction, it
had even then not entirely disengaged        latent heat    fusion*.    its                           of

    I did  not endeavour to determine directly the specific heat of
chloride of lithium from the quantity of heat acquired by the calo
rimeter charged with naphtha. I preferred to compare it directly
with that of chloride of sodium placed under exactly the same
conditions.     I cast therefore melted chloride of sodium in the
same mould, folded it in tinfoil, and determined its calorific ca
pacity with the calorimeter charged with the same quantity of
naphtha. The following is the table of results:—

    The specific heat of chloride of sodium was found to be 0.21401
 in my former experiments (Ann.            de Chim. et de Phys. 3rd series,
 vol. i. p. 154). By introducing this value into the two determi
 nations, the elements of which          I have just given, we can calcu
 late the value in water of the calorimeter charged with naphtha;
 we find thus,

    The two experiments on chloride of lithium, calculated                  with

    The product of this specific heat by the atomic weight 524.90,
 usually attributed to chloride of lithium, is 148-09.                   Now we
 have found for this product, with the chlorides R*               Cl*-
             Chloride of potassium          .    .    .   .   161:19

    The number obtained for chloride of lithium is obviously less;
but the difference is in that sense in which it might be presup
posed; for we may remark in general, that for bodies of the same

 chemical composition, the product of the specific heat by the atomic
 weight is the lower the less the atomic weight                                     is.
        Besides, for the chlorides  the formula       of                      R   Cl*, this product                  is—

                             thence concluded, that the formula

tains about 2 per cent. of tellurium; but this quantity is far too
small to modify the physical properties of the body. M. Salvétat

tion, the metallic character as decidedly as tellurium.
   Vitreous selenium may be maintained many hours at a tempera
ture of 90 degrees without undergoing the isomeric modification.
   Metallic selenium is a better conductor of heat than vitreous
selenium. This fact is easy of demonstration when the specific
heat is determined; with vitreous selenium, the time required
before the thermometer of the calorimeter attains its maximum
temperature is two or three times as long as withmetallic selenium.
   Some selenium, melted at a temperature of 300 degrees, was
thrown into very cold water; it solidified in large intertwined
threads, having a very hard and vitreous fracture. The substance
exhibited the same aspect as when allowed to cool in the air after
fusion.
   Vitreous selenium does not lose      characteristic properties by
                                                            its

   Hence at low temperatures the two isomeric modifications of
selenium have exactly the same calorific capacity. This result
is similar to that which     obtained with the two isomeric modiI
fications of phosphorus, ordinary phosphorus, and red phos.
phorus.     In two such different conditions, phosphorus showed
calorific capacities which were evidently equal (Ann. de Chim, et
de  Phys.  3rd series, vol. xxxviii. p. 129).
    Vitreous arsenious acid and opake arsenious acid also exhibit
no difference in their specific heats.       It is nevertheless remark
able that the enormous        disengagement      of heat which is mani
fested at the moment at which vitreous selenium is transformed
into metallic selenium, should not produce any change in                                                                   the

We may put A6= A6, 6 representing the excess of tempe

which the system obtains in 1 minute. To calculate the con

We may calculate from this formula the elevation of tempera
ture which the enclosure has given in each minute.
    From the 78th minute, when the system exceeds 100 degrees,
to the 92nd minute, when it is plunged into the water of the

   This elevation of temperature is less than that which we have
found by the first mode of calculation; but I shall show that it
is necessarily too little, for in the preceding calculation we have
assumed by inference, that at the moment at which the thermo
meter marked the maximum in the oven, and at which it was
plunged into the calorimeter, the molecular transformation was
complete.     But we know from the first experiment, that even
then the substance still continued to disengage heat, and we
allowed for that in our first calculation.

   In recapitulating, think we may conclude from these expe

an arc of flame passes the interval, and fuses electrodes present
ing twenty times the sectional area of the wire from which the
current is produced: the flame can at the same time be acted
upon by a permanent magnet in the same manner as the voltaic
arc.   This heating power appears to depend, not upon the quan
tity of electricity passing, but upon the resistance it can over
come; consequently the thermal effects disappear in vacuo, to be
reproduced upon the gradual admission of air or other resisting
media.

   As the directions of propagation of the transmuted rays depend
only on the circumstances of the disturbance, the new rays might,
consistently with this theory, be propagated only in directions
coinciding nearly with the direction of propagation of the original
    †, (5)
raWS.
              it might happen, consistently with the theory, that
light is not produced under the circumstances supposed in (4),
the values of A for the transmuted rays not falling within the
limits proper for visibility; or, that rays for which the values of
A do not fall within the limits of visibility give rise to visible rays.
                                                                                                be all

   As little did question that “in making experiments with the
spectrum, in order to neutralize, when possible, a prismatic colour
of given intensity by another prismatic colour, so as to produce
white, two points must be attended to : the place of the second
colour in the spectrum must be properly chosen, and the inten
sity of the light properly regulated;” for I thought        had ex                  I
plained theoretically in the paragraph marked (4), why one of
these points must be attended to, and in the paragraph marked
(7) why the other must be attended to. There is also another
fact which my theory embraces, viz. that when two given colours
are mixed, the gradations of colour obtained by varying the pro
portions depend on the source of the light. Thus with sunlight
the gradations of a mixture of yellow and blue pass from yellow
through diluted yellow, white, and diluted blue, to blue; whereas
in a mixture of yellow and blue from certain sources, the grada
tions pass through green.

light.”      It is on the change of the values of m, m', &c. that the
difference between the composition of prismatic colours and the
composition of the colours of substances depends.
    I  willingly admit, on Professor Stokes's authority, that “ab
sorption is not always, nor even generally, accompanied by epi
 polic dispersion.”      Speaking of “certain absorbing media,”         I
said that    “absorption   generates in greater or less degree epipolic
 dispersion,” meaning, as already explained, internal dispersion.
    I  quite concur in referring the natural colours of bodies to
absorption. This doctrine I taught long since in optical lectures,
and never doubted of its truth.
    From the foregoing consideration of Prof. Stokes's Remarks, it
 appears that there is no material difference in our views except on
two points: the real character of the phaenomenon presented by
 certain absorbing substances which has been ascribed to subject
ive illusion, and the question of fact whether blue and yellow
lights in any instance produce a green compound.

           LXVIII.     On the Allotropic Conditions      of Sulphur.
                           By G. MAGNUs        #.
                             has recently shownt that sulphur com
          bined with a fat or an oil, dissolves in sulphur and imparts
 to it an extremely strong colour, so much so that one part of
 tallow heated with 3000 parts of sulphur furnishes an intensely
 red mass.       I have repeated these experiments, and have con
 vinced myself that not only the fats, but also a great number of
 other substances produce a similar action. Besides the fats, the
 following substances are particularly distinguished for the strong
 colour they produce:—stearic acid, paraffine, war, spermaceti,
fossil war (ozocerite); colophony, mastic, gutta percha, and
 caoutchouc produce a somewhat less strong colour; and amber,
 sugar, starch, and cotton colour still weaker, but even then
 intensely.      The latter only exercise a colouring action when
 brought into the sulphur heated to 300° C. and well mixed
 with it.
     Some of these substances may have still contained small
 quantities of fat; of many of them this can scarcely be main
 tained, but it may be thought that they have acquired a
 colouring action from having been touched with greasy fingers.
 In order to meet any objection of this kind,               I placed some
 crystals of white sugar-candy in distilled water, and when the

external layer was dissolved, dried them in porous paper, and
without touching them with the fingers, introduced them into
the hot sulphur which had been purified by two distillations.
Even this coloured the sulphur.
   The colour which is imparted to sulphur by sugar, starch,
cotton, &c., is indeed more brown than red, but its solution in
bisulphide of carbon shows always the pure red colour.
   From this it is clear, that other than fatty substances colour
sulphur, and the red colour of sulphur cannot serve as an
evidence of the presence of a fat.     It appears that very various
substances so   decompose   at a higher  temperature, that a certain
constituent of them unites with the sulphur and forms with it
the strongly colouring body.                                I
                                       have, however, not yet been

  But the soluble part of soft sulphur contains still two different
modifications of sulphur.   For if a part of the bisulphide of
carbon be distilled off from the solution, and the liquid be then
allowed to cool, octahedral sulphur crystallizes out.                this be                  If
removed from the liquid and a fresh quantity of bisulphide of
carbon be distilled off, so that on cooling some more octahedral
sulphur is obtained, there remains, after repeating this operation,
a tough mass which can be drawn out in threads.                   This still
contains sulphur.        If left to itself the bisulphide of carbon
evaporates, and the sulphur separates as a crummy mass.                 This
sulphur was manifestly still more soluble in bisulphide of car
bon than octahedral sulphur, for it separated after the latter.
Notwithstanding this, after it has been once separated from the
bisulphide of carbon, it does not again dissolve in                       the                 it.   If

   Whether in the change of the soft sulphur into the hard
the crummy sulphur contained in it is changed into insoluble
or soluble sulphur, I must for the present leave undecided.            It
might indeed be believed that this could be settled by comparing
the quantity of insoluble sulphur contained in the soft, with the
quantity of the same present after it has become hard. But, as
is seen from the present experiments, such determinations cannot
be executed with sufficient accuracy; partly because the inso
luble sulphur from               its
                          porous condition easily retains some bisul
phide    ofcarbon; but chiefly because           cannot      certain,    we                      be               in
spite   of    all
              precaution, that the hardened sulphur under inves
tigation reaches the water        exactly the same temperature, and
                                                 at
is cooled under   exactly   the same circumstances,         thus      the                     is            in
same state      the soft sulphur corresponding

                         has lately made a very important step in the
       synthesis of organic compounds. Some time ago he showed
that by bringing olefiant gas in contact with the elements of
water, alcohol was formed.          He has now shown that olefiant gas
may be produced by the union of
                                                                of its

  532                 M. Wurtz        on a new Series           of Alcohols.
     The various carburetted hydrogens obtained in                              these experi
 ments were combined with bromine.      From                            their respective bro
 mine compounds they may be liberated in a pure state by being
 heated in a sealed tube in contact with metallic copper, water,
 and iodide of potassium.                  If
                              the copper be left out, the hydruret
 of the carburetted hydrogen is obtained; thus from bromide of
olefiant gas, C*H*Br”, the gas C*H"; from bromide of propylene,
C*H*Br”, the gas C6H4 are obtained.
   From these facts of the relation of carburetted hydrogen to
alcohol on the one hand, and of the relation of alcohol to other
organic bodies on the other, the complete synthesis of a vast
number of organic bodies may be considered as possible.
   Wurtz+ describes a new series of alcohols. The compound
aethers,it is known, are formed by the union of one atom of an
acid with one atom of alcohol. Berthelot has found, on the other
 hand, that glycerine unites with three atoms of an acid to form
the neutral fatty bodies. There is the same relation between
alcohol and glycerine as there is between a monobasic acid and
a tribasic acid.          If
                      spirit of wine is a monoatomic alcohol, gly
cerine  may   be considered as a triatomic alcohol.        From these
views Wurtz considered that there must be a series of inter
mediary combinations, whose molecule would be diatomic, and
would correspond to the bibasic acids.       By combining with two
equivalents of acid, they would form compounds intermediate
between the aethers and the neutral fatty bodies. Wurtz has suc
ceeded in forming by way of synthesis such an alcohol, which
he names glycol.      It is the type of a series, for the method by
which it is formed is susceptible of a general application.
    By acting on acetate of silver with iodide of aethylene, C*H*I*,
a body  is obtained the formation of which is expressed by                                          the

possess a greater fixity, a less fluidity, and a stronger tend
ency to assume the solid form, although these tendencies are not
so marked as to excite attention.    The compounds are decom
posed, under the prolonged influence of the alkalies, with the
formation of mannitane, or anhydrous mannite, C*H" O”, which
differs from mannite by one equivalent of water, and is trans
formed into mannite by prolonged contact with water.           Manni
tane is also formed by heating mannite to 200°C.
    With acetic acid mannite forms only one compound, a bitter
liquid substance; the compound of mannite with butyric acid is                                 in

By the action of bromide of phosphorus a large number of brom
hydrines are produced; a class of bodies consisting of glycerine
which has assimilated hydrobromic acid, and lost the elements
of water in various proportions. Of these, the principal are mono

THE“Elements      communications were read:—
                   of a Mathematical Theory of Elasticity.”      By
Professor William Thomson, F.R.S.
  This paper consists of two parts: Part I. on Stresses and Strains;
Part II. on the Mechanical Conditions of Relation between Stresses
and Strains experienced by an Elastic Solid.
   Part I.-The terms Stress and Strain are used in accordance with
the valuable definitions by which they were first distinctively intro
duced into the Theory of Elasticity by Mr. Rankine"; with only
this deviation; that instead of defining a stress as the reactive force
exerted by an elastic body when in a condition of strain, the author
of the present paper defines stress as “a definite external application -
of force to a body.”
   Various well-known theorems regarding the geometrical relations of
the displacements among the parts of a body in a state of strain, and
the geometrical representation of stresses and strains are enunciated,
and briefly demonstrated, for the sake of convenience. A mode of
expressing in absolute measure the magnitude of a stress or a strain,
which the author believes to be new, is laid down nearly in the follow
ing terms. The amount of work done by a stress applied to a body
of unit volume, while acquiring a strain of the same type as the stress,
is measured by the product of the magnitude of the stress into the
magnitude of the strain.
    When a stress and a strain are of the same type, they are said to
be concurrent;               or,
                            directly opposed, they are said
                               if                                        negatively                to    be
concurrent.      When stress and             strain are       any different types,     of
                                                          or a

volume acquiring the strain, divided               the product      the magnitude                   a
of   the stress into the magnitude                        of
                                             the strain. The measure            per                                 of
fect concurrence         therefore

the weight of a cubic inch of water weighed in a certain manner.
The Commissioners, however, in their Report dated December 21,
 1841, decline to recommend the adoption of these provisions for the
 following reasons: “Since the passing of the said Act it has been
 ascertained that several elements of reduction of the pendulum expe
riment therein referred to are doubtful or erroneous. It is evident,
 therefore, that the course prescribed by the Act would not necessarily
reproduce the length of the original yard. It appears also that the
 determination of the weight of a cubic inch of water is yet doubtful
 (the greatest difference between the best English, French, Austrian,
Swedish          and   Russian   determinations            being about          rººm    of the
whole weight, whereas the mere operation of weighing may be
performed to the accuracy of rººm of the whole weight).               Several
measures, however, exist, which were most carefully compared with
the former standard yard; and several metallic weights exist which
were most accurately compared with the former standard pound;
and by the use of these the values of the original standards can be
respectively restored without sensible error.            And we are fully per
suaded   that, with reasonable precautions,       it will always be possible
to provide for the accurate restoration of standards by means of
material copies which have been carefully compared with them,
more securely than by experiments referring to natural constants.”
   At the end of the Travaux de la Commission pour fixer les Me
sures et les Poids de l'Empire de Russie, Professor Kupffer has col
lected the results of observations made in France, England, Sweden,
Austria and Russia for finding the weight of a given volume of
water. The resulting values of the weight of an English cubic inch
of water in a vacuum at 62°Fahr., expressed in doli, of which
 22504.86 make a kilogramme, are as follows:—
           French observations . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  368-365
           English observations. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  368'542
                 Swedish observations       . . . . . . . . . .     ..    368°474
                 Austrian observations      . . . . .   . . .   . . ..    368°237
                 Russian observations. .    . . . .   . . . .   . . . .   368.361
Assuming the Russian observations to be the best, as they probably
are, it will be seen that a troy pound deduced according to the method
prescribed by the Act, would be 2.829 grains too heavy; while, if the
Austrian observations had been accepted as the best, the troy pound
would have been 4.707 grains too heavy. On the other hand, it
was possible to recover the weight of the lost standard in air to
within a fraction of 0.001 grain, by means of the troy pounds which
had been compared with           it,
                                and could     easily brought together for

date 1758 were     constructed,   along  with the lost standard, by
Mr.  Harris, Assay  Master of the Mint.     These were referred to at
the suggestion of Professor Schumacher, in the hope of arriving at a
knowledge of the volume of the lost standard, which, unfortunately,
had never been determined by weighing it in water.         For, as long
as the volume of the lost standard remains    unknown,   the weight of
the air displaced by                 it,
                           and, consequently,      absolute weight,              its                      is

   The Commissioners for the Restoration of the Standards of Weight
and Measure, in their Report, dated December 21, 1841, recom
mended that the avoirdupois pound of 7000 grains be adopted
instead of the troy pound of 5760 grains, as the New Parliamentary
Standard of Weight, and that the new standard and four copies of it
be constructed of platinum.
    In accordance with this recommendation, five weights were made
by Mr. Barrow, a little in excess of 7000 grains, of platinum pre
pared by Messrs. Johnson and Cock. The form of these pounds is
 that of a cylinder, nearly 1:32 inch in height and 1:15 inch in dia
 meter, with a groove round        the middle      which        it,

  By the good offices of M. Arago, permission was obtained from
the French Government to compare the new English weights with
the standard kilogramme of platinum, known as the kilogramme des
Archives, and which will be denoted by the letter 3. The compa
rison was made by two perfectly independent methods.                 In one of
these 3 was compared sixty times with PC No. 1 + PC No. 2 +
auxiliary weight B+ a platinum weight V of nearly 192:436 grains.

 K+L4-B+W,         is subject to some uncertainty, arising from the cir
 cumstance that the platinum, of which A, B, C, F were made, had
 been very badly prepared and contained cavities filled with some
 hygroscopic substance which rendered the weight of B slightly
 variable, according to the greater or less amount of moisture present
 in the atmosphere. According to these observations, the kilogramme
 des Archives = 15432-34816 grains.
    By the observations of Schumacher and Steinheil on the ratio of
 the weight of 3 to that of Sp, subject to an uncertainty of 0.00139
 grain, on account of an error of the press, and the comparison of S
 with PS, the weight of 3 is either 15432-34873 or 15432.35012
 grains, of which PS contains 7000.

       I heartily agree with Mr. Mallet in the opinion he expresses in
    his concluding sentence, that it is far from “desirable to add to the
    already numerous names of stilbite-like minerals;” and the sincerity
    of his expressed opinion is most strikingly evinced by his refraining
-   from naming the substance till time should have tested        specific                             its
    individuality.

such instruments is merely the relative state of activity of the whole
or of a portion of the charge, in a given direction, taken in terms of
a given statical force, either attractive or repulsive, and by the instru
 mentality of which we may occasionally infer the quantity of electricity
 in operation at the instant of discharge. I further show, by reference
 to investigations prior to those of Dr. Riess, that the diminished
 effect of the electrical discharge observed in accumulating and dis
 charging a given quantity of electricity from an increased surface,
 taken in parts, as in the case of extending a battery by the addition
 of other jars, arises solely from the resistance we thereby introduce
 into the circuit of discharge, and not from any change of tension in
 the accumulated electricity itself; and in confirmation of this, I call
 Dr. Riess's attention to the fact, as a crucial experiment, that when
 the given quantity of electricity is accumulated on an undivided sur
face, that is to say, when it is collected on the extended surface of a
 single large jar, for example, instead of an extension of surface by
 means of several lesser jars, the surfaces being in each case alike
 extended,—or when collected on two separate jars of such unequal
 surfaces and magnitudes as to give electrometer indications of ex
 tremely different intensities,     then no change takes place in the
 heating effect of the discharge; consequently the mere extension of
  the surface of the battery, taken alone, has really no influence on
  the result; and Dr. Riess's law of electrical heat falls to the ground.
  Now to this experiment Dr. Riess makes no reply.
     It would be easy for me to animadvert effectively upon all Dr.
Riess has advanced in his last communication.                  I
                                                      am not certainly
open to the censure of having taken Haldane's method of measuring

quantity as my own; and in confirmation of this beg to refer to my
paper in the Transactions of the Plymouth Institution, also to page
358, Phil. Mag. vol. xi., referred to by Dr. Riess himself.      I cer
tainly resorted to the method at first, without being aware that the
same method had been already employed by Haldane; but I was
very cautious in claiming any precedence, or stating, as Dr. Riess
has done (Pogg. Ann. vol.           xl.   p.
                                  324), that   was the “first    apply
