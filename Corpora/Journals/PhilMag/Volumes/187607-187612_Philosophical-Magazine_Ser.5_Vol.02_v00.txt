chemical substances are valued not for what they are con
ceived as being, but as doing—that the most important ques

behave with this              that reagent?
                                        or           appears       me that          It                        to
what        chemical substance does depends very much upon
              a
what          it   is,
                and that, although we are obliged              study these                               to
questions           certain extent

fixed conditions, from a mixture of certain weights of the two
former a weight of the third equal to the sum of these two
weights is invariably produced.    In such a statement nothing
is said of the homogeneity or    non-homogeneity     of the three
substances: whatever views may be held on this subject, the
                                                         º
fact of the production of the third substance by the mutual

action of the other two is undeniable; and this fact is sym
bolically expressed in the equation we have been considering.
    Of course chemists are generally in the habit of conceiving
that water is made up of oxygen and hydrogen, that these
                               .
substances exist in some way in the new substance formed by
their action upon one another; and the equation will bear this
meaning.     On the other hand, it is at least possible, in the
light of Mr. Lockyer's recent spectral                 to imagine
that hydrogen         oxygen  may  themselves be    split  up into
simpler substances (just as water is split up into hydrogen
and oxygen); but if this be the case the equation may remain
unaltered: it expresses a truth, although probably not the
whole truth.     But we believe that                        tell us
much more about the composition of substances than the mere
 fact that certain weights of two bodies produce a certain
weight of a third; this part of the subject, however,         shall                I
defer to a later portion of the paper.
    7.    If
          we are to regard chemical substances chiefly in the
light of what they do, it may, apparently, be urged that our
ordinary formulae are of little use to us—that, inasmuch as
these formulae are based upon statical ideas, they are useless,
or   allbut useless, when we come        deal with questions
                                                         to                                 of
kinetics.
    If we investigate chemical formulae, especially     their more       is in
 recent outcome.     think we shall see that this
                               I                          mistaken       a
 idea.

might almost have been arrived at by a study of structural

in the energy of these hydrocarbons before and after the per
formance of such operations; and inasmuch as we can ascend
the series by a repetition of the same operation, we should
 expect that the change in energy, whatever it may be, would
be regular, and would be related in some way to the regular
 change in chemical constitution.                            -

 actions by which these substances are produced, and by which
 they may be transformed into other substances, but with the
 formulae of the elementary bodies there is likewise associated
information of a similar nature.
    Mendelejeff” has pointed out that if the symbols of the
 elements be arranged in the order of their combining weights,
 beginning with the smallest, the elements may be divided into
 groups and series, the members of which are characterized by
 a gradation of properties, which gradation is closely related to
 the increase of the combining number.          Each group possesses
 many properties in common, among these the power of
 forming oxides and other salts of similar type being very
 marked.      We have here, then, a possible arrangement of che
 mical symbols such that, from           position  its  regular series,

monly accepted meaning of the phrase. That amount of a
#.      radicle which will displace unit weight of hydrogen
  om an acid may not be that amount which will do some
other kind of work, just as that amount of hay which will
displace 1 cubic foot of air in the railway truck is not that
amount which will do the work of an equal volume of bullion
in so far as exchange is concerned, although it does accomplish
the same amount of work when we define the unit of work as
“replacing 1 cubic foot of air.” Dr. Mills has introduced an
unfortunate word by using the term value.
   15. If we for a moment agree to view this matter of valency
in the light of the molecular theory of matter, and of some
recent researches of Michaelis and other chemists, the ex
planation given of the relation between valency and general
chemical “value” would be something as follows.        W. may
imagine the molecule of a chemical element performing a
certain vibration in a definite period of time; during the
performance of this vibration there are certain positions at
tained by the molecule, at each of which it is so situated as to
be capable of exercising chemical action upon other molecules.
The number of these positions is the valency of the molecule.
But we can suppose that the total force exercised is not
uniformly distributed, so that an unequal amount is capable of
being exercised at each position; hence the valency may vary
according to the reactions in which the molecule takes part.
Again, it is clear that the total force exercised will not neces
sarily bear a simple relation to the number of positions in
which the molecule may be capable of exercising this force;
hence the general affinity (or chemical “value
      may     small,               its
                                 valency     large,
                                                                    *

useful means      classification, and that we are fully entitled

devise an entirely new system of notation, but only to modify
the existing system so as to include the new knowledge.
Our present notation is founded on facts; it does not neces
sarily involve any theory, only a generalization, as Dr. Wright
has well pointed out; hence it is not to be thrown aside
because at some future time it may not adequately express all
our knowledge. Let us wait till that knowledge is gained,
and then try to so modify our notation as to symbolize the
knowledge.
    But if we should not find it possible to do this, and it
becomes necessary to have a new system of notation, it will
be still a system which has been developed from, not a system
which has overthrown, the old.
    17.  I  have so far endeavoured to put forward reasons for
believing that our existing system of notation symbolizes, to
a certain extent, both the substances which take part in, and
the final products of a chemical action, and also some of the
relations existing between these substances and the changes
of energy which accompany the action. In so far as the
latter changes are concerned, it must, however, be confessed
that our ignorance is great, and that when more knowledge is
gained it will be necessary for us to modify our notation so as
to express this knowledge symbolically.
    I  have sought to show that our equations represent the
initial and final distributions of matter during a reaction
symbolized, that they imply changes of energy, that in the
case of dissected or structural formulae we can trace a close
connexion between such changes of energy and the formulae,
and that in valency we have at any rate the rudiments of a
method by which the power of doing work of different sub
stances may be compared.
    18. On looking at such an equation as
                     Zn + H2 SO, = ZnSO, + H2,
         5.º.
one might imagine that the weight of zinc sulphate expressed
by the
tion of that   quantity of
                           would be at once produced on the addi
                           sulphuric acid represented by H, SO, to
Zn    parts by  weight  of zinc, and that, were a somewhat larger
quantity of acid to be added to the same quantity of zinc, the
action would not be modified. The equation appears to convey
this meaning; but the meaning is erroneous. Chemical action
 involves greater or less quantities of time; and it is certainly
influenced by the total mass of the acting substances, as also
         #.
 by the mass of the resultants, and by the relation which these
 bear at any moment to the generating substances.
    19.            we have not been able to express such facts as

10           Mr. M. M. P. Muir                     on Chemical Notation.
these   symbolically.      And at present it would be useless to
attempt such a task; we are but on the threshold of such
inquiries; we have been so long (perhaps too long) occupied
with gathering together facts concerning the substances pro
duced by chemical action that we have had little time to devote
to a closer study of the action itself in                         its
                                                   various phases. Such
study will form        part      the        of
                                     chemistry     that        be, and will
                                                                                is

without doubt           rich      results   in  the  highest ofimportance.
But    granted   that we cannot now           express    the process                                          of   a

                   saying, that those substances which we call
chemical elements, when they react together                            form              so    as       to

the formation of chemical equations, or in the general methods
of chemical research. The meaning of the words “atomic
theory,” and the distinction between the generalization and
convention upon which our chemical notation is really based,
and the hypothesis upon which it is so often said to be based,
are so ably pointed out by Dr. Wright in the paper referred
to *, and in a previous paper, that # need do no more than
refer any one who wishes for clear ideas on the subject to         -
those papers.
   22. Premising, then, that chemical notation does not assume
the existence of “atoms,” but admitting that if the atomic
hypothesis were granted the existing chemical notation would
readily adapt itself to the necessities of an atomic notation, let
me pass on to consider some of the reasons which appear to
me to favour the adoption of the molecular theory of matter.
“A    molecule may be defined as a small mass of matter, the
parts of which do not part company during the excursions
which the molecule makes when the body to which it belongs
is hot.” This quotation from Prof. Clerk Maxwell’s ‘Treatise
 on the Theory of Heat,” gives a clear definition of what is
 meant by the term molecule.          The theory in question sup
 poses that any given piece of matter consists of a definite
 number of molecules, that                     all
                                    the molecules     the same sub            of

 may consist      “several distinct portions
                       of                           matter held to          of
 gether      by
             chemical bonds,” and, finally, that “the molecules
of  all bodies are          in
                         state   acontinual agitation.”

 to use Prof. Maxwell's words, “that after we have divided
 body into    acertain finite number        constituent parts called
                                                              of

 be  effected either by the motion                         of
                                                material particles from the
 hot   body        to
                 the  body   which receives the heat,               the motion       or     by
of   some medium which fills the space between the body giving
 out and the body receiving heat; hence the particles                        the                        on
  outer surface             body

must be the motion of exceedingly small parts: hence arises
the conception of molecules, i.e. of small parts which remain
intact during the movements which each part makes when
the mass of the body to which it belongs is hot.
    28. Again, the molecular theory is in accord with known facts
concerning diffusion.                       If
                                   two gases be arranged in distinct
strata, it is found that in a short time the presence of that gas
which was at first confined entirely to the lower stratum is
perceptible in the upper stratum, and vice versä ; further, it is
found that if a stratum of gas be issuing through another gas
which is at rest, the movement of the former tends to commu
nicate itself to the latter, which, in                            its
                                                     turn, reacts upon the
moving gas, tending            bring   to      rest. Again,
                                                      is it          the upper          if
                gas             be

nicated       the lower stratum.             We have here, then, three
kinds    of
          diffusion—diffusion            matter, diffusion
                                                      of           momentum,        of
and diffusion        energy. As we have learned

must be smaller than the average velocity of the molecules in
a gas; nevertheless this does not prevent us from believing
that the velocity of individual liquid molecules may be greater
than that of individual gaseous molecules.            Supposing that
liquid molecules of such great velocities are moving at the
surface of the liquid from the liquid, they will tend to escape
from the liquid into the surrounding vapour.           Supposing that
a gaseous molecule of great velocity strikes the surface of the
liquid, it will tend to become entangled in the liquid. Hence
we shall have evaporation of the liquid and condensation of
the vapour going on continuously.

spectroscopy are in keeping with the molecular theory—that
the vibration of each molecule may well be supposed to com
municate itself to the ether in a regular manner, that an                                          in
crease in density of a gas will cause the introduction of irre
gular motion among the molecules, and hence the appearance
of a more or less continuous spectrum; but, for a considera

                                             of molecules are there
fore assumed to be represented by our chemical symbols.                 In
order to deduce such weights with accuracy, we are obliged to
determine the relative densities of the substances in the form
of gas, and to assume the truth of the law of Gay-Lussac or
of Avogadro.        But this law can be deduced from the mole
cular theory of matter; hence, when we speak of “molecular
weights,” we assume the truth of the molecular theory; and                                                    I

must regard chemical action as constantly taking place.         To
use Dr. Mills's words (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1876), “ Chemical
action can begin, because it never has ceased.”
    38. Suppose, however, that the molecules of a given sub
stance (A) come into contact with those of another substance,
(B), and that these substances are capable of exercising chemi
cal action upon each other, we shall have an interchange of
“atoms” between the molecules A and B; at any moment,
therefore, we shall have four kinds of molecules present—A and
B, the generating substances, and A’ and B', the products. We
shall have an exchange of atoms taking place between A and
B, an exchange of atoms taking place between A' and B' (and
possibly an exchange of atoms taking place between A and A',
and between B and B’ &c.). Now the       #.    condition of atomic
distribution  among   the  reacting  molecules will depend chiefly
upon the rate of atomic interchange; if more changes take place
between the atoms constituting the molecules A and B than
between the atoms constituting the molecules A' and B' in
equal times, it is clear that an increase in the number of the
molecules A<U+017F> and B' will take place; and conversely, if more
atomic changes take place between A' and B than between A.
and B in equal times, the number of A and B molecules will
increase; in other words, the decomposition of A and B will
cease.    Again, if by any means it is possible to remove the
newly formed molecules A<U+017F> and B' from the sphere of action,
    .
then the atomic interchange represented by the equation
A+    B-A’   + B will proceed until A and B have entirely
disappeared, and the sum of the weights of A' and B' is equal
to      original sum of the weights of A and B. Such an action
as this very generally takes place in ordinary chemical reac
tions. For instance, the equation
                BaCl, + Naz SO, = 2NaCl + BaSO,
represents the final atomic arrangement of the molecules taking
part in the reaction; but we must imagine that a secondary
 reaction, symbolized thus,
              2 NaCl + Ba SO. = Naz SO, + BaCl2,
 also takes place, but only to a very limited extent, because the
 molecule BaSO, is removed from the sphere of action almost
 as quickly as it is produced.     It is true, as has been urged,
 that the equation }. +H, SO, =Zn SO, +H, has never been
 rigorously realized in practice. Why? Because, before the
 atomic interchanges symbolized are completed, so many mole
 cules having the composition ZnSO, have been formed, and
 have not been removed, that the completion of the change be
 comes impossible.     Remove the products of the action, how

 in the form of the energy of the reacting molecules: potential
 will be converted into kinetic energy, or vice versä. Such
 changes will be marked by absorption or by evolution of heat.
 These energy-changes will certainly bear a close relation to
 the general character of the products of the reaction. Thus

in accord with the molecular theory to        suppose  that there is
taking place so rapid an atomic interchange among the mole
 cules both of hydrogen and of chlorine that when these two sub
 stances are brought together, under suitable conditions, it is easy
 for the momentarily dissociated atoms to combine together so
 as to form the new molecules of hydrochloric acid, and that
 when these are formed there is not so rapid an atomic ex
 change taking place among them as there is among the mole
 cules of the generating substances.         The general result of
 such an   action, so far as change  of energy  is concerned, would
 therefore be an evolution of heat.      Indeed the fact that it is
 possible to completely carry out the reaction symbolized above,
appears to me to be in perfect keeping with the fact of the
 evolution of heat which is noticed during the the reaction; for
 if the number of atomic exchanges between the products
 HCl HCl were as great as those between the generating mole
 cules H2 Cl, in equal times, the decomposition would cease
before the equation was completely realized.         But the actual
 result points to the conclusion (on the assumption that the
 molecular theory is true) that there are less rapid intramole
 cular movements occurring in the case of the molecules HCl
 HCl than in the case of the molecules H2 Cl2–in other words,
that some portion of the initial molecular motion has disap
 peared.     But inasmuch as the total energy of the system is
 supposed the same, the energy which has disappeared in one
 form must have reappeared in another; it has reappeared as
heat.
    42. Lastly, as to isomerism.     So called isomeric bodies un
dergo different reactions; they are produced by different
reactions, &c.: these facts may be expressed irrespective of
any theory as to their cause, by means of structural or dissected
formulae. It has been supposed that isomerism is to be ex
  lained by imagining that the atoms are differently arranged
in isomeric molecules.        Again, it has been supposed that
isomerism is to be     explained by granting that isomeric bodies
are endowed with varying amounts of energy, that in the for
mation of these bodies different quantities of energy change
form, and that, conversely, the various reactions noticed with
isomeric substances are to be traced to different degrees of
conversion of one form of energy into another.             Dr. Mills
(loc. cit.) says, “to measure, both in quality and in quantity,
the energy associated with each isomeric substance, is to give
a complete account of the phenomenon of isomerism.” Not, it
seems to me, to give a complete dynamical account of the phe
nomenon of isomerism;         for it is only when we explain a
phenomenon as a “change in the configuration and motion of

a material system,” that we give a                                  complete dynamical expla
nation of that phenomenon. If Isomerism depends on changes
of potential energy, we must remember, to quote Prof. Clerk
Maxwell (Treatise on Heat, p. 283, 1st edit.), “that potential
energy depends essentially on the relative positions of the
parts of the system in which it exists, and that potential ener
cannot be transformed in any way without some change of the
relative position of those parts.”
   Hence            I
            think that the energy theory of isomerism is not
altogether inconsistent with the position-theory, and that both
meet with their fullest development in terms of the molecular
theory of matter.
   43. I have thus attempted to show that our ordinary che
mical notation is founded on facts, that it gathers together and
symbolizes a great many phenomena, that it does not neces
sarily imply the acceptance of any theory as to the constitu
tion of matter, but that it receives       fullest meaning when      its
viewed     the  light
                in        the molecularoftheory.      have further                     I

chemical notation, but have expressed       belief that when the       a

                                         º
specimens procured in Switzerland.      The crystals proved to
be full of striae; but notwithstanding this, the appearance of
the bands is substantially perfect when the line of vision co
incides pretty closely with the axis. This is an observation
worth noting; for it seems              that most of the Swiss
quartz is so striated as to make it useless for many purposes,
but that the striated structure is so situated as not to affect
vision in the direction of the axis.               I
                                               possess some fine Swiss
crystals with well-developed hemihedral faces, which present
external markings similar to those on the crystals which
proved striated: if such as these can be used for the present
purpose, the expense of perfect crystals of the requisite size
may be avoided ; for any one can pick up in Switzerland for
a few francs large and fine specimens of this kind.
   The small instrument of Swiss quartz is mounted at the end
of a tube 10 inches long with a small Nicol's prism interposed
between it and the eye.        It gives, with polarized mean yellow
light, three complete bands, and already forms a very useful
and sensitive polariscope for ordinary purposes.
   By reducing to millimetres, taking M. rotation of the mean
yellow ray at 24° for 1 millim., and remembering that a
parallelopiped of this kind made up of two opposite quartz
wedges exerts a rotatory effect due to twice                        its
                                                          depth, we can

to left-handed rotation, and the bands appear to move to the

move from the right-handed quartz to the left-handed one,

     Inwhite light, as the breadth of one band is different for
each colour, and the rotation of 180° in either the incident
polarization or the analyzer displaces every colour through

   We should expect such a polarization to be insensible; and
that it is so is confirmed by the observation of the setting
sun with the polariscope which I have succeeded in making.
No trace of polarization is to be seen in the sun's light.
   Let us see what the positive polarization at the neutral
}.oint will be if we compute it on the supposition that it arises
      the simplest case of diffraction, as is most probably the
Case.
   Let A, B be the amplitudes which would produce the                         in
the polarization there is
                           2 — R2

                                  and put   = tan pa. Then  º
the polarization of the same components looked at in a                      direc
tion forming an angle a with the line to the sun is
                      A* (1–cos'a)—B sin” a                     .

 In the sky b, is generally from 20° to 25°; and putting
R=45°–4, we find for R values between 19 and 2°.
   These values are so much larger than that due to horizontal
astronomical refraction that it seems impossible that the two
can compensate each other at the neutral points.
   We are thus thrown back on the original speculation of
Arago, that the horizontal polarization in the neighbourhood
of the horizon is due to the effect of light reflected from the
atmospheric regions surrounding the observed point.         It is
clear that this is capable of furnishing an explanation ; for
the light diffused from sources in a line with the observer
|.
would not be specially polarized by diffraction at the observed
        while that from sources to the right and left would be
  orizontally polarized, as the plane of source, point, and ob
server would be in the mean horizontal.     But it does not seem
practicable to establish any definite theory of this kind. The
principal interest of this horizontal polarization and    effects     its
would appear     to   beconnexion with the meteorological con

    10. The sum of Uranus's mean and Earth's secular peri
helion vector radii = 20.0158.          The importance of Earth's
  osition, the near approximation of this sum to the cardinal
 ight-oscillation (9), and the indications of a somewhat shorter
major axis for the inner meteors of the November stream
encourage us to look for still further evidences of continuing
nebular activity in our own orbit as well as in that of Saturn.
If  Earth and Uranus were once parts of an elliptical ring, or
meteor-current, with Earth sharing Uranus's present maxi
mum secular eccentricity (.077.965), Earth, Jupiter, Uranus,
and Sun were connected by the following equation :-Modu
lus=252 x the square of Jupiter's mean radius vector x the
time of revolution at secular perihelion (1922035) of a mean
proportional radius between Earth and Sun (1 : V214,86);--
  square of Earth's radius × 1 year).         This value of modulus

  17. Jupiter and Sun thus appear to be companion consti
tuents of a binary star; and the point of primitive rupture
should be sought at the secular-perihelion centre of gravity.
Bodies falling towards that point, on approaching Sun, are
subject to a force of about 1048 towards Sun, and 1049 towards
the slowly moving common centre of gravity. There are
therefore two nodal points, with the least resistance to motion
nearly midway
                     (...) between them.                       If Sun   is gaseous, as
Hunt, Faye, and others have supposed, there should hence
arise linear oscillations of 2 × 2r synchronous with the circular
oscillations of 27tr. The corona may perhaps be due to such
radial oscillations.
     18. The 15th accordance gives for the mass                     of Sun-i-Jupiter,
1049.875–2=1047-875;          the 17th, 1049.871–2=1047-874,
Bessel's estimate being 1047-879-1-235.
   19. The discrepancy between the two astronomical estimates
for the velocity of light seems to have arisen from ignorance
of the intranodal oscillation. Delambre, from his discussion
of more than 1000 eclipses of Jupiter's first satellite", esti
mated the time of light-passage from Sun to Earth at 493-198
seconds; Struve, from the phenomena of aberration, at 497-827
seconds.    If the time of traversing 212.86 solar radii is 493-198,
the time for 214.86 r should be 497-831, which differs from
Struve's value by less than rºoo of 1 per cent.

                                                 expression for two poles A
and B in any bounded plate.                 It   may always be written in the

where Q is a numerical quantity which depends on the general
form of the boundaries of the plate, and on the position of the
poles with respect to those boundaries; while c is a number
which depends only on that part of the boundary which is infi
nitely near a pole. As long as the poles are not placed on the
edge of the plate, c=1 and is unaffected by any change in the
boundary ; but if either pole is placed on the edge, the angle
on which it is placed determines c, -the general law being
that   if A is on an angle         #, and Bonan angle               !,        then   c=m-n.

(When both poles are inside the plate, both angles equal 27,
and therefore c-1, as stated above.)
  It is unnecessary to prove this rule formally ; but it is a con

strengths in the unlimited sheet must be in the ratio of 2m : 2n,

this famous spring, in his Spandarine Anglica, published in
1626.
   “The waters of this sulphureous fountain,” he says, “are
very cold, and have no manifest heat, because their mines and
veins of brimstone are not kindled under the earth, being
hindered from the mixture of salt therewith.”       We are further
told that although such as drank the water verily believed
there was gunpowder in       there could  it,  little doubt              be                            of   its
efficacy against “reef and fellon,” “morphew, tettars and the
like.” Its attributes are more fully set forth by Dr. Michael
Stanhope      his “Cures without Care, being
              in                                   Summons                    a                        to   all

   The quantity of solid matter above given is equal to 831
grains in the imperial gallon; it is probably underestimated.
A more accurate analysis was made in 1783 by Dr. Joshua
Walker; a full account of his method of operating and of his
results is published in his treatise on the spring".     He found
that it contained 15 drachms of common salt and 26 grains of
calcareous earth in the wine gallon, amounting in                                                 all    to
1111:2 grains       the imperial gallon—no very great difference

solid matter, agree closely with the determinations of later
analysts". The total volume of the dissolved gases in the
imperial gallon was estimated by Dr. Hunter at 34 cubic inches,
and by Mr. West at 36.4 cubic inches.
    The true chemical history of the spring may, however, be
said to date from Dr. Hofmann's analysis, made nearly a
quarter of a century agof.     His examination first made known
with certainty the proper nature and proportion of the consti
 tuents of the water; it is therefore only since 1853 that we can
 determine with accuracy the character and extent of the changes
 which have taken place. The existence of barium and stron
 tium in the water was first stated by Mr. Hayton Davis in
                                                                       º

                 Magnesia.
   In addition were minute traces of strontia, fluorine, phos
 phoric acid, alumina, and organic matter.             A special examina
tion, made by means of the spectroscope, of the alkaline
 chlorides obtained from the chloroplatinates from the residue
of 10 litres of the water, failed to reveal the presence of thal
lium, caesium, or rubidium.
   In  the quantitative analysis at least two determinations of
each principal constituent were made.               The results are as
follows:—

of the water was mixed with bromine immediately after being
taken from the spring.   After standing the barium sulphate
formed was filtered off and weighed.

It is evident, from the absolute agreement between the results
of the two independent methods of determining the sulphur,
that no thiosulphate can be present.
    19. Determination of the Sulphur as Hydrogen Sulphide, and
as Alkaline Sulphide.—A considerable amount of discussion has
occurred respecting the manner in which the sulphur, perhaps
the chief remedial agent in the water, is contained in                                       it.   H.
would seem        be certain from the above determinations that
                      to
it  exists entirely       sulphide, either
                            as                 hydrogen     alkaline
                                                                 as                  or
                                                                              #.

his ‘Treatise       the Sulphureous Springs
                       on                          Harrogate,’ pub    of
lished      1843, states that
            in                              no
                                   free sulphuretted hydrogen                                      is
present      this water, but that

bination with calcium and sodium; and               all the analyses   in
 which have been made subsequent              that time the sulphur

                                  to              sulphydrate.    Dr. or
 Bennett based his conclusions on the observations that no
arsenic sulphide was precipitated        the addition   on  solution               ofa
 of  arsenious oxide      the water. This test, however,
                                 to                             falla                     is
 cious, inasmuch      any arsenic sulphide which might
                            as                                formed                    be

                                                                           -
                   Old Sulphur Well, Harrogate.                       55
would be retained in solution by the alkaline sulphide which
 Dr. Bennett inferred was alone present. It is quite certain
that a portion of the sulphur in the water exists as free sul
phuretted hydrogen.
    In order to determine the ratio between the dissolved gas
and the alkaline sulphide present,        I  followed the procedure
adopted by Simmler in his analysis of the Stachelberg sulphur
water, of expelling the hydrogen sulphide by a current of an
indifferent gas, such as hydrogen, and passing the escaping
gas through an ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate, convert
ing the precipitated sulphide into chloride, and determining
the amount |sulphur from the weight of the latter compound.
The operation (which extended over about twenty hours) was
conducted immediately after the collection of the water, and
before it had suffered the slightest exposure to air. Two ex
periments were carried on simultaneously.             The results are as
follows:—

Search    was made for carbon oxysulphide,             which, according
to Than, appears to exist in certain Hungarian sulphur waters.
The method of testing was based upon the fact that when
carbon oxysulphide is led into solution of ammonia, ammonium
oxysulphocarbamate, NH, COSNH, is formed, and that when
the solution of this salt is heated to 100° in sealed tubes it
loses the elements of water and is converted into ammonium
sulphocyanate, the existence of which is readily demonstrated
by the blood-red coloration it affords with ferric chloride.
Tie gases evolved by boiling 2 litres of the recently collected
water were led into dilute ammonia; and the ammoniacal solu
 tion, after concentration, was heated as above described. The
residue left on evaporation gave not the slightest indication
of the presence of a sulphocyanate.
    The results of the analysis, arranged in the conventional
mode of representing the state of combination of the various.            -
 acids and bases, are as follows:–

    Amount of soluble matter obtained by direct evaporation
and dried at 170°–190°, 147940 grams in 1000 grams.
    The amount of the solid matter obtained by direct evapora
 tion is slightly lower than that calculated from the several
 results of the analytical operations. This, indeed, was to be
 expected from the character of certain of the constituents.                  The
 magnesium salts tend to become basic on drying; and the am
 monium salt and the alkaline sulphydrate would be decomposed.
    It has not been thought necessary to ascertain the amount
 and nature of the gases expelled from the waterby boiling. Such
 determinations have in great measure lost their significance
    º
 since Dr. Jacobsen and Mr. Buchanan have shown that the
 saline matter in the water interferes greatly with the complete
 expulsion of the dissolved gases.                e amounts, however, of
 free carbon dioxide and       hydrogen      sulphide    (the most important
 of the gaseous constituents) are readily deduced from the ana
lytical results. They are as follows:—
     Vol. of dissolved gases at
        10° and 760 millims.           In 1000 grams.          In 1 gallon.
                      hydrogen      3628 cub. cent. 10:16 cub. in.
    Carbon dioxide . . . 143-17                    22        40.10        ,
 Almost exactly one half of the total amount of carbon dioxide
 in the water is in a state of combination, the other half being
 free or existing as the so-called acid carbonates.               The volume
 of the free gases thus formed is considerably larger than is

matter.
   The following Table exhibits the results in grains per gallon
of the principal analyses which have been made of the water
of the Old Sulphur Well. It has been arranged to show the
various constituents independently of the views entertained by
the analysts as to the particular manner of their combination
in the water.   We are thus enabled to trace, with a certain
degree of probability, the nature of the changes

the last three years. As compared with the composition in
1853 and 1867, the most striking difference is exhibited in
            ...!
the quantity of potash, which is less than one seventh of the
amount
also considerably
                   in the latter vear. The amount of lime is
                  less; and the diminution in both constituents
is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the amount of
chlorine.   The amount of barium salt in the water is un
usually large, and appears to be increasing.      So far as is
known, no mineral springs in this country or on the Continent
contain so large a proportion of this substance as the Harro
gate waters. The quantity, indeed, in the Old Sulphur Well is
as large as the entire amount of soluble matter contained in
many of the waters used for domestic supply in our towns.
So potent an agent present in such large proportion must un
doubtedly exercise considerable influence on the therapeutic
action of the water; and therefore it is highly desirable that
the determination of               its
                        amount should      repeated from time           be

land, but a veil of darkness suspended between the observer
and the low country. . All this time it is rapidly rising and
approaching, and each instant becoming more distinct, until
suddenly it seems to fall back on the spectator, like a ladder
that has been reared beyond the vertical; and the next instant
it is gone. Of the accuracy of the above facts I have no
doubt whatever.    A great number of trustworthy witnesses
have described it to me; and but for a sudden attack of fever
at the foot of the peak, which prevented an ascent being made
in the evening,               I
                    should have been able to describe it from
personal observation.     As it was ascended next day and was   I
able to form a very good idea of the conditions under which
the phenomenon takes place ; but was, of course, unable to          I
obtain accurate data as to the duration of the veil, the height
to which           its
              apex rises above the horizontal, the elevation                                                         of

when total internal reflection ceases and the veil suddenly dis
appears. Its apparent tilting over on the spectator      imagine    I
to be merely an illusion, produced by the rapid approach and
rising of the dark veil without any gradual disappearance
which can be watched and estimated. It will be evident that
it is the illumination of the innumerable particles floating in
the atmosphere, and capable of reflecting light, that causes this
aerial shadow to be visible by contrast.
   Another atmospheric phenomenon visible in Ceylon, of
great interest but not so striking in character as the above,
admits of an equally simple explanation.    Not unfrequently in
 the mountain districts broad beams apparently of bluish light
may be seen extending from the zenith downwards, converging

rays themselves are very broad and blue in colour; and the
spaces between them have the ordinary illumination of the rest
of the sky.         If
                    we suppose in this instance that the lower
strata of air are colder than the upper (a condition of the
atmosphere which not unfrequently occurs in a tropical moun
tain district like that of Ceylon, where large currents of heated
air sweeping up a valley cross another valley nearly at right
angles and at a considerable elevation above it), the refraction
spoken of in the case of Adam's Peak will be downwards instead
of upwards.         If,
                   too, the observer            be

never expressed.                   I
                        have indeed stated that at an early stage in
the cooling of our planet, contraction was met mainly by that
deformation of the spheroid which gave rise to the continents
and ocean-beds; but                     I
                            have abstained from assigning any me
chanism for the immediate production of that deformation,
which I still believe the state of our knowledge does not enable
us fully to explain.       Difference of coefficient of contraction
beneath land and ocean is not any necessary condition to the
deformation of the spheroid ; and had             ventured to speculate   I
upon the mechanism of such deformation,                 certainly should            I
not have rested it     upon    so extravagant     and unsustainable an
                                   of all
hypothesis as that        parts     our globe beneath the ocean had
                                                  of
a  larger coefficient     contraction than those beneath the land—
one the deductions from which would be quite irreconcilable
with even what we already know                  the forms      both con
                                                                as   to                      of

     The second work is one of more pretensions.             The original
  algebra of Dr. Wood was published at the end of last century, and
  was characterized by a most competent judge (the late Dr. Peacock)
  as an admirable specimen of simple exposition,           combined with
 adequate but not excessive illustration.       As time went on, how
 ever, parts of the work needed expansion; and (we believe about
  1840) Mr. Lund published an appendix to                   consisting                      it,                         of

tures in the top of the cupboard are inserted,  air-tight, the open
ends of two narrow tubes, intended to connect the interior space
with the atmosphere.    The tubes are bent several times up and

feeble currents as changes of temperature    might cause to set in

until they come, not only within range of the microscope, but
within range of the unaided senses. Let it be assumed that our
knowledge of them under these circumstances remains as defective,
as it is now—that we do not know whether they are germs,
particles of dead organic dust, or particles of mineral matter.
Suppose a vessel (say a flower-pot) to be at hand filled with nutri
tious earth, with which we mix our unknown particles, and that
in forty-eight hours subsequently buds and blades of well-defined
cresses and grasses appear above the soil.        Suppose the experiment
when     repeated   over and over    again  to yield  the same unvarying
result. What would be our conclusion ? Should we regard those
living plants as the products of dead dust or mineral particles, or
should we regard them as the offspring of living seeds 2 The reply
is unavoidable.       We should undoubtedly consider the experiment
with the flower-pot as clearing up our preexisting ignorance; we
should regard the fact of their producing cresses and grasses as
proof positive that the particles sown in the earth of the pot were
the seeds of the plants which have grown from them. lt would
be simply monstrous to conclude that they had been “sponta
neously generated.”
    This reasoning applies word for word to the development of
Bacteria from that floating matter which the electric beam reveals
in the air, and in the absence of which no Bacterial life has been
generated.      There seems no flaw in this reasoning; and it is so
simple as to render it unlikely that the notion of Bacterial life de
veloped from dead dust can ever gain currency among the members
of a great scientific profession.
    A novel mode of experiment has been here pursued, and it may
be urged that the conditions laid down by other investigators in
this field, which have led to different results, have not been strictly
adhered to. To secure accuracy in relation to these differences, the
latest words of a writer on this question, who has materially            in
 fluenced medical thought both in this country and in America, are
 quoted.     “We know,” he says, “that boiled turnip- or hay-infu
 sions   exposed   to ordinary air, exposed to filtered air, to calcined air,
 or shut off   altogether  from contact with air, are more or less prone
 to swarm with Bacteria and Vibriones in the course of from two
 to six days.” Who the “we” are who possess this knowledge is
 not stated.       The author is certainly not among the number,
 though he has sought anxiously for knowledge of the kind. He
 thus tests the statements in succession.
     And first, with regard to filtered air. A group of twelve large
 test-tubes was caused to pass air-tight through a slab of wood. The
 wood was coated with cement, in which, while hot, a heated “pro
 pagating-glass” resembling a large bell-jar was imbedded. The air
  within the jar was pumped out several times, air filtered through
 a plug of cotton-wool being permitted to supply           its  place. The

tion; while twelve similar tubes, prepared at the           same time, in
precisely the same way, and exposed to the ordinary air, are
clogged with mycelium, mould, and Bacteria.
   With regard to the calcined air, a similar propagating-glass was
caused to cover twelve other tubes filled with the same infusions.
The “glass” was exhausted and carefully filled with air which had
  assed through a red-hot platinum tube containing a roll of red
F.   platinum gauze. Tested by the searching beam, the calcined
air was found quite free from floating matter. Not a speck has

mackerel, eel, oyster, oatmeal, malt, and potato, hermetically sealed
while boiling, not by the blowpipe, but by the far more handy spirit
lamp flame. In no case was any appearance whatever of Bacteria
or allied organisms observed. The perusal of the discussion just
referred to caused the author to turn again to muscle, liver, and
kidney, with a view of varying and multiplying the evidence. Fowl,
pheasant, snipe, partridge, plover, wild duck, beef, mutton, heart,
tongue, lungs, brains, sweetbread, tripe, the crystalline lens, vitreous
humour, herring, haddock, mullet, codfish, sole, werc          embraced                                all
in the experiments. There was neither mistake nor ambiguity about
the result. One hundred and thirty-nine         the flasks operated               of                                   on

nesses offered the least countenance       the assertion that liquids     to
within flasks, boiled and hermetically sealed, swarm, subsequently,
more      less plentifully with Bacteria and allied organisms.

  the bell-jar was imbedded.          For three weeks the infusions had re
  mained perfectly clear.         At the end of this time, with a view of
  renewing the air of the jar, it was exhausted, and refilled by fresh
  air which had passed through a plug of cotton-wool.                 As the air
   entered, two small spots of Penicillium, resting on the liquid
   which had boiled over, attracted attention.                  It was at once
  remarked that the experiment was a dangerous one, as the enter
   ing air would probably detach some of the spores of the Penicillium
  and diffuse them in the bell-jar. This was therefore filled very
   slowly, so as to render the disturbance a minimum.                 Next day,
  however, a tuft of mycelium was observed at the bottom of one
  of the three tubes, namely that containing the hay-infusion. It
  has by this time grown so as to fill a large portion of the tube.           For
  nearly a month longer the two tubes containing the turnip- and
  mutton-infusions maintained their transparency unimpaired.                 Late
  in December the mutton-infusion, which was in dangerous proxi
  mity to the outer mould, showed a tuft upon its surface. The
  beef-infusion continued bright and clear for nearly a fortnight
  longer.    The recent cold weather caused the author to add a third
  gas-stove to the two which had previously warmed the room in
  which the experiments are conducted.             The warmth played upon
  one side of the     bell-jar,  causing   currents within it ; and the day
  after the    lighting   of the    stove, the beef-infusion gave birth to
  a tuft of    mycelium.      In this case the small spots of Penicillium
  might have readily escaped attention; and had they done so
  we should have had three cases of “spontaneous generation” far
  more striking than many that have been adduced.
     In further illustration of the danger incurred in this field of                                      in

after prolonged   exposure to the boiling temperature;        and this
         him to come to the conclusion that under certain rare con
ditions spontaneous generation may occur.      He also found that an
º,
alkalized hay-infusion was so difficult to sterilize that it was ca
   ble of withstanding the boiling temperature for hours without
        its power of generating life. The most careful experiments
have been made with this infusion.       Dr. Roberts is certainly cor
rect in assigning to it superior nutritive power. But in the present
inquiry five minutes' boiling sufficed to completely sterilize the
liquid.

 recognized—an           upper one, the reservoir                  or   feeding glacier, and
 lower one, the flowing glacier. Applying this division  the old                         to
 glaciers,  appears that
            it              the glaciers

flowing glacier (which occupied the plain) had a surface nearly
equal to that of the feeding glacier (which was situated in the moun
tains).    By means of several tables M. Favre showed the height
attained by these glaciers, their thickness, the slope of their upper
surface &c. at various points in the Alps, the Jura, and Swabia, and
deduced as the result of the comparison of these numbers:–1. that
the Rhone glacier passed over several of the chains of the Jura,
 and that the ice covering these, far from being an obstacle to the
extension of the glaciers of the Alps, actually reinforced them, and
served them as relays, the glaciers of the Jura having carried far
on the Alpine erratic blocks; 2. that the slopes of the upper surface
were variable, and were null, or nearly so, over considerable spaces.
    At the Calanda, near Coire, there are erratics which seem to
be at a higher level than that attained by the glacier.      This may be
explained by the formation in the glacier of a sort of eddy, which
would elevate the ice to a certain amount over a limited space.
   During their greatest extension the Swiss glaciers came into contact
with those of central France near Lyons; they united with those
 of the Jura, the Black Forest, and the Austrian and Italian Alps;
they stretched from the plain of the Po to that of the Danube; and,
further, for distances of 50 or 100 kilometres they nearly ap
proached horizontality. Hence they resembled the glaciers of the
interior of Greenland and Spitzbergen, so far as can be judged
from the descriptions.

      GENTLEMEN,
MAY I         ask you to insert in the next Number of the Philoso
         phical Magazine the following translation of a letter which    I
have addressed to MM. les Secrétaires Perpétuels of the Académie
des Sciences in reply to the letter from Father Secchi, of which a
translation appeared in the Supplementary Number of your Maga
zine for June 2

    I hesitate   to occupy the time of the Academy with a few words
 in reply to a letter from Father Secchi, read on April 3, especially
 because Mr. Christie, of Greenwich, has communicated to the Royal
 Astronomical Society       a summary of the results recently observed at

Greenwich, which agree in a remarkable way with my observations
on the same stars. It is true that there were discordances among
the early Greenwich observations; but these were due for the most
part to the apparatus, which was not in        respects sufficiently             all
trustworthy.   Mr. Christie  compares his results with mine      the                                           in
following Table. The figures indicate the velocity     approach                                   of                 or

  Father Secchi writes:—“Nous acquimes la conviction que la raie
pouvait paraitre constamment d'un cóté ou de l'autre, selon la dis
position de l'instrument sans que l'observateur eat un indice assez
sur pour reconnaitre l'illusion dont il était victime.” Such an illu
sion was scarcely possible in the method which    I  employed, because
from the first   I was careful to add to other   necessary  precautions,
that of   directing  frequently the telescope with the spectroscope
attached, to the moon, when the triple line b always coincided per
fectly with the three bright lines of magnesium. When the instru
ment, without any possible derangement, was again directed to the
star, the same displacement of the line was seen which had been ob
served previously.
     Itis also not necessary for me to state the special precautions
which have to be taken when a stellar line “très-large et estampée à
son bord” has to be compared with the bright line 3 of hydrogen,
because many of the comparisons were made with narrow and de
fined stellar lines with the lines of magnesium and of sodium. The
displacement due to the approach of Arcturus was observed not only
in the case of the line F with hydrogen, but also, in the case of the
triple line b, with the three lines of magnesium, and the double
line D with the two lines of sodium.
    The observations of the displacements of lines in the spectra of
 stars are necessarily, from their nature, of extreme delicacy; and
 success can be expected only when suitable care and precautions are
taken.
    Father Secchi says, p. 762, “M. Huggins reprit peu après la
 question.”    The application of the spectroscope to the movements
 of the heavenly bodies was entirely original on my part. It is true
 that Father Secchi's letter describing his negative results appeared
 in the Comptes Rendus for March 2, 1868, while my paper was pre
 sented to the Royal Society the following month, April 23, 1868;
 but my observations for the most part, as is stated in my paper, were
 made during the preceding year.      The idea of the method was fami
 liar to Dr. Miller and  myself at the time of our comparisons of stellar
 with terrestrial  spectra in 1862–63: see Phil. Trans. 1868, p. 529.
  ON      THE INTERNAL CONSTITUTION     OF MAGNETS.       BY   J. JAMIN.
  In a saturated magnet of infinite length, the magnetic intensities
y are expressed by the formula of y=Ak-", which represents a
 curve the more elongated as k is smaller:    ;
                                              k is what   I    have named
the cofficient of conductivity. For one and the same quality of steel
in    its
       different states A  isinvariable; but the conductivity increases
with the   annealing, and takes  itsleast value when the steel has been
dipped                                     If
                                                                         of of

                                         of             But     the as

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                    75
commercial kinds do not contain more than 1 percent, of carbon,              I
had prepared by M. Dalifol a series of steels which have been sub
mitted to repeated cementations, then cast, in which the proportion
of carbon progressively increases, and the last members of the series
will not bear the forge. Chilled at a white heat they are more and
more hard, not attacked by acids except aqua regia, less and less
conductors of magnetism, and, what is more, less and less magnetic.
The last members are scarcely attracted by an electromagnet, scarcely
magnetized by a powerful coil either during or after the passage of
the current (Comptes Rendus, vol. lxxvii. p. 91).
   I have explained these facts by assuming that those steels which
are bad conductors of magnetism in the direction of their length are
the same also in the direction of their depth—that their magnetiza
tion, considerable at the surface, decreases thence to the centre, and
that for the most cemented the magnetized layer does not exceed
the thickness of a varnish.         I  have, besides, established that the
law of the decrease of      magnetism    is given by the preceding formula.
These ideas having been recently contested on the ground of some
experiments neither very precise nor correctly interpreted,              I pro
ceed to defend them and give them precision by more thorough                in
vestigation.
   I take as an example a bar of steel prepared by M. Dalifol, very
homogeneous, well tempered, very hard, and having very little con
ductivity.     Its dimensions were—length 280 millims., breadth 50
millims., and thickness 10.6 millims. After magnetizing it to satu
ration, and keeping it at rest for some days to bring it to its defini
tive equilibrium,    I  dissolved it gradually in cold aqua regia, taking
it out from time to time to measure its thickness e and its total

   On discussing that formula we see that if E increases, kTº                                                di
minishes and M increases.     Therefore the magnetism augments
with the thickness of the bar. From a sufficient thickness (the less
as k is greater) the magnetism no longer augments with E, but
takes a limiting value

This limiting value is the less the greater k is or the steel less con
ductive; whence it follows that steels which are much cemented
and chilled will be magnetized very                                little, and equally under                   all

ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE SOLIDIFYING-TEMPERATURE                              OF
  LIQUIDs, AND IN PARTICULAR OF SULPHUR.                       By D. GERNEz.
   The determination of the temperature at which the passage of a
body from the solid to the liquid state is effected, or inversely,
presents, notwithstanding       its apparent simplicity, uncertainties
which have only been dissipated for a relatively restricted number
of substances, even when the change of state takes place abruptly—
that is to say, when the solid becomes suddenly liquid through an
infinitesimal change of temperature. The slowness with which the
fusion of a body is produced in a bath at a constant temperature but
little above the fusing-point, and the imperfect conductivity of the
substances (which permits certain parts of the liquid to attain
temperatures above that of the part not melted), have led physicists
to substitute for the determination of the fusing-point that, supposed

case that the measurements are found to be falsified in consequence
of the phenomena of surfusion.                   I
                                       As will show, these phenomena.
can be utilized to determine the      solidifying-temperature    of liquids
with a   precision only  limited  by the  patience  of the experimenter,
    For this purpose, into a glass tube 3 centims. in diameter, closed
at one end, such a quantity of the solid is put that in the liquid
state it forms a column 5 or 6 centims. in height; along the axis
of the tube a thermometer, held by a cork, is arranged, the bulb of
which, sufficiently small to have only a negligible effect on the
temperature of the surrounding liquid, descends to within a few
millims. of the bottom, without touching the tube. The fusion of
the body is then determined by putting it into a bath of water or
paraffin at a temperature a few degrees higher than the presumed
point of solidification.    When the body is entirely melted, the tube
is brought into a bath at a constant temperature lower than the
temperature sought; and we wait until the indications of two
thermometers (one internal, the other external) differ only very
little.  The result is accelerated by turning the tube on its axis—
which   does not provoke solidification, unless in the movement the
thermometer rubs against the sides of the tube bathed by the liquid.
The body being thus in the state of surfusion, a fine glass needle
with      its
          extremity covered with     small quantity

which      immediately determined.

cork  is rotated about its axis, which moves the stem and carries the
crystalline germs cylindrically round the thermometer, the indica

change of state of sulphur; and the following are the chief res

   The most simple results is that which relates to sulphur insolu
in sulphide of carbon, obtained by exhaustion from flowers
sulphur.       The solidification of this variety takes place at 114°3
whatever may be the temperature at which it was melted: thus,

SINCE  heats of gases this   subject has not, so far as      I am aware,
been experimentally      dealt with. The apparatus required to
carry out such investigations as those of Régnault is not
usually at the command of many physicists.
   I  have sought to discover methods which would enable the
experimenter to prosecute with exactness, yet with less com
plicated appliances, this inquiry, which has such important
bearings upon the mechanical theory of heat and also upon
molecular chemistry.
    In the following first communication the methods of obser
vation will be described, measurements of the specific heat of
air will then be given, and, lastly, the relation between specific
heat and temperature in the case of a few gases will be in
vestigated f.
    In performing     his measurements Régnault used an appa
ratus which consisted essentially of three parts—the vessel for

in thickness, and had a capacity of about 30 litres ; the gas
to be examined was                        in it by means of a force
pump.      Pressures    varying    from 3000 to 4000 millims. of

was an attainable pressure. The gases could easily be sent
through the warming-apparatus and calorimeter in sufficient
          and with the necessary velocity. As the volume of
   e copper containing-vessel was known, the quantity of gas
used could be calculated from the pressure existing before and
after the experiment. That part of the apparatus in which
the gases were warmed consisted of an oil-bath containing a
tube of brass or platinum 8 millims. in width and 10 metres
in length, through which the gas was allowed to flow. The
calorimeter consisted of a similarly shaped spiral of thin sheet
tin surrounded with water. In taking an observation a known
  uantity of the gas under examination was allowed to flow
through the warming-apparatus, which was heated to a deter
minate temperature; the heat thus absorbed was again given
up to the water in the calorimeter; and from a determination
of this quantity of heat the specific heat of the gas could be
readily calculated.
    In order to ensure correct determinations, it was especially
necessary that the gas should be completely heated to the
temperature of the warming-apparatus, and that it should also
entirely give up             its
                          heat                 in
                                       the calorimeter.      The spiral
through which the gas flowed was therefore required                 pre
sent   aconsiderable surface         the gas and thus
                                              to                   con       to     be   of to
siderable length.     This was the more requisite, inasmuch                                        as
the gas passed through the apparatus with             very considerable

which has a length of 11 centims. and a diameter of 4 centims.,

and  departs  by  op.   The latter tube is made of copper so far
ass, from s to p it consists of German silver; it is 17 millims.
in length. It was found that too much heat was conducted
from the warming-vessel to the calorimeter if the exit-tube
was made entirely of copper; the correction-constant, k (to
be discussed hereafter), received therefore too high a value.
A thermometer passes through the lid of the heating-vessel.
The liquid in the warming-vessel is constantly kept in motion
by means of a stirrer, which consists of two perforated hori
zontal plates hard-soldered to a stirrup W, and at a distance
from one another somewhat greater than the breadth of the
copper cylinder. A cord passing from V over a pulley is con

up in stirring. The warming-vessel and calorimeter are con
nected together by means of a cork, as was done by Régnault
in his apparatus.
    In          to maintain a constant temperature around the
calorimeter    during an experiment, the calorimeter is placed in
a cylindrical vessel of sheet brass having two walls; the height
of this vessel is 17% centims., and the diameter 14, centims.
A funnel-shaped orifice in the front part of this vessel allows
of the introduction of the tube & without contact between the
two.    By means of the side tubes water, maintained at uniform
temperature, is allowed to circulate through this vessel.          A
wooden partition covered with tinfoil, 2, and furnished with a
circular opening in the centre, protects the vessel just described
from the heat radiated from the warming-apparatus.               The
calorimeter is supported in a wicker stand in the centre of
the brass vessel x. A board covered with tinfoil is placed on
the top of x; and to this board another, protected -in the same
manner, is vertically attached.
    The latter carries a pulley, over which passes the cord
attached to the stirrer of the calorimeter; the stirrer is moved
 upwards and downwards 40 to 50 times per minute.
    The thermometer of the calorimeter is illuminated from
behind by means of a gas-lamp, the heat-rays from which are
cut off by the interposition of four glass plates. Immediately
behind the thermometer is placed a glass plate covered, with
the exception of a space equal to the breadth of the thermo
 meter, with tinfoil; by means of this arrangement foreign
light is cut off,
    The thermometer employed was graduated to tenths of a
degree; by using a telescope it could be read to hundredths
 of a degree. . This thermometer was calibrated and carefully
compared with a standard from 0° to 40°.
    On account of the size of the apparatus and the great pres–
 sures required, Régnault's method of storing and delivering
 the gases, and of measuring their volumes, could not be em
ployed.      It was, however, found possible to modify the
method of Delaroche and Bérard so as to obtain exact results.
 These experimenters forced the gases from moist animal
 bladders, which were placed in a balloon communicating with
 another into which water issued at a constant velocity.       From
 the  quantity   of water  entering, the quantity  of  gas   issuing
 could be be calculated.     By replacing the animal membrane
by caoutchouc, the gases could be maintained free from
moisture.

   Another method for determining that the gases are
thoroughly warmed has been proposed by Régnault.                    He
  laced a                  in the anterior part of the spiral of the

the thermometer is exposed to the influence of the heat radi
ated from the sides of the apparatus. A gas which has only
cooled slightly will therefore produce an extremely small
effect on the indication of the thermometer.
    In order to ascertain whether the heated gas entirely parted

          heat     the calorimeter, experiments were carried out

peratures were noted for five to ten minutes—at first each
second, afterwards from minute to minute. A regular increase
of temperature occurred generally at the tenth and twentieth
seconds after closing the stopcocks; so short was the time
            º,
required for the temperature of the silver gauze to become
equalized with that of the water of the calorimeter.             The
time was            the higher the temperature of the entering
gas, inasmuch as the gauze situated nearest to the entrance
aperture underwent a greater rise in temperature.             Imme
diately before and after the experiment the temperature of the
heating-vessel was determined, the mean of the two readings
being taken as the temperature during the experiment.
     Water maintained at the temperature of the air of the room
 flowed continuously through the double-walled vessel X. The
temperature of this water was determined before it entered
 and when it flowed from X. Notwithstanding the wooden
 screen, a slight increase in the temperature of the water was
 observed ; the mean of the two readings was adopted.

     In  order to calculate the specific heat, we require also the
weight of liquid in the calorimeter, as also the water-value of
the calorimeter.        The weight of liquid was determined by
direct    weighing    before every experiment; it varied from 59
to 61 grims.          e water-value of the calorimeter was calcu

   In order to estimate the heat radiated to and from the
calorimeter, as also that carried away by currents of air, we
make the assumption (justified by the smallness of the dif
ferences of temperature) that this is proportional to the differ

94      M. E. Wiedemann      on the Specific Heats  of Gases.
   The mean value is 0.2389, the greatest deviation from this
being 0.0025.
   Experiments Nos. 9 and 10 were carried out four weeks
after Nos. 1 to 8, and Nos 11 and 12 some time after 9 and 10;
during the earlier experiments, the heating-vessel contained
boiling water; during the two latter experiments it contained
        paraffin.
   The numbers agree among themselves to as great an extent
as do those obtained by Régnault: thus he obtained numbers
varying from 0.23536 to 0.23890; my numbers vary from
0.2374 to 0-2414. The mean number 0:2389 obtained by me
differs by less than 1 per cent. from that obtained by Régnault,
viz. 0.23751.
   The method adopted for graduating the thermometer for
150° and 200° may fitly be described in connexion with the
specific heat of air.
   In order to determine the temperatures which corresponded,
in an air-thermometer, to the 150th and 200th degree of the
thermometer used in the heating-vessel, the paraffin-bath was
heated steady until the mercury column reached and remained
steadfast at the given degree. The process, as if for determi
ning the specific heat of air, was then proceeded with; and the
lowering of temperature of the air of the calorimeter was cal
culated from the known specific heat of air (which, as shown
by Régnault, is independent of temperature) and from the
other data of the experiment.
   By adding this lowering of temperature to the mean tempe
rature of the liquid in the calorimeter during the experiment,
which corresponds with the final temperature of the air after
cooling, the initial temperature of the air was obtained, and
therewith also the temperature measured by an air-thermo
meter which corresponded with the position of the thermometer.
The differences of the calculated deviations of our thermome

           The mean number deduced from experiments 5 and 6 is
       3.410, the greatest deviation therefrom being 0-004. The
       fact that the first four numbers are larger than the last two is
       explained by Régnault's observation that the constant k acquires
       a larger value when the whole apparatus is filled with hydrogen
       (as was the case in the first four experiments) than     en it is      *
       filled with air. When the very mobile hydrogen is allowed to
       remain at rest before and after the experiments, currents are
       engendered which carry over heat from the heating-vessel to
       the calorimeter, without taking into account the heat conducted
       from the German-silver tube. But in making the correction,
       the heat conducted over is alone taken into account, when the
       apparatus is filled with a stream of gas, as the secondary cur
       rents are then entirely neutralized.    But too great a value for
       k causes the  negative  correction for the observed temperature
       increase to be also too large, and therefore the temperature
       increase itself to be too small. The smallness of the number
       obtained for the specific heat is thus accounted for.
          In the last two experiments the apparatus was filled with air
       before and after each experiment; k has in these cases the
       smaller and more correct value, and the number 3:410 then
       obtained for the specific heat of hydrogen agrees well with
       Régnault's number 3:409, especially when it is remembered
       that his numbers vary from 3:401 to 3:419.
          By multiplying 0-96.92 by 3410 the number 02358 is ob
         ined as representing the specific heat referred to volume.

               heat of hydrogen at varying temperatures, inasmuch as Rég
               nault has shown that in the case of this gas the specific heat is
               independent of the temperature.     Neither did an examination
               of oxygen or of nitrogen appear to be necessary. Régnault
               has shown that the specific heat of the first, referred to volume,
               is the same as that of air; the same must therefore hold good
               for nitrogen.   Inasmuch also as air exhibits no change of spe
               cific heat with change of temperature, we must believe that
               neither is there any change in the case of       constituents.                                    its

 98       M. E. Wiedemann      on the Specific Heats    of Gases.
    My numbers agree among themselves            as well as those ob
 tained by Régnault;      for    instance,   he obtained values for
 the specific heat between 210° and 10° varying from 0:21416
 to 0-21844 &c. It appears, alike from Régnault's and from
 my experiments, that there is a great change in the specific
 heat of the gas under examination with change of temperature.
    The true specific heats calculated from the foregoing num
 bers for certain temperatures are as follows:—
                 For    0    .    .   .  .  .   0-1952
                      100   .     .   .  .  .   0-21.69
                      200   .     .  .   .  . . 0-2387
    Régnault's numbers are :—
                 For    0   .     .  .   .  .   0-1870
                     100    .     .  .   .  .   0:2145
                     200    .     .  .   .  .   0-2397
    Taking the specific gravity of carbonic acid as 1:529, the
following numbers express the relative heats:—
                 For    0   .     .  .   .  .   0.2985
                     100    .     .  .   .  .   0-3316
                     200    .     .  .   .  .   0-3650
                         Carbonic Oride.
    The gas was prepared by Fowne's method, viz. heating
one part of yellow prussiate of potash with eight parts of con
centrated sulphuric acid. The gas was led through caustic
potash and then through sulphuric acid : it was entirely ab
sorbed by a solution of cuprous chloride in hydrochloric acid;
it contained no carbonic acid. Oxalic acid was not used for
the preparation of the gas, inasmuch as the carbonic acid
simultaneously produced can only be separated with great dif
ficulty.
   #.    numbers given in the two following Tables yield almost
exactly the same values for the specific heat; so that we may
conclude that the specific heat     of carbonic oxide is independent
of the temperature.     Régnault's number between 200° and
20°, viz. 02450, does not differ materially from mine.
   The relative heat of carbonic oxide is 0.2346 (the specific
gravity being taken as 0.967), which is nearly the same as that
of air –0.2389.

                                                            Ethylene.
   The ethylene was produced by Mitscherlich's method, viz.
by leading alcohol vapour into tolerably concentrated sulphuric
acid heated to 160° or 170°. The gas was cooled to condense
ether, which is always produced along with the ethylene, and
then passed through caustic potash and through concentrate
sulphuric acid into a gasometer. The last traces of ether were
given up to the water in the gasometer; and the gas, after
being dried by means of sulphuric acid, could be passed into
the caoutchouc balloon.
   Inasmuch as by-products are always formed in the produc
tion of ethylene, so great an agreement among the results of
experiments cannot be expected in the case of this as of the
other gases.

   The mean value is 0.4293; the greatest deviation therefrom
0-0108.
   The order of experiments was 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 a, 2a, 3a, 5, 6,
7, 4a, 5 a, 8, 6a. The number 0.4293 does not differ very
much from that obtained by Régnault, viz. 0.404 (mean of
0.4147 and 0.3933).                  Régnault did not carry out experiments
between 100° and 20°.

   The gas was prepared by long-continued                                 heating of ammo
nium nitrate free from chloride and nitrite;                               it was purified by
passage through caustic potash (to absorb ammonium nitrate
carried over and nitric acid) and through sulphuric acid (to
absorb free ammonia).

     The specific heat found between 200° and 25° is almost
identical with the number 0-22616 obtained by Régnault.
From Régnault's experiments carried out for the temperature
interval 165° to 200°, as well as from my own results, it ap
pears that the specific heat of nitrous oxide increases with
increase       of temperature.
                                 :-
     From the foregoing measurements the following true specific

     Multiplying these numbers by the specific gravity of nitrous
 oxide (1:52) we obtain the relative heats:—

     The gas was prepared by gently warming the strongest am
 monia of commerce, and dried by passage through a long tube
 filled with lime.
     In order to regulate the velocity of the flow, the gas was
 passed through a small flask containing mercury and then
 through an empty flask.

to be the time for making an attempt to estimate the separate
parts of the heat of molecular motion—heat of atom, and of
atoms (atom- und Atomenwärme), according to Naumann–
which constitute the specific heat at constant volume, nor for
endeavouring to trace simple relationships between these—in
asmuch as these relations would appear altogether different for
different temperatures, on account of the unequal alterations in
specific heats with alteration in temperature, which are not to
be entirely explained as small differences in heats of expansion.
  The alterations in the specific heats of gases with alterations
in temperature cannot be explained by taking into account the
deviations from the state of permanent gases.   In the case of
ammonia, for instance, the alteration with the temperature is
much smaller than it is in the case of nitrous oxide and car
                       *
bonic acid, although the latter are much more nearly perma
nent gases than      former, as appears from the proportion of
the values       of
                      PIV1
  The smallness of the difference between the coefficients of
expansion of the gases show that the alterations in question
cannot be traced to this difference.
    Any attempt to explain the alterations in specific heat of
these gases from alterations in the specific heat of the elemen
                                                                               i.
tary bodies composing them, say carbon and nitrogen, does not
appear feasible. For, in the                        #.
                                           place, the experiments on
air show that the specific heat of nitrogen itself              not alter
with the temperature; and further, the specific heat of               car                    all
bon   compounds    does not show alterations with the     temperature.
One must rather accept             Weber's view”, that the carbon
                                           F.

                 in                     possessed   isproperties other   of

researches, however, it is not to be supposed that dissociation
would proceed to completion ; this change, therefore, would not
have taken place.
    But further experimental investigations must precede the
theoretical discussion of this question.    It will be my first
endeavour to carry out experiments within greater temperature
limits, and especially to estimate the specific heats of the
vapours.        I
              have already carried out a prolonged series of
preliminary experiments with this object, making use of the
apparatus already described with a few slight modifications;

                    By   GEORGE FULLER, C.E., Belfast".
      HIS   machine is a double-acting electrophorus worked by
        cranks, with the addition of an arrangement by which a
small electric charge given to it is augmented and kept up, so
that the dielectric does not require to be recharged.
    A is a vulcanite plate supported in a vertical position by two
 insulated standards, p, p.
          º
    B, B' are two insulated metallic plates, one on each side of
the plate A ; these can be moved together to and from con
tact with A by means of cranks worked by the handle C.
    m and n are two conductors armed with needles and con
nected by means of two glass rods, so that they receive the
Same                motion from the mechanism by means of the
wire, cord, and pulleys, g, g, g. The wire g is attached to the
arm that moves the plate B' ; and the length of the cord and
size of pulley are so adjusted that when this is in           extreme                   its

    In the production of gas the same thing takes place. In
 order to overcome the cohesion of water, some heat must be
 destroyed and become imperceptible.                In the coming back to
 the liquid state this heat must be again disposable and able to
 put into vibration, i. e. to warm, the thermometer or the hand.
 A gas vibrates so that                       its
                                  particles always tend            drive one          to

of these speculations, especially those of Mayer and Séguin, have
been discussed, and at least in part reprinted, in the Philosophical

   Take, for instance, the case of a medium in which the par
ticles, being separated by finite intervals, act upon each other
solely by their mutual attractions, and in which the vibration
is transversal. If in such a medium two waves, analogous to
those already described, advance towards each other, the dis
placement in the one lying wholly on the one side of the line
of direction of the wave, while that in the other lies wholly
on the opposite side, it is evident that at the period of com
plete superposition                   all
                             particle-displacement must, for the

the distances R and r,” is in fact the sum of the following
 products, viz. of the tensions acting (say) at the beginning of
 each of an indefinite number of equal intervals dt, into which
 the interval T t (corresponding to the distances R and r) is
divided, each multiplied by the velocity of the particle at the
same instant and the short interval dt, during which the ten
 sion and the velocity may be considered uniform.
     It is thus evident that the term in the equation of vis vira
 which Dr. Helmholtz offers to our notice as depending solely
 on the tensions, does in fact depend on the tensions and velo
 cities combined ; from which it results that the interpretation
 of the equation of ris vira which forms the basis of Dr.
 Helmholtz's theory, viz. that the energy of a system consists
 of two separable constituents, one depending solely on the
 motion existing in the system, the other depending solely on
 the forces exerted by the particles on one another, has no foun
dation in fact,

considering it is not true, as asserted by Prof. Maxwell, that
the energy of the system consists of two parts—one depending
on the motion of the body represented by the kinetic energy,
the other depending on the work which the forces would do if
the bodies were to yield to their action, since during this por
tion of the motion the body cannot yield to the action of the
forces, that action being controlled and overcome by the mo
mentum for the time being inherent in each body.
     Ifthe second of the two components of which the total
energy is assumed to consist is to be expressed in the language
of the ‘Theory of Work, it is evident that during one half
of the motion in the last case, Prof. Maxwell's account of the
composition of energy must be modified into some such terms
as the following.
  The energy of the system consists of two parts—(1) the kinetic
energy which bodies have by virtue of being in motion, (2)
an energy depending on the amount of work which the mo–
mentum in the system would do if the bodies were to yield to
its action,--a classification which, however exactly     meets the                it

    It thus appears that instead of the term depending on the
tensions being always positive, as the theory assumes, it will,
in the case just considered, be always negative ; so that if we
take the vis vica to represent the kinetic, and the term depend
ing on the tensions the potential energy, it follows that it is the
difference, not the sum of the kinetic and potential energies which
 in this case of motion will be constant.

124        Mr. W. Baily    on the Optical Properties         of Starch.
   Under the polariscope, with the Nicols at right
                                                    angles, the
grain appears to be marked with a black cross, whose inter
section always coincides with the nucleus, whose arms reach
the circumference, and whose form depends on the kind of
starch, as well as on the position of the grain; the spaces
         the arms are illuminated with less than full
                                                      light, the
between
brightness increasing with the distance from the cross.                         If
                                                              white, and the
the Nicols are made parallel the cross becomes
spaces between the arms become dark but not                black,   the dark
ness   increasing   with the   distance   from    the  cross.    Hence     it is
                    light  which    emerges    from the     starch   at  points
evident that the
                                                             polarization of
on the cross is plane-polarized in the plane of
the lower Nicol, and that the light from points in the
                                                                     spaces is
elliptically polarized, the polarization being most nearly                     cir
                                                                      turning
cular at points most distant from the cross, where the
of the upper Nicol was found to occasion the least                 change     in
the illumination.       In round     grains,  such    as  young     grains    of
potato-starch, or in oval         grains   seen    endways,     the   cross    is
rectilinear and rectangular, the arms            being   parallel    and   per
pendicular to the plane of polarization.                  e appearance re
                                                              by the circular
sembles closely that given under the polariscope
disks formed in      crystallized     hippuric    acid  and    salicene. In
hippuric acid the pattern is in black and          white;    but in salicene,
                          º
 though the cross is black or white, the remainder is brilliantly
 coloured.     In starch the pattern is in black and white generally,
 but the largest grains show a trace of colour.
    Now the optical properties of these disks can be completely
 explained by supposing that the substance is doubly refracting,
 with two axes of                    at each point in the plane of the
 disk, one of them being           irected  towards the centre of the
 disk.     The arrangement of the axes of elasticity in the disk is
                                                                        centre,
 therefore given by a family of lines radiating from the
                                                       it.  Plane-polarized
 and a family of circles described about
 light passing through such disk will emerge without change

 the plane    of polarization; for the vibration will coincide with

   In an oval grain of starch seen sideways the nucleus is
situated            towards one end, and the arms of the cross
are  curved, except  when the length of the oval is parallel or
perpendicular to the plane of polarization, in which case two
arms form a straight line along the length of the oval, and the
other arms are curved. The same effect would be produced
by a crystalline disk constructed as follows:—Round a point
as nucleus draw a family of ovals,
each having the point towards one
end, and       itsgreatest length            cer   in   a
tain   direction,       and let the axes                         of
elasticity     in the disk          each point
                                       be   at

                                             to

             XVII.    The Pitted Surface of Meteorites.
               By N. Story MASKELYNE, F.R.S.         &c.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical    Magazine and  Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
IN Daubrée,
        the  Comptes   Rendus for April 24th of this year M.
                  the eminent director of the École des Mines,
has offered an explanation of the hollows which characterize
the crusted surface of meteorites. This explanation he partly
draws from the very singular parallelism between this alveolar
surface of meteorites and that presented by the fragments of
unburnt gunpowder that fall at some distance from the muzzle
of a large piece of ordnance.
   I  had myself the pleasure of introducing this subject to the
notice of my friend M. Daubrée when he was staying with me
in London in the summer of last year. I drew his attention
to the remarkable similarity which these incompletely burned
fragments of gunpowder bear in the pitted character of their
surfaces to meteorites, whose black crust presents hollows and
irregularities curiously identical in feature with those of the
powder fragments.                   -
    I spoke, indeed, with some hesitation as to the causes of this
similarity in the two cases, as the conditions were by no
means identical.      Had M. Daubrée's explanation been in all
respects in accord with what seemed and seems to me the
most satisfactory way of accounting for phenomena so similar,
it would be unnecessary for me to make any further observa
tion on the matter.
                                       .
    I should merely have been anticipated in the publication of
one of the points      I   have discussed in a little treatise on
meteorites long nearly ready for printing.
    Since, however, M. Daubrée             not give the same ex    |
planation of the hollows       pitting the surface of a meteorite
that still appears to me to be, on the whole, the best way of
accounting for them,     I  venture to put on record, earlier than
I  otherwise had intended doing, what        I conceive is the pro

                                 Surface of Meteorites.                                                127
bable cause of the variolar surface in the two cases, and in
                       I
what respects find myself not in accord with the conclusion
of the Director of the École des Mines.

    And I should here say that have had, on more occasions
than one during the last two or three years, to thank my
friends Professor Abel and Major Noble for specimens of these
fragments of gunpowder as projected from the 35-ton and
80-ton guns at Woolwich, and that in the explanation                    offer                     I
of this part of the questions at issue my opinion has been
brought into           its
                       present shape                   be

    The   fragments    are generally    about the size           small nut,        of   a
and very irregular          form; but where the original grain
      gunpowder                 a in                                                                       is of

distinctly recognizable             the diminished fragment which
                                            in
represents       it.

                        the fragment         usually covered with
                                                           is            sort                     a

sometimes isolated and nearly hemispherical, more often are

    Among the many splendid services which Professor Abel
  has contributed, not only         the War Department
                                             to                  Woolwich,              at

                                            to
  over many years,              of
                           the various conditions for and results                                           of
  the combustion         explosive agents, including gunpowder.
                           of

128            Mr. N. S. Maskelyne on the Pitted
    He showed that by simply removing the gases rapidly
enough, as in an exhausted vessel, you might arrest entirely
the combustion of gunpowder—and, further, that another
element in the rapidity with which the combustion penetrates a
solid mass of that explosive is the density of the mass.     The
huge cubes of nearly two inches, no less than the other
varieties of “pebble’’ and “prismatic" forms of coarse-grain
powder employed in our large guns are, by their very manu
facture, lacking in mechanical homogeneity.
   Within the gun, where the pressure is some twenty-two or
twenty-three tons to the square inch, the process of combus
tion goes on rapidly, but can be regulated by adjusting the
density; and size of the gas-producing grains of gunpowder.
It furthermore goes on with greater intensity at some than at
other parts of the surface, in consequence of the variations in
                                                      *.
density; and at these points centres of combustion become
established—the relative depths in different parts of the sur
face to which the combustion would penetrate in any brief
period depending on the relative densities of the
granules or fragments of “cake,” which give to the gun
powder mass the character of a sort of breccia. At the dis
charge of the gun the released gases escape, together with a
few fragments, which are the cores of some of the cubes of
gunpowder which have not had time to be entirely consumed;
§.
and at the surface of these fragments the combustion will
  roceed at different centres of combustion, the depth of which
          on the density of the powder and the pressure exerted
on it  by the surrounding gases.
   At the same time the sudden removal of the vast pressure
in operation within the gun, and an initial velocity of 1400 feet
in a second, sufficiently explain, on Professor Abel's principle,
the extinction of the combustion of these projected fragments.
Their pitted surfaces are also explained as the result of me
chanical heterogeneity in the component particles of the
powder.
   With these points M. Daubrée appears to be in accord,
though he does not seem to have been aware of Professor
Abel's researches, as he does not refer to them.
   Let us now turn to the case of a meteorite. It enters our
atmosphere with at least a planetary velocity, which is at once
arrested by the resistance the body experiences in traversing
even the highest and rarest region of the aerial envelope of
our globe.
   The resulting heat at once fuses the surface of the stone or
iron; and though the fused and oxidized material is thrown off
(aided in most cases by a rotatory movement in the mass) as

   The probable errors here refer to the last figure of the pre
ceding decimal.        An examination of this Table shows that
there are, notwithstanding the extreme care with which the
observations were made, some unknown constant errors in ex
istence outweighing the apparent probable errors of the differ
ent measurements, and therefore interfering with the applica
tion of the theory given above, at least for rods Nos. 1 and 2.
I  hope by some future observations to discover the source of
the constant errors in question. The following Table gives the
values of E for each rod expressed in millions of pounds.

   While making      these experiments I met with a very elaborate
work   published   at St. Petersburg, entitled Recherches Expéri
mentales sur l'élasticité des Métaur faites à l'observatoire phy
sique central de Russie, par A. T. Kupffer.              Of brass, nine spe
cimens were     experimented        on—three of cast brass, three of
plate brass, and three of hammered. The experiments were
made :-first, by causing the rods to bend under given weights,
and measuring with vertical circles the inclinations of the ends
of the rods so bent; secondly, by causing the rods to vibrate
transversely when fixed by one end in a vertical position, the
other end being weighted, and counting the vibrations.                      The
results obtained    by   §.  two methods       agreed    very   satisfactorily.
The following Table gives the moduli of elasticity expressed in
millions of pounds for the nine specimens.

142                Mr. O. Heaviside                    on the      Eatra Current.
The actual potential is the sum of (17) and (20), and the actual
current the sum of (18) and (19).                                 When           g is large         the   initial
charge may be neglected altogether.       Considering only the
potential and current due to the initial current, we find that
the current in the wire consists of a series of decreasing waves
in opposite directions, causing corresponding changes in the
potential of the wire.  At the first moment after disconnexion
the potential         of the       end      Q becomes positive                    =vV; nearly,
and the end P negative to an equal extent.                Provided this elec
tromotive force      suddenly    developed      is not  sufficiently  great to
cause a spark, this state of things is rapidly reversed, the end P
becoming positive and the end Q negative, which is followed
by another reversal, and so on till the energy of the initial
current is all used up against the resistance of the wire.

quantity of electricity than the line or condenser originally

      “On Repulsion resulting from Radiation.”—Part                           III.       By
William Crookes, F.R.S. &c.
   This paper contains an account of experiments on the action of
radiation on bodies the surfaces of which have their radiating and
absorbing powers modified by various coatings.        The difference
between a white and a lampblacked surface in this respect was at
first not very decided; and experiments have been instituted with
the object of clearing up some anomalies observed in the actions.
Two pith disks, one white and the other black, were suspended on
a light arm in a glass bulb by means of a fine silk fibre; after
perfect exhaustion the white and black disks were found to be
equally repelled by heat of low intensity, such as from the fingers,
warm water, &c.    A
                             ºrp<U+017F>           ball was then tried at gradually             in
creasing temperatures.         Up           to 250° C. it repelled both equally,
above that the black was more repelled than the white, and at a full
red heat the repulsion of the black disk was very energetic.         A
lighted candle acts with more energy than the red-hot copper.
   The presence of even a small quantity of aqueous vapour in
the exhausted apparatus almost, if not quite, neutralizes the more
energetic action which luminous rays appear to exert on a blackened
surface.
   After describing several different modifications and some new
forms of apparatus devised to facilitate experiment, the author gives
a drawing of an instrument which enables him to get quantitative
measurements of the amount of incident light falling on                            it.   It
consists of   a flat bar      pith, half black and half white, sus

   The variations in the luminosity of a “standard” candle will
cease to be of importance.     Any candle may be taken; and if it be
placed at such a distance from the apparatus that it will give a
uniform deflection, say of 100 divisions, the standard can be repro
duced at any subsequent time; and the burning of the candle may
be tested during the photometric experiments by taking the deflection
it causes from time to time, and altering          distance,     needed,    its                  if                    to

   A comparison of these figures with those usually given in text
books to represent the distribution of heat in the spectrum is a
sufficient proof that the mechanical action of radiation is as much
a function of the luminous rays as it is of the dark heat-rays.

   In consequence of some experiments tried by Profs. Tait and
Dewar, and published in “Nature, July 15, 1875, the author fitted
up a very sensitive apparatus for the purpose of carefully examin
ing the action of radiation on alum, rock-salt, and glass. The
source of radiation was a candle.       Perfectly transparent and
highly polished plates of the same size were used; and the de
flection was made evident by an index ray of light. Taking the
action on the alum at 100, that on the rock-salt in five successive
experiments was 81, 77-3, 71, 62.5, 60:4.    This increasing action
on the alum was found to be caused by efflorescence, which took
place rapidly in the vacuum, and rendered the crystal partially
opaque.   A fresh alum plate being taken, this and the rock-salt
were coated with lampblack and replaced in the apparatus, the
black side away from the source of radiation, so that the radiation
would pass through the crystal before reaching the lampblack.
The action of radiation was in the proportion of blacked alum
100 to blacked rock-salt 73.
   Rock-salt and glass were next tested against each other in vacuo
in a torsion-balance. Professors Dewar and Tait say that rock-salt
is inactive when the beam from a candle is thrown on           while                                               it,   a

torsion-fibre, and the whole is enclosed in glass and connected with
the mercury pump and exhausted as perfectly as possible.              A
weight of 0.01 grain is so arranged that it can be placed on the
pith or removed from it at pleasure. A ray of light from a lamp
reflected from a mirror in the centre of the beam to a millimetre
scale 4 feet off shows the slightest movement.      When the reflected
ray points to zero, a turn of the torsion-handle in one or the other
direction will raise or depress the pith end of the beam, and thus
cause the index ray to travel along the scale to the right or to the
left. If a small weight is placed on one end so as to depress                                                        it,

    The author stated that the Trias of Devon and Somerset was
divisible into three groups, occupying distinct areas.
    The first lies north of the Mendip Hills, where the Trias is
 thinnest and assumes its simplest characters, consisting of marls and
 Dolomitic conglomerate, the former predominating, the latter not
 only occurring as a basement series, but in some cases persisting
 continuously upwards as the marginal equivalent of the marl, as
 Rhaetic beds overlie both alike.    South of the Mendips the Trias is
 similarly constituted, but is of much greater thickness.
    The second area embraces the country south of the Polden Hills as
 far as a north and south line through Taunton.
    The chief portion of the Trias in this area, as in the northern,
 consists of marls; but unless the breccias of Wembdon, near Bridge
 water, are portions of a basement series, faulted up, but elsewhere
 concealed, the lower division consists of sandstones found resting on
 the flanks of the Quantocks, flanking outliers of the older rocks,
 and here and there faulted up.
    In the lower parts of the marls in the Wale of Taunton and other
 places occasional beds of sandstone are found, which from their
 position may be regarded as equivalent to the Upper Keuper Sand
 stone of Professor Hull.    The sandstones of this area differ from the
 conglomerates of the Mendip country in occupying a definite subor
 dinate horizon to the marls, and not dovetailing into them.
    The third area, bounded on the north by the Bristol Channel, on
 the south by the English Channel, on the east by the Blackdown
 range, and on the west by the Culm and Devonian highlands,
 presents the most complex relations of the Trias in the south
 western counties.
    The upper member of the series, as in the other districts, consists
 of marls; they contain occasionally thin beds of sandstone towards
 the base, which may be considered, although apparently of local

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                              153
occurrence, as Upper Keuper Sandstone.         They are underlain by
sandstones. In these two upper divisions we have the continuation
of the whole Triassic series of the second area, and in the third
underlying division conglomerate and pebble-beds. From Watchet
to a point west of Wellington this division is represented by hard
bedded conglomerate, thence to the south coast by sands with rounded
grains and pebbles, at first of quartz grit and slate, gradually giving
place to the large foreign-derived quartzites of Budleigh Salterton.
   A second series of marls is found to underlie the conglomerate and
pebble-beds conformably.        This attains as much as 500 feet in
thickness near the south coast, but in the northern part of the
district does not appear to exceed 200 feet.
   The base of the series is composed of sandstone, breccia, and occa
sionally clays, occurring at different horizons in different parts of
the area, and each variety locally predominant over the others.
   The clay beds appear to be confined to the neighbourhoods of
Exeter and Crediton.       The upper part of the division south of
Bradninch seems to consist of red sandstones, the lowermost and
principal part of the division consisting of breccia. North of Brad
ninch the sandstone occupies the principal portion of the division,
sometimes apparently to the exclusion of the breccia.          Towards
Wiveliscombe the upper part of the series for from 15 to 30 feet con
sists of breccia and breccia-conglomerate, the major part consisting as
before of sandstones.    North of Wiveliscombe breccia begins to pre
vail, and in the Stogumber valley principally represents the division.
Owing to the conformity of the various members of this latter
group, they appear to represent continuous deposition.       We might
fairly consider the upper marls and sandstones as representing the
Keuper, as their average thickness taken together can scarcely be
under 1000 feet.
   The lowermost sandstone and breccia may be taken as equivalents
of part of the Bunter, as they are probably 1000 feet thick near the
south coast, and 300 where least developed.
   The representation of the Muschelkalk would                    lie
                                                          then between
the conglomerate and Lower Marl divisions, and the one rejected                        be

zation were to be expected. The force fell, during the first half of
this time; from 4.83 to 0-40, and then gradually rose to 1:37, to
sink again toward the close of the period mentioned; but the alte
rations took place slowly and without any quick leaps.
     It now appeared that if for only five minutes two Daniell ele
ments were closed between the one outer plate A and the middle
plate B, which carried hydrogen to the plate B, a change occurred in
the behaviour of the other side of B toward the second outer plate C.
     For example, in a series of experiments, immediately before
closing the current through A and B the pressure-difference between
B and C had been —0.6; after the current had been passing for
five minutes, while plate Cremained electrically insulated, the pres
sure-difference was -H 5-2 ; it then rose in the next three hours, the
plates being insulated, to 17:1; and 18 hours later it was again –3.
     In other experiments the current between A and B was closed
during 12 or 18 hours. The difference of potential between B and
and C was then greatest immediately after the interruption of that
 current, and gradually diminished during the hours that followed.
     When the current between A and B received the opposite direc
 tion, so that it urged oxygen toward B, the opposite result occurred
 on the other side of B, with the same quickness, and partly with
 same, partly with greater intensity than in the previous hydro
 gen polarization.       Whether this difference in the quantity of
 the effect is or is not conditioned by the antecedent hydrogen
 polarization cannot be decided from the experiments hitherto made.
 As sometimes the state of the plates B and C has been equalized
 by joining them to the circuit, a sensible quantity of hydrogen may
 then have been also carried over to C, and thence may arise the more
 powerful action of B, polarized with oxygen. In general, quanti
 tative determinations of the action were frustrated by the circum
 stance that the gas once forced into the plate only very slowly
 becomes equally diffused in its interior, and can only be removed
 again very slowly. Moreover the action is quite evident when only
 a single Daniell element between A and B is employed; and, on
 the other hand, the action of two Bunsen elements was but a
  trifle greater than that of two Daniells. The cause of this may be,
  that when electrolytic gas-production commences, the escaping
  portions of the gases withdraw themselves from the force which
    resses them into the platinum; and hence, probably, a further re
  inforcement of the electromotive force augments the decomposition
  of the water, but the pressure of the gases into the platinum is
  increased very little or not at all—as indeed it is known that the
  polarization of the plates, when once it has arrived at gas-develop
  ment, can be raised but little higher.
      When plates B and C were put for a short time in conducting
  connexion after B had been charged with gas from A, immediately
  after interruption of the conduction the difference of potential be
  tween the two was =0, but then rose again on the same side as it
  had been before the conducting connexion, in precisely the same
  way as this usually takes place when both plates have been polarized
   by an electric current led directly through them.

   This reappearance of a previous polarization        have already en            I
deavoured to account for    by  the depolarizing  current only removing
the gases from the most        superficial layer  of the platinum, new
supplies of gas pressing afterwards from the deeper parts to the
surface.   This takes place, therefore, in the same manner when
the entire store of gas is derived from the other side.
   Experiments made by Dr. Root, with a suitably modified appa
ratus, on the question whether free hydrogen in contact with the
off side of B, while free oxygen was on the off side of C, would
penetrate through the plates and produce polarization on the other
side, did not give sufficiently explicit results.   In these cases even
the electrical force is wanting which urges the positive hydrogen
molecules into the platinum.–Monatshericht der königlich preu

in which it occurs cannot be worked any further until a tunnel
has been run, and that it is quite uncertain when this will be done.
    Although by no means perfect, my results approach the truth
and give a fair idea of the composition of the mineral, even if the
evident admixture of other minerals, varying in the different sam
ples analyzed from about one to perhaps over twelve per cent., does
not permit one to calculate the atomic ratio of the constituents and
establish the constitution of this species. There is especially an
uncertainty with reference to the quantities of silicic acid, alumina,
and potassa which belong to the Roscoelite, or which may have been
introduced by admixtures of feldspathic and other minerals, as will
appear from the results given below, which show that the mineral,
when decomposed with sulphuric or dilute hydrofluoric acid, gene
rally gives only about six per cent. of potassa, while fusion with
 calcic carbonate and ammonic chloride yields from eight to nine per
 cent.    Some of these uncertainties      could have been removed      if  a
 larger quantity of the mineral had been at my disposal.
     Particular attention was paid to the correct determination of the
 vanadium, and the form in which it exists in the Roscoelite.
     The separation of vanadium is attended with great difficulties;
 and I have not found any of the methods of separation to give
 fully reliable results. This is in part owing to the incomplete pre
 cipitation of the vanadic acid, and in part to the impossibility of
 washing the precipitates completely without loss of vanadium.             It
 was therefore always determined by the only method which           I found
 to give fully reliable results—by titration with potassic permanganate.
     After the separation from the other elements, the vanadic acid
 was reduced by hydrosulphuric acid into V, O, which, after the ex
 cess of hydrosulphuric acid had been expelled by continued boiling,
 was reoxidized into V, O, by permanganate.           I have satisfied my
 self  by  numerous     experiments  that,  no matter whether only a very
 minute    quantity   of  sulphuric acid is present, or a very large excess,
 the V.O., is completely oxidized into V. O. by this process.
     For the determination of the state of oxidation of the vanadium
 in the Roscoelite, a quantity of the mineral was dissolved in dilute.
 sulphuric acid in a sealed tube at a temperature of about 180°C.,
 and was titred after cooling; the liquid was then reduced by
  hydrosulphuric acid; and after boiling-off the excess of the latter, it
 was again titred.        From the quantity of oxgyen required for oxi
 dation in both cases, it was found that vanadium in the mineral is
 present as W. On=2W, O, V, O..
     The determinations of the other elements were made by the usual
 methods.
     The finely powdered mineral was dried (unless otherwise stated)
 for two days over sulphuric acid; and the different samples gave the
  following results:—
     a (purest scales). The analysis was made by dissolving one
  portion in sulphuric acid and determining in this the quantity and
  state of oxidation of the vanadium, the silicic acid, and insoluble
  impurities. The latter were left behind in dissolving the silicic
  acid in sodic carbonate and gave 0.85 per cent. ; a second portion

was decomposed by sodic carbonate and nitrate, and a third for the
determination of the alkalies by                            J.
                                     L. Smith's method. The W. On
given below is the mean of the two determinations.        b (another
sample, not quite as pure as a) was analyzed by fusion. , c, still
more contaminated with impurities, was analyzed by dissolving in
dilute sulphuric acid in a sealed tube, &c.; ca is the result of this
analysis; c3 after deducting 11:45 per cent. of impurities. d
(another sample) was decomposed by dilute hydrofluoric acid; the
analysis was unfortunately lost, excepting the determinations given
below; the material for this analysis had not been dried over sul
phurie acid. e. This sample was dried over sulphuric acid for
several weeks; a portion, which was decomposed by sulphuric acid,
gave 5:37 per cent. insoluble silicates, 0:23 per cent. of gold, and
43.24 per cent. of silicic acid; the V.O., was determined by dif
ference.   The results given below were obtained by decomposing
the mineral by fusion.

M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, in 1871, pointed out that, in the spectrum
of a metal, the higher the temperature of the source, the nearer is
the brightest line to the ultra-violet; and he showed that a certain line
in the vicinity of the infra-red, visible at one temperature, ceases
to be so at a higher temperature, and that then some lines towards
the ultra-violet become visible which at first were not so. MM.
Brünner and Salet have remarked that hydrogen and a certain
number of metalloids gave different spectra when the nature of the
sources was different.
    Having been permitted to take advantage of the resources of the
laboratory under the direction of M. Desains at the Sorbonne,                                                  I
proposed to myself (1) to determine the distribution of the heat in
the calorific spectrum produced by a Bourbouze lamp and a re
fracting system of flint glass, (2) to study the variations of this
spectrum with the temperature of the source, and (3) to observe
also the absorption-spectra of various bodies, and their variations
with the temperature of the source.

   Granted that there is an inner structure of the molecule,
we should, a priori, expect that changes in this structure
would be correlated with changes in the functions of the
molecule.    And we must imagine that atomic motions are
continually taking place in the molecule; hence under certain
conditions these motions may be directed so as to result in
the development of a form of energy different from that which
is developed when the atomic motions are otherwise directed.
If  it be urged that the terms “molecule,” “atomic motion,”
&c. involve theoretical considerations, we grant the objection,
if objection it be. The same objection would apply to very
many of the most important dicta of science. Still it might
be said that by limiting our attention to the changes of function
(or of energy) we are dealing with facts, and with facts

will depend on the position of the parts; hence the two theories
will be complementary of each other.
    6. One    of the difficulties in the way of explaining the facts
of isomerism in terms of the molecular theory arises from our
ignorance of the conditions which influence the linking
together of atoms in a molecule.             Given the formula of a
substance and the valency of the atoms, it is possible to ar
range the symbols in a certain number of ways only ; each of
these methods      of arrangement may represent an isomeric body.
But we have often very good reasons for believing that of
these possible methods of arrangement two or more will
represent substances which are actually identical, not isomeric,
with each other.
    Thus if we replace one hydrogen atom in marsh-gas by

atom may be regarded as an expression for the number of
directions or of positions in which the atom is capable of
exercising chemical force. Thus when we say that the carbon
atom is tetravalent we mean, on this hypothesis, that it is
capable of exercising chemical force in four directions, or that

composed of the same atoms as those which actually were
produced, but differing in atomic structure, and in the amount,
or at any rate in the form, of the energy possessed by them.
   We have here isomerism which is chiefly due to a dif
ference in the value of the equivalents of the atoms of one of
the reacting molecules.
   Let us now imagine that the atoms of the reacting mole
cules were capable, as before, of exercising chemical force in
four and in two positions respectively, but that the force
exercised in each position is the same in amount.
   After the atomic interchanges have taken place (we may
suppose, for a moment, that these interchanges are accom
plished almost instantaneously, and that the resultant molecules
are removed from the sphere of mutual action) we have new
molecules, still, by supposition, capable of exercising chemical
force in two directions; but we may surely suppose that the
amount of force to be exercised in each of these directions is
not the same now as it was before the atoms had become asso
ciated.    The occupation, so to speak, of two of the positions
of possible action will most probably influence the force which
remains to be exercised at the two residual positions, even
supposing that originally an equal amount of force was
exercised at each of the four.    The phenomena of magnetism
and of    electricity make us  acquainted  with actions somewhat

similar to this.
    If we may carry the imagination one step further and sup
pose that the occupation of two positions has not only          in
fluenced the force to be exercised at the remaining positions,
but has also influenced it unequally, we shall now have a
molecule which is capable of forming isomers by a process
similar to that which was carried out in the case which we
first attempted to follow.
   If  we grant that the occupation of a certain number of the
positions at which an atom is capable of exercising chemical
force, by another atom, causes a change in the amount of
force remaining to be exercised at each of the residual posi
tions, we may also very well grant that upon the nature of the
occupying atom will greatly depend the extent of this           in
fluence.

    By substituting   a new, occupying    atom   of equal valency
with the original we shall produce not only a new molecule,
but a new molecule which is possessed of a different amount
of energy from that originally formed. On this supposition
we can trace the formation of isomers containing
atomic groups.
   Let us suppose that two molecules a and      b come  within the

occurs, but that in the case of molecule b this is not carried
out completely, that instead of the setting-free of single atoms,
groups (or at any rate a group) of atoms are produced ; these
groups become combined with the atoms which formerly con
stituted molecule a of the equivalents of these atoms some
are satisfied by the new atomic groups; and in this process
the remaining equivalents become altered in value (we have

mentary atoms will be influenced by the position of the
affinities mutually satisfied; or if we prefer to regard the
elementary atomic affinities as of equal value, we may still
suppose that the mutual action of two elementary atoms will
so modify the residuary affinities as to render possible the
formation of allotropic forms according to the position in the
molecule occupied by a third atom, which now comes within
the sphere of action of the molecule.     Or it may very pos
sibly be that both of these causes influence the formation of
allotropes.   We certainly know that the density of some
allotropic forms of the same element is not a constant number;
it appears also that changes of energy accompany the changes
of an elementary molecule from one allotropic form to
another.

XXIII.         Supplementary     Discussion of the Hydrodynamical
     Theory    of   Attractive and Repulsive Forces. By Professor
     CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.f
1.
      IN from
         the mathematical theories of the physical forces which
              time to time I have proposed and discussed in
this Journal, the reasoning has been uniformly made to rest
on the following principles:—
   All visible and tangible substances consist of atoms.
   An atom is a very small inert spherical mass of constant
form and magnitude.                     -
   All            occupied  by  atoms is filled by a perfectly fluid
              not
                     ...i.

substance (the           of uniform pressure and density when
at rest, and varying in pressure when in motion in exact pro
portion to variations of           its
                              density.
   All physical force acts either      pressure
                                              as                  of
                                                      the aether upon
the surfaces        of
                  atoms,           or
                                 reactionas      the atoms upon the
                                                        of
ather     by
           reason        of
                     the constancy                 of
                                          their form and magnitude.
     2.The selection          of
                          these  hypotheses      has been determined

               of Attractive and Repulsive Forces.          173
by two regulative principles:–(1) they must be perfectly intel
ligible from sensation and experience; (2) they are required
to be appropriate foundations of mathematical reasoning. The
aether, being assumed to be susceptible of variation of density,
must be conceived to be atomically constituted, because we
have no experience of variation of density and pressure which
is not the result of atomic constitution.   But for the purposes
of physical research, it suffices to regard the aether as a con
tinuous substance, and to apply calculation to it as such, just
as the air is treated mathematically in Hydrodynamics, although
it is known to be composed of discrete atoms. After adopting
these views, the atoms of the aether do not individually come
 under consideration.
    3. In this philosophy the only admissible form of force is
pressure, because we have distinct perception of such force,
 and such only, by personal act and sensation, as when the
 hand is pressed against any substance.
    4. According to the foregoing principles of theoretical
 physics it is not allowable to make any assumption respecting
 the laws of action of the physical forces, inasmuch as these
 laws have to be deduced by strict mathematical reasoning
 from the above stated hypotheses. This I consider to be the
 legitimate application of the rules and principles of philosophy
 suggested by Newton at the beginning and the end of the
 third book of the ‘Principia.’ To deduce exclusively from these
 hypotheses the modes of operation of the various physical
 forces, and to compare the theoretical results with facts of
 observation and experiment, might well seem to be an arduous
 task.    Since, however, the Newtonian principles of philosophy
 can   only by such means be tested or established, an upholder
 of those views could not do otherwise than enter upon this
undertaking.     Accordingly   I  have devoted much time and
research to  problems  the solutions of which are demanded by
this course of philosophy; and, in particular,       I
                                                    have endea
voured to infer the laws of attractive and repulsive forces from
modes of pressure of the aetherial medium. The furthest ad
vance   I  have made towards the solution of this essentially
important but difficult problem is given in arts. 30–39
of a communication contained in the Number of the Philoso
phical Magazine for September 1872.          The object of the
present communication is to correct in certain respects that
investigation and to carry it a step further; and with this
object in view I shall begin with reproducing here so much
of the antecedent argument as may be required for making
intelligible the proposed extension of  it.
   5.   In the Philosophical   Magazine for August 1862, but

174            Prof. Challis     on the Hydrodynamical   Theory
  more accurately and completely in pages 201–228 of ‘The
  Principles of Mathematics and Physics,”           I have obtained par
 ticular solutions of the general hydrodynamical equations ap
    licable to the motion of a fluid for which p=a^p, without
      ving made previously any supposition as to the circum
 stances under which the fluid was put in motion.                These re
  sults, as depending on no special arbitrary conditions, but only
  on the general analytical hypothesis that ude--rdy--wdz is
  an exact differential, are considered to give the laws of spon
  taneous mutual action between the parts of the fluid.                The
  motion thence     resulting   is characterized   by  being symmetrical
  with respect to an aris, and by consisting wholly of harmonic
  vibrations partly parallel and partly transverse to the axis.
      6. It is not necessary to introduce here the details of the
 abstract reasoning whereby this particular motion was reached;
 but it is important to remark that as the solution is unique
 and definite it cannot without error be left out of consideration
 in applications of general solutions of the hydrodynamical
                                        j.
 equations, and that it must be taken into account before pro
 ceeding to apply such solutions to cases of motion taking
 place under given arbitrary circumstances.               This being pre
 mised,   I  shall now adduce the      investigation   of that particular
 motion in sufficient detail for the present purpose ; and in
 order to give the means of acquiring fuller information, re
 ferences will be made to the pages of the above mentioned
 work, or to Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine, in which
 the several steps of the reasoning are completety discussed.
      7. A differential equation,               I       the first general
 equation of hydrodynamics, being formed on the principle
 that the directions of motion in each given element are normal
 to surfaces of displacement in successive instants, it may be
 shown that if uda + way--wdz be an exact differential (dy),
 the motion is spontaneously rectilinear where \! has a maxi
 mum or minimum value (Props. VII. and XI. in pages 186
 and 201 ; the reasoning is given better in arts. 32—35 of the
 communication in the Philosophical Magazine for September
 1872). Accordingly, assuming that there would be rectilinear
 motion along an awis, it may be supposed, for the rest of the
 motion, that        (d.Wr)=(d       $), and, the ordinates          being
                                                                       2

gether depends on the a priori determination of the laws of

which, apart from any particular mode of disturbing the air,
are found to be expressible by definite mathematical formulae.
The reality of this class of vibrations had been established by
experience, inasmuch as it had been ascertained that indepen
dently of particular producing circumstances sounds are recog
nized by the sense of hearing as consisting of fundamental
notes and accompanying harmonics.         Obviously, therefore, the
accounting for such vibrations by abstract argument founded
on the general equations of hydrodynamics was a problem
demanding solution.       The appropriate solution        claim to                        I

tance from the plane. As preliminary to the solution of our
problem, we have to determine under what hydrodynamical
conditions such motion takes place. As long ago as the year
1848     Ipointed out that the exact solution, according to the
usually received principles of hydrodynamics, of the problem
of plane-waves conducted to an absurd result, indicative of
defect of principle. Subsequently                           I
                                     ascertained that the failure
of the reasoning arose from not previously taking into account
the primary spontaneous vibrations, which, as already argued
in art. 8, it is logically necessary to employ for satisfying
the conditions of arbitrarily imposed motion.     In the theory
of sounds it appeared that the required conditions could be
fulfilled by means of sums of spontaneous vibrations (arts. 8
and 9). In like manner, as                        I
                                 am about to show, the condi
tions of the problem of plane-waves may be fulfilled by sums
of uncompounded aetherial vibrations. It should, however, be
noticed that whereas for aerial vibrations the transverse
motions might be neglected and the factors f, g, h, &c. each
be taken to be unity, this is no longer the case when we have
to deal with such small wave-lengths as those which pertain
to vibrations of the aether. Considering, however, that in the
proposed application of the formulae for the primary vibrations
the distance r from the axis will always be very small com
pared with X, and that the constant e varies inversely as                                          A*,

   Now the principle already adopted in the foregoing theory
of musical sounds requires that the plane-waves of the present
problem should be supposed to be made up of sums of the
spontaneous vibrations defined by the above three equations.
I  have been compelled, by a logical necessity, to abandon the
hypothesis of uncompounded plane-waves such as are usually
admitted in hydrodynamics, having obtained absurd results
when the reasoning on that hypothesis was made to include
terms of the second order.            It will therefore be supposed
that the  plane-waves    of our   problem    are composed of an un
limited number of spontaneous vibrations,                      the same                   all   in
phase    of vibration and    having   their axes      parallel,     being          all                   it
presumable that under these conditions the transverse vibra
tions will         be
                wholly neutralized.

wave at any point of a plane cutting transversely a diameter
of the sphere drawn in the direction of the incidence of the

contribute nothing to the condensation at the surface of the
 sphere if the plane cuts the second hemispherical surface, be
 cause in that case their axes are intercepted by the first
hemispherical surface; whereas the corresponding components
 will be fully effective, as respects their condensation, at the
first half-surface, because, although they are reflected at this
 surface, the effect of the condensation accompanying this re
 flection may, by what is said in art. 13, be left out of con
º
 sideration.   It appears from this argument that to find the
 whole accelerative action on the sphere we have only to find
the accelerative action, on the first hemispherical surface, of
so much of the incident waves as is composed of the intercepted
vibrations, inasmuch as this action is not opposed by corre
           condensations on the second hemispherical surface.

the latter may, for reasons already given, be left out of account,
so that we have only to calculate the accelerative action on the
sphere resulting from the velocity W sin 6. This velocity
takes place along the intersection of the spherical surface b
any plane passing through the axis from which 6 is
inasmuch as the motion is evidently symmetrical with respect
to this axis. Thus we have here a case of constrained motion
uninfluenced by the action upon the fluid of any extraneous
accelerative force.  Hence, if V be the velocity at any point
at any time t, and a' be the corresponding condensation, we
shall have by a known formula,

measure by their mutual repulsions; but in proportion as a
    oup is further from the centre it will be acted upon in the
  irection from the centre by a residual repulsion which re
quires to be counteracted by attractive action towards the
centre. The latter force is supplied by the waves composed
of the individual emanations from the whole number of atoms,
for which waves kn will be a very large number. The least
 number of atoms of a given substance which constitute a mass
which is thus self-contained may be called a molecule of that
 substance.     It has long appeared to me that the received
 mode of    attributing attractive and repulsive forces to occult
 virtues emanating from particles or points leaves wholly un
 explained why some forces are repulsive and others attractive.
 This fact is fully explained by the present theory, which ac
 counts for such diverse action of forces by modes of pressure of
 the aetherial medium.

dence of a series of waves on a movable sphere.         This is the
case of Example        VII.
                          in the ‘Principles of Physics, a solu
tion of which to small quantities of the first order is given
in pages 296–298. Another solution, including terms of the
second order, which is attempted in pages 446–452 of the
same work,       I
                subsequently found to be faulty on account of
 its involving the supposition            of

magnet-core by an earth-wire or by any conducting substance
held in the hand and presented to the core". These sparks
are best seen when the electromagnet-coils, interrupter, and
battery-cells are completely insulated from the ground.                    The
substitution of a bar of any metallic substance, or even carbon
or wood coated with tinfoil, in place of the iron core of the
electromagnet, does not prevent the production of the spark.
With bars of zinc or cadmium, or, better still, of either of these
metals amalgamated on the surface, the sparks are brighter.
   The minuteness of the sparks makes observation of them a
matter of some difficulty; between two points of graphite
pencils in a dark box they are more readily seen.                    They are

 obtained had never exceeded the quarter of a millimetre in
           and were quite incapable of producing a luminous
 discharge through a small vacuum-tube.
    The following experiments led to the method desired:—
    A rod of soft iron 20 centims. in length was wrapped in
 folds of vulcanized sheet rubber to a thickness of 2 centims.
 Around the exterior of this 150 centims. of stoutly insulated
                                                                       193
 copper wire were wound. One end of this wire was connected
 with one terminal of the secondary wire of a small induction
 coil", the other end was brought within 15 millims. of the other
 terminal.     The intent of this arrangement was to pass, as in
the previous experiments, an intermittent current around a
 metallic conductor.        When the coil was set in action the
 secondary currents passed with rapid discharge across the
interval of about 15 millims. between the end of the wire and
the terminal; and it was then found that sparks of several
 millimetres length could be drawn from the iron rod within
 the folds of vulcanized rubber by an earth-wire, or by the
finger, or by any conductor held in the hand. It was found
impossible to convey any charge from the iron rod by a proof
[...
  lane to an electroscope; and on leading a wire to a sensitive
            galvanometer by Colladon no deflection was obtained,
though the sparks were drawn from the wire beyond the
                                                                   .
    lvanometer, through which the force thus manifesting itself
must therefore have passed.            Identical effects followed the
substitution of bars of copper, cadmium, and zinc for the
iron rod.
    It was next ascertained that no perceptible difference of
potential existed between the two         id:   of the metal rod, and
none between the ends and the median portion.                  The spark
could be drawn        indifferently   at either  end,  or at the
but not from two points at once; nor could it be led by an
insulated wire from one point of the bar to another. Other
metallic objects in the neighbourhood of the bar became
 similarly affected ; and from them sparks could be drawn.
 These effects were augmented when the distance of 15 millims.
over which the secondary current of the coil discharged itself
as a spark was increased to 20 millims.               They diminished
when the distance was reduced to 5               millims.,   and ceased
entirely when the interval was reduced to nothing, so that the
secondary current of the coil passed along unbroken metallic
                               ...
 connexions.      The conclusion to which these results pointed
   * This coil, capable of throwing sparks of 50 millims. length with two
cells of Grove's element, was            in most of the succeeding experi
ments.    Each piece of apparatus used, including the cells of the battery,
 was carefully insulated from the table.

This surmise might be directly tested by increasing the size

WIre.

preceding experiments.  It remained practically, unchanged

poles of zinc, mercury, or carbon.          Their brilliance was
augmented and their length was increased to above 20 millims.
when w was withdrawn so far from T that only a faint brush
discharge passed across from w to T, a distance of about
50 millims. ; and a still greater effect was produced when T
was directly connected with earth. This modification virtually
changed the arrangement to that indicated in fig. 4*.
    6. When the spark obtained between Q and the earth-wire
C exceeds 4 millims. in length, it is capable of illuminating a
small vacuum-tube.       The illumination differs, however, in a
remarkable manner from that produced by the ordinary direct
discharge of the induction-coil.      Instead of the usual pheno
mena of a small brush of        light at the positive pole, and a
bright aureole or glow surrounding the negative pole, the
illumination is symmetrical, alike at each pole, having both
 brush and glow at each, and is unaltered by reversing the
 primary circuit of the coil. An occasional flash, however,
 seemed to glow at one pole or at the other.
    On making single contacts by holding the break-piece of
 the induction-coil in the fingers the effect was as follows:—
 at each make-of-contact no illumination ; at each break-of
 contact an illumination of the same symmetrical nature, afford
 ing no evidence of polarity of discharge in one direction more
 than in another.
     7. To ascertain whether the discharge at the two poles was
 simultaneous or alternating, a rotating mirror was placed be
 side the vacuum-tube.      The images were found to be, roughly
 speaking, alternate, the discharges being alternately from
 either pole. The irregularity of the alternation appeared to
  be dependent partly upon the distribution of the resistances
  in the circuit, partly upon the irregularities in the vibrations
  of the break. The occasional flashes of light at one pole or
  the other were explained by the occasional appearance in the
  mirror of two contiguous images having the same position,
  indicating the occurrence of two consecutive discharges in the
                        ...
  same direction.
     With rotating slits the same phenomenon of reciprocating
  discharge was              though less advantageously.

XXVI.   On a repetition of Dr. Kerr's Experiments on a new
  Relationbetween Electricity and Light.  By    E. H. GoR                  J.
  DoN, B.A., Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge".
    HAVE    been for some months             on a repetition of
     the experiments   described  by Dr. Kerr in the Philo
sophical Magazine for November and December 1875.                                                I
have as yet been absolutely unable to obtain Dr. Kerr's
result; and         I
               think, when                        I
                               have described the precautions
taken,     I
         shall be able to show that either Dr. Kerr's success
or my failure is due to some cause not yet noticed by either
of us; in any case the cause of the difference in our results
will be worth looking for.
                                 The optical arrangements.
  The polarizing apparatus consisted of a Nicol's prism and
collimator, as described by me in my last papert.      e end of
the collimator which carried the prism projected through a
hole in a screen, which protected the observer from stray light.
The collimating-tube was fixed in cement to the brick ex
perimenting-table.
  Monochromatic light was used, generally that of a powerful
paraffine lamp, coloured red by means of a test-tube containing
coloured liquid and hung in front of the prism.
   Sometimes a solar spectrum was thrown on a card, a slit in
which admitted one colour to the Nicol.

  In   this process we see that in every alternate line the letter
c disappears from the coefficient of w, that in every fourth
line, starting with the second, the letter b disappears, and that
in the          line the letter a disappears; while p disappears
from the final result, and the other letters, each raised to the
power #, are left in the denominator.
   It is evident that the above procedure is quite general, and
that, following the law of succession there indicated, one letter
is always absent after each differentiation.     To state the law,
suppose (for greater convenience) the order of the n letters                             re

nate one starting from the end an a, in every alternate one of
those that are vacant beginning with the second a b, in every
alternate one of those that are still vacant, beginning with the
fourth, a c, and so on, we obtain the order in question, which is
          pabacabadabacabaeabacabadabacabafabaca                                    ...        .
This is of course the binary law; viz., if we write down in order
the numbers in the binary scale 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111,
1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, &c., then every alternate one
ends with 1; every fourth one, starting with the second, ends
with 10; every eighth one, beginning with the fourth, ends
with 100, and so on ; and the reason is the same in the two
cases.    *
   A littlethought shows that if in the differentiations this suc
cession be followed, each letter must disappear when          turn                                    its
comes, and that, after                   all
                             the operations are performed, each
letter except will  p   left    the denominator with exponent

show somewhat less salt than previously ($ 82), where the
 cryohydrate was obtained from a saturated solution, and where
 the amount of salt was determined by simple evaporation.                         I
 now find the melting-point of the cryohydrate to be —2°C.;
 and the temperature of the cryogen is exactly the same.                         In
 the above-given       determinations of the           cryohydrate       and of the
 solubility at 0°C. the solution was oxidized with nitric acid,
 the sesquioxide was precipitated with ammonia and weighed ;

observation on the separation of ice could be got, namely that
of the 3-per-cent. solution, which gave up ice at –0°4.

   The cryohydrate of acetate of potassium has not yet been
determined.
         temperature of the cryogen of acetate of potassium is
   The
 –25° C.
   It is well known that fused acetate of potassium is heavier
than the anhydrous solid acetate at the same temperature; but
I do not find the remarkable fact anywhere noticed, that the
fused anhydrous salt is also lighter than the aqueous solution
of the salt saturated at ordinary temperatures (17° C.).

possibility of the condition of supersaturation being maintained
even in solutions from which crystals of sugar are being depo
sited. Also, as was so notably the case                     alcohol, the cryo

dict that in order to boil a solution of gum a temperature
above 100°C. would be required.            This was,  I  confess, m
own persuasion until       I was enlightened by the above experi
ments on the separation of water as ice from gum-solutions of
all strengths.     But being so enlightened     I was able to predict
that a solution of    gum    would       at a temperature  not above
100° C.      A 20-per-cent, solution     of gum arabic appeared to
boil in a test-tube over the bare flame below 100° C. But as
it is almost impossible to avoid a certain amount of decompo
sition under these circumstances, a tube holding a fresh
quantity of the 20-per-cent. solution was placed in a wider
tube containing a solution of chloride of sodium which boiled
at 104°C.

                On heating the latter gradually the gum-solution
could be made to boil
    by  rapid heating
                            É.     the brine began to do so. And
                        the latter were made to boil, the gum-solu
tion boiled   violently,  and continued to do so after the brine
had ceased.       A thermometer in the gum-solution showed
 100° C.     Further, a 40-per-cent. solution of gum arabic when
surrounded by boiling water boils at 98°          &   or two degrees
lower than the water.
    § 163. Albumen.—Dry albumen when mixed with ice can
only depress the temperature 0°-25 C. Four parts by weight
of water and one of albumen, both at 18°2, gave, on mixture,
a temperature of 19°5.         In another experiment the common
temperature rose from 19° to 21°. In the above experiments
commercial albumen was used. For more exact experiments
white of egg was used, which analysis showed consisted of
 13:37 per cent. of albumen (dried at 100°C.) and 86-63 of
 water. Such white of egg begins to separate ice at 0°C., and
 freezes into a solid mass at -0°5.           A solution diluted to
 5 per cent. begins to give up ice at 0°C., and is solid at

either or any of the constituents—witness the “fusible metals.”
When metals are alike in chemical affinities, they have little
affinity for one another. They mix mainly by diffusion. They
dilute one another.                     If
                          we mix sodium with sodium, we cer
tainly dilute each sodium with the other; the adhesion which
we supply is exactly equal to the cohesion which we replace;
the resulting mass is identical with    constituents.    But               its                                          if

   In the third chapter the author divides the entire surface of the
moon into three great classes—namely plains, craters, and moun
tains, the former consisting of the dark and light plains. The well
known formations, “craters,” he divides into nine classes—namely
walled plains, mountain rings, ring plains, crater plains, craters,
craterlets, crater pits, crater cones, and depressions; while he reckons
as many as twelve classes of mountains—namely the great ranges,
highlands, mountains, and peaks, constituting the greater elevations,
while the hill-lands, plateaus, hills, and mountain-ridges form the
lesser; he also particularizes hillocks, mounds, ridges, and land
swells as comprising the smaller irregularities of the surface.
 Although the number of these divisions is somewhat extensive,          it
 will be useful in studying the smaller lunar features, especially
such as occur on the walls of the larger plains.        Portions of these
 walls Mr. Neison is disposed to regard as forming parts of long
continuous mountain-ranges—a view, if we mistake not, which has
 been previously promulgated—many          of the walled and ring-plains
 “appearing,” he says, “more like confluent plains or spaces          en
closed by intersecting mountain-chains.”           The most interesting
objects in the author's classification of craters are “crater-cones,”
of which he says: —“Perhaps the true representatives upon the
             *g.
 moon of the existing terrestrial volcanoes have only of late years
had their distinctive features recognized, and even when excep
tionally well placed are only with difficulty distinguishable from
the bright                      and minute white spots dispersed over
the lunar surface.       Steep conical hills or mountain-peaks, from
 one half to two or three miles in diameter, with deep cone-like
central depressions scarcely one half of this size in diameter, they
remain in high illumination, visible as white brilliant spots of
 minute dimensions, and only under favourable conditions can their
central apertures be detected even in the most powerful instru
ments. .   .  . . Under any circumstances they are difficult to
distinguish from bright mountain-peaks and white spots, whilst in
 many ways they bear a considerable resemblance to terrestrial
volcanic cones; and it is therefore not without interest to find that
many phenomena perhaps indicating actual lunar changes present
 themselves in observing these objects.” . In this chapter the author
 draws attention to those remarkable features known as rills or
clefts, and the great ray-systems, also to the different varieties of
brightness and colour found on the surface of our satellite.
    Chapter IV. is devoted to general lunar history; we, however,
think that, had the author given separately the two branches of
history, viz. that which culminated in the advanced state of the
lunar theory and that which has reference to the surface, both (as
at present) arranged chronologically, some little trouble to the
selenographer would have been saved.
   The last chapter, W., of those forming the Introduction treats of
the variations of the surface; and of these the author has taken, as
it appears to us, the most consistent and truthful views, considering
that so little is really known of the vast majority of the minor
details of the moon's surface.      He says that “a very considerable
alteration of the  present   constitution of the surface might occur at

is made the primary object of expensive expeditions.   The establish
ment of more observatories in arctic lands, and the strengthening
of those already formed, would be of far greater service to science,
and productive of greater gain to navigation and general useful
knowledge.    Austria is willing to join in international establish
ments of this kind.   He refers to Sir J. C. Ross's Antarctic Expe
dition as a model scientific voyage, and draws attention to the good
results of the economic expeditions wintering in the Spitzbergen
archipelago, and devoted to physical and meteorological observation
rather than to geographical discovery. The loss of the open weather
by long sledging expeditions destroys real scientific research.
Arctic research is of the highest importance to the knowledge of
nature's laws; but independent series of observations (especially if
chiefly devoted to geography) have but little value, compared with
stationary observatories encircling the arctic lands, and working on.
synchronous magnetic “term-days” and other agreed times and
periods, without which physical, astronomical, and meteorological
phenomena cannot be reduced to their natural laws.

THE“Preliminary
     following paper was read:—
                 Note on the Compound                          Nature of the Line
Spectra of Elementary Bodies.”             By   J.   N. Lockyer, F.R.S.
   In   a former communicationto the Royal Society (Proc. vol. xxii.
p. 380, 1874)     I referred
               spectra
                          briefly to the possibility that the well
known line         of the elementary bodies might not result from
the vibration of similar molecules; and                    I
                                            was led to make the
remark in consequence of the differences in the spectra of certain
elements as observed in the spectrum of the sun and in those
obtained with the ordinary instrumental appliances.
   Ihave now clear evidence that the molecular grouping of calcium
which, with a small induction-coil and small jar, gives a spectrum
with its chief line in the blue, is nearly broken up in the sun (and
quite broken up in the discharge from a large coil and jar) into
another or others with lines in the violet.
   I say “another” or “others,” because                I
                                               have not yet been able
to determine whether the last-named lines proceed from the same
or different molecules; and it is possible we may have to wait for
photographs of the spectrum of the brighter stars before this point
can be determined.
   This result enables us to         fix
                                 with very considerable accuracy the
electric dissociating conditions which are equivalent     the degree    to

    My DEAR LocKYER,-You might perhaps like that should put                                                   I
on paper the substance of the remarks         made last night as to the         I
evidence of the dissociation of calcium.
    When a solid body such as a platinum wire, traversed by a vol
taie current, is heated to incandescence, we know that as the tempe
rature increases, not only does the radiation of each particular
refrangibility absolutely increase, but the proportion of the radia
tions of the different refrangibilities is changed, the proportion of
the higher to the lower increasing with the temperature.         It would
                                                                    .
be in accordance with analogy to suppose that as a rule the same
would take place in an incandescent surface, though in this case
the spectrum would be discontinuous instead of continuous.           Thus
if A, B, C, D, E denote conspicuous bright lines, of increasing re
frangibility, in the spectrum of the vapour, it might very well be
that at a comparatively low temperature A should be the brightest
and the most persistent; at a               temperature, while all were
brighter than before, the relative brightness might be changed, and
C might be the brightest and the most persistent, and at a still
higher temperature E.          now, the quantity   If,persistence were                     of                                in
each case reduced till                        all
                            lines but one disappeared, the outstanding
line might              the lowest temperature,
                              be        at              the higher,                            at                                at

   The following paper was read:—
   “On the Force caused by the Communication of Heat between a
Surface and a Gas, and on a New Photometer.”      By Prof. Osborne
Reynolds.
   This paper contains an account of an experimental investigation
undertaken with a view to support, by absolute measurements, the
theoretical arguments by which the author endeavoured to prove the
existence of reactionary forces or “heat-reactions” whenever heat
is communicated from a surface to a gas, and vice versá, and the
connexion between these forces and the motion caused by heat and
light falling on bodies in vacuo.
    Since the publication of the author's paper on this subject in the
“Proceedings’ for April 1874, the correctness of his conclusions
with regard to the existence of these heat-reactions has not been
controverted or even questioned; while Professors Tait and Dewar,
after an elaborate investigation, entirely confirm the author, not only
in these conclusions, but also in his view as regards the explanation
of Mr. Crookes's experiments.         Mr. Crookes, however, appears
entirely to repudiate this explanation, arguing,
    1. That he obtains his best results in vacua so perfect that there
                                                                         -
is no air either to receive the heat or react on the surface.
    2. That the force is radiant in character.
    3. That light, as well as heat, produces the motion, which conse
 quently cannot be due to the heating of the surface.
    Having obtained one of the beautiful little “light-mills” con
 structed by Dr. Geissler, of Bonn, the author was in a position to
 make quantitative measurements of the effects produced and of
 the force producing them.
    In the first place, with regard to the sufficiency of the residual
air to cause the motion. It was found that this air              with the             is,

   As regards the possibility of the motion being in any way the
direct result of radiation.   This supposition the author had pre
viously shown to be directly contradicted by the fundamental law
of motion, that action and reaction are equal. A cold body runs
away from a hot body, while, if free to move, the hot body will
run after the cold body, showing that the force does not act from
body to body, but that each body propels itself through the sur
rounding medium in a direction opposite to            hottest side, the                    its

W. Weber's       theory assumes. Those experiments might possibly
 have been decisive against the existence of such an action. They
 were not so; but, on the other hand, through this negative result
 the existence of the action in question remained unproved.                  Mr.
 Rowland has now carried out a series of direct experiments, in the
 physical laboratory of the University here, which give positive proof
 that the motion of electrified ponderable substances is also electro
magnetically operative.                I
                                    here remark that he had already con
ceived and    fully  considered the plan of his experiments when he
came to    Berlin,  without any previous cooperation on my part.
    The moved bearer of the electricity was a disk of ebonite 21:1
centims. in diameter and 3 centim. thick. It could revolve with
great velocity (up to 61 times in a second) about a vertical axis
fixed in its centre.       The ebonite disk was gilt on both sides; but
the   gilding  was insulated from the axis. Near                      it,

of the needle, the length of which was normal to the radius of the
disk, was such as would have been produced by a positive electric
current flowing with the rotation of the positively charged disk, or
against the rotation of the disk charged negatively.
   There was no alteration in the action when the gilding of the
ebonite plate was removed in a series of radial lines, so that annu
lar electric currents could no longer take place. A thin plate of
glass was also inserted instead of the gilt ebonite, and, like the
disk of a Holtz machine, could be electrified through points; while
close beneath it there was a gilt resting plate connected to earth,
in order to fix as much electricity as possible. The direction of the
deflections was the same as in the previous experiments; but they
were smaller, as the conditions were not so favourable for strong
electrification.
    In order to compare the electricity carried forward by convection
with that which passes in conductors, experiments were instituted
in the following manner.                                                 -
    The ebonite disk was    gilded afresh, and the gold coating divided,
 by a series of fine circular lines, into rings insulated from one
 another.     The innermost ring was connected with the axis; the
 rest could not at any rate become considerably charged without
 discharging themselves by very short sparks from one to the other.
 Two electrified plates, each having the form of a sector of a
 circle, but which did not reach to the axis, were placed, opposite to
 one another, above and below the rotating plate.          Under these
 circumstances the electricity of the gold rings must have been ac
 cumulated by electrostatic induction in the sector covered by the
 last-mentioned plates, and carried forward convectively.         When
 this electricity was positive, it became free at the fore margin of
 the induced sector (in the direction of the rotation), while at the
 hind margin of the same, continually new positive electricity being
 attached, relatively negative electricity became free.
    The positive electricity must, under these conditions, have over
 flowed from the fore to the hind margin of the sector, for which
 there were in each ring two paths open, between which it must
 have divided itself in the inverse ratio of their resistances.      the               If

direction, must have been shown on the sector.
   The experiments showed that, when the sector was small                              (§   of

the circumference), the small difference between the convection           1
and the conduction 4 in general could not (or at least not with
certainty) be detected, that therefore, with approximate equality
of convection and conduction, the electrodynamic effect of the one
sensibly neutralized that of the other.
   When, however, the sector took in half of the circumference, the
here assumed current could be observed even in the free portion
of the disk, though the amount was too small for safe measure
ment.
     The observed electrodynamic action being so little in the fore
 going experiments, in which the disk was electrified and covered in
 its whole extent by the induced plates, theoretical calculation of
 the amount of the action from the known absolute values of the
 electrodynamic constants promised only approximately accordant
 values.    Nevertheless it was carried out by Mr. Rowland.
    The proportion in which the action of the earth's magnetism upon
 the pair of astatic needles was diminished was ascertained by finding
 the oscillation-period, first with the needles equally directed, and
 then arranged astatically.
    The value of the function of the electric potential in the Leyden
 battery, and on the rotating disk, was determined according to the
 law of spark-length given by Sir William Thomson, which in this
 case appeared sufficiently accurate.       Before and after each experi
 ment, a smaller jar was charged from the battery of nine
 ones containing the store of electricity, and on it the length of the
 spark was determined.
    The velocity of the rotation was regulated by the position of the
 balls of a centrifugal governor, which was applied to one of the more
 slowly rotating axes. The calculation from the magnitude of the
 rollers agreed well with the determination by the tone of a siren
 disk, which was for some time attached to the most rapidly re
volving axis.
    In the calculation of the distribution of the electricity on the
disk, and     itselectromagnetic directing-force, the surplus charge
present  at  the margin        the disk was reckoned according
                              of                                   to   the
value which holds for       infinitely  thin disks, and considered  as   an
infinitely thin thread concentrated          atthe margin—a proceeding
which was     inboth ways only approximately correct, but,   in   presence
of  the minuteness       of
                         this  portion,  was sufficient.
   The influence exerted upon the upper needle was about           ºr    of
that upon the lower.         The horizontal force  of    the earth's mag
netism was    put  equal      to
                              0-182  (using  the centimetre,  gramme, and
second  as  units);  the  electrodynamic    constant was    by

   The mechanical arrangement adopted is a very simple one. The
rod of the pendulum is of round steel, with an adjusting screw at
the lower end: a round rod of vulcanite with a hole in the centre
is passed on to the steel rod, fitting it loosely, and being held in
place by the adjusting screw. The bob of the pendulum consists
of a heavy mass of brass with a hole through the centre large enough
to admit the vulcanite, over which it passes, and, by a properly
arranged stop, rests on the end of the vulcanite furthest from the
lower end of the pendulum; so that any expansion of the vulcanite
elevates the brass bob, thus compensating for the downward ex
pansion of the steel rod and brass bob.
   There is a simple mechanical arrangement for adjusting the
proper difference between the length of the vulcanite and the other
parts of the pendulum.
   For a second pendulum to an astronomical clock          have used              I
the following dimensions—diameter        of the steel rod 6 millims.,
diameter of vulcanite 25 millims., length of same 165 millims.,
diameter of brass bob 63 millims., length of the same 156 millims.
These dimensions are in no way insisted on as being the best. For
a half-second pendulum                 I
                              have used a steel rod 3 millims. in dia
meter, vulcanite 11 millims. in diameter and 63 millims. long, brass
bob 38 millims. in diameter and 57 millims. long.
   I have had one of these pendulums attached to an astronomical
clock; and, after adjustment, it has been running four months with
very satisfactory results.    Should this form of pendulum prove
itself constant and correct, it would certainly be a convenient one
for transportation, and very much less costly than the ordinary
form.    And as for the half-second pendulum, in such constant use
in mantle-clocks, it will be of the greatest service and not add more
than twenty cents cost to the commonest form of pendulum that
can be used.
    As regards the uniformity of the coefficient of expansion of                                        all
vulcanites,       of
                  course       not

                                    several different specimens; and the
results vary little from each other. The range                          of

as effectually as either heat, or electricity; and the energy
thus employed is as really and truly converted into mechanical
energy as was the heat or the electricity in the cases to which
§.
 we have referred.      An electrical machine driven by water
  ower will as effectually produce electricity as though it were
         by steam-power or by horse-power; and the electricity
produced will as truly be derived from gravity in the one
 case as it would be from heat or from animal power in the
other cases.
    If then it be admitted, as it must be, that in the case of the
electricity produced by the machine driven by steam-power
the electricity previously existed under the form of heat,
for the same reason it ought to be admitted that the elec
tricity produced by the machine when driven by water-power
 previously existed under the form of gravity.
    We may now suppose the process reversed and electricity
to be the motive power.        Conceive a machine of some kind
 or other driven   by electricity,  and this machine to be employed
in the   production  of heat,  say  by friction, and to be employed
also in raising water.     It  will be universally admitted  H.   We
have in the one case electricity converted into heat; but it is
equally evident that we have in the other case electricity
converted into gravity.        If  the electricity produced by the
descent of the water be gravity transformed into electricity,
then the ascent of the water produced by electricity must be
electricity transformed into gravity; for it is the same process
merely reversed.
    Gravity in relation to Conservation.—If gravity be corre
lated to other forms of energy, it must, like them, come under
the great principle of conservation.            But here we enter
upon debatable ground.           It is admitted that gravity can
                                                           .
perform mechanical work, and the mechanical work can be
converted into other forms of energy.         Here we have correla
tions; but it is generally denied that there is a decrease or loss of
gravity resulting from such transformations. But this appears
to me to be a virtual denial of the principle of conservation.
To suppose a steam-engine to perform the work of raising the
loaded piston, without the steam sustaining any loss of heat,
would be universally admitted to be a violation of the prin
 º;
ciple of conservation.        Every one would maintain such a
        to be impossible, and that the steam must not simpl
lose heat but lose an amount equivalent to the work
Apply the same mode of reasoning to gravity.              º gravity
perform mechanical work in pulling down the piston, then
there must be a loss of that form of energy equivalent to
the work performed.       But it is not admitted that gravity is

If   a stone one pound in weight fall from an elevation of
1000 feet, one thousand foot-pounds of work will have been
performed by gravity on the stone.                  The stone on reaching
the   ground    is possessed     of that amount of energy in the form
of   motion,      all   which has been derived from gravity. But

                       of time and space, we must affirm that
                                                                            219
every thing which eatists must exist in time and space.     But
although existence necessarily implies time and space, it does
not necessarily imply any measurable quantity or amount
of time and space. A thing which exists, no matter what
it may be, exists in the absolute and indivisible moment.
Continued existence, of course, necessarily implies an amount
or measurable quantity of time, but not more existence abs
tractly considered.
   The same does not, however, hold universally true in regard
to space ; for whether the existence of a thing necessarily im
plies an extension or measurable quantity of space depends
upon whether the thing possesses extension or not.          For
example, thoughts, feelings, emotions, &c., and other mental
  henomena must exist in space, but do not require extension
in space. Length, breadth, and thickness have no application
to thought or to feelings.   A mathematical point, for example,
has position in space, but it does not occupy space.
    Time and Space in relation to CHANGE.-Lapse of time is
necessarily implied in the very conception of change. Change
is the passing from one state to another. The thing changed
is first in the one state, and afterwards in the other. It
cannot be in the two different states at the same moment.
   Change does not, however, necessarily imply a quantitative
amount of space as it does of time. Change implies succes
sion of moments of time, the one following the other; but it
does not necessarily imply a succession of positions in space.
There can be no change without change of position in time;
but there may be change without change of position in space.
Change of thought, feelings, &c. do not imply change of
position in space.  It may           ..
                              true, or it may not, that mental
change cannot take place without some change in our material
organism (say, of the brain); but nevertheless the most rigid
materialist    will admit that change of              thought   itself does not
imply change of position in space.  Even in material objects
change does not always imply change of position.       A body
may also be conceived to increase or decrease in density with
out any change in the position of    particles. its

mation is a change from one form to another. There is first
the one form, and then the other; or, in other words, there is
first the one form, and afterwards the other. The two are not
simultaneous.       It becomes the one by ceasing to be the other.
Transformation without lapse of time is both inconceivable and
a contradiction in terms.
    If  we leave out of consideration mental phenomena, we may
affirm that transformation of energy without transposition in
space is just as impossible as transformation of energy with
out transposition in time; only it is not so directly obvious in
the one case as in the other. That transformation of energy
necessarily implies change of position in space may              i.
proved from general considerations alone, without reference
to special cases.
F.
      ransformation of energy must consist either (1) of change
of   potential  energy into kinetic, or (2) of kinetic energy into
             or (3) of one form of kinetic energy into another
  orm of kinetic energy, or (4) of one form of potential energy
into another form of potential energy. There can be no other
form of transformation beyond these ; for they comprehend the
whole field of the possible.        Now it is obvious that the first
three forms of transformation imply change of position in
space; for kinetic energy, implies motion in some form or
other, and motion implies change of position in space.          The
fourth and last form of transformation, viz. of one form of
potential energy into another, were it possible, might, it is
true, be conceived to take place without change of position;
but there is evidently no such thing in nature, so far as is yet
known, as one form of potential passing directly into another
form.     It is true that the potential energy of one form may
be transformed into potential energy of another form; but it
must, in the first instance, become kinetic before it assumes
the second form.         Static electricity, for example, may be
transformed into       magnetism,  but not so directly.     It must
first assume the    dynamic   form before it can become magnetism.
A magnet will magnetize a piece of soft iron, but before the
iron assumes the magnetic or potential state a molecular
change takes place. The first effect produced on the mole
cules of the iron is dynamic before they assume the static or
magnetic state.
    #.    conclusions    to which   we are led may be stated      as
follows:—
    1st. Under every possible circumstance time and space are
absolutely necessary as conditions to the transformation of
energy from one form to another—the physical reason being
that there can be no transformation without motion, and there
can be no motion without time and space as conditions.

         Dr.  J. Croll on the Transformation of Gravity.       251
    2nd.  In every possible  case the amount of transformation
is limited by the extent of the space condition available for
the forces to act. We have seen that in the steam-engine,
for example, the amount of energy in the form of heat that
 can be converted into mechanical work would be limited by
the length of the cylinder, were it not that the stroke of the
 piston is reversed; for when the piston reached the end of
the cylinder no further transformation of energy could take
place.     But the reversal of the motion of the piston affords
 an unlimited amount of space condition ; consequently, so
 far as space is concerned, there is no limit to the amount of
heat which may be converted into work in a steam-engine.
 The same thing is also true of the molecules of the steam
itself.   They could perform no work on the piston unless they
 had space to allow of motion.      But as their motion, like that
 of the  piston, is to and fro, there is no limit, so far as space
 is concerned, to the amount of energy which they may lose
in work.
    But gravity is a force which cannot act to and fro. The
 amount of energy which gravity can lose is limited by the
 distance between the gravitating bodies. When the space
 between them is traversed and the bodies are in contact, there
is then no space condition, and further transformation of
 energy into work is impossible.
    Energy of Position.—What is meant by energy of posi
 tion must simply be that a body is in such a position that
force may be converted into kinetic energy or energy of
motion. It means that the force is in a position, so far as
                      º
 the space condition is concerned, of being transformed into
 kinetic energy. We do not speak of the piston of the steam
 engine being possessed of energy of position.        We have no
 occasion to do so,          because it is always in possession of
 energy of position. But we speak of the weight when raised
 and the bow when bent as possessing energy of position ; for
 it is only when they are in this condition that force can be con
 verted into motion. The generally received meaning, however,
 of these terms is not only erroneous and misleading, but hides
 a most important physical truth. For when it is said that a
 body possesses energy of position, it is not meant simply that
 the body, in regard to space, is in a position to allow of force
                             .#
 being transformed into
                                     of motion ; for it is not sup
 posed that force is transformed at all, the only thing changing
 being simply the position of the body.     When a stone, dropped
 from a height, is being pulled to the ground by the force of
 gravity, it is supposed that there is no loss or consumption of
 gravity ; the only thing lost which can possibly be regarded

as the equivalent of the motion gained, is simply the distance
between the stone and the ground.      Consequently space is
not only made a part of the potential energy, but the only
part out of which the kinetic energy has been generated—
space or distance from the ground being the form in which
    e energy of the falling stone previously existed.
     Grarity a Space-perrading Force.—The fact that gravity
increases inversely as the square of the distance may be re
§:arded as evidence of the truth of the views advocated by Fara
        Waterston f, and others, that it is a force pervading
space external to bodies, and that on the mutual approach of the
bodies this force is not increased as is generally supposed, but
the bodies merely pass into a place where the force exists with
   reater intensity; for in such a case the intensity of the
  orce, in the space external to any body, is inversely as the
square of the distance from the centre of convergence of these
lines of force. When a stone, projected upwards, recedes from
the earth,         riva  its   ris
                           transferred     space, and exists there

as   gravity. When the stone approaches the earth, the force
existing     spacein  transferred back
                                     is   the body and reappears      to

     “The integral                    of    gravitation,” says Mr. Waterston, “is                               a

    On a former occasion * endeavoured to show at consider
able length that our inability to conceive how force can exist
without a material medium has its foundation in a meta
physical misconception.
    Force cannot be conceived to exist of itself; for it is not a
substance, but must be either the property of a substance or
the effect of a cause.       But there is no & priori necessity for
forming any conception of the nature of the substance of
which it is the property, or of the cause of which it is the
effect. This is not all. To suppose that the substance of which
the force is the property should be some material tangible
thing such as a corpuscle, is to suppose that we must not only
know the nature of the substance, but should also be able to
form a sensuous representation of           Here       double error;

heavy shower of hailstones, will, irrespective of resistance
from the air, return to the ground with a certain loss of
motion, because the force of impact of the hailstones will be
greater on the stone when ascending than when descending.
Now if we substitute gravific corpuscles for hailstones we
shall have the same result, though, of course, to a far less
extent, owing to the enormous velocity of the gravific cor
puscles compared with that of the hailstones.               But unless
these corpuscles move with infinite velocity, the force of im
pact cannot be absolutely as great on the descending as on
the ascending stone; and if so it cannot return to the earth
with absolutely the same velocity as it left. There must be a
loss of motion, however small that loss may be.

    Quantities occurring in the Mechanical Theory of Heat.             255
 yet duly elucidated second proposition of the mechanical theory
 of heat. Accordingly a rigorous, indisputable proof, a purely
 dynamical demonstration of the Second Proposition is of pre
 eminent interest, not merely for the theory of heat, but also
 for every department of physics.
     Of late years it has already been repeatedly attempted             to
 deduce the Second Proposition without the aid of thermic
 axioms or hypotheses, merely resting it upon mechanical prin
 ciples or at least purely mechanical assumptions.            In the year
 1866, Boltzmann showed that, for a system of material points,
 one can, on certain special hypotheses, construct a dynamic
 proposition which in form and meaning appears to be identical
 with the second proposition of the mechanical theory of heat.
 In 1871, Clausius somewhat extended and generalized the pro
 position.      In the same year the author of this submitted to
 the   Hungarian    Academy a memoir in which he called atten
tion to the fact that the dynamic proposition of Boltzmann
and Clausius, at least in form, agrees with Hamilton's prin
 ciple, whence he inferred that the Second Proposition plays
the same part in thermodynamics that Hamilton's principle
does in dynamics.
    All these dynamic deductions, however, although free from
thermic hypotheses, were not free from mechanical assump
tions; and on this account they were inadequate to excite
absolute confidence in the universal validity of the proposition
in question. This circumstance determined me to investigate
the question afresh (in a memoir submitted to the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences, May 10, 1875*), and, resting on an
almost prophetic utterance of Rankine's, endeavour to deduce
the Second Proposition directly from the principle of the
conservation of energy without making any further mechanical
assumption.

and the                 rests on     perhaps  a not quite indisputable
basist. Since then          I  have been    continually  pursued by the
thought whether the deduction could not be effected more
naturally, simply, and secure against every objection.                   I
finally came to the conviction that the chief difficulty consists
in this—that the mechanical conceptions which have been formed

perfectly just.

of thermic quantities are inadequate, and,   taken strictly, are
not even correct.  It became evident that, before all, these con
ceptions must be sifted, and, indeed, in part generalized, in
part rendered more precise.                            I
                                now resolved to give up many
of the usual ideas, and to substitute for them more general
and, in my opinion, more precise notions.      Arrived at this
point, the deduction was immediately found to be more simple,
more natural.
   I now make public the results which I have hitherto at

Proposition carried out on the basis of the altered notions,

is constant so long as         volume and temperature remain un

As the number of the molecules, though very great, is not                                     in
finite, and we will provisionally suppose that no unparalyzed
external forces cooperate which could disturb the spontaneous
variation, there is just as much probability that, at any moment
previously selected, the partial rarefactions will predominate,
as that the reverse will be the case; and therefore that in an
indefinitely short period chosen the sum of the expansions or
that of the contractions will predominate is equally probable—
supposing,        I
                repeat, that no unparalyzed external forces act
on the body. Let us assume that at the moment chosen ex
pansion predominates, so that in that element of time the
volume becomes greater.           Let us then consider the body
again after a while; it may just as well happen that now the
contractions predominate and therefore the space occupied
is diminishing.     As, however, the successive changes can never
take place abruptly,             all
                            the gradations         both expansion and
                                                                of
contraction must occur, and               continuous series, between

                               the given ratios. Accordingly the
volume will     during     certain time continually increase until

      When, therefore, it is said that the space-content
constant, this properly signifies only that the sum      the varia
                                                                                       ya

tions of volume  during   a complete oscillation is nil.

      it be admitted that the body, in relation to these changes
of colume, can be regarded as perfectly elastic, and we assume
               |.
that no unparalyzed external forces alter the amplitude or the
period of      oscillations, then on the one hand the duration of
an oscillation, and on the other the mean volume for this
period, remain constant;                   or
                                             i-const.,

Therefore, if it is said the volume is constant, this by no means
signifies that the volume undergoes no variation, but merely that
the mean value of the volume remains unchanged.
     Ithink the justification of this conception can hardly be
questioned.
   But as soon as it is allowed that the space-content is subject
to continual alterations, it must also be admitted that the body
is continually performing work against the forces acting upon
it, now positive, now negative, although        volume        the           its                is,   in
ordinary sense, called constant.         hence follows, not that It

                          the time-element        nil, but merely          dt    is

      But whence does the body take, and        what does    apply,        to                it
the energy which comes into play       this alternate performance

and consumption         work? On the one hand the energy
                             of                                                                           of

     Letus collect the results of the foregoing considerations.
It is now easy to perceive when the thermal state of a body
can be regarded as constant: it is not in the least necessary
that what are called the variables of state (volume, tempera
ture, tension, &c.) should continually remain constant.                                                                Ac
cording to our apprehension, the condition for the constancy
of the state of any body whatsoever consists in this, that the

   Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, atmospheric air, and carbonic
oxide are permanent gases; and their molecules contain the
same number of atoms.         Now, as it follows from Regnault's

gas, is very nearly equal, therefore for the gases mentioned

    Consequently, when     it is said that      the temperature of two
gases (whose molecules contain the same number of atoms) is
equal, this much is meant—that the mean value of the vis viva
for the unit of volume, in the course of a complete oscillation, is
 equal in the two gases.

screws at the points Q, R, S, 38, 13, 25 millims, distant from
the centre, for securing the crystal-holder to the instrument
in a convenient position. This disk is capable of revolving
round a pin the ends of which enter holes in the centres of
the disk and graduated circle.       A rectangular piece of metal
 TU, having each arm 95 millims. long, 30 millims. wide and 5
 millims, thick, with slits the width of which is very little
larger than the diameter of the screw, can be securely clamped
 to the disk by a screw passing through the slit in the hori
 zontal arm. A bar in which are inserted two screws, by which
 it can be secured to the vertical branch of TU, carries at its
 upper end the ordinary Wollaston's branch, to which the crystal
 is secured by a cement employed by Wollaston, consisting of
  beeswax melted with a little olive-oil, honey, and lampblack,
 and stirred while cooling to prevent the separation of the
 components.        The crystal being now adjusted above every
 part of the instrument, about 195 millims. above the plane on
  which it rests, is brought into the axis by making TU slide
  and revolve. The screw being now tightened, the crystal
  revolves with the circle without any danger of the small angu
  lar displacement which is liable to occur, according to Dauber
  (Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. ciii. 1858, p. 107), in the best
  constructed goniometers when the circle is vertical and the
  adjustment is by sliders in grooves making right angles with
   one another.      #.  method of bringing the crystal into the
   axis of the circle can also be applied with advantage to the
   small Wollaston's goniometer.
      The image of the bright signal is much more distinct when
   the incidence is as direct as possible, more especially when the
   face under observation is striated or partially coated with any
   foreign matter. A small angle of incidence is hardly obtain
   able with a vertical circle or with a horizontal circle in most
   localities, as long as the faint signal is seen directly.
       Instead of employing an object seen directly for the faint
    signal, it was suggested independently by A. F. E. Degen
    (Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. xxvii. 1833, p. 557) and E. Sang
    (Edinb. New Phil. Journ. vol. xxii. 1837, p. 213) that the
    image of a line seen by reflexion in a mirror could be employed
    for the faint signal. They failed, however, to obtain the great
    est advantage from the employment of the mirror; for though
    theoretically correct, this is practically inconvenient, because
   the brightness of the reflection in the mirror very commonly
    extinguishes the reflected image in the face of the crystal.   A
    better mode of procedure is to place a screen with a narrow
    vertical slit covered on the side furthest from the observer
    with thin paper, making at the crystal an angle of from 3° to

                      Professor A. DEs CLoISEAUxf.
              (Pogg, Ann. Ergänzungsb. iii. 1851) and vom
      Rath (Pogg. Ann. Ergänzungsb. v. 1871) have referred
the different forms of Humite to three types belonging to the
orthorhombic            all reducible to the same elements. An
examination of the     optical characters, however, has led me
to separate the three types, and to transfer the crystals belong
ing to types II. and #. to the clinorhombic system, as shown
in the following pages.

  Prof. A. Des Cloiseaux                       on the three Types of Humite.                               287
of my ‘Manual of Mineralogy.'            have placed the obtuse   I
angle of the prism in front, in accordance with the general
usage for orthorhombic prisms; and        have multiplied the old      I
value of the vertical axis by 4 to simplify the symbols.
   The plane of the optic axes is parallel to the base; the acute
bisectrix is positive, and is normal to h"(010).        Dispersion
hardly appreciable in oil, p < v (?). 2H, = 78° 18' to 79°.                     ,
   The laminae parallel to h" consist of plates (of greater or less
extent) in which the extinction of the light is complete. These
are intersected by patches of irregular form in which the ex
tinction is imperfect, and which probably consist of Humite
belonging to the third type. These probably interfere with
the accurate determination of the chemical composition of
crystals of the first type.

 and log r when n=2, and consider d8 to be the element of
 what in n dimensions corresponds to a spherical surface in
 three-dimensional space.
    The method employed, of first using two Laplacian operators
 in combination to determine one property of the form under                                                   in
vestigation and then a single one of them to act on the form
thus partially determined, reminds one very much of the method
 for obtaining invariants of given orders from their two general
 partial differential equations. Combined, these two equations
 express the law of isobarism ; then, assuming the isobarism, a
 single one of the two serves to determine the special values of
the coefficients. The analogy between that process and the
one here employed seems to me to be exact, although the sub
ject-matter is so very unlike in the two problems—and is the
 more interesting on that very account.

sponding to each. If the two points thus found be joined, the line
joining them will be the Sumner line. Or we may calculate one
            (and so obtain one point through which the line passes),
and also the true azimuth of the body observed, which gives us
the inclination of the Sumner line to the parallels of latitude.
The latter plan is the one adopted by Sir W. Thomson. The former
is the plan most commonly used, although neither can properly be
said to be in common use at all; for, as Sir W. Thomson says,
    “Sumner's method, although undoubtedly the clearest and com
pletest mode of interpreting observations, has never found very
general favour with navigators.         A few of the most skilful no
doubt use it habitually; and many more use it occasionally in criti
cal times; but       its
                   tediousness has hitherto prevented       from coming                   it
into every-day use.      have prepared the Tables which follow with

    When the latitude      estimated, the problem
                                 is                     how     find the            of             to

take the Tables and find, by aid of a pair of compasses, two places
somewhere in one of the columns headed ‘b, one of which is as
much above the level of the half estimated co-latitude as the other
is below that level, and such as to have two numbers opposite to
them in the ‘co-hyp’ column approximately agreeing with the de
clination and altitude respectively.    The numbers level with these
in the adjoining column ‘A’ will then agree with the hour-angle -
and azimuth.”

given of how to find the exact position by means of the intersection
of two Sumner lines, or of one Sumner line with the true bearing
of an object whose position is known.
   Believing as we do that Sumner's is the only scientific method
of treating observations of the sun and stars at sea, and that its
general adoption by sailors is a reform much to be desired, not
only because of the practical merits of the method, but also, and
perhaps chiefly, on account of                 its

where land was extremely expensive, and every dimension was
carefully apportioned,         “the platform area is probably mini
mized; but the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed
traffic of long- and short-journey trains, amounting at times to as
many as 400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.” To
accommodate this enormous amount of traffic, there are an eastern
and a western platform, each being 13%                 wide, and having       ft.

 of (say twelve) kinds of trains have to be described by signal.
 In such a case an elaborate instrument called the train-describer
 has to be used (p. 158). As well as a description of the Block
 System, Mr. Barry gives a discussion of the advantages which it
 possesses over other systems; and his conclusion is as follows:–
 “Viewing the block system as a whole, it may be safely said that
 it has the advantage of being perfect in principle in so far that it
 renders collisions impossible provided it be carried out perfectly;
 whereas the system of time signalling, even granting that it can be
carried into effect without a flaw, gives no absolute security against
 collisions” (p. 165).
    Perhaps the point which strikes us most forcibly when reading
 such a book as that before us, is the enormous amount of ingenuity
 that has been brought to bear in working out the details of our
present system of locomotion.       The need for a large part of the
contrivances   actually  in use could not possibly have been foreseen;
it could  only  have come into view as the system was being gradu
ally worked out.        Of course, therefore, further improvement is
still possible;  and if by any chance we have a railway manager
among our readers, we would earnestly recommend to his attention
the following suggestion.      “Another great improvement would be
in  paying  more attention to distinguishing the trains, or, where
necessary separate carriages, by boards on which their destination
should be legibly painted, placed in positions on the carriage where
the boards would be visible when the train is standing at the plat
form. This is particularly necessary on the metropolitan and
suburban lines; but the notice boards on the carriages are usually
very indistinct, as if railway managers were ashamed of them;
and they are often so placed that they cannot be seen well at any
time and scarcely at               all
                              night” (p. 280).

THE“On   the Nature of the Force producing         the Motion of a Body
exposed to Rays of Heat and Light.”         By Arthur Schuster, Ph.D.,
Demonstrator in the Physical Laboratory of Owens College.
   Mr. Crookes has lately drawn attention to the mechanical action
of a source of light on delicately suspended bodies in vacuo;          have                               I
made a few    experiments    which  will,   think,  throw some I  light  on
the cause of the phenomenon, and assist us in the explanation of the
manifold and striking experiments made by Mr. Crookes.
   Whenever we observe a force tending to drive a body in a cer
tain direction, we are sure to find a force equal in amount acting in
the opposite direction on the body from which the force emanates.
It was with the view of finding the seat of this reaction that         have                               I
made a few experiments.
     If
      the force is directly due to radiation, the reaction will be on the
radiating body;                if,   on
                          the other hand,      due     any interior action,

the mill had become constant, the vessel returned to its original
position. On suddenly cutting off the light the vessel was again
deflected, but in the opposite direction to that on starting the experi
ment.    The vessel therefore now turned in the same direction in
which the mill turned.
   These experiments are easily explained on the assumption that the
force acting on the vessel enclosing the light-mill is exactly equal
and opposite to that acting on the mill itself. While the velocity
of the mill in one direction is increasing, a force acts in the oppo
site direction on the vessel. When the velocity has become con
stant, the force which tends to drive the mill round is exactly
counterbalanced by the resistance which opposes the motion of the
mill. The two forces acting on the vessel will therefore counter
balance, and the vessel will return to      original position     rest.     its                                 of

way that the sign of the return charge after discharge and insula
tion should change once or more.
  3.   This anticipation   was verified by charging the flask alternately
positively and negatively for successively decreasing periods. The
author learned after making this verification that Sir William
Thomson had tried similar experiments before, but had never
formally published them.
   4. The analogy between coercive force in magnetism and the
electro-coercive force suggested that, as mechanical agitation shakes
out the magnetism from a magnet, so it might shake down the
electropolar state of a dielectric and unmask residual charge more
rapidly than is the case in quiescence.    This was found to be the
case; a residual charge manifests itself in the flask more rapidly
when the flask is tapped than when it is quiet. It was also found
that that portion of the return charge which comes out last is more
accelerated by vibration than that which comes out first, and that,
after tapping, the flask was less susceptible to the effect of tapping
than it was before it was touched.
   5. Experiment shows that, after a return charge has attained a
maximum and is decreasing by conduction through the glass, the
loss per cent. per unit of time does not continuously increase from
zero at the point of maximum potential but may presently decrease.
   6. Sir William Thomson explained specific inductive capacity by
supposing every part of the dielectric to be electropolar under             in
duction; by introducing time into that explanation, it is made to
cover both specific inductive capacity and that on which residual
charge depends as respectively rapid and slow cases of similar phe

   The author described in great detail his observations on the
glacial phenomena of Greenland, and applied their results to the
consideration of the traces of glacial action exhibited in Norway.

slope of only    4°,

Norwegian     fjords.  From a consideration of the height at which
these boulders occur on islands at the mouth of the latter, the
author estimates the thickness of some of the glaciers, to which he
attributes the formation of the fjords, and arrives at thicknesses
varying from 2940 to 7010 feet. The author remarks that fjords,
lakes, and cirques are always met with in glaciated regions, and
explains their formation by the action of ice.        His view of the
course of events in Norway is as follows:–Before the Glacial epoch
thousands of streams commenced the work of erosion and produced
valleys.    During the Glacial epoch these valleys were enlarged and
lake-basins were hollowed out. The descending glaciers ground
out fjords to their full length when the Glacial epoch was at its
highest; but as it declined the glaciers ground out the inner part
to a still greater depth, producing the present characters of the
marine fjords, and giving rise to lake-hollows in other places.
That the glaciers once extended beyond the fjords is shown by
moraine-matter being dredged up.         Some of the sea-banks and
islands off Christiania-fjord are old moraines; and if Norway should
bo raised 400 metres, these banks would show as moraines and
plains before the lake-basins of the fjords.
    2. “On the Drift of Brazil.” By C. Lloyd Morgan, Esq., F.G.S.,
Assoc.R.S.M.
   The author described the position and mode of occurrence of large
boulders of gneiss and granite in the red drift of Brazil and on the
slopes of hills even at considerable elevations, and stated that, like
Professor Agassiz, he could not see how these could have been trans
ported to their present positions except by the agency of ice. At
the same time he stated that none of these boulders exhibit any
glacial scratches, nor are any such markings perceptible on exposed
rock-surfaces; their absence on the latter he thought might be due
to weathering.      The surface of the gneiss on which the red drift
lies, however, is moutonnée.     The author remarked with regard to
the great glacier which Prof. Agassiz imagined to have filled the
valley of the Amazons, that the Andes from which he supposed it
to have come, are more than 1500 miles from Rio, and that right
across   the country there stretches an almost continuous series of
mountains and hills.       He also called attention to the existence of
mountains in eastern Brazil of sufficient height to have nourished
glaciers, but at the same time remarked that the question of the
origin of the supposed glaciers cannot be satisfactorily answered
until the boulders found in the clay have been traced to their sources.
For his own part he is inclined to believe that the drift, if of glacial
origin, was not formed by glaciers taking their rise in any of the
peaks indicated by him, but by an almost universal              South
American ice-sheet.

     ON   THE PHOTOMETRY OF COLOURED FLAMES.                  BY M. GOUY.
THEsubject  photometric process of which the description
                  of this Note permits us to measure with
                                                                  forms the
                                                                 facility the
brightness       of the various lines constituting the spectrum of co
loured flames.
     When a source of light is examined with the spectroscope, a
spectrum is seen of which the brightness varies according to the
point considered, the nature of the source, and the width of the
slit. The luminous intensity in a point of the spectrum is ex
                                 *A2
                                     -
pressed by the integral k       \A   id A.
      In  this formula, i is the intensity of the ray whose wave-length
is A, emitted by the source; k is a coefficient depending on the
 construction of the apparatus and the loss of light by absorption
and reflection; A, and A, are two wave-lengths such that a source
which emitted only those two rays would give in the spectroscope
 two lines in contact whose common margin would pass through
 the point considered.
      If  we project upon the slit of the spectroscope, supposed verti
 cal, the image of a Babinet's compensator arranged so as to give
 horizontal fringes, illuminating it by two luminous pencils polarized
 at a right angle and emitted by two different sources, a spectrum
 will be produced streaked with horizontal fringes. Each of the
 sources will give a system of fringes; and the dark fringes of the
 one system being superposed to the bright ones of the other, the
 portions of the spectrum in which the preceding integral has the
 same value for both sources will alone preserve their usual aspect.
 By varying in a known ratio the intensity of the light emitted by
  one of the sources, we shall be able to measure the brightness of
  the different parts of the spectrum which it produces.          If it gives
  a  line-spectrum,    the slit is to be   opened  sufficiently for the lines
  to become broad bands; this will make the observation easier.
       The apparatus is arranged thus:—In front of the slit of a
  spectroscope is placed the photometer, which comprises the follow
  ing pieces, ranged in a straight line in the axis of the collimator:-
  an achromatic lens; a Nicol with its principal section horizontal;
  a piece similar to a Babinet compensator, in which the axes of the
  quartz prisms are at 45° from the fringes, which are horizontal;
  an achromatized spar prism, of which the principal section is
  horizontal; a Nicol movable at the centre of a graduated circle;
  and a lens.
       Between the spar prism and the last Nicol the tube carries a
  lateral branch at a right angle, which contains a total-reflection
  prism and a lens. A flame being placed before this lateral branch,
  the light which is not stopped by the diaphragms passes through
  the spar as the extraordinary ray; the contrary takes place for a
   flame placed before the movable Nicol.         The two flames thus give
   complementary fringes, the image of which is thrown upon the slit
   of the spectroscope and passes into the spectrum.

     By putting a lamp in the place of the slit of the spectroscope
and  following   the rays which have passed through the photometer,
one can see what points of the space can send light into the spec
troscope, and consequently regulate the apparatus.        These rays
form a condensed     pencil with a diameter of less than 5 millims.
and length of 20 centims.
   The flames which         I
                           employed were produced in the manner
following. Air compressed to 1-5 atmosphere issues through an
adjutage, above which is fixed the tapering end of a glass tube,
the other extremity of which dips into a saline solution; the solu
tion is aspirated and reduced to a very fine powder.      The illumi
nating gas is aspirated at the same time, mixes with the air and
the saline powder, and burns above a metallic gauze. The blue
part of the flame (which gives the lines of carbon) rises 2 or
3 millims. above the gauze ; the flame is afterwards homogeneous
and but little reducing; it forms a cone 8 centims. in height by
2 in diameter. It was towards the base that my observations were
made in the experiments, of which                       I
                                       have now to speak.
    The  object of these was to seek the mean intensity of the rays
which constitute the lines of the spectrum of coloured flames. Let
k be a constant, i the intensity of the ray of wave-length X, A, and
A, two wave-lengths selected on one side and on the other of the
line considered, the brightness of this line will be equal to

    For sodium the brightness            varied from 1 to 15, and the height
from 0.28 to 0:30. It is seen that the augmentation of the bright
ness is effected chiefly by the widening of the lines.
    On the other hand, the nebulous lines (a, y, and 3 of strontium,
a and B of calcium) have a centre of gravity of which the height is
comprised between 0 and 0.03.                   It is probable that the centre of
gravity rises when the brightness is increased; but my experiments
are too incomplete to enable me to affirm any thing on this point.

         ON THE INFLUENCE OF SONOROUS WIBRATIONS                                                        UPON THE
                    TrADIOMETER. BY J. JEANNEL.
     I
     have ascertained that the rotatory movements of the radio
meter can be determined by certain sonorous vibrations.             In re
gard to this            I
                have, in conjunction with M. Coulier and M. Alver
gniat, made various experiments, of which think           ought to render         I              I
an account to the   Academy.
   In semiobscurity three radiometers A, B, C, of unequal sensi
tiveness and at perfect rest, were placed on the inner shelf of a
saloon-organ.    The bass notes (those of the first three octaves)
determined the rotation-movements.         The deepest bass notes have
the  greatest action;  nevertheless the fa and the fa sharp of the
lower octave, especially with the bourdon stop, produce the most
                                      do re,
rapid rotation. Ut,     and mi, though deeper, have much less action.
                                                       of all
   The radiometers       not      behave       the same way       regards   in                             as
the speed and the direction        their rotations.    Thus, through the
effect     of   fa   sharp or   fa
                                the lower octave, radiometer

                                 of                light;    and    (more                            B         C
sensitive    light) turn more slowly, and
                   to                          the direction                                                        of   the
light-produced motion, viz. with the bright faces    front.                                      in
  These facts           I       propose     explain thus.

XLI.   On a Method of Measuring the Contour of Electric Waves
  passing through Telegraph Lines.   By ROBERT SABINE *.
           methods have during the last forty years been
VAR19.
   suggested and put in practice with the view of ascertain
ing the time which          elapses between starting electricity into one
end of a conductor, and the instant when the advancing wave
acquires strength to do the work necessary to give some indi
cation at the other end.
   Sir William Thomson, in his admirable paper on the “Theory
of the Electric Telegraph,” has clearly shown that, in any form of
conductor with any given receiver, the time required for a wave
to give a signalis dependent upon the induction and the resist
ance of the line, or what is termed             its
                                        “retardation.”     may also          It
 be stated that, with any given line, this time     dependent both
upon the sensitiveness and the resistance                       of is
                                                    the indicating
instrument;       by
                   decreasing the sensitiveness          increasing

the resistance interposed by the instrument, the observed time
is  increased.    Professor Wheatstone,       his celebrated expe
                                                      in

exact results, the sensitiveness of such a means of indication
being more than a thousand times less than that of even a
Morse magnet.              But this beautiful experiment was made
before Morse magnets were invented, and fifteen years before
a submarine cable was attempted, from which date exacter
knowledge has been acquired of the principles involved; and
much more delicate methods have consequently been devised.

326      Mr. R. Sabine                       on Measuring the Contour                         of
of spring       e   with stud g and the breaking     of contact, be:
tween l and m is shown     by  the engraved    division upon which
the index of the arm h stands. The       disk,  making two revolu
tions per second, each of the 500 divisions necessarily repre
sents room of a second, which is further divisible by the monius
                                                         of
     rººm. It is of course assumed that the rate            rotation
 during a revolution is uniform, the retardation through friction
 being too minute to be appreciable in so short a time.
     The original way of “timing” this apparatus was to start
 it and note the figures read in succession under the fibre of a
 small telescope when the disk was illuminated by half-second
 flashes of an induction-coil.    The force of the spring and the
 position of the trigger were    adjusted  until the right velocity
 was obtained.      Recently                     I
                                have employed an equally accurate
  and easier  way  of “timing,”    by discharging an accumulator
  through a known resistance for some intervai indicated by the
                                                                  the
  disk, and calculating, from the initial and final readings of
  galvanometer, the time according to the leakage-formula. ...If
  the two do not agree,                      I
                             alter the spring until they do. The
  spring, however, is very constant; and no adjustment has been
   found to be necessary, except after taking the apparatus to
                              (ºn
  pieces for alterations.
      The manner in which the apparatus is connected up is shown
   in plan in fig. 4. The body of the disk d d is connected with

been enabled to make some measurements with this appa
ratus upon lengths of gutta-percha cable, lately manufac
tured by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Com
pany, Limited, for submersion in the Red Sea. Measurements
of this kind upon coiled cable containing iron in the covering
are of less value than upon submerged cable ; but as the
amount of iron in the covering of this cable is comparatively
small,    I
          do not think that the magnetoelectric currents set up
were of   great  strength *.                    I
                               hope to be allowed the opportunit
of  making   similar measurements upon a submerged and dupli
cated cable. In the mean time           give the results, by way    I
of illustrating the employment of the method rather than pro
fessedly for their intrinsic value.

speeds of waves in short cables or land lines, the accumulator
employed should have a proportionally small capacity.

respecting the approximative formula (9) is sufficient.        It is
thence obvious that, if we go through the middle point of a
particular curve m of equation (11), we at the same time pass
through an apparent inconstancy in the true dispersion-curve

Thus, in the ordinary way of considering the operation of di
vision, not only is it necessary to know the quotient in order
to obtain the remainder, but the value of the remainder is de
pendent upon the value of the last figure of the quotient. This
is shown by the fact that if example I. were carried one step
further, the quotient would be 0.4098 and the remainder
                                                                                   .

wherever calculations have value.                  More than a thousand
years ago the Arabians used the tarazu or balance to check the
operations of multiplication and division ; the operation called
tarazu is that of casting out the nines, or ascertaining the
remainder to 9 that any given number has, and with these
remainders performing the same operations as with the num
bers whence they are derived.
     Lucas de Borgo, in the fifteenth century, used the remain
ders to division         i.
                          9, as well as to division by 7, obtained for
the various data in a numerical calculation (each datum having
 its  corresponding remainder),             check the operations

   Many theorems that, treated in the ordinary way, involve
the cumbersome notation of algebra used to deal with scales of
notation, can be investigated by the simplest means.       For in
stance, the proof that the addition of the digits of a number
casts out the nines of that number is manifest from the sub
stitution of 9 for 8 in the general formula of unitation given
above; for in that case ...i. term has 1 for its coefficient.   In
the function Uniºr the coefficients are, beginning with the unit,

use the multiplier as a divisor, beginning with the last figure
of the period, working towards the right hand, and taking
each figure of the quotient as it is obtained as the figure to be
brought down for the unit figure of the dividend at each ope
ration.         The work to obtain                                    by this method is :—5

represents a dielectric of perfect insulating power: the jar will
in this case remain charged for any length of time, and the
whole charge can be got out of it at any time by unclamping
the cord.     In the symbols of § 8,

        The slippery buttons 3, 5, and 6 will again gradually slide
 back almost to their mean position, the tension which their elas
 tics exerted towards the right will be relieved, and we shall pre
 sently have an unbalanced tension in the same direction as at
 first: this is the “residual charge;” and the state of things is re
 presented in            IIII,
                        fig. 2. On unscrewing S a second motion of
the cord will take place, and the buttons will take up a fresh posi
sition of temporary equilibrium.          The numbers annexed to the
four cases I, II,         and     III,        IIII
                                    indicate the electromotive force, or
the stress on the cord, in each case. Thus when first charged it
is 24; after standing some time it falls (say) to 17; immediately
after the first discharge it is of course 0; and after again waiting
some time it rises to 3 in the same direction as before, again to
 fall to zero when the second discharge occurs.            Still, however,
the   jar is not  wholly    discharged,   because the   slippery    buttons
will again have been displaced beyond their mean position and
will slide back again ; so it will take an infinite number of mo
mentary contacts completely to discharge the jar, unless indeed
every stratum allows a little slipping to go on.
    This is Professor Clerk Maxwell's theory of a composite
dielectric, which he explains in art. 328 of his ‘Electricity and
Magnetism, and which he also illustrates mechanically in
art. 334.

Such disruptive discharge as this represented by a snapping of
the elastics is analogous to the rupture of solid dielectrics like
glass.   In fluid dielectrics like air, the disruptive discharge
may be better represented by a slipping of the pins to which
the elastics are fastened along a groove parallel with the cord:
at each slip the cord makes a bound forward; but no perma
nent damage is done. (If at any one point a slip takes place,
the extra stress thrown on to the others is liable to make them
give way too.) A discharge of this sort is a kind of electro
lysis, and may be supposed to go on slowly in glass at a high
temperature.     It would be accompanied by a polarization of the
electrodes, as we shall see later (§§ 13 and 15). Discharge in a
vacuum-tube seems to be of this nature.      If partial disruptive
discharge occurs at points inside a dielectric, it will in general
give rise to infernal charge, even though the dielectric be of
uniform conductivity, because the buttons will not preserve
their original distances from one another on the cord.
           Maxwell's Theory of a Composite               Dielectric.
     § 8. Let us now see how the model must be made in order
to agree accurately with the dielectric, as investigated in art.
328, vol. i. of Maxwell's ‘Electricity.’
   It is there supposed, “for the sake of simplicity, that the
dielectric consists of a number of plane strata of different ma
terials and of area unity, and that the electric force acts in the
direction of the normal to the strata.” The row of buttons in
our model (fig. 1) will represent this collection of strata;
and we shall, for simplicity, consider the normal distance be
tween adjacent buttons in the row as unity.     The thickness ai,
a..... of any stratum is then equal to the number of buttons
(or molecules) which         compose   it;   and the whole thickness        of   the
dielectric   at   +a, +....+will equal
                                  an               n,
                                          the whole number                         of
buttons. Since         all
                   the buttons    any one stratum have exactly
                                        in
the same properties, we may       we like consider each button
                                       if
to represent   entire stratum, and take

duced in a solution of double tartrate of iron, or other conve
vient salt, by magnetism. One might use iron electrodes, care

fully depolarized, connected with      a galvanometer, and arranged
so that either can be      magnetized      at pleasure. The current
           if too feeble to be  directly  observed,     might be detected
  y using it to charge a condenser. But a more likely way
would be to send a current through the solution by a very
small external electromotive force, first in one direction and
then in the other, and to measure it each time; in one case
iron would have to be carried against magnetic force, in the
other case with it (cf. Maxwell, art. 263).            the end of a mag If
net were  cup-shaped     and were filled with a        magnetolyte, I sup
pose that a continuous action would go on, tending to deepen
the hollow, because the middle of a magnet is magnetized
more feebly than the external portions.

 creased, because of the relaxation of tension normal to the lines
of force; but this the model does not show.) Let the real
plane of polarization be ay.       Then, resolving each oscilla
tion into two equal components parallel to ºr and y respectively,
the y component will be retarded behind the other in their pas
sage through the medium ; and when the beam emerges, it will
be no longer plane, but elliptically polarized.    The amount of
ellipticity depends on the difference of the velocities of the two
components (which depends on the square of the electromotive
force), and on the thickness of strained medium through which
the light has passed. If one component were retarded a quarter
wave-length behind the other, the emergent light would be
circularly polarized; so the actual retardation must be ex
tremely small, as the change in the light     even under favour            is,

the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 172, p. 136.                                                              I
refer chiefly to the phenomena exhibited by “a small piece of
pith hanging down like a pendulum at the distance of about a
millimetre from the rotating vanes of the radiometer.”                 It was
noticed that “scarcely any movement of the pendulum was
produced when the rotation was very rapid ; but at one parti
cular velocity the pendulum set up a considerable movement.”
At the suggestion of Professor Stokes, the candle which by

light produced the rotation, was placed

present theory, that no electricity can pass, air of ordinary
density being a non-conductor.      On producing exhaustion
the rotation commences and increases up to a certain point,
because rarefied air is a conductor of electricity.    After a
high degree of exhaustion is attained, the rate of rotation
diminishes, because vacuum is a non-conductor of electricity,
and an approach to that condition has a retarding effect.
As the exhaustion proceeds, the effect of the friction at the
pivot becomes more prominent, which, however, appears from
the experimental results to be, after all, a very minute quan
tity.   A degree of exhaustion which actually stopped the
vanes was not reached.                 I
                                    can see no & priori reason why
the   stoppage   should occur with the same degree of exhaustion
as that which would prevent the passage of a galvanic spark
under particular conditions. The vanes continued to move
when the degree of exhaustion was considerably greater than
that at which the spark ceased to pass under the particular
conditions arranged for the comparison.
    On further trial         I
                           failed to verify the statement made in
the May Number, that the presence of a magnet in the neigh
bourhood of a radiometer affected the rate of its motion. On
the contrary,          I
                    proved by more careful experiments that the
streams of a    magnet     had no perceptible effect on the move
ment of the vanes.        This result might have been anticipated
 from the circumstance that the electric streams of the theory
traverse the vanes transversely, so that the addition of mag
netic streams (with which, according to hydrodynamics, the
electric streams may coexist) produces no variation of aetherial
density at the vanes, and therefore no motive force tending to
give them motion. The case would be different for a                                      set   of
streams symmetrical with respect              toaris, inasmuch

378          Explanations of Additional Phenomena of the Radiometer.
ever, be employed to test the truth of the a priori theory,
because, if the latter be true, it ought to be capable of giving
reasons for the experimental facts on which the empirical
theory is founded. The phenomena of the radiometer have
attracted my attention as being peculiarly adapted to be of
 service in carrying on researches as to the laws of physical
 force.        I
             have, in fact, been able, by applying to them the
foregoing theoretical discussion, to settle an important physical
question.      In my Theory of Electricity I had occasion to speak
 of electricity-radiants, but had no means of determining in
what order they stood relatively to heat-radiants.               The ten
dency of the explanations given in this communication is to
prove their identity, at least, as to kind, if not in degree,
with heat-radiants, and to show that, like these, they are sub
ject to the law of exchanges. On the assumption that such
 is their character, I propose to conclude this communication
with giving a theory of the induction of electricity more pre
 cise than that contained in arts. 12–16 of the “Theory of
 Electric Force" in the Phil. Mag. for October 1860, or that
 in pp. 521-531 of ‘The Principles of Physics.”
     This theory of electrical induction rests essentially on a cer
 tain state of the atoms at and near the surface of a body (first
 recognized by Poisson), according to which through an ex
 tremely small thickness the density of the atoms increases from
the surface towards the interior.         The fulfilment of this con
dition is   necessary   for the  equilibrium   of the atoms so situated.
 It will now be supposed that the undulations of the aether cor
 responding to the radiants we are concerned with can traverse
 substances freely without undergoing transmutation.                 Such
 undulations     pertain   to the electrified state of a solid      body,
 and, in conjunction with the forces of atomic repulsion, main
 tain by attractive action the interior gradation of density
 which is a necessary condition of that state. When a body in
 a neutral state is brought into the neighbourhood of an elec
 trified body, those radiants of the latter that are incident upon
 it pass freely through           it,
                                and consequently traverse the whole
              superficial               varying atomic density spoken
of of                                   in of
     the thin              stratum
     above.    Now when aether          motion, whether the motion         be
vibratory          or
                 steady, permeates         collection

greater atomic density.         The variation   of  pressure consequent
upon this variation       ofcondensation acts upon the atoms and
displaces them from their normal positions; and this,                 as

ever, to be considered that this action is always towards the
interior of the substance, and that the induction of electricity
depends on the difference between the disturbances at the two
positions at which the radiant, cuts the surface of the body,
which difference arises from the variation of the intensity of
the action according to the law of the inverse square. It is
evident that, although the radiants may be effective in produ
cing motion of the atoms in the superficial stratum by reason
of the variation of atomic density that subsists there, they may
still be of an orderwhich, like light- and heat-radiants, produce
no movement of the body as a whole.

       HERE    are few minerals which offer an equal interest,
        from the point of view of the progressive development
 of our knowledge of them, with the two magnesian silicates,
enstatite, MgSiO3, and olivine, Mg, SiO,.            It is well known
that our knowledge of the latter mineral, in proportion as it is
increased, has recognized          its
                                   abundance and importance.          At
first found almost     exclusively       volcanic rocks and
                                         in                        small in
crystals, olivine has since been met with         plutonic and meta
                                                 in

 Berlin, 1861).      Professor N. Story Maskelyne found this
 mineral in the Busti meteorite (Trans. Roy. Soc. clx. 189).
 Professor von Lang showed, in an admirable investigation,
 how rich were the combinations of the enstatite of the Breiten
 bach meteorite. Nearly at the same time vom Rath deter
 mined the crystals of hypersthene of Laach.        The specimens
 from both these sources, cosmical and terrestrial, have abso
 lutely the same angles. Implanted crystals of enstatite pre
 senting freely formed crystalline faces had hitherto been un
 known in plutonic rocks.      It might be thought that if they
 could be found   they  might  astonish us by their gigantic size,
 like the olivines of  Snarum;    and in this expectation we are
 not disappointed.
                                            -
    In the apatite mine of Kjorrestad between Krageröe and
 Langesund, in the autumn of the year 1874, enstatite was
 discovered in crystals of a size reached only by very few mi
 nerals. The locality where the great enstatite crystals have
 been found is one of those numerous apatite veins of Southern
 Norway. The main rock of this part of the coast is mica and
 amphibole slate, in which the apatite veins are included. Their
predominating mineral is amphibole.
    In the vicinity of these normal veins there is to be found at
the Hankedalsvand, not far from Westre Kjorrestad, an isolated
 deposit, as a thick lode constituted principally of large crys
 tals of enstatite and enormous masses of rutile.       There was
 not much   apatite, but some  greenish-white  mica and tale; and
for this reason apatite was obtained only for a short time.
The enstatite crystals, from 0-3 to 0-4 metre in size, had
been thrown away unheeded, till they were discovered by
Brögger and Reusch in their researches on the apatite beds
(Zeitschr, d. deutsch. geol. Gesellsch. vol. xxvii. p. 646, 1875).
As the mine of Vestre Kjorrestad had been already abandoned,
the investigations of the discoverers were confined to the matter
thrown out.
    The enstatite crystals, occurring in more or less elongated
columnar forms always broken at one end, were no doubt origi
nally implanted on the wall of the lode. The space between
the gigantic enstatite crystals was filled with silver-white or
light-green talc. Also in the interior, and principally in the
decomposed crust of the enstatite, we see minute scales of tale,
lying in planes parallel to the prismatic faces, or oftener to the
brachypinakoid, formed evidently by a metamorphosis of the
enstatite.
    The new crystals excite our attention at first by their size.
Several crystals attain a magnitude of 20 centims. in length
and in breadth. One of the two largest specimens measures

                             large Crystals            of Enstatite.                                     381

other one, notwithstanding                      its

   The crystals show predominating vertical rhombic prism,

reduced the forms of the Kjorrestad crystals to those of bron

Also it is to be noticed that the crystal was measured at Chris
tiania, and that the faces denoted by Greek letters were deter
mined at Bonn. Having in view the imperfections of the faces,
it would not have been possible to obtain measurements more
nearly approaching to the calculated angles.

     It
      is possible, even easy, to reduce the above-mentioned
crystals to the form of enstatite, as the perturbations which
produce a monoclinic appearance are only 1 or a few degrees.
On other crystals it is impossible without making too arbitrary
assumptions, because the differences between the homologoûs
edges are as great as 7 degrees, even more in some cases.
The two large crystals of the Bonn Museum have such a habit.
One of them (see fig. 7) allows pretty exact measurements,
If we had had only this single one, we should not have dared
to assign it to the rhombic system of enstatite; and yet even
here no doubt remains that the irregularity is due to perturba
tions only. We acquire this conviction, as well by comparison
with the more regular specimens as by an exact study of the
perturbed crystal itself if we try to reduce it to the monoclinic
system. We get in this case no simple symbols, and we are
obliged to take different axial elements for nearly every crystal.
The best-formed specimen of the Bonn collection gave the fol
lowing angles (fig. 7):—
                          m:        m<U+017F> (over    b)=89°40',
                          m :       x=109°,
                          m':       x = 102°.
     If
     we regard m as prism or P,                    x    as klinodome        (P 2),   we
obtain the following elements:—
                a : b : e-0-99798:                 1:   0.41387;
obliquity of axis      (8)=94°57'.                                      -
  For the face a we cannot get any more simple symbols than
(#a': b : #e), 4 P 4.
  Supposing this formula, we find—
                                     Calculated.            Measured.

     Comparison  with the other crystals of pseudomonoclinic
habit leaves no doubt that the face X is identical with the bra
chydome q=# P × of the normal crystals, and that the differ
ence of the angles x: m/- 102°, X: m = 109° is to be explained
by the dislocation of               all
                          the faces forming the summit.     The

     On passing the spark between the metallic points another
spectrum is seen, consisting of sixteen lines spread over the
range of the luminous field: the two more-refrangible of the
lines shown by the chloride appear in
of lower    refrangibility,

points—one lent to us by the Professor of Chemistry, the other
cut from a piece of indium which we purchased from Messrs.

currents, about lines of magnetic force are well known. One
form of experiment, commonly called the rotating spark, presents,
beside the actual rotation, some peculiar features which do not
appear to have been noticed in detail.      The instrumental arrange
ments consist of a partially exhausted chamber with a platinum
point for one terminal, a ring for the other, and the intervening air
or other gas for the movable conductor.         The chamber is made in
the form of a double cylinder, so that a magnet inserted through
the ring may reach nearly to the point.            The discharge then
passes between the point and the ring, and revolves about the
magnet according to Ampère's law.
    But beside the rotation, and even when, through weakening of
the magnet, rotation does not actually take place, the spark, when
carefully observed, is seen to assume a spiral form; and the spiral
is right-handed or left-handed according to both the direction of the
current and the magnetic polarity.            This effect is particularly
noticeable if the magnetic pole be inserted only a short distance
beyond the ring. The discharge is then seen to spread itself out
sheetwise on the ring in the direction in which rotation would take
  lace. The edge of the sheet is in the form of a helix.
    The object of the following observations is to bring out the
character of this phenomenon by making it a principal instead
                                                          -
of a secondary feature of the experiment.
    The arrangement here described consisted in using the poles
of an electromagnet as the terminals of a discharge from an           in
duction-coil, and in observing the effect on the form of the dis
charge caused by exciting the electromagnet.           For this purpose
the movable      poles were insulated from the main body of the mag
net  by  interposing   a sheet of ebonite thick enough to prevent the
passage of the discharge, but not thicker, in order as little as pos

sible to diminish the strength of the magnetic poles. The discharge
was then effected either in the open air or in a closed chamber.
The latter was constructed of a short cylinder of glass, say 3
inches in length and 2 in diameter, having conical ends pointed
inwards, so as to receive the poles of the magnet. The chamber
was also furnished with a pipe and stopcock for the purpose of
exhaustion.                 -
   The    discharge    from an induction-coil taken in air or other
gas at atmospheric pressure consists, as is well known, primarily of
the spark proper or bright line, irregular in form and instantaneous
in duration.        But beside this, when the primary wire is thick
and the battery-current strong, the spark is enveloped in a bright
cloud, or rather flame, which is capable of being thrown on one
side, although not entirely detached from the spark, by a current
of air. This, when examined in a revolving mirror, is found to
be subsequent in time to the spark proper, and may be considered
to be due to the gas in the neighbourhood of the spark becoming
sufficiently heated to conduct part of the discharge, and to the
consequent combustion of any extraneous matter floating in the
medium.       Such a view is supported by the fact that the colour of
this flame depends partly upon the nature of the gas in which the
discharge takes place, and partly upon that of any volatilizable
matter which may be introduced near the poles.
   The exciting of the magnet produces upon the spark proper no
appreciable effect; but as soon as the flame is submitted to                                                         its

commenced to revolve in the opposite direction to that in which
the arms had been revolving.          The movement kept up as long as
the candles were      burning,  and the speed was one revolution in two
minutes.
    The magnet was removed, the arms obeyed the force of radiation
 from the candles and revolved rapidly, whilst the glass envelope
quickly came to rest and then rotated very slowly the same way as
the arms went.
    The candles were blown out; and as soon as the whole instru
ment had come to rest a bar-magnet was moved alternately from
 one side to the other of the radiometer, so as to cause the vanes
 to rotate as if they had been under the influence of a candle.
 The glass envelope moved with some rapidity (about one revolution
in three minutes) in the direction the arms were moving.                 On
reversing the direction of movement of the arms the glass envelope
 changed direction also.
    These experiments show that the internal friction, either of the
 steel point on the glass socket, of the vanes against the residual
air, or of both these causes combined, is considerable.         Moving the
vanes round by the exterior magnet carries the whole envelope
round in opposition to the friction of the water against the glass.
    As there is much discussion at present respecting the cause of
these movements, and as some misunderstanding                seems to pre
vail as to    my   own views on the     theory of the   repulsion resulting
from    radiation,   I wish to take this    opportunity   of  removing   the
impression that     I  hold opinions which are in antagonism to some
strongly urged explanations of these actions.         I  have on five or six
occasions specially stated that       I  wish to keep free from theories.
During my four years' work on this subject          I  have accumulated a
large fund of experimental observations; and these often enable
me to see difficulties which could not be expected to occur to an
investigator who has had but a limited experience with the work
ing of one or two instruments.

    3. “Recent Glacial and Aqueous Action in Canada and the
Drift-Uplands of the Province of Ontario.”        By the Rev. Wm. Bleas
dell.    Communicated by the President.
    The author stated that an enormous amount of glacial action
takes place every winter in Canada, especially on the river St. Law
rence and its large lakes.       “Anchor ice" and “pack ice" are drifted
down the stream, abrading and carrying off piece-meal the various
small islands studded along its course. A “shove,” as it is termed,
often takes place on the breaking up of the ice; the broken blocks

Mr. Murphy           on the   Glacial Climate and                the   Polar Ice-cap:     395
of   ice are piled up and jammed    together, damming up the river;
and destructive floods ensue when the icy barrier gives way.   Several
examples of these phenomena which came under his notice are re
corded by the author.
   At Presqu'isle Point, Lake Ontario, “banks” of ice are formed by
the dashing up of the water.      These banks exercise an abrading
influence on the shore. In the winter of 1874–75 these ice “banks’’
were greater than ever known previously, extending 300 feet out.
into the lake, whilst some of the “hummocks" of ice were 20 feet
high. Some sixteen years ago a portion of the shore 40 feet wide
was laid bare in one winter.    The rocks thus exposed were finely
polished, grooved, and scratched. These marks have now been
obliterated by the very agent that formerly produced them. The
author also gives several instances of the formation and cutting
through of sandbanks and headlands.         The cutting back of the
coast-line of the lake is proceeding at the rate of from 30 to 40 feet
in twenty years.
   Fringing the basin of Lake Ontario are terraced highlands of
loose gravel, with here and there apparent stratification of a partial
character, called Artemisia-gravel by the Canadian Survey.          A
peculiar feature of these gravel ridges is the presence in them of
numerous small lakes. The author records the bursting of the
natural dam of one of these lakes, and mentions the occurrence of a
peculiar hollow, probably the basin of a lake that burst in a similar
way in former times.
   Freshwater-shell deposits occur here and there; further down the
river a brackish-water shell is found in them ; and they are replaced
lower down by marine deposits. The author quotes various opinions
relative to the formation of these terraces and shell-deposits by sup
posing the former existence of a barrier of ice or rock lower down
the river, and concludes that by these phenomena noteworthy altera
tions are year by year being made on the surface of the land.
  4. “The Glacial Climate and the Polar Ice-cap.”                                By Joseph
John Murphy, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author agrees with Mr. Croll in thinking that a glacial epoch
must be one of maximum eccentricity of the earth's orbit, and
that the northern and southern hemispheres during such an epoch
must be glaciated alternately; but he maintains, in opposition to that
writer, that the glaciated hemisphere must have       summer       aphe  its        in

those    of   Monte Somma.”           By         R.   Mallet, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The author stated that                            he

so that if the material of the cone were perfectly uniform, the dykes

uniformity and other causes, fissures commenced at the interior and

charcoal.  If touched by either flame, it is dissipated immediately,
imparting a brilliant green colour to the flame-border.           The
brown deposit is not readily seen on charcoal; but if the metal be
fused on a cupel, or on a piece of thin porcelain or other non-redu
cing body, the evolved fumes are almost wholly of a brownish
colour, and the deposit is in great part brownish black.     It would
appear, therefore, to consist of TIO, rather than of a mixture of
metal and oxide.   On the cupel thallium is readily oxidized and
absorbed.   It might  be employed, consequently, as suggested by
Crookes, in place of lead, in cupellation ; but to effect the absorp
tion of copper or nickel, a comparatively large quantity is required.
When fused on porcelain, the surface of the support is strongly
attacked by the formation of a silicate, which is deep red whilst
hot and pale yellow on cooling.             -
   The teroxide, as stated by Crookes, evolves oxygen when heated,
and becomes converted into T10. The latter compound is at once
reduced on charcoal, and the reduced metal is rapidly volatilized
with brilliant green coloration of the flame. The chloride produces
the same reaction, by which the green flame of thallium may easily
be distinguished     from the green copper-flame, the latter, in the
case of cupreous chlorides, becoming changed to azure blue.         With
 borax and phosphor-salt, thallium oxides form colourless glasses,
which become grey and opaque when exposed for a short time to a
reducing-flame.      With carbonate of soda they dissolve to some
extent; but on charcoal a malleable metallic globule is obtained.
The presence of soda, unless in great excess, does not destroy the
green coloration of the flame.                                      -
   Thallium   alloys  more or less readily with most other metals before
the blowpipe.      With platinum, gold, bismuth, and antimony re
 spectively, it forms a dark grey brittle globule.      With silver, cop
per, or lead, the button is malleable.        With tin,  thallium unites
readily; but the fused mass immediately begins to oxidize, throw
ing out excrescences of a dark colour, and continuing in a state of
ignition until the oxidation is complete. In this as in other reac
tions, therefore, the metal much resembles lead.
            ONTHE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF GALLIUM.
                    BY LECOQ DE BOISBAUDRAN.
  I  have recently prepared  rather more than half a gramme of pure
gallium. In the liquid state this metal is of a beautiful silvery
whiteness; but in crystallizing it assumes a very pronounced bluish
tinge, and   its
               lustre notably diminishes.
   By suitably working the solidification    overmelted gallium, iso
                                              of
lated crystals are obtained:      these are based octahedra, which

   In a  first trial (April 1876) the melting-point had been found        to   .   .
lie between 29° and 30°,     or about 29°5.   I  have just examined six
specimens    of gallium electrolyzed successively from one and the same
solution.    The foreign metals supposed     to    present would
                                                   be                un

    WAS     led to study the subject of this paper during a series
      of experiments undertaken for the purpose of directly
testing Ohm's law.
   The results arrived at are,      I  think, interesting, not only
in connexion with galvanometry, but also in relation to the
theory of induced magnetism. In the first instance I shall
describe the phenomena as simply as possible from the first
point of view, and then consider a little more closely some
points which arise when the matter is looked at from the second
point of view. This order is to a great extent that in which
the facts came under my notice; and it has the additional ad
vantage that it leads us incidentally to see that the phenomena
in question really have their seat solely and entirely within the
galvanometer, and have nothing to do with any phenomenon
of the nature of unilateral conductivity or with any other ex
cention to Ohm's law.
      .  Schuster has described f an experiment in which a
small current of constant direction is superposed on the alter
nating currents of a sine inductor, and the whole sent through
a galvanometer.      Such an experiment affords (under certain
suppositions) a test of Ohm's law; for the average intensity
of the current in the direction of the small constant current is
greater than that in the opposite direction ; hence, if the re

402             Mr. G. Chrystal    on  Bi-  and Unilateral
sistance of the circuit depends on the intensity of the current,
one of the currents will prevail, and the presence of the alter
nating currents will affect the permanent deflection due to the
 small constant current, whereas, if Ohm's law were true,
 there would be no such effect.              Without discussing Dr.
 Schuster's results    here, we   may   remark that a similar test of
 Ohm’s law could be obtained by merely passing through a
                  the currents from the secondary coil of an            in
   uctorium.     It is well known that if the primary be made and
 broken periodically, there will be an alternating current in the
 secondary, which will have the same period.                The whole
 quantity of electricity which passes during a complete oscilla
 tion is zero ; but the maximum intensities of the positive and
 negative parts of the current are very different.         H.     positive
 part, starting immediately after the break, has a considerable
 initial intensity, which is independent of the resistance of the
 secondary; the negative part, starting at the make, begins, on
the contrary, with zero intensity, and never reaches so large
a maximum as the positive".
    It follows that if the resistance of the circuit depends on the
intensity of the current, then the two parts of the current will
not experience equal resistances, and we shall get a galvano
meter indication in the direction of that which has the advan
tage. Any such effect would be much increased by the                    in
troduction into the secondary circuit of a resistance composed
of very fine wire. It is easy enough to calculate what this
resistance should be, in order to produce the greatest effect on
the galvanometer.
    Such a resistance I used in the shape of a fine German
silver wire (.002 inch diameter) wound on a cylindrical piece
of vulcanite about 9 inches long, the turns being insulated
from each other by the thread of a screw of one hundred turns
                                         8.
 to the inch cut in the vulcanite.         The whole is enclosed in a
glass tube with brass caps and copper terminals.            For this    in
strument I am indebted to Mr.                       of St. John's,     De
monstrator at the Cavendish Laboratory.              The induction-coil
 used was of the ordinary lecture-room form by Apps; the
primary was made and broken by electric tuning-forks of
various pitch.
    The results    I  obtained indicated an apparent departure
from Ohm's law, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in the
other. The presence or absence of the fine wire in the circuit
did not seem to be an essential condition of the phenomenon.
   * This supposes the period of alternation long compared with the time
constants of the coil; the same description applies, in a modified degree,-
to other cases.

I  was therefore led to suspect that the cause lay in the galva
nometer itself—a suspicion which became certainty
found that reversing the galvanometer-connexions with the
secondary, or reversing the primary, had no effect whatever
on the character of the phenomena.                  It appeared that the
effects observed could be          analyzed     as follows:—Suppose          we
are using a Thomson's galvanometer with mirror, lamp, and
scale as usual, and                 let
                              the scale        placed parallel be      the coil                to

to me to explain this suggested the existence of the first set
 I  was not then aware of Poggendorff's description).                Fact
  II. shows that the     phenomena     have   nothing    to do with any
departure from Ohm's law in the case of induction-currents;
and it seemed clear that the cause must be sought for in
alterations of the magnetism of the needle.
    Bilateral deflection was observed and minutely experi
mented on by Poggendorff.            Unilateral deflection does not
seem to have come under his notice, and has not, so far as                                                    I
am aware, been described elsewhere".               Poggendorff gave a
general explanation of the phenomenon he observed, attribu
ting it to the effect of the alternating currents on the mag
netism of the needle.       His description has led others to sup
pose that the effect never appears otherwise than in rendering
the needle unstable f. It will be seen, however, from the above
 facts that this is not so.    It is easy, moreover, to show that a
general theory of the phenomenon would predict this.

on going to the right (increasing 6) the curve (2) lies above

P and P'   have now disappeared, and the equilibrium at O has
become stable. This corresponds to case (1) of the second
state of the phenomenon.
   Lastly, suppose B small and a not zero, then we must dis
place the origin in curve (1) to the right, say. We thus get

stable; and Q represents a single stable position when the cur
rents are going.    The deflection corresponding to this posi
tion is On, where n is the foot of the ordinate of Q, and O n is
 > O O", in accordance with the experimental facts above stated.
    Similar reasoning would show that if the magnet had been
deflected in the opposite direction, the alternating currents
would have increased the deflection in the same direction.    In
fact the above   simple  graphical   representation embraces the

portance of these phenomena in relation to experiments such
as those of Dr. Schuster, where alternating currents are used.
   In attempting to get a clearer insight into the nature of the
effect on the magnetism of the needle, I was led to make some
numerical verifications, and to give some variations to the
experiment which may perhaps be of interest.
   The phenomenon of magnetic induction is more or less
complicated according to circumstances.              We have to deal,
in fact, with several distinct phenomena, which may for the
present purpose be classified under two heads:—I. Tempo
rary Magnetism ;                  II.
                             Residual Magnetism and                gradual                      its

                     stress     any way.     in

   I. An elongated magnet magnetized axially would give phe
nomena analogous to those observed.
  II.  A spherical magnet would give no such phenomena.
  III.   An elongated magnet magnetized transversely would
  ive similar phenomena, except that in unilateral deflection
the sign of the effect would be reversed; i.e., the spot of light
being brought, by means of the deflecting magnet, to the right
or left of zero, the effect of the alternating currents would be
to diminish this deflection.
    Conclusion          III.
                     was directly verified ; and the result was in
complete agreement with theory.          Conclusion II. was also
verified experimentally.     A small spherical steel magnet was
fitted with a mirror hung up in the galvanometer and observed,
as will be afterwards described in the case of an elongated
magnet magnetized axially. The magnetic moment of the
sphere was roughly determined for me by Mr. Shaw, B.A., of
   manuel College;

   Two cells of Grove were used in the primary of the induc
tion-coil.  The result was a feeble unilateral deflection.
An observation was made with an elongated magnet con
sisting of a piece of thin watch-spring magnetized longitudi
nally.        The maximum earth's couple in this case was about
                               All

before. The result was strong bilateral deflection. Here the two
magnets were very nearly in the same circumstances, the ad
vantage being somewhat in favour of the sphere, owing to                                                     its

of windings, partly of thin and partly of thick wire, is about
2668, making up a resistance of about 68 ohms. The chan
nels are cut in the same piece of boxwood, along the axis of
which is drilled a cylindrical hole in which hangs the magnet.
The ends of this cylindrical cavity are closed by two caps, one
of which is fitted with a plano-convex lens, the other with a
piece of plane-parallel glass. The torsion-head is fitted with
a Weber's suspension-screw in the usual way. The whole of
the upper part is supported on a foot, with placing screws in
such a way that the coils can be turned about a vertical axis.
   The magnet consisted of a piece of silvered glass fitted to a
brass frame, with weights for increasing the moment of inertia.
To the back of this was fitted a thin piece of magnetized watch
                ºf
spring about 10 millims. long and 2 millims. broad. Under
the earth's force the period of the needle's oscillation was 22-2
sec.   This was        to 492 sec. by properly weakening the
field.
   The deflection of the magnet was measured by means of a
scale and telescope in the ordinary way, the position of rest
being deduced from three elongations. The deflection of the
coils was measured by means of the faint image of the scale
from the plate-glass cap which closes the cylindrical core.
    The battery used was six cells of Smee ; and the primary
circuit was made and broken by means of an electric tuning
fork lent me by Mr. Dew Smith, driven by the primary cur
rent itself. The induction-coil was of the ordinary construc
tion, the resistance of the secondary being about 2714 ohms.
   By making an observation with the planes of the plate-glass
cap and mirror very nearly parallel, the value of the correction
                                                        diº
for the deviation of magnetic axis of needle in this position
from the true plane of the coils was found. Using this cor
rection, a series of observations with different               of
the coils gave  the following result:—

414              Prof. E. Ketteler on the Dispersion of Light
 was now driven by an auxiliary battery. The value of n was
 50. The galvanometer (resistance about 68) was put in the
 primary as above described.
    The above calculation represents the case thus realized pretty
 closely; for although the self-induction of the galvanometer
 has been neglected and the resistance of the battery only
 roughly estimated,
                                   i.
                              neither of these affects the important
term. The result, therefore, of experiment ought to be nearly
 as above predicted.       It was so as nearly as could be seen,
taking account of unavoidable experimental errors.
    It appears, therefore, that the above theory stands so far the
test of experiment. When                        I
                                    can get the use of a sine-inductor
or a   sufficiently  delicate  electrodynamometer     (both of which
will probably soon be added to the collection of instruments at
the Cavendish Laboratory), it will be easy to test the theory
still further.
     Ifit be accepted, it seems to me that an interesting conclu
sion follows, viz. that, of the total induced magnetism which a
given field of force is capable of generating in any body placed
in    it,   avery considerable fraction must          developed               be                  in    a

velocity-surface of the normal (corresponding to the “first
ellipsoid"), as the primary, has been derived. Making use
of this latter, the velocity-surface of the rays, the “wave
surface" (corresponding to the second or Plücker's ellipsoid),
is then obtained as the envelope of the same. The wave
surface thus appears only as secondary or derived from the
former, while in nature it is quite the reverse: here the wave
surface only has a physical meaning, and the normal surface
is associated with it solely as an (of course valuable) auxiliary
surface.
  The incorrectness referred to can only be avoided by                                            ad
mitting also the vibrations of the corporeal particles.

   d. On the other hand, again, on account of the difference
intimated, it does not appear indispensable that the corporeal

We preliminarily leave it undecided whether the vibrations                                                           of

       spectra for technological as well as purely scientific
reasons; but in the absence of classification and of a general

increase of absorption without any structural alterations in the
absorbing medium; for the cupric sulphate remains the same
during the two observations, and the temperature is unaltered.
The only difference is one of extent of medium.         For this
kind of    absorption  we  propose, at  the  suggestion  of Dr.
 Guthrie, the term transverse absorption.
    Professor Gladstone", when speaking of the action of heat
 on coloured solutions, thus tacitly refers to the two kinds of
 absorption:-"The elevation of temperature seems merely to
 heighten the absorbent power of the dissolved salt, so that
 light absorbed by a certain quantity of the heated solution is
 the same as would have been absorbed by a larger quantity of
 the same solution if cold.” Notwithstanding this, the two
 kinds of absorption seem not to have been formally separated;
 and the mixed inferences from one and the other have natu
rally produced a confusion in the minds of students which has
made selective absorption a subject little understood.              We
shall confine our observations to structural absorption.

  The scale may be illustrated by heating the following anhy
drous bodies on white porcelain.    Zinc oxide changes from
white to yellow and orange; metaborate of copper from blue
to green and yellowish green ; baric chromate from yellow to
orange; mercuric oxide from orange-yellow to orange, red,
and brown ; potassic dichromate, red to dark red ; trimanganic
tetroxide, reddish brown to nearly black; and cuprous oxide
glass from scarlet to dark scarlet and black.
    Respecting this colour-change, we make out:-(1) that it
arises from increased structural absorption with elevation of
temperature, the more refrangible increment increasing at a
greater rate than the less refrangible; and (2) that the only
 necessary concomitant is alteration of atomic potentiality—a
 change from the white towards the black end of the meta
       º
 chromatic scale signifying atomic recession, and a change
 from the black towards the white end, atomic approach.
     (1) In support of this we must refer to the bichromate ex
 periment.        e change from red to dark red viewed spectro
 scopically gives spectra Nos.1 and 2.

 changing bodies in various media, as nitrogen, carbonic anhy
 dride, and hydrogen, the result of which has been to show that

 tism.     The phenomenon is exhibited by                     all

bodies one meets with in the laboratory; for many anhydrous
silicates exhibit colour-change, and in some the change is
permanent after the metachrome has been subjected to a high
temperature. This is shown in the following Table" in each
example save that                of olivine.

       From the nature of metachromatism, it is probable that                                                              in

    accompanied by a corresponding alteration of molecular inter
    spaces.    Hence in allotropes we shall look for exactly the op
    posite of what Delaval sought to establish, viz. for cold colours
    with great density and warm ones with low density.

     The Five Orders of Spectra.-In the borderland between
chemistry and physics, data are being accumulated which tend
to make the former a dynamical science. Not the least im
portant of these data are those which furnish us with the con
nexion between the different kinds of spectra.            Professor
Roscoe is of opinion" that there is not sufficient evidence as
      to support the sequence in the five orders proposed by
}.  ockyerf and now generally received; and in the light of
metachromatism it may be necessary to modify this sequence.
The juxtaposition of the orders constituting a class of spectra
 we take to be founded upon that merging of the optical cha
 racters of one order into those of another which is exhibited
when the molecular changes in the radiating or absorbing body
 cause such optical alterations.       Now confining our attention
to low-temperature or absorption spectra, it is evident from
what has already been said that change in structural absorp
 tion alone is available for forming a sequence of orders. Hence
 we consider the fifth order, as at present received, misplaced,
                                                                                                 .

     A sequence of orders will readily suggest itself if we keep in

  Conceive of a colourless body capable of undergoing the whole
 series of change.      It first reflects or transmits rays of every
  refrangibility; as absorption increases, the band of transmitted
  or reflected light gradually narrows and becomes less intense;
  finally the field is darkened and we get continuous absorption.

                   Lord Rayleigh on the Resistance of Fluids.                            431
this objection that a mathematically sharp edge is an impossi
bility, inasmuch    as the electrical law of flow would require ne
gative pressure in cases where the edge is not perfectly sharp,
as may be readily proved from the theory of the simple cir
cular vortex, in which the velocity varies inversely as the dis
tance from the axis.
    The application of these ideas to the problem of the resist
ance of a stream to a plane lamina immersed transversely
amounts to a justification of the older theory as at least ap
proximately correct.        Behind the lamina the fluid is at rest
under a pressure equal to that which prevails at a distance,
the region of rest being bounded by a surface of separation or
discontinuity which joins the lamina tangentially, and is deter
mined mathematically by the condition of constant pressure.
 On the anterior surface of the lamina there is an augmenta
tion of pressure corresponding to the loss of velocity.
    The relation between the yelocity and pressure in a steady
 stream of incompressible fluid may be obtained immediately
 by considering the transference of energy along an imaginar
 tube bounded by stream-lines.          In consequence of the steadi
 ness of the   motion,  there must be the same amount of energy
 transferred in a   given   time across any one section of the tube
 as across  any   other. Now if p and v be the pressure and velo
 city respectively at any point, and p be the density of the fluid,
 the energy corresponding to the passage of the unit of volume
 is p + ºpe", of which the first term represents potential, and
 the second kinetic energy; and thus p + Apr’ must retain the
 same value at             all
                      points           of
                                 the same stream-line.             further    It   is
 true, though not required for our present purpose                                  or   to   be
 proved       simply, that
              on so
                                   ºptº retains
                                      p    +         constant value not
                                                                a
 merely       the same    stream-line,    but also when we pass from
 one stream-line          another, provided that the fluid flows
                                 to
 throughout the region considered            accordance with the elec

   If        the velocity
              be                      of

                                   resistances went         the assump   on
  tion that the    velocity           of
                                the stream was       destroyed   over the
  whole       of
             the anterior face         the lamina, and therefore led
                                                 of
 to  the conclusion that the resistance amounted                   pu" for     to

derable velocity, and at the edge itself retains the full velocity
of the original stream. Nevertheless the amount of error                          in
volved in the theory referred to is not        t, as appears from
the result of Kirchhoff's calculation of the case of two dimen
sions, from which it follows that the resistance per unit of area
is
          T
               pu” instead    of     pu".
      4+T
     Itis worthy of notice that by a slight modification of the
 conditions of the problem the estimate pu” may be made ac
 curate.   For this purpose the lamina is replaced by the bottom
 of a  box-shaped   vessel, whose sides project in the direction
 from which the stream is flowing, and are sufficiently extended
 to cause approximate quiescence over the whole of the bottom
 (Plate V. fig. 1).     In the absence of friction, the sides
 themselves do not contribute any thing to the resistance.     It
appears from this argument that the increase of resistance
due to concavity can never exceed a very moderate value.
    Although not very closely connected with the principal sub
ject of this communication, it may be well to state the corre
 sponding result in the case of a compressible fluid such as air.
If  po be the normal pressure in the stream, a the velocity of
 sound corresponding to the general temperature, y the ratio
 of the two specific heats, pu” is replaced by
                                            –1   wº,                    -
                         p.   ((1+*.*.)”-1},
which gives the resistance per unit of area. The compression
is supposed (as in the theory of sound) to take place without
loss of heat; and the numerical value of y is 1:408.
   When u is small in comparison with a, the resistance fol
lows the same law as if the fluid were incompressible ; but in
the case of greater velocities the resistance increases more ra
pidly. The resistance to a meteor moving at speeds compa
rable with 20 miles per second must be enormous, as also
the rise of temperature due to compression of the air.        In
fact it seems quite unnecessary to appeal to friction in order
to explain the phenomena of light and heat attending the
entrance of a meteor into the earth's atmosphere.
   But although the old theory of resistance was not very
wide of the mark in                its
                           application     the case    to  lamina           of

the stream divides, and where accordingly the pressure attains
its greatest value. It will be seen that, as might be expected,
this distance becomes small at moderate obliquities.
   The result of Vince's experiments agrees with theory re
markably well; and the contrast with sin” a is especially worthy
of note. The experiments were made with a whirling machine,
and appear to have been carefully conducted ; but they were
on too small a scale to be quite satisfactory.      The subject

      a lower pressure through a hole in a thin plate has
been the subject of much controversy.       Of late years it has
been  placed in a much clearer  light by  a direct application of
the principle of momentum to the circumstances of the problem                                                     -

   For the sake of simplicity the liquid will be supposed to be
unacted upon by gravity, and to be expelled from the vessel
by the force of compressed air through a hole of area a in a
thin plane plate forming part of the sides of the vessel. After
passing the hole the jet contracts, and at a little distance
assumes the form    of a cylindrical bar of reduced area      The                                  a”.

resolved part of this velocity in a direction perpendicular to
the plane of the orifice.  Thus it is only in the middle of the
jet that the whole velocity is efficient; near the edge the mo
tion is tangential ; and consequently this part contributes but
 little to the discharge. It is certain that the discharge will be
considerably less than ca, or, which is the same thing, that
the jet must undergo considerable contraction before the liquid
composing it can move in parallel lines with uniform velocity r.

By    means         of these points the curve, fig. 6, is constructed. From
(10),
                                  s= — log cos 6;
so that the radius                    of curvature is tan 6.
                                              The curvature is
therefore infinite at the origin, and diminishes continually
                                                      -      as
s increases.
   In discussions on the cause of the contraction of the jet
doubts have been expressed as to the reality of the deficiency
of velocity in the middle of the orifice; and it may therefore
be worth while to examine this point more closely.        For this
purpose it will be convenient to express 2 or a + iy in terms of                                                                                  .

A  few pairs of corresponding values of y and v will give an
idea of the relation expressed in (17).

‘58 of that prevailing in the vessel, the external pressure being
treated as zero.   In these statements the ultimate velocity is
understood to be unity, and the scale of linear magnitude is
such that 2+T represents the width of the orifice.

   The principle of momentum gives interesting information on
the question of the mutual action of streams which come into
collision.   Suppose, for example, that the motion is in two
dimensions,        that two equal streams moving with the same
velocity meet at an angle 22 (fig 4). After the collision the fluid
resolves itself into two other streams of unequal width parallel
to the line bisecting the angle 22 ; and a question arises as to
the relative magnitude of these streams. The ultimate velocity
is of course in both parts the same as before the collision.

1:   3. The effect            of friction would be                 to make the ratio still

    My dear Mr. Guthrie,                         Morges, 4th Oct. 1876.
          I  kept back for some days the above letter (which             I
wrote on the 29th of September), because             I had decided to
verify some of the observations which did not agree with my
formula.        I  have returned to day from Wesen, where          I have
 been examining the Lake of Wallenstadt, and            I  am happy to
inform you that the question which perplexed me is now fully
    Rºg
 cleared up.
                    to my former observations, the duration of the
seiches on the Lake of Wallenstadt was 371", the length being
 15,000 metres. Calculations from the formula gave a mean
depth of 128 metres. Now the only depth given, and which
was considered the maximum, was 114 metres.                Accordingly
either the formula must be defective or the real         depth   must be
greater.       The latter is the case.      Soundings     which    I  took
yesterday in this lake showed me that there is a great basin
of comparatively even bottom, having at different points the
depths of 97, 104, 118, 128, 133, 136, 138 metres.             These, as
you see, have a mean value which approaches much more
closely to the value 120, which the formula gives.
    I am happy in being able to give you this new confirmation
 of  my  hypothesis, and &c. &c.

   I have supposed      liquid surface in contact with air; but
                             the
equation (1) evidently applies to the case of the surface of
separation of two liquids which do not mix, or to that of the
surface of contact of a solid and a liquid. I shall speedily
treat the case in which S represents either the free surface of
a solid body, the surface of separation of two solid bodies, the
free surface of a gas, or the surface of contact of a solid and
a gas. At present I shall deduce from this equation several
 consequences which appear to be of great import.
    I. If   we impart to a liquid mass m an increment dS of
free   surface, then the potential energy T is a positive quantity;
 that is to say, the total initial potential energy has received a
positive increment TdS.        It follows that the mass m, having
 acquired a greater potential energy, must have lost a certain
quantity of heat; that           d0      is,
                                         negative. This  is shown                          is

  This value shows that the less the mass m and the specific
heat k, the more will the temperature vary.
   Here are two curious facts, the explanation of which long
 uzzled me, and which, in my provisional opinion, proceed
immediately from the above value of the variation of tempe

       the same    temperature as the liquid) evidently produces a
larger and larger free surface; and consequently the mass must

            the increment of surface dS is produced by a solid
                                                                                                i.
body immersed in the mass m and not wetted by the liquid, a
work TidS must be developed, Ti designating the potential
energy of the unit of surface of contact. Now                 de                           I
monstrated" that this     energy  constitutes a real tension;  it
follows that in this case, again, the liquid mass will undergo
a diminution of temperature which will be greater in propor
tion as the mass m and the specific heat k are less.
     Ishall shortly endeavour to prove this assertion by direct
experiments; but, as                       I
                           shall show further on, there are facts
                        indirectly.
which demonstrate it
     III. Suppose in the third place, that the increment dS
  iven to the surface is produced by a solid body plunged in
the mass m and wetted by the liquid; then the potential
energy T, of the unit of surface of contact of the solid and
liquid is not due to a force of tension, but to a force of ea:-
tension, as I have sought to establish in the Note above cited.
It hence follows that the potential energy of the mass, instead
of being increased by the augmentation of the surface,                                                  is,   on
the contrary, diminished; and consequently this loss          po                                        of
tential  energy   must    compensatedbe      heating    the mass    by   a                 of
m.       This follows immediately from formula (1), where                                           º         is
then positive, and consequently also d().
   This curious theoretical consequence seems fully verified                                                  by
the numerous experiments made         1822     Pouillett, who  in              by
ascertained that heat        disengaged whenever

organic materials, vegetable or animal, gave much more
marked results: thus paper, first dried and then impregnated
with water, received a rise of temperature of 4°52; sponge,
1°9; starch, 9°7; iris-root, 6°12; liquorice-root, 10°2; .
ox-tendon, 3°16; and the very thin membranes of the in
testines of sheep, 9°-6 with water, and 10°12 with alcohol.
These results, so surprising, compared with equation (1) ap
pear to furnish, for the extreme tenuity of the ultimate organic
particles into which liquids can penetrate, a proof at least un
expected, if not as certain as microscopic observations.
     ouillet's experiments were followed up in 1855 by M.
Jungk", who established the following facts:–(1) in water
absorbed by sand, there is depression or elevation of tempe
rature, according as the initial temperature of the liquid is
 below or above +4°C.; (2) the temperature is diminished
in water at 0° absorbed by snow. These two facts, intimately
connected with the abnormal expansion of water in the in
terval between       maximumits   density and     freezing-point,

relations between thermal, electric, and capillary phenomena.
   M. Lippmann has proved the existence                   two very im                     of

   2nd. When               a  surface       deformed by mechanical
means, the electrical difference             that surface variesof is                                              in   a
direction such that the superficial tension developed opposes
the continuance of the movement.
   The preceding demonstration enables                   see that these             us    to

the superficial tension developed opposes the continuation of
the movement.
   Let us now cite two verifying experiments described by
M. Lippmann.
     Experiment       I.--Two glasses, both containing        mercury
covered with acidulated      water,  are  placed side   by side ; they
are   put into electrical communication       by means of a cotton
wick; the two masses of mercury communicate with the ex
terior by means of platinum wires which do not touch the
acidulated water. After putting these wires in communica
tion with the extremities of a galvanometer-wire, the experi
menter inclines one of the two glasses; the needle of the
galvanometer is immediately deflected, indicating a current
passing through the liquid of the inclined glass towards the
glass that remains upright.
    By this operation the surface of contact of the mercury
and acidulated water in the first glass is enlarged; this sur
face must therefore be cooled, and the potential energy in it
increased ; but, in return, the electrical difference there has
diminished ; hence the current just indicated.
    M. Lippmann adds that the electrification is in time dissi
pated ; this is quite natural, since the current arises only from
                                             -
a difference of temperature.
    Experiment II.-Instead of inclining one of the glasses, the
surface of the mercury contained in it can be enlarged by
               it,
                                          is it,
depressing      dipping into        for example, the end          glass     of   a
or   wooden  rod;  when this       done,  we see the   galvanometer
                                                     -
needle deflected immediately.
    Thus my second consequence would                found fully con
                                                               be

 from a diminution of temperature due to the great increase
 of the liquid surface without the platinum sponge being wetted,
 thanks to the layer of air which covers it? But soon this air
 is expelled ; and then a large surface is wetted by the liquid,
 whence results a rise of temperature, and consequently a
 current in the opposite direction and more energetic than the
 first.
     V. Equations (1) and (2) appear to me to prove rigorously
 that every change in the surface of a liquid gives rise to a
 change of temperature, and, if the circuit is closed, to a ther
 moelectric current.     From this point of view these equations
 must be of capital importance in meterology.           Indeed, if a
 mere drop of water falling into a pond, and there losing the
 whole of       original free surface, can produce, independently
              its

  LVII.        On some Blowpipe Reactions.     By E.   CHAPMAN,          J.
         Ph.D.,    Professor in University College, Toronto".
ON IttheisOpalescence produced by Silicates in Phosphor-salt.—
            well known that most silicates when fused with
phosphor-salt are only partially attacked—the bases, as a rule,
ñº.         dissolving in the flux, whilst the silica remains in
the form of a flocculent mass technically known as a “silica
skeleton.”     Very commonly, almost invariably, indeed, if the
blast be long continued, the bead becomes more or less milky
or opalescent on cooling. This latter reaction was apparently
regarded by Plattner as essentially due to the presence of
alkaline or earthy bases, such as exhibit the reaction per                                 se.
He states (Probirkunst Dritte Auflage,
                                  :               468)—“Da man  p.

silica will immediately take place, the bead becoming milky
—or, in the case of many silicates, opaque-white—on cooling.
This test may be resorted to for the detection of silica in the
case of silicates which dissolve with difficulty in phosphor-salt
alone, or which do not give a well-pronounced “skeleton ’’
with that reagent".
    On the Reactions of Chromium and Manganese with Car
bonate of Soda.--When a mineral substance is suspected to
contain manganese, it is commonly tested by fusion with car
bonate of soda.     But chromium compounds form with that re
agent a green enamel much resembling that formed by com
pounds of manganese.
    The chromate-of-soda enamel, however, is yellowish-green
after exposure to an oxidating flame; and the green colour
never exhibits any tinge of blue.
    The manganate-of-soda enamel, on the other hand, is
generally greenish-blue when quite cold.
    To avoid, however, any risk of error in the determination,
the bead may be saturated with vitrified boracic acid until                                                         all

     On the Detection of Bromine in Blowpipe Experiments.-
 When fused with phosphor-salt and copper oxide, the bromides,
 it is well known, impart an azure-blue coloration to the flame,
 much like that produced by chlorides under similar treatment,
although streaked more or less with green, especially at the
commencement of the operation.              To distinguish these bodies
                                               º,
more     closely, Berzelius recommended the fusion of the test
 substance with 6 or 7 volumes of bisulphate of potash in a
 closed tube.       Bromides by this treatment become decom
posed, as a rule, and give off                         smelling brownish
 or yellowish-red vapours of bromine.              But this process does
not always give satisfactory results, as in some instances the
bromide is very slightly attacked.            In this case, the following
method, based on a peculiar reaction of bromide of silver, first
pointed out by Plattner, may be resorted                       to.

mineral substance of non-metallic aspect, in nine cases out of
ten, will be either a silicate, sulphate, phosphate, borate, car

if the substance            no fumes when heated on charcoal.
     Simple fusion with phosphor-salt on a loop of platinum wire
serves at once to distinguish a silicate from any of the other
bodies enumerated above, as whilst the silicate is but slowly
attacked, these other bodies are readily and rapidly dissolved.
Among the latter, again, the carbonates are distinguished
without risk of error by the marked effervescence which they
 produce in the bead by the evolution of carbonic acid during
 fusion, the phosphates, sulphates, &c. dissolving quietly.              The
 reaction is quite as distinctive as that produced by the appli
 cation of an ordinary acid; but, of course, it may arise in both
 cases not only from a carbonate proper, but from the presence
 of intermixed calcite or other carbonate in a silicate or other
 body.     It was by               its

THE“Experimentspaper was read:—
                 on the Friction between            Water and Air.” By
Dr. Ritter von Lang.
   The method adopted for estimating the mutual friction of water
and air consisted in connecting a glass tube of 8 centims. length
and 0.72 internal diameter with the pipes which supply Vienna
with water at a pressure of four atmospheres.              Arrangements
for  securing   a vertical  position    for the tube ensure a perfectly
continuous    jet, devoid of   any   broken surface; and a glass tube
surrounding this jet, with               its
                                   axis coinciding with that       the jet,        of
acts  as    aspirator,

lateral feeding-tube.     The amount         this indrawn air correspond

                          which      film a    soap was borne along the
feeding-tube; and the velocity           the water causing the indraught

   Neglecting the slightly conical character of the surface of the
water column, and assuming (as the result of experiments in which
the motion of a smoke cloud was observed) that the movement
of the air was throughout in lines parallel to the axis of the tube
along which it flowed, and showing that the pressure does not vary
along the length of the tube, the author proceeds to discuss the
hydrodynamic equations expressing the conditions of the problem
(the motion of the air being uniform and independent of time), and
represents the volume of air A passing through the tube in a second

W being the   weight of water, in grammes, discharged in a second,
r the radius   of the jet in turns of the micrometer-screw (6-8
turns of which correspond to 1 centim.), R being the radius of the
aspirating tube.
   The results obtained by observation accorded well with those
given by this equation, so long as the value of R did not exceed
the limit within which the suppositions regarding the motion of
the air hold good.                                                                               -
   The question was considered whether the results might not be
brought into even closer accord with theory by the assumption
that a slipping action takes place between the air and the water
jet on the one hand, and between the air and the tube on the other,
instead of the assumption previously made that the air adhered alike
to the water and to the tube in         passage.      its

experiments    with other materials for the tube and other gases
(namely, coal-gas and carbonic anhydride) were made, without re
sulting     any marked difference from the results obtained with air
           in
and  glass.

granite, indicating the changes produced by the intrusion of the
latter upon clay slate and upon certain igneous rocks. The slates
in contact with granite become converted into tourmaline- and mica
schists, and are found to contain crystalline quartz, tourmaline, and
three distinct varieties of mica, with occasionally tremolite, magne
tite (and andalusite?), and in some localities felspar. Their struc
ture is also changed, the most remarkable changes being foliation,
with every gradation from nearly straight parallel lines to the most
complicated contortions—and concretionary structure by segregation
of quartz and mica, the result being a spotted schist. The strata near
the granite contain far more quartz than those at a distance; and
the author thought that there could be no doubt that much of the
quartz has been derived directly from the intruded rock. He referred
particularly to the fluid-cavities contained in the quartz of the gra
nite, schorl-rock, and altered slates, and, from his observations
upon them, stated that he was compelled to dissent from the views
of Mr. Sorby, inasmuch as he found no uniformity to prevail in the
relative sizes of the bubbles and fluid-cavities in the quartz crystals
belonging to precisely the same portion of rock, or even in the same
crystals.   Hence he regarded it as impossible to arrive at even an ap
proximate estimate of either the temperature or the pressure under
which a given rock was formed from a consideration of such charac
ters.   The author next described the characters and mode of occur
rence of tourmaline both in the granite and in the schorl-rock, and
inferred that at the separation of the latter from the former the
whole mass was in a plastic state, and that then the tourmaline and
quartz became crystallized in an order varying in accordance with
varying conditions. He also noticed the alteration of tourmaline pro
ducing pseudomorphs of that mineral ; and stated that while          the all
three varieties   mica found distinctly furnish the red lithium-line
                  of
when treated spectroscopically, this most strongly marked and per

unable  to decide whether these masses are contemporaneous and                 in

the microscopic examination of which shows that the pyroxenic
mineral, whether augite or diallage, has frequently been con
verted into a hornblendic substance, and that actinolite is found
filling cavities and fissures in precisely the same manner as other
products of alteration.    The imperfect cleavage of the more compact
varieties is regarded by the author as in accordance with the facts
observed in typical slates.     The metamorphism of the dolerites is
regarded by him as different in kind from that of the slates, and
caused rather by a decomposition and rearrangement of mineral
substances in situ than by an introduction of new material; in
many cases the process of alteration may be followed step by step;
and from the evidence it would appear that two rocks of similar ori
gin and composition may follow two different lines of metamorphosis,
and thus become converted into two totally different substances; and,
again, many of the metamorphic rocks have undergone a second series
of changes, brought about chiefly by chemical forces, and indicated
by the occurrence of micaceous and chloritic pseudomorphs after
tourmaline and an alteration (hydration) of the mica.
    With regard to the origin of the granite of Cornwall, the author
said that neither observation in the field nor microscopical study
lends any support to the notion that it is a metamorphic rock—
but on the contrary, that there is the clearest evidence of former
deep-seated volcanic action in the disturbance and alteration de
scribed in his paper, and in the enormous number of granitic and
felsitic dykes intersecting the country for miles. The mode of oc
currence of granite in other localities also seems to him to        fur
nish evidence in the same direction.

shire and Denbighshire to beds usually described as Permian.”        By
D. C. Davies, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author described sections obtained at the Ifton Rhyn Col
lieries and other places in the neighbourhood, and compared these
with other sections displayed in different parts of England and
the continent, and also in Nova Scotia, and stated his conviction
that from the Spirorbis-limestone     upwards, to and including the
Permian, we have one continuous series of deposits. He maintained
that there is no real general break in the sequence of the strata or
in the continuity of life, but only local unconformabilities marked
by equally local gaps in the succession of life.

Gippsland, Victoria.”     By A. W. Howitt, Esq., F.G.S.
    The earliest formation of which any trace is left in this district is
the Silurian—all traces of any older rocks being removed, probably
by the same agencies which have contorted and metamorphosed the
 Silurian slates and sandstones. The surface of all these Silurian
 strata shows signs of great denudation previous to the deposition of
 the Devonian.     The period that elapsed between these two epochs

was one of volcanic activity, apparently subaerial and terrestrial,
and representing the Lower Devonian. The Middle Devonian strata
consist of shales and sandstones devoid of any traces of volcanic
action, which, however, again becomes apparent in the Upper De
vonian.    The latter consists of conglomerates, sandstones, and shales,
interstratified with aqueous deposits. The prevailing red colour
of these beds the author                        suggests         may possibly indicate lacustrine
rather than marine conditions.
   The next in the series of deposits present in North Gippsland are
of Tertiary age, and rest horizontally on the flanks of the mountains
at elevations nowhere exceeding 1000 feet. At the close of the
Miocene and at the commencement of the Pliocene period the land
probably was from 300 feet to 400 feet lower than at present.
   The fact that different genera of fish are found in the streams
flowing from the north and south sides of the Australian Alps
indicate the high antiquity of that watershed. These mountains
have been formed by the gradual elevation of the land en masse, and
its equally gradual erosion                       by
                                the streams and rivers.

       The author carefully compares the situations, structures, &c. of
    these two shingle beaches, and points out that their wonderful
    similarity is due to nearly the same natural causes in each case, but
    that at Chesil the driftage is due to the flow-tide current aug
    mented by waves caused by the prevailing winds, while at Cahore
    the driftage is solely due to the flow-tide currents,         effects being                      its

formable, the Permian formation being nearly horizontal, and the
Coal-measures dipping at an angle of 15° to the north-east.     At the
western end of the tunnel another fault lets down the Permian
12 feet; the Coal-measures are consequently lost to sight, until again
brought up by another fault on the other side of the village.      The
author considers that the Permian strata are closely related to the
overlying Trias, and are unconformable to the Coal-measures.
     Here and there patches of drift were met with, but almost en
tirely in the Bunter country, owing to the friable nature of that
deposit. These patches are probably the remnants of a drift once
more widely spread.
     Traces of drift on the Keuper country are remarkably few.     Two
patches have been preserved by a fault on the north-eastern side of
Nottingham.
     In  a cutting on a new line of the Midland Railway it is found
that the Avicula-contorta shales have been removed by evident
glacial action, and redeposited among other materials on the planed
 and striated surface of the indurated greenish-grey marls of the
 lowest Rhaetic strata.

 Relations to the under- and overlying Formations.”      By E. Wilson,
 Esq., F.G.S.
     The author describes, as follows, the same section as that noticed
 in the preceding paper:—Lower Bunter, 30 feet; breccia of various
  slates and grits &c., underlain by red and yellow mottled and grey
 sandstones, considered by the author to be passage-beds between
 the Bunter and the Permian formations; these are followed by
 ordinary Permian marls, 21 feet; Magnesian Limestone, 33 feet;
  slate-coloured thin-bedded sandstones and shales, with a breccia at
 the base, 19 to 20 feet. The breccia rests in a series of very gentle
 undulations on a planed-off surface of Coal-measure shales which dip
  in a north-easterly direction at an angle of 15°. This unconformity
  between the Coal-measures and the almost horizontal Permians is
 most pronounced, a fact long ago pointed out by Prof. Sedgwick, and
 tends to confirm the supposition of the pre-Permian elevation and
 denudation of the Penine axis.
     The author considers the breccia at the base of the Permian, and
 possibly that of the Lower Bunter, to be of glacial origin. The
  paucity of life in the intervening beds might thus be accounted for.
     20. “The Section at High Force, Teesdale.”        By C. T. Clough,
  Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     The section described by the author (in descending order) is as
 follows:—Basalt, 24 feet; altered shale, 13 foot; basalt, 6 feet;
 altered shale, 12 feet; limestone, 32 feet. The second stratum of
 basalt has been erroneously described in Phillips's “Geology of York
 shire’ as “plate” or shale, whereas it is merely an underflow of the
 basalt.    About 20 yards below the Force the lower and intercalated

474                         Geological Society.
layer of basalt has entirely disappeared. These intercalated (not
interstratified) beds of volcanic rock are common throughout the
district, and tend to prove the irruptive nature of the Whin Sill, as
maintained by the late Prof. Sedgwick.
    21.  “The Distribution of Flint in the Chalk of Yorkshire.” By
J. R.   Mortimer,  Esq.
    The author considers that the present shape of the Chalk Wolds of
Yorkshire seems to suggest that they are the remains of an atoll or
 circular reef, probably one of a chain, rather than the fragment of a
vast sheet of Cretaceous mud deposited in deep water.          He thinks
that the flint-bearing and non-flint-bearing chalk areas are in the
main contemporaneous in Yorkshire. The chalk without flint con
tains 4:28 per cent. of silica, whilst the chalk with flint contains only
 2.12 per cent.
    22.  “On    the Mode of Occurrence and Derivation of Beds of
Drifted Coal near Corwen, North Wales.” By D. Mackintosh, Esq.,
F.G.S.
    Resting on the lowest drift, which here, at an elevation of
500–600 feet above the level of the sea, consists of yellowish clay
alternating with beds of coarse gravel, is a deposit of clean sand and
fine gravel, containing streaks and layers of coal, which varies in
form from fine dust to large lumps. The fine gravel appears to be
entirely made up of local micaceous Silurian grit.
    The glacial striae run in a W.S.W. direction, and at first led the
author to infer that the coal had been drifted from that quarter.
This, however, would have involved the supposition that a portion of
the Coal-formation in situ had been faulted down on the top of the
remarkable outlier of Mountain Limestone which occurs about a
mile and a half west of Corwen.      The authoris therefore now of the
opinion that the coal was drifted from the Ruabon district during a
comparatively temperate interglacial period.       The land not being
submerged beyond a few hundred feet, it was floated along the sinu
osities of the valley of the Dee, and stranded in the shallow water of
the Corwen area. Hence the transportation of débris may at times
have taken place in a direction diametrically opposite to that of the
glaciation of a district.
    23. “The Cephalopoda-beds of Gloucester, Dorset, and Somerset.”
By J. Buckman, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author considers the Cephalopoda-beds of Bradford and
Dundry to be on the same horizon, and that neither the one nor the
other have the slightest connexion with the Cephalopoda-bed of
Gloucestershire.     The Dorsetshire Cephalopoda-bed is the equivalent
of the “Gryphite Grit” at Leckhampton; and the overlying roughly
bedded stone is the representative of the “Trigonia Grit” of Cold
Comfort.      The Gloucestershire Cephalopoda-bed lies at the base of
the Inferior Oolite, whilst the Dorsetshire bed is at the top of that
formation.

    Part of the sands at Bradford Abbas really represent the lower
oolitic mass of Leckhampton and Crickley; in fact the Dorset sands
represent the lower freestones of Gloucestershire.   The beds under
lying the Dorsetshire Cephalopoda-bed are the equivalents of the
 Inferior Oolite of Ham Hill.
   The author gives lists of the fossils from the freestone of Ham
Hill, and of the Cephalopoda from the Dorset equivalent of the
“Gryphite Grit.” The latter do not appear in zones; but dif
ferent species are prevalent at different localities, all on the same
horizon. The other fossils from this bed point to the same con
clusions, as the Ammonites are numerous and in good preservation.
     24. “Evidence       of the Subsidence of the Island of Guernsey.”
By R. A. Peacock, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
   All round the coast of this island, like that of Jersey, are found
tree-trunks and other vestiges of old forest-land now submerged. Pas
sages are quoted by the author from various old historians relative
to the former existence of this tract as dry land, the submergence of
which probably took place in the fifteenth century. The encroach
ment of the waters is due to the subsidence of the land, and not, as
has been suggested, to the breaking in of the sea through some
natural barrier upon some already low-lying district. Judging
from the old chart of 1406, the amount of depression is equal to
160 feet.

            ON   THE ROTATORY POLARIZATION OF QUARTZ.
                   By J. L. SORET AND ED. SARASIN.
INannounced
    a former    memoir on the rotatory polarization of quartz”, we
                the intention of extending our observations to the                     ul
tra-violet rays more refrangible than the line N, and of giving at the
same time to our measurements a higher degree of precision.         It
is the results of these fresh researches that we have now the honour
of communicating to the Academy.
   To determine the angle through which quartz rotates the plane
of polarization of rays of various wave-lengths we have, as before,
operated upon solar light by the method of MM. Fizeau and Fou
cault. The left-handed quartz crystal which we have chiefly made
use of has been retouched in        cutting its            so
                                                      render    as

Its thickness      29.885 millims. We have carefully determined

   To control the accuracy of the mode of observation which we owe
to MM. Fizeau and Foucault, we made a great number of experi
ments on the light of sodium by means of the very precise method
made known by M. Mascart in his excellent paper “On the Modi
fications undergone by Light in consequence of the Motion of the
Luminous Source” (Ann. Sc. de l’Ecole Normale, 1872, t. i. p. 202).
Employing this method, which consists in operating on monochro
matic light observed in a spectroscope with the slit very much
widened, M. Mascart found 21°73 for the rotation of the light of
sodium at 15 degrees temperature.      We arrived at the figure
21°727 at the temperature of 20 degrees, which corresponds to
21°711 at 15 degrees. This slight difference appears to us to
come within the limit of the errors which this method permits
when applied to light which is not strictly monochromatic.
   On the other hand, we have made a great number of measure
ments for the solar lines D, and D, by Fizeau and Foucault's
method.    For D, by varying the conditions of observation, we
obtained values between 21°750 and 21°714: the mean of those
in which we have most confidence is 21°736 at 20 degrees. For
D, we have found 21°684. These numbers, between which falls
the value obtained by M. Mascart's procedure, appear to us to
prove the correctness as well as the delicacy of the method of MM.
Fizeau and Foucault.
   In making a first series of experiments the spectroscope we used
was furnished with lenses of quartz and a prism of Iceland spar,
with the fluorescent ocular for the observation of the ultra-violet
rays”, and with the ordinary eyepiece for a certain number of
measurements taken in the luminous portion of the spectrum.      In
a second series of experiments we made use of ordinary lenses of
optical glass, employing two flint-glass prisms for the lines com
prised between A and G, and one prism only for the portion ex
tending from h to               M.
   * The spectroscope with fluorescent eyepiece, described by one of us,
has well answered its purpose for the very refrangible rays from N to R.
The solar light has to be reflected from a German-silver mirror (not a
silver one, because silver absorbs the highly refrangible rays, as Prof.
Stokes has already shown). To avoid the rotation which the collimator
lens of the spectroscope impresses on the polarized rays when it consists
of only one biconvex lens of quartz, a compensated lens is employed,
formed of two plano-convex quartz lenses, perfectly equal, one with right
handed, the other with left-handed rotation, applied the one against the
other by their plane faces. The Iceland-spar prism has          edges cut  its
             the axis;    therefore gives two spectra,             of

       ON  THE RATIO OF THE TWO SPECIFIC HEATS OF A GAS.
                                BY CH. SIMON.
    My   purpose,    in this communication,      is to determine,    by the
theory, the ratio                                       perfect gas, simple
                      c of the two specific heats of  a
and tetratomic.
    When a gas is regarded          as a system of material      points the
mutual actions of which are negligible, the ratio        9 is readily found
                                                          c
to   be equal to #; and M. Villarceau has proved that the result is
the same when a mutual action is supposed between two gaseous
molecules which is a function of their distance and directed along
the right line that joins their centres of gravity; but this result
has only been verified hitherto in the case of mercury vapour,
which is considered to be monatomic.            For any gas whatever, M.
Villarceaut has     given   the  expression

where the quantity in the brackets represents the variation, per
degree of increase of temperature, of the energy of the system of
the atoms in their motions about the centres of gravity of the mole
cules of which they are parts. This quantity consequently includes
the internal vibrations and the rotations of the molecules.           Igno
rant as we are of the laws which govern the intramolecular forces,
it would perhaps be impossible to reach by calculation the internal
vibrations; but it appears easier to take into consideration the rota
tions of the molecules about their centres of gravity; and it is to be
presumed that, if account be taken of the rotations, the internal

That is the idea which has led me to undertake this research.
  To calculate the vis viva due to the rotations of the molecules of
a gas, recourse must necessarily be had to certain hypotheses.
Without introducing any new ones, I adopt those which appear to
me the most plausible and are most generally accepted.              call                I
perfect gases those which follow the laws of Mariotte and Gay
Lussac, and in which the internal work is nil, so that their mole
cules have velocities of translation of which the squares are propor
tional to the absolute temperature.            I
                                         call simple and tetratomic the
gases whose molecules are composed of four smaller molecules
identical with each other—not necessarily atoms, but which may
 be regarded as atoms in the present state of science: such are (or
appear to be) hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, &c.                      I
                                                      imagine that, in
such a gas, the four atoms occupy the apices of a regular tetrahedron,
the edge of which is longer than the diameter of each of them, and
that the interior of the tetrahedron is filled with aether free or
condensed.    Now, taking account of the rotation of each elementary
tetrahedron about its centre of gravity, and regarding the vibra
tions of the atoms as none or insensible,               I
                                               have found the ratio of
the two specific heats to be exactly $ or 14, while experiment
has given, for the gases above-mentioned, values between 1:39
and 1:42.
    From this accordance between calculation and experiment it
 seems to follow that the internal vibrations, neglected in the cal
culation, are negligible in reality.           I
                                         am thus led to think that, in
 simple gases, the physical molecules remain sensibly invariable in
form and dimensions as long as no electrical or chemical action
is produced.—Comptes            Rendus de l'Académie               des Sciences,         tome

            A NEW PROCESS FOR THE SEPARATION OF GALLIUM.

of            by operating      as   follows:—
   1. The ore is dissolved, according to                its
                                                  nature,     aqua regia,    in
chlorhydric acid,        sulphuric acid. The liquid
                           or                              treated, cold,
                                                                        is

                 of                                               hydro           of
gen     still pretty considerable; the liquid
       is                                           then heated with
                                                              is                             a
large excess      of
                   zinc.   The gelatinous precipitate       washed, and is
taken       up
           again       by
                       chlorhydric acid. The new solution         heated          is
with      an
         excess      zinc, and
                      of         second gelatinous precipitate obtained.

              ...;
filtered, the sulphuretted hydrogen expelled; and finally carbonate
of soda is         fractionally until the line Ga a 417 ceases to be
visible with the chlorhydric solution of the precipitate.
    3. The oxides (or subsalts) are again taken up by sulphuric acid;
the solution is cautiously evaporated until no more white sulphuric
fumes (or scarcely any) are liberated.      It is allowed to cool, then
agitated with water, which dissolves the mass after a time varying
from a few hours to two days. The solution of the nearly neutral
sulphate is diluted with water and heated to ebullition, and the
subsalt of gallium separated by filtration hot.
    4. This basic salt is dissolved in a little sulphuric acid; and a
slight excess of caustic potass is added, so as not to separate the
gallium but to throw down the iron.       Filtration follows, and then
the passage of a prolonged current of carbonic acid gas, which
precipitates the oxide of gallium.
    5. This oxide is redissolved by the smallest possible quantity of
sulphuric acid; a small excess of slightly acid acetate of ammonia
is added, and then sulphuretted hydrogen is passed into the solution.
Under these conditions gallium is not precipitated.
    6. The acetic liquid is filtered, diluted with water, and brought
to ebullition; the largest portion of the gallium is precipitated.   It
is filtered while hot. The mother-liquor, concentrated and boiled
with aqua regia (in order to break up the salts of ammonia), is put
with the other gallium-residues.
    7. The precipitate formed by the hot acetic liquor is redissolved
by sulphuric acid; we add a slight excess of caustic potass, and
filter.
    8. The potassic solution is electrolyzed.   The metallic gallium is
readily detached from the plate of platinum by squeezing this be
tween the fingers under tepid water.
   9. The metal is kept for about half an hour, at a temperature of
60° or 70° C., in nitric acid (quite free from chlorine) diluted with
 itsvolume    ofwater; after washing,  it may     considered pure.

   The last experiment was varied by scraping one of the sur
faces backwards and forwards with a glass scraper, and obser
ving the current by a delicate mirror-galvanometer with a
very high resistance in the circuit during the scraping, and
at intervals of fifteen seconds after ceasing to scrape, until
the two surfaces had resumed an equality electrically. Whilst
the one surface was scraped, the other surface was at rest:

tion is of very short duration. The mirror-like brilliancy of a
mercurial surface is no criterion that the whole of the visible
molecules may not be suboxide; for the reflection would not
be lessened until the formation of this suboxide became suffi
 cient to impair the smoothness of the surface. And the cur
 rents measured between the disturbed and quiescent surfaces
 of mercury are probably currents set up between surfaces in
 different states of oxidation, the less oxidized of the two being
positive to the other.
    To put this more fully to the test of experiment, an appa
 ratus was made up very much on the principle of that used by
Mr. Varley for producing currents by mercury when polarized
with hydrogen. The object in view was, that one of the sur
faces of mercury might                       Fig. 2.

   The mean of the two series represented a difference of elec
tromotive force equivalent to 0-115 volt.       When a small
quantity of sulphuric acid was added to the water, similar re

     AW-tube, 0.8 centim. diam., was made
up as in fig. 3; mercury in the two lower
parts, acidulated water in the junction c, and
platinum wires in the outer limbs. On tilt
ing the tube, so that the surface in a advanced
and that in b receded, the mercury in a, by
reason of the slight friction, flowed, of course,
less readily in contact with the glass than
at the centre; and so fresh surface broke
through. On the other side (b) just the
reverse took place; whatever suboxide was
on the sides closed in and thickened.
   The needle of the galvanometer between the platinum wires
was deflected in one direction when the system was inclined
one way, and when it was inclined the other way, in the other
direction. The advancing surface brightened and was posi

causes the drop to contract; and in the other direction, that
the current oxidizing the surface increases the adhesion of the
water, which spreads out in consequence.      The second explana
tion is that suggested by Dr.                     J.
                                      W. Draper, in 1845, in a
paper" entitled “Is Capillary Attraction an Electrical Pheno
menon P” According to his view, the capillary constant at
the contact-surface of mercury and dilute sulphuric acid is
supposed to be altered by the current; and hence the contraction
or expansion, the surface of mercury behaving like an elastic
membrane.         It
                 appears to me that both adhesion and capilla
rity play very insignificant parts in the phenomena in question.
                                    I
The explanation which offer is that these contractions and
expansions are due simply to the different atomic volumes of
mercury and        its
                  suboxide.

before  connecting   the  battery, their distances from the peri

 drop contracts and when       expands. From this
                                        it                  obvious             it   is

 an increased adhesion, but simply      the expansion  to  the mer               of

   Viewed in this light, the water-drop may be said to perform
two distinct functions —(1) that of determining the area of
mercury the visible molecules of which are to be changed
from metal to suboxide, and vice versä ; (2) that of showing to
what extent the covered mercury surface is expanded or con
tracted in consequence.
   And if this view is correct, it follows that, by knowing the
relative atomic volumes of mercury and        suboxide, we could        its
predict approximately    what extent any given water-drop

   The mean with acidulated water is higher than that with
distilled water. This may be due to the greater conductivity
of the acid water causing   the reducing action to be more
complete and prompt, and partly to reduction of sulphate.

“capillary electrometer,” in which similar circulations set up
in the mercury produce, of course, a similar alteration of level,
but in explanation of which Mr. Lippmann reproduces Draper's
theory of capillarity. In another form of Mr. Lippmann's
“electrometer,” a column of mercury is supported vertically
in a tube, the bottom of which is drawn out to a capillary bore
and dips into dilute sulphuric acid.             When the capillary
niveau is    deoxidized,   the circulation which is set up in the
mercury tends to cause it to recede.            This recession is op
W.osed and finally balanced by the superincumbent column.

    To find the effect exerted upon the capillary constant of a
common mercurial surface by deoxidation and further oxida
tion, the following experiments were made:--
    A copper wire of 0.3 centim. diameter and 18 centims. long
was furnished with a disk 1.7 centim. diameter soldered upon
one end. The lower part of the wire and upper side of the
disk were varnished, and the under side of the disk kept care
fully amalgamated for some days in order to avoid any change
in the degree of amalgamation taking place during the expe
riments; at          its
                  other end, the wire was suspended and cen

   It appears from the above experiments that under water
and acidulated water the surface-tension of mercury is slightly
increased when deoxidized by an electric current, the deoxi
dation under acid water appearing to be more complete than
under distilled water.    When the mercurial surface was deoxi

to that produced by the battery with acid water; but the de
oxidation did not appear to be so complete.

                    in Mercury by Deoridation.                            499
  If  at any moment the electric circuit was interrupted, the
weight required to detach the disk immediately increased,
showing that the relaxation of surface-tension was due to the
process of oxidation, and not to the presence of oxide only.
   It is evident from the foregoing experiments:—(1) that the
deoxidation of an ordinary surface of mercury to a slight ex
tent increases its surface-tension ; but when the deoxida
tion is as complete as it can become in the liquid employed,
no further change appears to take place by increasing the
battery-power; and (2) that with the mercury in process of
oxidation we have to deal with a surface which is being trans
formed into a substance with little or no cohesion, at a rate
increasing with a stronger current.
   In this investigation I have confined myself to some of the
direct effects of deoxidation of mercurial surfaces. There are
other well-known phenomena of the motions of mercury in
which the reduction of other metals from solutions plays an
important part; but they are beyond the purpose of the pre
sent inquiry.
   To sum up the results, we are, I think, entitled to con
clude   :-
   (1) That the electricity disengaged between pure mercury
surfaces (when not hydrogenized) is due to different states of
oxidation.
   (2) That the motions observed to take place in mercury
electrodes under water (or dilute sulphuric acid) are due to the
displacement of the surface corresponding to the different
atomic volumes of the metal and                its
                                      suboxide (or suboxide and
sulphate).
   (3) That the pumping action          columnof a  mercury    of           in
tube    or
         narrow channel     due  is rapid circulation caused
                                          to                              bya
such displacement.
   (4) That these motions are not due      change     either con
                                                     to         of
stant    capillarity
        of               or
                       adhesion.   And,  finally,
   (5) That we may give          negative answer

four beats in a second. Then                   I
                                     brought quite close to my
ear a watch (made     by  Lange,  of Dresden) ticking five times
in the second. In this position I heard          the ticks       theall                        of

  High Sounds cannot obliterate Low Sounds.-A new and
remarkable fact was now discovered.       No sound, even when
very intense, can diminish      obliterate, the sensation

discovered on stopping the higher sound that the fork, which
should produce the lower sound, has ceased to ribrate.       This

surprising experiment must be made in order to be appre

ments, ranging through four octaves, have been made, with
consonant and dissonant intervals, and that scores of different
hearers have confirmed this discovery.     It is important to
understand that this phenomenon    depends  solely on difference
of pitch, and not at                      all

their compass), and, secondly, we have determined throughout
the musical scale the relative intensities of the sounds (of
simple tones) when obliteration of the sensations of higher
(simple) tones supervenes. The powerlessness of one sound
to affect the sensation due to another sound lower than itself
in pitch greatly simplifies this problem.
  4. Applications of the Interferences of Sonorous Sensations to
       Determinations of the Relative Intensities of Sounds.
    Quantitative analysis of the compound tones of musical
instruments is now the great desideratum of the composer.
 It is only after we know the relative intensities of the com
ponents of typical musical tones used in orchestral perform
 ances that we can so regulate their intensities as to give those
 qualities of sound which the composer desires to be heard.
 Thus it at once becomes evident that the instruments used in
 orchestral music should be very differently constructed from
 those used for solos or quartets.        In orchestral instruments
 certain characteristie upper partials (overtones, harmonics)
 should predominate in order to find expression in the midst
 of other and graver sounds. Such orchestral instruments will
 therefore have exaggerated peculiarities in their qualities of
 tone which will render them unfit to be played on alone and
 uninfluenced by other orchestral notes.       It is surely not hope
 less to  anticipate  that  empirical  rules may  be attained, which
 will guide the musical-instrument-maker to the production of
 those special qualities of tone required in orchestral instru
 ments.     It is fortunate that the very phenomena of the inter
 ferences of sonorous sensations will assist in the much-desired
 solution of the problem of measuring the intensity of a sound
 (simple tone), either when existing alone or as component of
 an ordinary musical (compound) tone. On this subject            I am
  now engaged.       It is evident (by way of illustration) that, so
 far as concerns the measure of the relative intensities of
 sounds of the sume pitch, this problem has already received
 the simplest solution by merely placing these sounds at
 various distances and obliterating the sensations they excite
 by means of a constant and standard sound of a lower pitch.
 But I reserve a description of this work for a more formal
 publication.

in the way of the extension of                             Fresnel's theory of reflection to
anisotropic media.
   In the universal aether as first medium let a wave-plane po
larized under any azimuth be supposed to fall upon a plane
face of a crystal with any orientation whatever; there will in
  eneral arise, besides the reflected wave, two refracted ones.
    order to determine them according to amplitude and azi
muth, we require, as with the transmission of light into an
isotropic medium, four different limit—equations.     But while
(on account of the divisibility of the fundamental theorem of
the vires viral) two principles there suffice for their derivation,
three are necessary here. We designate them briefly as the
principle of so-called continuity, the principle of equality of
work, and the principle of vires viva.

one is oscillating forwards with velocity r + æ and backwards
with velocity    r-r,   then the cord will be pushed forward both
by reason of the too rapid motion and by reason of the too
sluggish one; and the electromotive force urging it is
                        (v--w)r—(v–w)r=2.er.       .   .    .   .   (16)
If the cord were allowed to move, the work done per second
by this force would be 2.cru; and       j times this is therefore the
rate at which heat is absorbed at such a point by this force.
The heat so absorbed is evolved in other parts of the circuit,
because friction opposes the motion of the cord with a force
nur equal to 2.cr.      If we urge the cord at any rate u through
such a circuit    by  an external electromotive force E acting in
the same direction as the force of the a-button, the work done
per second is             Eu-(nur—2.cr)u,

Now (17) contains two terms, one depending on the square of
the current and being the irreversible frictional generation of
heat (15), and the other changing sign with the current and
representing the heat absorbed or generated at the r-button
according as u is positive or negative, remembering that the
current has been considered positive when going i<U+017F>e way the
button tends to drive it.
   Something analogous to the unsymmetrical action of this
a-button is what     I  imagine to go on at a junction either of two
different metals at the same temperature, or of two parts of the
same metal at different temperatures; and accordingly 2/4 ru
will correspond either to the Peltier effect or to Thomson's
convection effect; and 2.er is analogous to the coefficient which
which is called    II  in the one case and may be called 6 in the
other.
    § 29. Let us now proceed to consider what kind of unsym
metrical motions may reasonably be expected to actually occur
at a junction either of two different metals at the same tempe
rature, or of two portions of the same metal at different tem
peratures.     In both cases the molecules on the two sides of
                are vibrating at different rates:—in the      first  case

    Now it is very unlikely that the vibrations of the closely
packed molecules of a solid should be any thing so simple as
the simple harmonic motions partially assumed in §§ 22 and
 27: in other words, the restoring force cannot be due simply
 to bending of the connecting rods, but it must also be an
effect of the neighbouring buttons by impact or otherwise.
 Any button in the interior of a mass of metal will be driven
backwards and forwards with a velocity depending on the
average velocities of the buttons in        neighbourhood    well      its                                         as

536              Mr. O. J. Lodge                       on a Mechanical                 lllustration
than before, yet, since the impacts of one are more violent
than those of the other, they will still have some irregularity—
those of the hotter metal A going faster from A towards B
and slower in the reverse direction, while those of B go slowly
from B to A and faster back again from A to B. On the
whole, then, we have a double layer of buttons oscillating
quicker in one direction, viz. A B, than the other"; and such
buttons, if threaded on a cord, would have a tendency to drive
it in the direction AB, as we have already seen, § 28.
    § 30. At a junction of two metals, or of unequally hot
 pieces of one metal, we appear then to have found an electro
 motive force acting in one direction; but there is something
 further to be noticed yet.       We found in the former paper
 that in any complete model it was necessary to have not one
cord but two, arranged side by side and connected so that
however one moves the other must move with the same velo
 city in the opposite direction—one representing a current of
 positive, the other the simultaneous equal opposite current of
negative electricity. Now the electromotive force whose exist
ence we have been recently imagining, is one that will act on
both these cords; and if it acted on both equally they would be
both urged equally in the same direction, and consequently
could not move at all.      It is necessary, therefore, to assume
that the bite of the buttons on one of these cords is greater
than their bite on the other; but whether it is the positive or
the negative cord on which the greatest force is exerted in a
given case will depend on the nature of the metal, and possibly
also on          its
             temperature—though we have             evidence     re                          no                          as
gards the latter point, and       shall not assume     I                                           it.
    What we have now assumed amounts                 this, that the                           to
quantity      called the specific resistance

tromotive force being balanced by the slight state of strain

which show the greatest effect are those which stand furthest
apart in the voltaic series.
   But the contact electricity spoken of above as generated at
the junction of two metals has nothing to do with chemical
action.    It is an incipient thermo-electric current takin
place across the junction, which only shows itself as a slight
displacement of the cord, unless the metallic circuit is com

this point. The dip of all the above beds is the same, viz. 2° to 3° a
little north of N.E. (the direction of the line); and there is no

  2. “Note on the Red Crag.” By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A.,
F.G.S.
   The object of this paper is to show that what had been taken to
be an irregular line of erosion between a certain unfossiliferous sand
and the shelly Red Crag (in Suffolk) was really a line of dissolution
of shells, the sand being simply Red Crag deprived of its fossils
through percolation of water.    This is shown to be the case from
the facts that in some places lines of bedding and false-bedding ex
tend from the Crag into the sand, and that impressions of Crag shells
are found in ironstone in the sand.
   3. “On the Kessingland Cliff section, and the relation of the
Forest-bed to the Chillesford Clay, with some remarks on the so
called terrestrial surface at the base of the Norwich Crag.” By F.
W. Harmer, Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper was a reply to one read before the Society during last
session by Mr.          J.
                     Gunn, F.G.S., who affirmed that the Forest-beds
in the section were overlain by the Norwich Crag and Chillesford
Clay.     The author, on the contrary, gave, in the first part of the
paper, detailed drawings of the cliff, in which he represented the
fossiliferous deposits known as the Kessingland Beds as resting in a
gorge cut out          of,
                    and consequently newer than, the Chillesford Clay.
The beds present           the section, according
                              in                        his view, are (in

                                underlain                by
                                             sand and gravel, which, with
            the clay, contains mammalian remains and freshwater shells.

                              of
at the base       the Norwich Crag, which contains marine shells and
                  of
mammalian      remains,   was not                  an
                                        old land surface,      asserted         as        by
Mr. Gunn and       others,  but merely  the basement-bed        the deposit     of
which overlies          it,
                      the mammalian fossils     contains,  which are prin

       1. The unfossiliferous sands of the Red Crag.
       2. The unconformity between the Lower and Middle Glacial
          deposits.
       3. The mode in which the Upper and Middle Glacial were
            accumulated.           .
     The views of the authors under the first     head were similar to and
confirmatory of those advanced in the previous paper by Mr. Whit
 aker; but they pointed out that the Red Crag, which these sands,
in an altered form, represent, could not belong to the Chillesford
division of that formation, by reason of the casts of shells which
had been preserved not comprising any of the more characteristic
Chillesford species, and of their including among them forms con
fined to the older portions of the Red Crag.        They also pointed out
that the Chillesford   Clay had been removed over         the area occupied     all
by these sands          by
                     denudation     prior    the  deposition
                                                           to    the Middle                of
Glacial, which rests upon these sands wherever they occur. The
removal       the Chillesford Clay, the authors consider, was due
              of                                                                                           in
part,   not
       if    entirely,     the great denudation between the Lower and
                               to
Middle  Glacial,  which   gave rise     the unconformity discussed under
                                                      to
the second head.
   This unconformity they illustrate          lines         by
                                                        section traversing  of
 most  of  the river-valleys            of
                                  Central and East Norfolk and Suffolk.
 These show that such valleys were excavated after the deposit                                             of
 the Contorted Drift, and out         that formation and the beds under
                                                 of
 lying  it.  They also show that the Middle and Upper Glacial have
 been bedded into these valleys,          well    spread (the middle only
                                                      as         as
 partially, but the upper more uniformly) over the high grounds

the many perplexing features which are connected with the position
and distribution of the Middle Glacial formation; and while they
admit that as to one or two of these the theory which they offer
affords no explanation, they suggest that the theory of this forma
tion's origin which best meets the case is as follows, viz.:-As the
country became resubmerged, and as the valley-glaciers retreated
before the advancing sea, the land-ice of the mountain districts of
North Britain accumulated and descended into the low grounds, so
 that by the time East Anglia had become resubmerged to the extent
 of between 300 and 400 feet, one branch of this ice had reached
 the borders of the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Herts, and
 Bedford, ploughing out and destroying any Lower Glacial beds that
 had been deposited over the intervening counties upon which it rested,
 and over which we ought otherwise, having regard to the depth of
 the earlier submergence under which they were accumulated, to
 find them, but do not. The Middle Glacial formation, consisting of
 sand and gravel, they attribute principally to the action of currents
 washing out and distributing the morainic material, which was
  extruded on the sea-bottom by this land-ice—that ice itself, by
  keeping out the sea over            the country  all  which               on
                                                                  rested (which           it

 ON SOME       REMARKABLE PHENOMENA IN GEISSLER TUBES.                                                  BY
             PROF. E. REITLINGER AND A. V.ON URBANITZKY.
   Having, at the commencement of July last, made preparation
for continuing our experiments with the aid of a Geissler mercury
air-pump, we filled so-called Wüllner tubes with different gases,
and first investigated afresh the conversion of attraction into re
pulsion by a higher degree of rarefaction.      The experiments were
made with air, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid.
They established that, with                             all
                                     these gases, between       and                           4          12
millims. pressure the electrical luminous column         attracted, but                is
at about 2–1 millim.          repelled. itBetween the two phenomena
                                             is
there   is    an
             intermediate stage,      which neither attraction nor re
                                                         in
pulsion   isperceptible.   For the first occurrence, however,       per                            of
ceptible repulsion      was the less possible
                                it              find with the different      to
gases one and the same degree          rarefaction,       the repulsion and
                                                         of                       as

by  the insertion             of
                          resistance.
                                    a   Now since the gases           the tube                in
themselves offer different degrees             resistance, we had  of      take                    to
into account             at
                     the same time the       intensity        the   current,        of                   in

         to                                   The latter has been found
to exert the greatest influence; yet up          the present time we have
                                                                        to

were made with        somewhat wider tube without any capillary part,

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  551
tubes and the so-called electrical        egg.    Already, when using also
the double-barrelled valve      air-pump,   we  had   experimented with an
electrical egg and atmospheric air and seen a distinct recession of
the visible luminous swell in the centre of the egg as the hand was
brought nearer from a distance. With five or more centims. dis
tance between the hand and the glass wall of the egg the retreat
was very evident; but on the glass being touched, it was changed
into an attraction, at least in appearance. When we experimented
with the Geissler air-pump and the wide tube above-mentioned,
there appeared first, when the induction-current passed through in
the usual manner, altogether similar phenomena as in Wüllner's
tubes; in particular here also with greater rarefaction the attrac
tion changed into repulsion. But the most striking repulsions
were obtained when only one pole of the Ruhmkorff apparatus was
connected with one of the wire electrodes of the tube, and the
other was led away to earth. In this case a luminous appearance
was perceptible, which, of course, shone brighter only with a
higher degree of rarefaction; but it then exhibited the repulsion
 phenomenon especially distinct, and with a distance of several
 centims. between the hand and the glass tube. Its appearance
 was essentially different, according as the positive or the negative
 pole of the induced open current was connected with the wire;
 and the strength of the repulsion was also in the latter case much
 more considerable than in the former.             This repulsion increased
 as the rarefaction was       pushed   further,   and was most intense at
 the highest degree of rarefaction attained, about 0.2 millim. The
 singularly favourable result of this experiment induced us to put
 the wire electrode of the tube into conducting connexion with the
 conductor of a two-disk Winter electrical machine; and in this
  case also, with very strong rarefaction, the positive luminous tuft
  was seen to recede.      Experiments for the purpose of testing the
  principal inferences suggested by the phenomena with the unclosed
  current are already in preparation.       This may also be the place to
  mention that in none of the cases      investigated   by us did an ebonite
    late when    brought near  attract or  repel.
      The striking similarity which is shown between the luminous
  phenomenon in the unclosed current with great rarefaction and
  the figures of comets, and the great distance at which in this case
  the repulsion of the approaching conductor yet acts, reminded us
  afresh of the question (touched upon in our first communication)
  whether, in the repulsion under consideration, we have not to do
   with that very force which makes the tails of comets recede from
   the sun.    That the degrees of rarefaction at which the best results
                                                                             of an
   are here obtained   lie near 0:2 millim.    isonly favourable   to  such
   assumption.      Further, in those Geissler tubes     in  the collection
   the Second Physical Lehrkanzel         in   which the recession      of  the
   electrified luminous  gas-columns   before the    approaching    conductor
   was first observed, the light which appeared, when examined with
   the spectroscope, showed distinctly upon         aless-bright background
 those three spectral bands which the spectroscope exhibited also
  inthe flame    illuminating-gas, and which are usually designated
                of

552             Intelligenee and Miscellaneous Articles.
as a carbon-spectrum, but which, according to Vogel, have likewise
formed the spectrum of comets.              Moreover, if it be remembered
that the  repulsion   in  question,   in  itself, requires from the repelling
body only the conducting quality, and not any free positive or
negative electricity, the expectation will not be considered un
warranted that these experiments will be of importance for the
electrical theory of the tails of comets and their repulsion—a
theory to which several distinguished astronomers have already
turned their attention.
   In several tubes even at a pressure of 20 millims. (at which the
observations commenced) distinct strata appeared; and while the
rarefaction was then continued the connexion between the number
of the strata and the rarefaction could be proved.                It came out
that, so long as the chemical quality of the luminous gas-columns
and all the other circumstances except the density could be taken
                                                                                                      of the
as unchanged, the number of the strata diminishes in the ratio of
rarefaction, or,   in other terms, that the interval from the centre
one bright stratum        that
                          to         of
                                    the next increases proportionately        the                to
rarefaction.     This law   may       expected
                                      be             hold  goodtoeither  strictly

our observation extended. The intensity                  the current, too, has
                                                                    of
