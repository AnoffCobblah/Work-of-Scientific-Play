     F coal gas be made to pass slowly and for a length of time
      over pure iodine, the latter substance moistens, and is
partly changed into a dark-brown liquid, which effervesces
with alkaline carbonates, showing the presence of hydriodic
acid. After some hours, colourless prismatic crystals shoot
out from the iodine, and clothe the interior of the vessel, and
 ultimately the whole is changed into a mixture of different
 compounds forming an olive-coloured substance,               partly
coating thickly the sides of the vessel, and partly constitu
 ting an unctuous mass, with the dark fluid at the bottom.
    The liquid contains free iodine and hydriodic acid. When
washed out from the solid portion by alcohol and neutralized
by caustic potash, the solution gives a yellow precipitate, con
sisting of a mixture of Faraday's iodide of carbo-hydrogen
(H, C, I)+ and of iodide of formyle (iodoform H C, Is).

2       Prof. Johnston on the Iodide of a new Carbo-hydrogen.
light carburetted, and  olefiant gases, are present. The
latter would furnish the three compounds obtained in this
experiment, as shown by the following formula:
              2   (C, H,) + 5                 I=HI                +     C, H,          I    +    C,     H. Is
that is to say, one atom of olefiant gas decomposes to form
hydriodic acid and formyle, while another unites with iodine.”
directly.    Still this does not represent the action quanti
tively, since the proportion of the C, H, I is much greater in
actual experiment, and appears also to be variable.
   Such is the action in close vessels provided only with a
small aperture to allow the current of gas to pass out very
slowly; but since these three compounds are            volatile,                                 all                      it

case     in the previous analysis”.         The experimental result
however      may    be reconciled to the formula (CoHoo +              HI)
 which gives 6'340 of hydrogen per cent, a quantity so near
 to that found as to leave nothing for the ordinary error of
 analysis.      The action of chlorine hereafter described, if the
 results are to be depended upon, gives a probability to this
 formula, in addition to that which is derived from the rational
 formula, adopted by Liebig to represent the constitution of
what by other chemists are still regarded as chlorides and
 iodides of olefiant gas (elayle) and some other carbo-hydro
g ens.
     It has been already stated, that when boiled in carbonated
 alkalies the colour of this compound remains unchanged,
 and that it undergoes decomposition.                The decomposition
 however is      only  partial.   4:51 grs.  boiled in a concentrated
 solution of carbonate of soda, and afterwards washed and
 dried at a gentle heat, still weighed 3:51 grs. having lost 22:17
 per cent. The whole of the iodine therefore is not separated
 by this process; it may however be completely separated by
 mixture with pure carbonate of soda, and gradually heating
 over the lamp to a temperature below redness.
     In this way I obtained by means of nitrate of silver an ap
 proximation to the quantity of iodine, which however was too
 rude to be worthy of insertion in the present paper.              I  was, at
 the time of       making    the  experiment,    unacquainted      with the
 more perfect method of estimating the quantity of iodine since
 published by Lassaigne.
     II. Diffused through water and subjected to the action of
  chlorine, the green colour of this compound is slowly changed
 to brown, but the action is much more rapid and complete
 when the iodide is reduced to fine powder, diffused through
 alcohol, and submitted to a current of chlorine. Thus treated
  it speedily acquires a bright yellow colour, combining with
  chlorine and yielding the iodine to the supernatant liquid, in
  which it is readily recognised.
     I subjected to analysis a portion of the substance thus pre
  pared, after washing with alcohol and drying at 212° Fahr.
  When heated in a close tube it gave off no iodine.
     a. 8:45 grs. gave C = 1881 grs. and                 H =     4.545 grs.
    * 2:795 grs. heated to 212° for some time, lost 0.295 gr., and at a subse
  quent weighing the loss announted to 0-485 gr. Still it seems possible to
  preserve it for a long time at ordinary temperatures and in close vessels
  without sensible decomposition.    One of the specimens employed in the
  above analysis was prepared by Mr. Kemp, and had been in my possession
  several years,

         Prof. Johnston on the Iodide of a new Carbo-hydrogen.                7
   attention has recently been recalled to the subject by a paper
   on Hellenine, by M. Gerhardt (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys.
   vol. lxxii. p. 163), in which he gives for this substance the for
   mula Cls Hio O, or Cso H2O O. containing apparently a ra
   dical isomeric with the carbo-hydrogen Cao Ho, which exists
   in the iodide above described. By the action of chlorine, hel
  lenine becomes (C15H10O. H. Cls Hio Cla) according to Ber
   zelius, or (Cls Ho Cl O. 4 H Cl) according to Dumas, in
  which we see a considerable analogy with the formulae for
  the oxichloride above described. By the action of anhydrous
  phosphoric acid on hellenine, a yellow liquid carbo-hydrogen
  is produced, to which M. Gerhardt gives the name of hel
  lenene, and which is represented by the formula Cls Hs,                    --
  the hypothetic radical which enters into the constitution of
  our oxichloride as it is represented in the formula (4).
      These interesting approximations indicate a series of com
 parative experiments, to which the iodide described in the
 present paper might be subjected, with the hope of throwing
 new light on the nature of the ever-varying isomeric modifi
 cations, of which the compounds of carbon and hydrogen are
 susceptible.     I hope to be able soon to return to the subject
 with a view to this investigation.
      In regard to the presence of a carbo-hydrogen represented
 by the formula Cso Hoo in coal gas, it need not excite our
 surprise if many other such compounds should hereafter be
 met with among the volatile and gaseous products obtained
 from the distillation of coal. When we consider how many less
volatile substances of this class have been extracted by Pelle
tier and Walter* from the products of the distillation of resin
for the manufacture of gas, and how many more volatile ones
have been separated by Couerbet from the gas thus produced
when subjected to pressure, we shall be prepared to expect
in coal gas also, the vapours of many other volatile substances
in addition to those which have hitherto been detected.
     I   have not as yet proposed any name for the supposed
radical Cºo H20.       It    ºff, to the same group as mesitylene
(Enyl of Berzelius) = C, H, and retinyle Cls Hig, in both
of which the elements are in the ratio of 3 to 2. It would
be exceedingly desirable to adopt the system of nomenclature
proposed by Berzelius           for
                              these compounds,            in

principle of Berzelius, which abstractedly is very valuable as
a guide for general nomenclature, would receive in the works
of different chemists at least two, and sometimes three differ
ent names of foreign origin. Trivial names therefore derived
as heretofore from different and various sources, will be likely
in the present state of the science to create much less con
fusion in our rapidly extending, already exceedingly difficult
and almost Protean nomenclature.

    appears from
           that the
                        late number of Professor Jameson's
                          a
                       crystallographic characters of this new
mineral, as examined by Mr. Brooke, remain ambiguous, and
that the crystals sent to him for examination do not enable
him positively to say whether it belongs to the rhombohedral
or to the prismatic system; it may therefore be interesting to
state that I have discovered that it possesses only one axis of
double refraction in the direction of the axis of the pyramid or
prism in which it usually crystallizes, and consequently there
can be no doubt that greenockite is a rhombohedral cadmium
blende.

  This calculus   was externally of a dirty white colour, and
had the    greasy   feel of cholesterine calculi; it floated on
water, and when applied to the tongue, left an impression of
bitterness. It was of an oval figure slightly flattened, one
inch and a half in length, rather better than an inch in thick
ness, and about one inch and a quarter in breadth, but being
broken in this direction its exact measurement could not be
ascertained.   It readily yielded to the knife, and the cut sur

               these cases the acids retained lime
fatty matter separated by the action of acids was partially so
luble in boiling alcohol, and the solution on cooling deposited
shining crystalline scales.   With caustic potass it formed a
ropy almost gelatinous solution, and was precipitated in white
 flakes on the addition of an acid.    A small piece being placed
 upon the ball of a thermometer previously heated, began to
 solidify when the temperature had sunk to about 135°Fahr.
     From these experiments                I
                                   concluded that this calculus
 consisted of margarate, or stearate of lime, mixed probably
 with the oleate of the same base and some of the other con
 stituents of the bile. That the lime was in combination with
 the fatty acid, was indicated by the insolubility of the calculus
 either in alcohol or caustic alkaline solutions, until it had
 been previously digested in some acid.
    The minute quantities on which I had hitherto operated
prevented me from determining whether only one or more of
 the fatty acids were present.       The following analysis was
 therefore made.
    Analysis.-12-80 grs. of the calculus previously dried in
 vacuo over sulphuric acid were boiled in distilled water: a
peculiar odour was given off, and the water acquired a yel
 lowish-brown colour: being evaporated to dryness it left a
 transparent resinous-looking     residue, which weighed 0-84.
 This residue when     digested in alcohol left 0.24 in the form
of dirty yellow flakes, which in distilled water swelled up and
ultimately dissolved, forming a solution which in
                                                                        of its
                                                         chemical
characters   exactly  resembled that      the mucus  of   the gall
 bladder.
    The alcoholic solution being evaporated       dryness, the re
                                                               to
sidue was redissolved        water; the solution was intensely
                                in
bitter; with muriatic acid       gave it  copious viscid precipi
                                                     a
tate: acetate      of
                   lead  produced  likewise    viscid precipitate,

and the supernatant liquor when clear was again troubled                                  by
a  solution of subacetate of lead.
    The 0.84 consisted therefore               of   mucus     of   the gall bladder
0-24; inspissated bile 0-60.
  After water had extracted from the calculus all that                           it   was
capable     of             was treated with successive portions

trated, it deposited some white fatty matter and acquired a
yellow tinge; a residuum was ultimately left, which had the
appearance of a mixture of a fluid and concrete oleaginous

0°47.
   It strongly reddened litmus paper; dissolved readily in a

 ITtheis Royal
         more than twelve years since Dr. Foville laid before
               Academy of Sciences of Paris some highly in
  teresting discoveries respecting the anatomical structure of
  the brain.     They were the results of laborious researches in
  what at that period he had already been long engaged. At the
 time they attracted the careful attention of #. anatomical
 members of the Institute, and more especially of the late
  Baron Cuvier, and of Professor Blainville, and an able and
                       º-
 highly favourable report on the subject was presented to the
 Academy by the latter savant.           Translations of this Report
 and of Dr. Foville's Memoir were published soon after in the
 Annals of Philosophyt.          From that time to the present the
 Doctor has been pursuing his investigations, and has made
 new discoveries as well as confirmed his old ones, and has
 been engaged in preparing a detailed and extended work on
 the anatomy,                    and pathology of the brain and
 spinal cord.       He laid a condensed view of the anatomical
 facts before the Medical Section of the British Association at
 its  meeting     inBirmingham, and has presented further me                a
            the Academy                        Paris. The Doctor has

 nerves, inert conductors. It still remains to determine which
 of these substances is pre-existent to the other; in what                  or
 der the development of the different parts which they com
 pose takes place, and what are the most essential differences
 in the nervous systems in different animals. It is sufficient
 to mention the name of Tiedemann to remind you of the light
 which has been thrown on these interesting and important
 questions.
      I
      will not undertake to enumerate the many points which
 are yet  to be elucidated. I will merely, before exposing my
 own views on the structure of the encephalon, allude to those
 of the most eminent anatomists who have attempted to deter
 mine the disposition of the two substances composing the
 encephalic masses.
    Willis, Malpighi, Reil, Gall, and Spurzheim are of opinion
 that the white fibres of the crura cerebri, after emerging from
 the medulla oblongata, penetrate into the hemispheres,                     di
verging in various directions till they meet the gray matter of
the convolutions in which they terminate.        They believe that
the   corpus   callosum   reaching  from one   hemisphere   to the
other is formed by the union on the median line of a new
order of fibres, originating in that same gray matter of the
convolutions, as that in which the fibres proceeding from the
crura cerebri terminate. Gall clearly and distinctly ex
presses this opinion, when he says that the brain is formed
of two different orders of fibres, the one of diverging, the
other of converging fibres.
   Tiedemann does not admit these two orders of fibres.                     Ac
cording to his views, the fibres meeting in the corpus callosum
are a continuation of those which proceed from the crura ce
rebri after they have gone through the entire circumference
of the hemispheres.
   Which of these different views is consistent with the truth 2
Is there no other difficulty than the choice between them :
   It is pretty generally admitted that the encephalic masses
are, according to the poetic language of Reil, “an efflores
cence of the spinal marrow,” the cerebrum being developed
:
at the summit of its anterior, the cerebellum, at the summit
of    its
        posterior columns.     The decussation between the two
anterior   pyramids   belonging             to
                                     the anterior columns     held    is
to account for the effects             of

small very fine parallel white layers pass from the one                                           to

roots of the spinal nerves proceed directly from the axis itself.
This distribution is more evident with respect to- the posterior
than to the anterior roots.
   Without attempting to describe the lateral columns of the
spinal marrow, I must not omit to mention a remarkable dif
ference between the lateral parts of these columns and the
anterior and posterior portions.                         If
                                        a portion of the spinal
marrow be cut out transversely, freed from          membranes,                   its
and left       to
             macerate     plain water for
                                   in      few hours, the lateral a
parts     of
          each half will assume,     consequence    the swelling
                                                    in                           of
of of
    their fibrous fasciculi,                  an
                                appearance something like that
     alarge nerve, whilst the anterior and posterior parts ad
joining these lateral columns are uniformly swelled without
presenting any such appearance.        Let      now see how the        us
axes     of
        the superficial  columns     the spinal marrow are con
                                                    of
nected with the parts developed          their upper extremity,
                                                          at
that    issay,
             to  the medulla oblongata.

  The anterior  part      the axis, ofother words, the anterior
part     of
        the commissure, appears                      to in   go
                                         almost entirely into the
decussation           of
                the anterior    pyramids,   and into the pyra
mids themselves.        very fine commissure between the pyra
                               A
mids seems to be      continuation of the anterior commissure
                             a
which exists throughout the whole length                                of   the spinal      mar
roW.
   The posterior commissure ascending along the medulla
oblongata comes very near        the surface, and when examined
                                              to
between the two lateral     portions     the medulla,    of
                                                          seems                        it        to
constitute    very delicate bond
                  a                                 of
                                     union between the two sides
of the calamus scriptorius. This union seems           established           to   be
by means       two slight fibrous columns, which are prolonga
                   of
tions     of
          the posterior commissure                       of
                                          the spinal marrow.
     If
      these statements are    correct, we see that when the pro
longations of the commissures or naked surfaces of the axis
of the spinal marrow are examined          the medulla oblongata,
                                                             in

and posterior surfaces                    of
                               the medulla oblongata.       But
slight are the remains                   of
                            the commissures when examined                                        in so
the medulla oblongata, that         very easy  itoverlook them.

When the two halves                 of
                          the medulla oblongata are separated,

                                    is         introducing and         by

pyramid before to some small columns which proceed from
the posterior commissure behind. These two opposed layers

medulla oblongata to the double band having the same dis
position in the medulla spinalis.

tinuous with the posterior commissure of the spinal marrow,
are connected those white fibres seen on the surface of the
calamus scriptorius, which are said to go to the auditory nerve.
     I must not forget to say, that from these same posterior
ascending bundles proceed radiating fibres, going to the su
perficial columns of the medulla oblongata, in like manner as
there are found radiating fibres proceeding from the axis of

 one then communicates with the posterior part of the crus
 cerebri and the nerves of sensation; the other with the      in
 ferior part of the crus cerebri and the anterior pyramids, which
 decussate like the effects of cerebral lesions bearing upon the
 powers of motion.      The first order of fibres are applied to
 the circumference of the convolutions very near the median
 line, and the circle which they form is on a vertical plane, di
 rected antero-posteriorly;    the second, radiating from within
 outwards towards the middle of the convex surface of the
 hemispheres, spread themselves out from thence towards the
 termination of the convolutions round the corpus callosum,
 and become connected here with the external margin of the
 circular band, which extends to the same point of the convo
 lutions.
    This remark on the relation of the convolutions to the two
 orders of fibrous parts, of which the one proceeds from the
 anterior pyramids and the anterior parts of the spinal mar
 row, whilst the other is intimately connected with the sensorial
 nerve of the brain, and the posterior parts of the spinal mar
 row, points out the manner in which the cerebral convolu
 tions should be studied.
     Ifour description is confined to their forms, nothing of im
 portance will be revealed.     But if on the contrary we endea
 vour   accurately to determine their relation to the other parts
 of the system by means of the fibrous parts entering into
their composition, the mind will be prepared to apprehend
 the different offices they are intended to fulfil. This is what
I  have endeavoured to accomplish in the first place in the
human brain, and secondarily in that of a considerable num
 ber of mammiferous animals. I shall subjoin here an abs
 tract of my researches on this subject.
    Considered in reference to the different connexions of their
fibrous parts, the convolutions may be distinguished into two
principal classes: first, those clothing the prolongations in
the brain of the fibrous bands connected with the olfactory
lobes, optic nerves, and posterior parts of the medulla spinalis;
and second, those enveloping the cerebral terminations of the
pyramidal fasciculus of the crus.
    The convolutions connected with the prolongations in the
brain of the fibrous parts which proceed from the basilary
quadrangle, or the common meeting-point of the sensorial
nerves and the posterior parts of the medulla, constitute all
the plain internal part of the hemisphere, the surface of the
basilary cerebello-temporal zone, and the lobule of the insula.
Those developed on the terminations of the pyramidal fas
ciculus of the crus, constitute all  the external portionof  the

                     is                                               the                       in         in

and at the basilary surface; and lastly, from those which in
the fissure of Sylvius itself constitute the lobule of the insula.
Of the convolutions of the regions which I have just pointed
out, those of the internal aspect of the cerebello-temporal
zone are included between the line of convolutions which
tracks the large circumference of the hemisphere, and that
part of the convolution  of the border which extends from
                       i.
the anterior to the posterior margin of the perforated qua
drangle, following      curve from before to behind of the
corpus callosum, and the fissure of Bichat.      Lastly, the
convolutions of the insula are included between the line of
convolution forming the inclosure of the fissure of Sylvius,
and that part of the convolution of the border, very short in
man, on which is prolonged the external root of the olfactory
nerve.
      If we dissectthe convolutions of the plain internal surface
 of the  hemisphere,   those of the cerebello-temporal zone, and
 lastly, those of the insula, we can easily show that their       fi
 brous parts converge from the great circumference of the
 hemisphere, and of the convolutionary inclosure of the fissure
 of Sylvius towards the corresponding regions of the convolu
 tion of the border, and terminate at last in the fibrous band
 of the border itself, whose connexions with the perforated
 quadrangle, the sensorial nerves of the brain, and the posterior
 parts of the spinal marrow we are already acquainted with.
 On the contrary, dissection of the convolutions on the ex
 ternal convex surface of the hemisphere included between the
 two grand lines of convolution which bound this aspect, one
 of these lines traversing the great circumference of the brain,
 the other following and forming the boundary of the fissure
 of Sylvius, shows that the fibrous twig of these convolutions
 terminates in the plane of the hemisphere which emanates
from the pyramidal portion of the crus cerebri.
    As to the two lines of convolution situated on the limit of
those convolutions which are united with the dependences of
the border and of those which envelope the terminations of
the plane of the hemisphere, they both pertain by one of their
margins, to the productions of the border, and by the other
to the productions of the plane of the hemisphere. They
form then a means of union between the two orders of con
volutions, of which the one is connected to the sensorial nerves
and the posterior parts of the spinal marrow, and the other
to the anterior pyramids and the anterior parts of the spinal
marrow.
    Thus    all
             the convolutions developed       in
                                               the interval  of

and the internal and external margins of the orbital region,
are in exclusive relation with the prolongations of the pyra
midal fasciculus of the crus.
   All the convolutions developed between the border, pro
perly speaking, and the great circumference of the hemi
sphere, pertain to the fibrous emanations from the perforated
quadrangle.
    All the convolutions of the insula situated between the
short region of the border which is traversed by the external
root of the olfactory nerve, and the convolutionary inclosure
of the fissure of Sylvius, belong peculiarly to the fibrous parts
emanating from that region of the border to which belongs
the external root of the olfactory nerve. Lastly, the great
circumference in which are found the external surface of the
convolutions belonging in particular to the terminations of
the pyramidal fasciculus of the crus, and the internal surface
of those which belong exclusively to the fibrous emanations
from the perforated quadrangle, is destined by                double reits

from it in the greater part of their course, but always coming

   Setting off from the crus, the first of these parts is the white

posite sides           of
                   the brain.
  It  appears            to
                    me that       man the anterior commissure only
                                        in
unites those   parts       theofopposite   sides which are connected
with the nerves of sensation. The well-known fact that in
many mammifera this commissure only stands                     each side               on
to  the  olfactory    nerves instead        reaching   of

sphere       the other, adds force
             to                           the opinion to   express, that    I

             Dr. Foville  on the Anatomy of the Brain.          27
the anterior commissure only unites parts devoted to sensa
tlon.
   I  shall not insist further on this anatomical proposition,
but if you will allow me briefly to add a few physiological
deductions,   I would say that the fibrous parts intermediate
between the internal surface of the convolutions and the an
terior pyramids, appear to me to be simple conductors, as
well as those which unite the organs of sensation with the
                      #.
circumference of the gray substance of the convolutions; these
transmitting to the
which determines their
                               the influence of the gray substance
                           contraction,  whilst those convey from
the  organs  of sense to the same     gray  substance impressions
made on the surface of these organs.
   The grey substance of the convolutions appears to me to
be the material substratum, by the intervention of which the
will directs the movements of the body. For the last twenty
years lesions of this substance have been pointed to as those
most frequently occurring in the insane, by those physicians
who expect to find in the brains of such patients alterations
corresponding to the characteristic symptoms of their dis
orders.
   Atrophy of the convolutions, so frequently seen in de
mentia, appears to me to result from disuse of the functions
of the gray substance; then the fibrous matter proceeding
from this gray substance becomes atrophied also, just as the
optic nerves fall into a state of atrophy in the blind.
   Pathological anatomy furnishes numerous examples of le
sions of the fibrous matter intermediate between the cortical
substance of the convolutions and the anterior pyramids.
Paralysis of the active organs of motion on the opposite side
is generally the consequence.
   The information afforded by pathological anatomy, relative
to the effects of lesions affecting the fibrous parts intermediate
between the gray substance of the convolutions and the or
gans of sense, is not so clear. This is owing, I imagine, to
the communication in the median line between these fibrous
parts of opposite sides, and the great number of these parts
rendering the complete obstruction of the impressions they
are meant to convey, difficult.                    -
   Before summing up these conclusions, relative to the struc
                                               I
ture and office of some parts of the brain, should like to say
a few words on the relations which the study of the cranium
establishes between different regions of this bony case and the
corresponding regions of the organ which it incloses.
   If  the two frontal eminences are divided horizontally by
sawing on a plane perpendicular to their centre, and this sec

tion is carried to some depth in the brain, the lateral ventri
cles are opened by their anterior extremities, each of these
extremities terminating in a cul-de-sac, answering to a frontal
eminence.     In the interval between these two cul-de-sacs of
the anterior extremities of the ventricles we reach the anterior
curve of the corpus callosum.      If we saw in the same way
the two  superior  occipital protuberances,  we arrive at the pos
terior extremity of the two lateral ventricles, each of these
extremities ending in a hollow cone, answering to one of the
superior occipital depressions and eminences. Lastly, if the
saw is made to divide the two parietal eminences at their sum
mits, and that portion of the long vault intermediate between
them, it leads to that part of the lateral ventricles which is
the most spacious and projects the most outwards.          It is in
this part of the ventricles that is situated, so to speak, the
confluence of the anterior, posterior, and temporal regions of
these cavities.   The same section which leads from the pa
rietal eminences to that part of the lateral ventricles which is
the most spacious and projects the most outwards, falls in the
interval of the two eminences and of the corresponding por
tion of the ventricles upon the posterior margin of the corpus
callosum.
    There exists on a level with the squamous portion of the
temporal bone a depression in the interior of the cranium and
a corresponding eminence, almost as considerable, on the
outside.   If  we cut through this eminence and the contiguous
part of the brain at the same time, we open the base of the
temporal region of the ventricle.
    Now as there is nothing on the surface of the brain to ac
count for the cranial prominences of which I have just spoken,
it appears to me that we may very fairly consider them as
caused by the shape of the corresponding regions of the ven
tricles.  This conclusion is strengthened by comparing the
form of these eminences with that of the portions of the ven
tricles corresponding to them. The frontal eminences are
round, like the two cul-de-sacs forming the anterior extre
mities of the ventricles.     The occipital protuberances, and
especially the depressions answering to them in the interior of
the skull, are sharper, if this language is applicable to pro
tuberances and depressions; and the greater acuteness of the
posterior extremities of the ventricles in relation with these
protuberances, is a fact sufficiently, notorious.     Lastly, the
temporal eminences are oblique in the same direction as the

  in each posterior half of the hemispheres, are in accordance
  with these peculiarities.    To this region correspond the
  convolutions situated behind the posterior margin of the
 corpus callosum as far as the posterior termination of the
 ventricles.
     Lastly, the fourth region, situated in the interval between
 the superior occipital protuberances and the upper curved
 line of the occiput, divides the latter into a median convex
 quadrangle, and two lateral triangles, whose pointed summits
 terminate near the mastoid process. . Now these triangles,
                                                      j
  instead of being convex like the rest of the median arch, al
 most always present a plain or even concave surface. The
 depressed portions of these triangles correspond at their
 sharp summits to the insertion of the tentorium cerebelli and
 the external part of the lambdoidal suture.
     In the temporal regions of the cranial arch, we always re
 mark, on a level with the great wing of the sphenoid bone, a
 depression running upwards and backwards in the same
 direction as the fissure of Sylvius, to which it corresponds.
                                                           iº
 A right line drawn from the top of this depression towards
 the centre of the parietal eminence, marks the course of the
 fissure of Sylvius, and allows us to measure, on the livin
 subject, the comparative volume of cerebral substance
 in front, and of that behind, this fissure.
    Now the fissure of Sylvius, and the cranial depression
 answering to it at the fore part of the temporal fossa, are
 variously modified according to the modifications of the ven
tricular hollow.    The anterior and temporal regions of these
cavities are separated by a large nervous mass which follows
 the crus cerebri.   The fore part of the ventricle is enlarged
above this mass and the temporal part of the
low it.
    The fissure of Sylvius, then, forms the interval between
two regions of the ventricle, the frontal and the temporal,
and consequently the interval between the convolutions co
vering in these two distinct regions of the serous cavity.      It
ceases above, at the part where these regions of the ventri
cular cavity unite into a common conflux.         Its deepest part
is below, at the bottom of the widest interval between the
frontal and temporal extremities of the ventricle.
    Thus the form of the brain, and that of the skull also,
would seem to be determined in their general character by
the form of the serous sacs inclosed in the hemispheres, and
constantly filled with the fluid peculiar to them.
    This is not meant to imply that the cerebral convolutions
do not exert any influence on the secondary          shape of the

                    the ventricles,         almost    so   as

development           of
                the convolutions, acquires the cerebral forin,
par    earcellence.
   On the contrary, when the convolutions are but very little
developed, the prominences, and the regions separating them,
are    all
         exceedingly well marked, whilst,         the same time the

                                  the ventricular extremities have

                                                                            I               be

had evaporated and the entire film become of a black ap
pearance, what Newton likened to a hole in his bubble,
transmitting almost the entire light.          now moved the bottle          I
to and from me, and in a short time the entire film was
clothed with silvery white, reflecting atoms, which soon
formed into beautiful bands of colours by means of cohesive
attraction; for, as they formed nearly simultaneously, they
could not be produced by a descending fluid, causing relative
thicknesses; but perhaps it may be said, that the film was
thickened by evaporation of the saponaceous fluid. To ob
viate this objection,                 I
                         made the following new, and         presume                             I

about one inch in diameter,                               I
                                   dipped one end to the depth of
three inches into a    saponaceous    solution and formed a film,
which, when the tube was held perpendicularly, glided down
three inches.            I
                     now corked the upper orifice, to prevent
further  descent,  and laying the tube on the table, in a short
time the bands were formed; when these disappeared, and the
film was black,              I
                      shook the tube from side to side, and in
a short time the black changed to a silvery white, and then
formed into bands of different colours.         On placing it again
on the table the film appeared           over black.     Here thereall

34           Dr. Reade       on the Permanent Soap Films,
coloured rings. Now it is evident that friction cannot alter the
thickness of a plate of air, but must bring into view some sub
stances capable of condensation; and there is nothing mixed
with the air capable of such condensation, except vapour.                      I
therefore must attribute the colours to this cause. Convinced
that vapour was the cause, I improved on the Abbé Mazéas's
experiment: for, on washing one of the plates of glass with
soap and water, and holding it before the fire, then breathing
on the other, by means of a slight degree of friction I co
loured the entire glass, with a large black spot in the centre
more than an inch in diameter.       When this black spot was
formed, the glasses were so firmly united as to require a stron
force to separate them. This I attribute to the air being presse
out, and then the glasses acted in the same manner as a leather
 soaker used by school-boys, and not to any cohesive attraction
 of the surfaces, as supposed by chemists. I coated the glasses
 with a plate of water, and on pressing them together no co
lours appeared, until by a strong degree of friction I produced
 vapour.    I also smeared the glasses with some candle-grease,
and found no colours, until               I
                                   held the glasses to the fire,
 when, on using friction, vapour and colours were produced.
                    Atomic Theory of Colours.
   Having endeavoured to prove, I hope with effect, that
colours are not produced by relative thicknesses of the plate,
as advanced by Sir Isaac Newton in the second book of his
Optics,  I  shall proceed to give what I conceive is the true
explanation of this interesting phaenomenon. Grimaldi and
others maintained that light was capable of condensation and
rarefaction.    However, as they brought forward no experi
ments to prove         it,
                         Ithink     unfair
                                        it     say that
                                                   to      took myI
theory from that celebrated philosopher.                If   we
                                                      hold candle     a

                                                        or
and opake substance, and hold the paper sideways                 the      to
window, two shadows are formed, the one blue from the
candle, the other brown from the daylight.          Now this brown
shadow can        be
                   changed         to   an
                                    orange             by
                                                 approximating the
candle;    at ayet nearer distance the orange becomes        perfect  a
yellow, and when very close the colour entirely disappears,
 or the light   ofthe shadow becomes rarefied into perfect trans
parency.     The blue         like manner undergoes rarefaction
                              in
and change      ofcolour,  from    blue      purple; and when the

36          Dr. Reade   on the Permanent Soap Films,
clothed with white reflecting atoms; some of these soon
changed to a purple, blue, orange, &c., and when the bottle
was placed on an inclined plane the coloured bands were
formed, broad and vivid.          o ascertain whether the bands
of colour were similar by transmission and reflection, heldI
the film above a lighted candle, at an angle of about 45°, and
perceived exactly the same coloured bands, and not any com
plementary colours, “magnis componere parva.”           We must
attribute the colours of the clouds to the      approximation  of
 vaporific atoms, and not to different-sized globules of water.
 It is an interesting object of inquiry, to say why the black re
flecting atoms at great distances, should by heat or agitation,
 approximate to     #.    white or bands of colour.     We may,
 hypothetically, surmise that these atoms are spherical, and
 are enlarged by caloric, in the same manner as air in a bal
 loon or bladder; or we may suppose that, by agitation, &c.,
 they become oblate spheroids.
    Nothing is more surprising than the permanency of this soap
 film. In a few seconds Newton's bubble bursts, and conse
 quently hindered him from making deliberate observations;
 but now that we have one which lasts for months, can be
 washed and renewed, an inferior mind may investigate the
 phaenomena of light and colours with more success than even
 that great philosopher, in the infancy of experimental science.
 Indeed, every new experiment opens a wider field for re
 search, and I am sanguine enough to think that the perma
 ment soap film and the newly invented iriscope may produce
 interesting discoveries.   With intent to ascertain this perma
 mency,  I formed two films with a similar saponaceous mixture,
 in equally-sized bottles; the one was corked, the other open,
 and consequently exposed to the action of the atmosphere;
 in a short time the open one broke, the other remained
 for weeks.    I therefore inferred that the film broke from the
 vaporific action of the atmosphere. That it was not from
 pressure, I proved, by putting in a very long cork, so that
 the pressure
                 º:    be increased; nor was it from agitation,
 as supposed by Newton, for in washing the film it was well
 shaken; neither could it proceed from any chemical action,
 as I made the film in vacuo.      I remarked that a film formed
 on the mouth of a wine glass remained a long time when
the atmosphere was heavy and charged with vapour, whereas
of a dry day it speedily burst. I hence infer that the air in
a corked bottle becomes saturated with vapour, and thus that
evaporation is diminished.      I shall now sum up the foregoing
arguments, to show that the colours do not proceed from re
lative thicknesses.

40              Mr. C. Holthouse   on Increasing the Light
experiments being kept under slight pressure and at an
equable temperature of near 70°Fahr.
   Mixtures of this kind conducted through the vinous <U+017F>er
mentation in silver and china vessels always afforded a larger
quantity of ashes after evaporation and calcination than those
made in glass apparatus.        But upon the proportionate                  in
crease   by this process in any experiment, we can speak at the
outset with as little certainty as upon the height to which
any plant will grow when the seed is first planted.      One of
the features which I have     always  found to  accompany  their
formation is an increase in colour, which colour again disap
pears when they undergo decomposition by the putrefactive
fermentation and have ammonia as a product.
     Ihave found the quantity to vary with almost every cir
cumstance, even in experiments made with the same mixture,
from little or no increase to that of twenty times the weight
of those included in the sugar experimented upon. My ex
periments made with solutions containing about ten per cent.
 of their weight of sugar (the strength employed by Mr. Smith)
 rarely gave more than an appreciable increase upon the ori
 ginal quantity, except when the fermentation was conducted
 very quickly.
    The ashes were obtained by evaporating and burning over
 a spirit-lamp   without the addition of any foreign agent, the
 materials   being  in an open platinum vessel.   Their quantity
 was determined by weight as a whole, with the addition of
 their power of neutralizing acids as regards their alkaline
 property.

  flame in the same proportion become steadier and more uni
  form, till at seven inches, which was the length of the pillar
  of this chimney, it was as steady as could be desired. One
  fact was strikingly obvious during this experiment, viz., that
  the increase of brilliancy was by no means commensurate
  with the loss of light occasioned by the smaller bulk and
  great unsteadiness of the flame.         From several trials with
  chimneys of various lengths,             I
                                       should say that a seven inch
  pillar, for an Argand burner of the ordinary size, is well
  adapted for giving brightness, and at the same time steadi
  ness, to a flame.
     To ascertain the best diameter for the chimney, eight pieces
  of tin were procured, each two inches square, and having a
  circular aperture in their centre, varying from one and a half
  to half an inch in diameter; these, by turns, were fixed to the
  moveable stage of a microscope, and then placed directly over
  the flame of a lamp, so that the centre of the circle of the                                   Ar
  gand burner should correspond with the centre of the circular
  aperture in the tin; a simple” glass chimney being now placed
  upon the tin, the whole apparatus was lowered till the flame of
  the lamp passed through the aperture in the tin. By trying the
 different sizes one after the other, we were able to decide upon
 that which gave the greatest degree of illumination, and by
 raising and lowering the apparatus over the flame, the best
 height from the level of the wick for obtaining the greatest
 light was determined. The following are some of the results.
 The size of the flame was in a direct ratio with the size of the
 aperture in the tin, but       brilliancy was
                                  its                   inverse ratio;

in   other words,   the flame diminished                 in
                                               size but increased                                in
 brilliancy      the aperture through which
                  as                                had       pass was

 and if the light is equal to that afforded by the rectangular

    One more point, which was barely touched upon by Sir                             J.
 Herschel, yet remains to be decided: Is this superior splen
dour of the flame attended by an increased consumption of
oil?       If
           we reasoned from analogy, we should certainly
reply in the affirmative; intensity of combustion being ever
attended with corresponding consumption of the combustible
material.    But to place this beyond a doubt, the following
experiment was undertaken.        Two Argand lamps, having
wicks and    chimneys  of the same diameter and length, and
furnished with the same kind of oil, were placed in a pair of
scales, each at an equal distance and elevation from the centre
of a sheet of white paper pasted on the wall. On being lighted,
the flames were regulated till the shadows cast by a small
ruler had an equal depth; when this had been fairly deter
mined both by myself and others, weights were put into the
stand containing the lighter lamp, till the two exactly ba
lanced each other. The chimney was now quickly removed
from one of the lamps, and another substituted for giving a
clear white flame, the time being at the same moment noted:
they were allowed to burn for forty-two minutes, and were then
simultaneously extinguished. At the expiration of this time, the
lamp burning with the bright flame had consumed 100 grains
more than the other.     The experiment being repeated, but                 oil
with smaller flames, the increased consumption of             the           in
bright burning lamp was         grains.   50

    2. You must be too well aware of the height at which you
stand, in the estimation of men of science, to doubt that I en
tertain with diffidence any opinion in opposition to yours.
I  may say of you as in a former instance of Berzelius, that
you occupy an elevation inaccessible to unjustifiable criticism.
Under these circumstances,                      I
                                 hope that may, from you, ex           I
perience the candour and kindness which were displayed by
the great Swedish chemist in his reply to my strictures on his
nomenclature.
    3.      I
          am unable to reconcile the language which you hold
in  paragraph   1615, with the fundamental position taken in
1165.      Agreeably to the latter, you believe ordinary induc
tion to be the action of contiguous particles, consisting of a                                         –
species of polarity, instead of being an action of either parti
cles or masses at “sensible distances.”       Agreeably to the
former, you conceive that “assuming that a perfect vacuum
was to intervene in the course of the line of inductive action,
 it does not follow from this theory that the line of particles
on opposite sides of such a vacuum would not act upon
each other.”
 electrified
                  Again, supposing “it possible for a positivel
             particle to be in the centre of a vacuum an
                                                                                             j.
 in diameter, nothing in my present view forbids that the
 particle should act at a distance of half an inch on                                            all
 the particles forming the inner superficies      the bounding                  of
sphere.”
    P.  Laying these quotations before you for reconsideration,
I beg leave         inquire how
                      to               positively excited particle,

             above     described,   can react “inductrically” with
any particles        the superficies        the surrounding sphere,

endeavour to return to their natural state, if nothing be su
peradded to them, it must be supposed that they have poles
capable of existing in two different positions. In one of these
positions, dissimilar poles coinciding, are neutralized; while
in the other position, they are more remote, and consequently
capable of acting upon other matter.
    12. But I am unable to imagine any change which can ad
mit of gradations of intensity, increasing with remoteness.      I
cannot figure to myself any reaction which increase of distance
would not lessen.     Much less can I conceive that such ex
tremes of intensity can be thus created, as those of which you
 consider the existence as demonstrated. It may be suggested
 that the change of polarity produced in particles by electrical
inductions, may arise from the forced approximation of reci
procally repellent poles, so that the intensity of the inductive
 force, and of their effort to return to their previous situation,
 may be susceptible of the gradation which your electrical
 doctrines require.    But could the existence of such a re
 pellent force be consistent with the mutual cohesion which
 appears almost universally to be a property of ponderable
 particles?     am aware that, agreeably to the ingenious hy
                  I
 pothesis of Mossotti”, repulsion is an inherent property of the
 particles which we call ponderable; but then he assumes the
 existence of an imponderable fluid to account for cohesion;
and for the necessity    of such a fluid to account for induction
it is my ultimate object to contend.        I would suggest that it
can hardly be expedient to ascribe the phaenomena of electri
city to the polarization of ponderable particles, unless it can
be shown, that if admitted, it would be competent to produce
all the known varieties of electric excitement, whether as to
 its nature      energy.

electricity of the charging apparatus.    Discharge is the return
of the particles to their natural state, from their state of ten
sion, whenever the two electric forces are allowed to be dis
posed of in some other direction.” As you have not previously
mentioned any particular direction in which the forces are
exercised during the prevalence of this constrained condition,
I am at a loss as to what meaning I am to attach to the words
“some other direction.”      The word some, would lead to the
idea that there was an uncertainty respecting the direction in
which the forces might be disposed of; whereas it appears to
me that the only direction in which they can operate, must be
the opposite of that by which they have been induced.
   22. The electrified particles can only “return to their natural
state” by retracing the path by which they departed from                                                      it.
I  would suggest that for the words “to       disposed        some             be               of   in
other direction,”    would     better
                                 it      substitute the following,
                                                  be                 to

ticles, at opposite ends of the wire, shall in the first instance
be subjected to the same polarization as the excited particles
of the glass; and that the opposite polarizations, transmitted
to some intervening point, should thus be mutually destroyed,
the one by the other? But if discharge involves a return to
the same state in vitreous particles, the same must be true in
those of the metallic wire.        Wherefore then are these dissi
pated, when the discharge is sufficiently powerful ? Their
dissipation must take place either while they are in the state
of being polarized, or in that of returning to their natural
 State.  #.    if it happen when in the first-mentioned state, the
 conductor must be destroyed before the opposite polariza

with that above suggested, so that an electrical current may
be constituted of an imponderable fluid in a state of polariza
tion, the two electricities being the consequence of the posi
tion of the poles, or their presentation.      Positive electricity
may be the result of an accumulation of electric particles, pre
 senting poles of one kind; negative, from a like accumulation
 of the same matter with a presentation of the opposite poles,
inducing of course an opposite polarity. The condensation
 of the electric matter, within ponderable matter, may vary
 in obedience to a property analogous to that which deter
 mines the capacity for heat, and the different influence of
 dielectrics upon the process of electrical induction may arise
 from this source of variation.

     YoUR     kind remarks have caused me very carefully to re
       vise the general principles of the view of static induction
which I have ventured to put forth, with the very natural fear
that as it did not obtain your acceptance, it might be founded
in error; for it is not a mere complimentary expression when
I say I have very great respect for your judgement.               As the
reconsideration of them has not made me aware that they
differ amongst themselves or with facts, the resulting im
pression on my mind                is,
                            that must have expressed my meaning

                                     in to
                   bodies

 degree        heat will merely make water hot, whilst
              of                                                      higher                    a
 degree will dissipate            steam, and

is   that contained          paragraphs

forth.
    xxxiii. admit that these questions are very properly put;
              I

                     on certain Theoretical Opinions.                     63
not that   I go  to the full extent of them all, as for instance that
of motion and rest; but I do not perceive their bearing upon
the question, of whether conduction and insulation are different
properties, dependent upon two different modes of action of the
particles of the substances respectively possessing these actions,
                                        j
or whether they are only differences in degree of one and the
same mode of action? In this question, however, lies the whole
gist of the matter. To explain my views, I will put a case or
two. In former times a principle or force of levity was ad
mitted, as well as of gravity, and certain variations in the
 weights of bodies were supposed to be caused by different
 combinations of substances possessing these two principles.
 In later times, the levity principle has been discarded; and
 though we still have imponderable substances, yet the phae
 nomena causing weight have been accounted for by one force
 or principle only, that of gravity; the difference in the gravi
 tation of different bodies being considered due to differences
 in degree of this one force               in them all. Now no one
 can for a moment         suppose   that it is the same thing philoso
 phically to assume either the two forces or the one force for
 the explanation of the phaenomena in question.
     xxxiv. Again, at one time there was a distinction taken
 between the principle of heat and that of cold: at present
 that theory is done away with, and the phaenomena of heat
 and cold are referred to the same class, (as I refer those of
 insulation and conduction to one class,) and to the influence
 of different degrees of the same power. But no one can say
  that the two theories, namely, that including but one positive
  principle, and that including two, are alike.
      xxxv. Again, there is the theory of one electric fluid and
  also that of two.         One explains by the difference in de
  gree or quantity of one fluid, what the other attributes to a
  variation in the quantity and relation of two fluids.           Both
  cannot be true. That they have nearly equal hold of our
  assent, is only a proof of our ignorance; and it is certain
  whichever is the false theory, is at present holding the minds
  of its   supporters      inbondage, and        greatly retarding the
                                                    is
  progress  of  science.                    *

           I    think      therefore important,

   class, just  as       important

     xxxvii. I now come to what may be considered as queries
  in your letter which I ought to answer.                     Paragraph 8
  contains one. As              I
                           concede that particles on opposite sides
  of a vacuum may perhaps act on each other, you ask,
  “wherefore is the received theory of the mode in which
  the excited surface of a Leyden jar induces in the opposite
  surface a contrary state, objectionable?”               My reasons for
  thinking the excited surface does not directly induce upon the
  opposite surface, &c.,           first, my belief that the glass con
                                     is,
  sistsof   particles conductive          themselves, but insulated

 from Farnham, a well was dug in sand to the depth of 36 feet, and
 one of the workmen on descending into it was instantly suffocated.
 Fatal effects have also resulted from the accumulation of this gas in
 wells in Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, and at Applebury-street, near
 Cheshunt. This gas is much increased, after long-continued rain, in
 consequence of the swelling of the clay driving it out of the                                      in
terstices; and it is diminished after a long drought.         The preva
lence of a north-east wind has been noticed     by well-diggers to dimi
nish the quantity of the gas, but the effect is ascribed by Dr. Mitchell
to the dry weather which usually accompanies the wind from that
quarter. The author also suggests, that if wells are to be dug in
dangerous districts, they should be undertaken when there is least
water in the ground, or from the beginning of July to October.
    The noxious gas in the Weald of Kent and Sussex is stated to be
sulphuretted hydrogen.
    November 20, 1839.—A paper “On the origin of the vegetation
of our Coal-fields and Wealdens,” by J. T. Barber Beaumont, Esq.,
F.G.S., was next read.
    An examination of the fossil trees discovered on the line of the
Manchester and Bolton Railway * has confirmed Mr. Beaumont in
the opinion, that in no instance has the vegetation of the coal-fields
arisen from drifted trees sunk to the bottom of mighty rivers and
estuaries, but that it grew where it is found; and he is further of
opinion, that the districts composing our present coal-fields were ori
ginally islands.
  The principal objections of the author to the theory of the trans
portation of the fossil vegetation are the following:
   1. The existence of a mighty river or estuary at the time of the
deposition of the coal-measures, would require the existence of a vast
continent of which there are no traces.
  2. The coal strata near Newcastle are 380 yards in thickness, and
consequently, the lowest strata must have been deposited at the bot
tom of a river or estuary, exceeding in depth, six times the mean
depth of the German Ocean.
   3. A continent producing such a river, it is reasonable to expect,
would have left an abundance of fossils on its surface, as well as at
the bottom of       great river; but

   The author then offers the following theory as affording a pre
ferable explanation of the origin of coal-fields and Wealden forma
tions.
   He conceives they were originally swampy islands, formed out of
disjointed fragments which resulted from the first elevation of the
rocks; that on these islands grew a luxuriant vegetation consisting
of Ferns, Calamites, coniferous trees, &c. which, decaying and rege
nerating, accumulated in the manner of peat bogs; that the islands,
by the settling down of the disturbed crust of the earth, were de
pressed beneath the surface of the sea, and covered over with drifted
sand, clay, and shells, till they were again, by this process, converted
into dry land, and clothed with another vegetation; and he is of
opinion, that the operation was repeated as many times as there are
alternations of coal and sedimentary strata.
   A notice on “The Fossil Fishes of the Yorkshire and Lancashire
Coal-fields,” by W. C. Williamson, Esq., was then read; of which
an abstract is given in No. 65 of the Proceedings.
   A paper was last read, entitled, “A brief notice of the Geology

Haven from Temple Bay to Great Island at the confluence of the
Suire with the Nore and the Barrow, forming a series of cliffs, in
which the strata are excessively contorted.      It also forms the cliffs
from the west shore of the Nore    opposite Little Island and the right
bank of the Suire; a small patch of it occurs likewise south of
Passage. The contortions in the cliffs on the east side of the Haven,
Major Austin ascribes to lateral pressure, and he states that the
ridges of clay-slate range at right angles to the band of conglo
merate which traverses the promontory at Sand Eel Bay. These
contortions are more especially marked and numerous between
Dollar Bay and Bluff Head, ranging from the top to the bottom
of cliffs 250 feet in height.     At the south point of Booley Bay
the slate affords beautiful examples of ripple marks.     It is stated to
be perforated along the whole line of coast, by hollows varying in
size from a pin's point to five inches in length, and to the height of
20 feet above high-water mark.       On the hill above the Roman Ca
tholic chapel, north of Duncannon sands, the slate has a prismatic
structure.   It is stated to have been altered by igneous operations
on the west side of Great Island and in Little Island.        Near Bally
hack the cleavage is diagonal to the plane of stratification.
   4. Trap forms at Herrylock a mass protruding from the beach ;
also the narrow point on which Duncannon Castle stands, where it
is stated to rest on the tilted edges of clay-slate, and to have altered
that rock into an indurated, stratified, yellow stone. A basaltic dyke
occurs opposite Great Island on the Kilkenny side of the Nore. It
rises abruptly to the height of 100 feet, and from           white colour,                its

traordinary number of ossicles; yet owing to the form of the digital
ossicles, their breadth and flatness, and their large size, as compared
with the joints of the fin-rays of fishes, it had been generally sup
posed that the locomotive organs of the Ichthyosaurus were en
veloped, while living, in a smooth integument, which like that of
the turtle and porpoise, had no other support than was afforded by
the bones and ligaments within.
    Sir Philip Grey Egerton in a recent examination of Ichthyosaurian
remains in the possession of Mr. Lee of Barrow-on-Soar, detected,
with the penetration which has enabled him to bring to light many
 other obscure points in the structure of the Ichthyosaurus, traces of
the soft parts of the fin in a slab of lias containing a mutilated pad.
 dle; and having submitted the specimen to the examination of Mr.
 Owen, a detailed account of its character forms the subject of this
 memoir.
    Mr. Owen considers the specimen to be a posterior fin of the
Ichthyosaurus communis.       It presents impressions and fractured por
 tions of six digits, with the impression,-and a thin layer, most     di
 stinctly preserved,—of the dark carbonized integument of the ter
 minal half of the fin, the contour of which is thus most beautifully
 defined.
    The anterior margin is formed by a smooth unbroken well-marked
 line, apparently a duplication of the integument; but the whole of
 the posterior margin exhibits the remains and impressions of a series
 of rays by which the fold of the integument was supported.        Imme
 diately posterior to the digital ossicles, is a band of carbonaceous
 matter of a distinctly fibrous structure, varying from two to four
 lines in breadth, and extending in an obtusely-pointed form for an
 inch and a half beyond the digital ossicles. This band Mr. Owen
 believes to be the remains of the dense ligamentous matter which
 immediately invested the bones of the paddle, and connected them
 with the enveloping skin. The rays, above mentioned, are continued
 from the posterior edge of this carbonized ligamentous matter, in
 which their bases appear to have been implanted, to the edge of the
  tegumentary impression; the upper rays being directed transversely,
  but the others gradually lying more in the direction of the axis of
  the fin, as they approach its termination.       The most interesting
  feature in these   rays, Mr. Owen    says, is their bifurcating as they
  approach the edge of the fin.
     From the rarity of their preservation, their appearance and co
  existence in the present instance with remains of the integument,
  he states, it is evident they were not osseous, but probably either
  cartilaginous, or of that albuminous horn-like tissue, of which the
  marginal rays consist in the fins of the sharks and other plagio
  stomous fishes.    Besides the impression of the posterior marginal
  rays, the specimen presents a series of fine, raised, transverse lines,
  which cross the whole fin, and probably indicate a division of the
  rigid integument into scutiform compartments, analogous to those
  on the paddle of the Turtle and webbed foot of the Crocodile; but
  they differ in the absence of subdivision by secondary longitudinal

72     Geological Society:-the          Rev.   D. Williams on     the
exhibited in juxtaposition the several varieties of Cornish killas, pale
green, light blue, and purple volcanic ash and Coddon Hill grits (the
two latter containing plants), interstratified beyond any doubt among
the coral limestones, and these limestones inclosing carbonaceous
beds, underlaid and overlaid by thick accumulations of Coddon Hill
and floriferous grits.    On the road by Grayleigh, and descend
ing further on to Waddon Burton, Mr. Williams has traced these
alternations foot by foot, and he says the sequents are so manifestly
palpable in their interchanges, great and small, that nothing is left
for inference or conjecture.
   The inseparable connexion of the coral limestone and Cornish
killas with the floriferous series, he states, is also most plainly ex
hibited to the N.E. of Kingsteignton, at Ashburton, Newton
Bushel, Abbots, and King's Kerswell, Marldon, Berry Pomeroy,
Higher and Lower Yalberton, and thence to Brixham and Berry
Head.     At Meadfort sands, on the south, the author says, there is
a  strange intermixture, yet in regular stratified order, of Cornish clay
slate, and buff-coloured, finely arenaceous beds inclosing shells and
corals, with true floriferous sandstones containing plants, also with
culmy slates, and strata of volcanic ash and coral limestones, forming
an anticlinal axis, ranging north and south, and throwing off the great
mass of the Torquay limestones to the east and west.
    To the east of Dartmoor, Mr. Williams has little doubt the same
alternations on a great and small scale occur, as far as the parallel
of Torquay, immediately to the south of which line, but west of the
bay, are said to be lofty conspicuous hills of the floriferous strata (No.
9), which he conceives “may be abruptions”; but their bases are
commonly concealed by a thick mantle of new red sandstone. To
the west of Dartmoor, independent of what he believes to be an axis
of No 8, and forming the southern margin of the culm-trough,
Mr. Williams has been led to conclude, that the floriferous beds, by
other arcs of undulation, have broken through the thinner northern
border of the killas, throwing it off on each shoulder and intercepting
it in troughs. Instances of this, he says, are sufficiently appa
rent on each side of a line drawn from Greston Bridge on the
Tamar, S.E. of Launceston, to Heath Field, north of Tavistock; the
high central ridge consisting of floriferous and Coddon grits, flanked
on the north by undoubted killas and volcanic ash and breccia. To
the N.W., W.S.W., and S. of Greston Bridge, the floriferous
series is stated to be exposed in great force, extending almost un
interruptedly in a straight line into the great body of the culm-field;
but to the west it is said to be generally concealed by killas, though
a continuous contracted range branches off to the westward by
Lezant, Lawanick-down, and Alternau; and it appears to be depressed
under, or to pass into the killas and speckled slates of Davidstow,
N.E. of Camelford.
   A small area of an inverted arc of undulation is exposed in and
around Tavistock; and the floriferous grit, principally identified by
 its associated slates,              underlie the high killas range
                                                                        in of

companiment of intercalated killas and Coddon Hill grit dipping
beneath the volcanic ash of Marly Mead. Mr. Williams also mentions
a shaft sunk in a copper lode close by the turnpike gate on the road
from Tavistock to Callington, as another instance of floriferous grit,
or a rock exactly the same as that which contains the copper lode of
Wheal Friendship, underlying pale green slate or killas: and he
adds, there can be no doubt that Wheal Friendship mine is in No. 9
 or the floriferous series. The next instance mentioned in the paper, is
at Linkinghorn and South Hill, north of Callington, where there is
stated to be an entire suite of alternations of killas, Coddon grits, and
floriferous grits with plants,           dipping south. Again, near Pillaton,

with a strike N. and S., or nearly perpendicular to that of Exmoor.
  What, says Mr. Williams, are the results, if the question be tested
  by the assumed law, that strata may be identified by their organic
 remains 2 If the Posidoniae and Goniatites of the lenticular, black
  limestones, never exceeding thirty-five feet in thickness, be appealed
  to, to identify them with the mountain limestone, the weight of
 organic remains opposed to them in the Launceston and Petherwen
 fossils, the corals and other organic remains of South Devon belong
 ing to the floriferous series, reduces the evidence to dust. If mineral
 characters be appealed to, he says, they fail altogether.
     In conclusion, Mr. Williams remarks, that in this supplement, he
 has endeavoured faithfully to transfer the simple truths of nature to
 his pages, without reference to the theories of others.        He would,
 however, remind geologists that the proposed law of Mr. W. Smith
 is no law, if it do not imply a final and universal extinction of
 species. This being his own view, Mr. Williams says, he could not
 admit that the Goniatites and Posidoniae of Devonshire were first
 introduced and became extinct with the mountain limestone, being
justified by the fact of superposition, and more reasonable analogy,
 in concluding that these genera existed elsewhere in congenial con
 ditions during the entire period of the deposition of the Trilobite
 slates, when that formation ceasing in Devonshire, the ova of the
creatures or the creatures themselves were transported to a region
favourable to their existence, and were continued during epochs of
duration up to the period of the mountain limestone, and probably
beyond   it,
           if    they be not now           in
                                        existence.    They appear,      his                  in

not universally effaced    inspecies. To guard himself, however, from

                                             believes entirely     the ex               in

    LETTER TO PROF. LIEBIG                      ON THE THEORY OF SUBSTITU
                                              TIONS”.
        SIR,
I   of
      HASTEN
       organic
               to communicate to you one of the most brilliant facts
               chemistry.    I have verified the theory of substitutions
in an  extremely remarkable and perfectly unexpected manner. It is
only from the present time that we shall be able to appreciate the
high value of this ingenious theory, and to foresee the immense dis
coveries it promises to realize.    The discovery of chloracetic acid,
and the  constancy of the types in the chlorinated (chlorés) compounds
derived from aether and the chloride of aethyle, have led me to ex
periments which I will now describe.     I passed a current of chlo
rine through a solution of the acetate of manganese under the direct
influence of solar light. After twenty-four hours I found in the
liquid a superb crystallization of a yellow violet salt. The solution
contained nothing further than this salt and hydrochloric acid.              I
analysed this salt: it was the chloracetate of the protoxide of man
ganese. Nothing extraordinary as yet; a simple substitution of the
hydrogen of the acetic acid by an equal number of equivalents of
chlorine, already known from the beautiful experiments on chlora
cetic acid.    This salt, heated to 110° in a current of dry chlorine,
 was converted with disengagement of oxygen into a new compound
 of a gold yellow colour, the analysis of which had for              composi                 its
 tion   tothe formula Mn Cl2         C4 Cl6   +       There was therefore

same takes place    with regard to alcohol; the temperature, beginning
at 140°, rises at last to the boiling point of the liquid.  When this
takes place, the greater part of the alcohol burns; but before the
burning commences, light blue flames are visible, which Doebereiner.
also observed upon the vaporization of aether dropped on hot platina.
Mr. R. F. Marchand wishes to guard against the inference that might
be drawn from this experiment, that he considered that the liquids
used were decomposed.       The formation of lampic acid is based upon
the fact, that the undecomposed vapour of alcohol passing within a
certain distance, immediatelyover the hot metallic surface, is oxidated,
which is also the case with platina wire.     If the vapour were in ac
tual contact with the metallic surface it would inflame.
   Both experiments are a confirmation of Buff's explanation of the
 repulsion in Poggendorff's Annals, xxi., which is so full and satis
 factory that it is unnecessary to look for any further elucidation.—

                UNCOMBINED HYPOSULPHUROUS ACID.
   M. Langlois, professor of chemistry at Strasburg, has succeeded
in isolating hyposulphurous acid; he obtained it perfectly pure by
decomposing hyposulphate of potash, with oxichloric acid, which
forms an insoluble salt with potash.
   The acid thus obtained is liquid, colourless, and of a slightly
syrupy consistence.       A period arrives when its density cannot be

     Nitric acid reacts instantaneously on concentrated hyposulphu

 remarkable than that of nitric acid; the decomposition of both
 acids occurs instantaneously, with tumultuous action; sulphur and
 chlorine evidently appear, and reagents show the presence of sul
 phuric acid in the solution: the phaenomena are similar to those ob
 served when chloric acid is dropped into alcohol or aether.    In this
 latter case as in those also happens inflammation of the excess of the
 combustible body.—L'Institut,                              No. 327.
ON THE PRESENCE                        OF IODINE            IN COD OIL. BY R. F. MARCHAND.

(1.)
       THE   phaenomenon of peculiar dark bands crossing the
         prismatic spectrum, when half the pupil of the eye
(looking through the prism) is covered by a thin plate of any
transparent substance, the edge being turned from the violet
towards the red end of the spectrum, was first described by
Mr. Fox Talbot in 1837 (Lond. and Edinb. Phil. Mag. and
Journal of Science, vol. x. p. 364.), who showed that these
bands are due to the interference of the two halves of each
primary pencil, one of which is retarded by the plate.
    (2.) Sir David Brewster has given various new modifications
of these experiments (British Association Reports, vol. vii.
Trans. of Sections, p. 13.), the most material of which tend to
show that the effect is fully produced only when the plate is
in the position just described, and diminishes and disappears
 as it revolves in         own plane; the same observation being
                           its
 also extended        tothe case             of

                      the bands  simply,   but assigns     reason why no

of last summer, when I repeated the experiments, and devised
several new modifications with reference to an explanation
which it appeared to me was supplied by the undulatory

to many entirely new conclusions*, I am anxious to put on
record the few points I have been able to establish, and to
vindicate my views from misconceptions to which they have
been exposed.
    (5.) The following distinctions are important to be borne in
mind with reference to the explanation of the phaenomena.
    In these experiments we have to consider the different ele
                                                                      lº.
mentary pencils of which the spectrum, as presented to the
eye, is formed; and with respect to each of                      in the case
of the prismatic spectrum it is easily seen that the edge of the
plate intercepts that half which lies towards the EDGE of the
prism.
    In the interference-spectrum (according to Fraunhofer's
method), the spectra are formed one on each side of the axis,
with their violet ends towards                The edge
                                                   it.         the plate   of                   in
this case must always intercept that half                              of
                                                              each primary
pencil, which after passing the focus lies NEAREST                  the aris.    to

the emergent pencil will originate from a geometrical focus,
which is not a single point, but a caustic, whose converity is
towards the edge of the prism.         Hence, on the principles of
the   wave-theory,  it follows that the side of the pencil which
lies towards the    edge   of the prism is that which undergoes
less retardation, or has the shorter undulatory route; this dif

  Assuming this formula as the true one, the deficiency in
the carbon experimentally determined is not greater than
what usually takes place; but the error in the hydrogen,
though trifling in amount, being upon the opposite side to
that on which it usually occurs, it became expedient to resort
to some method of verification.    The specific gravity of the
vapour of the             oil
                   was therefore taken according      the well                            to

future period submit to the Academy.           I have resolved, how
ever, no longer to defer giving publicity to my experiments iden
tifying the fluid oils of grain and potatoe spirit, having had my
attention drawn by Dr. Kane to a recent volume of Poggen
dorff’s Annalen, containing a paper by M. Mulder, in which
I  find myself anticipated on the other point; and the butter of
corn spirit is satisfactorily shown to be what I had concluded
it to be, not entirely from my own experiments, but from a
comparison of them with the researches of Pelouze and Liebig.
 Mulder also notices the third principle which is associated
with the oenanthic acid and oenanthic aether, and describes it
under the name of oleum siticum. The object therefore of
the present communication is much more limited than it was
originally intended to be, professing only to announce the de
tection of the potatoe-spirit oil of Pelletier and Dumas in fer
mented infusions of the mixed grains employed by the distil
ler.    But as Mulder conceived his discovery of sufficient      in
terest to justify him in giving it to the scientific world, I shall,
 I trust, be pardoned for bringing an analogous fact under the
notice of the Academy.
XV.      Observations on the Climate of Italy and other Countries
                          in ancient times”.
 A VAGUE           notion seems to have prevailed for some time
         past among persons conversant with ancient authors,
that the climate of Europe in the classical ages of Greece and
 Rome must have been considerably colder than at the pre
 sent day.     Latterly this question has been taken up by two
philosophers, who from a consideration of the vegetation have
come to a different conclusion.         Most persons probably have
read the   interesting  essay  by Arago    in the Annuaire for 1834,
who states that several of his facts have been borrowed from
the writings of Schouw. The conclusions drawn by these
writers are probably in the main correct; but some of the
facts stated by them appear to require modifications, which
are more fully explained in the following pages.
I.   Vegetation  of Ancient Italy:    the beech, the date-palm, the
                                 olive.
    It has been said that Virgil speaks of the beech as growing
in the neighbourhood of Rome; whereas now the climate is
too hot for that tree, which is not found till we reach a con
siderable height on the Apennines.           In fact, Tenore (Cenno

places the region of the beech in Southern Italy, at from 400
to 600 toises above the level of the sea. Virgil, however, in
reality never speaks of the “fagus,” generally supposed to be
the beech, as growing near Rome.            That tree is mentioned
twice in the Georgics        173. and       71.), but

though bearing an edible and sweet gland, is
from the trees bearing real “glandes,” that is acorns, seems
pretty decisive on this point.

date-tree grow; but at Bordighiera, which lies between them,
in a very warm exposure, it is cultivated rather extensively.
We must then put the mean temperature of Bordighiera
above 16°, and probably it is above that of Toulon, viz.16°-6.
 From these circumstances it evidently results that the culti
vation of the date-palm in Italy requires a mean annual heat
of from 16° to 17°C., and probably nearer the latter. Now
the temperature of the southernmost provinces of Italy is not
in     all
       likelihood above 17°5, the temperature            Palermo; and                     of

                           and other Countries in ancient times.                                               99
and hence the mean of the whole year = 27°4 C. Com
paring this mean temperature with that of Cairo, in latitude
30°, the increase for five degrees of latitude is 13°C., as
assumed before.
  Probably the number 270-4 is rather too high, as the hours
of observation selected would lead to a result erring in excess.
But on the other hand it is to be remarked, that Darfür
comes within the limits                  rains, which in this
                                                of the tropical
part of Africa reach as far as 17° north,    and tend to keep
down   very much the heats of summer.        In fact, Browne
never marks the thermometer above 389-3 in Darfür, while
he mentions having observed 46°.7 in the Great Oasis of
Egypt. It is in those portions of the torrid African zone,
where rain never or rarely falls, as in Upper Egypt, Nubia,
and Fezzan, that the heat of the day is most excessive.   It is
true that the nocturnal radiation is also very  great *, which

     think it is difficult not to feel very sceptical about any
extensive   cultivation of the vine in ancient times in the
northernmost provinces of France, and in England. Strabo,
as M. Arago has remarked, indicates the line of the Cevennes
as the limit of the culture of the olive in France, which it still
 is;but the remainder        the sentence   of think, equally re         is,  I

ceptions were evidently made; yet enough appears to explain
the value and the cause of the permission of Probus.
   The first positive authority for the cultivation of the vine
in Britain is Bede, who says, “Vineas etiam quibusdam in
locis germinans".”      It is important here to observe the “qui
busdam in locis.”      Setting    aside vague traditions, the next
authentic testimony is that of Domesday Book, which men
tions vineyards in several places.       At Rayleigh in Essex, we
are told “there is one        park   and six arpennis of vineyard,
which, if it takes well, yields twenty modii of wine.” (Cam
den's Essex.)     But the very indication of a few vineyards
here and there excludes the idea of any extensive cultivation,
such as takes place in really wine-growing countries.             At a
subsequent period, many authorities, for which I may refer to
the Archaeologia, vols. i. and iii., and Miller's Gardener's
Dictionary, article Vitis, prove the existence of vineyards in
particular spots, and generally in connexion with cathedrals
or religious houses.      What was the success of these attempts
of the monks to make wine, “in commodum et magnum
honorem,” as an old writer says, of their respective houses,
 may partly be conjectured from the accounts of a vineyard
 at Ely given by Miller, where the sale of verjuice forms a
 considerable portion of the profits of the vineyard t. Only

        I repeat, that to provechange of climate it is necessary to
                                                 a
show, not merely the existence of vineyards in a few localities,
but the extensive growth of the grape for the purpose of
making wine. In fact, Plot” tells us, that in the year 1685,
 Dr. Bathurst, President of Trinity College, made as good
claret at Oxford, “in a very mean year for that purpose,” as
any one could wish to drink; and Pepys says, that in the
reign of Charles                      II.
                        very good wine was made             Waltham                            at

    Hence the quantities of oxygen contained in the alkaline
 bases, including the lime, the alumina, the water and the
silica, are as the numbers 1, 3, 6, 8, as in most Chabasies.
The chemical distinction between the two minerals appears
to consist in the relative quantities of lime and soda contained
in them, most lime being contained in Chabasie.       Gmelinite
forms a jelly with hydrochloric acid, Chabasie does not.

    Between these analyses and that of Klaproth there is very
little agreement. Probably either the silica which Klaproth
obtained still contained alumina, or the elaeolith employed by
him was impregnated with foreign minerals, insoluble in acids,
which must have increased the quantity of silica, as this was
not tested as to    purity. This analysis becomes still more
                   its
suspicious, when we consider that elaeolith not only contains
potash, but also soda. From 100 grains         powder Klaproth                                     of
obtained 27.5  grains   chloride  of   alkali, which    took for                of       an                           he

in my analyses, we then obtain only about 11 per cent. soda
and 4 per cent. potash, which gives a loss of 4-5 for the
whole.      Between C. G. Gmelin's analyses and mine there
prevails a satisfactory coincidence; only the silica of the
former should perhaps be somewhat greater, as the small quan
tities of it which constantly accompany the other constituents
were not separated and added to the main quantity. That M.
Gmelin did not redissolve the silica in carbonate of soda can
scarcely have given rise to any inaccuracy, as on employing
good pieces of this elaeolith the silica is always found free
from foreign ingredients.         Likewise in the amount of alkali
this analysis differs slightly from mine, but this undoubtedly
arises from the               employed by him being less perfect
than the one now in use for the determination of potash and
soda. The sums of the chlorides agree on the other hand per
fectly; Gmelin obtained 39.1 per cent, and I very nearly 39.0,
which proves that only the relative quantities of potash and
soda were somewhat inaccurately determined in Gmelin's ana
lysis.

has not, as far as I am aware, been hitherto analysed, as it was

nute parts of the rock in their interior.                   Their nucleus is

   The amount of water is here adopted from Prof Gmelin's
                                                  ãº
determination, as a sufficient quantity of pure mineral was not
at my disposal. The silica separated by hydrochloric acid left
about 2.5 per cent, residue, insoluble in                       of soda, which
evidently consisted of minute parts of the rock.                  A consider
able difference between M. Gmelin's analysis and mine will
be found solely in the relative quantities of potash and soda.
The source of this is without doubt to be sought in the mode
of determining these two alkalies employed by L. Gmelin.
He weighed the heated chlorides and determined by a
solution of silver the quantity of chlorine contained in them,
and thence calculated the requisite quantities of chloride of
potassium and chloride of sodium which must be present
to give this quantity of chlorine in the mixture of the two
salts. On closer consideration, it is evident that every error
of weight is greatly increased by calculation, as a small
defect in the quantity of chloride of silver corresponds to a
considerable difference in the relative quantity of potash and
soda.

                                   have omitted two constituents
which well deserve a separate     consideration: these are small
   uantities of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids which occur in
 these minerals.    M. Bromeis first drew attention to this sub
ject, and      I
              have fully confirmed his observations.    To test
 the various species of elaeolith as to the quantities of these
 acids, I always employed distinct quantities, which, powdered
 finely, were decomposed by chemically pure nitric acid. The
 muriatic acid was then determined by a solution of silver, and
 the sulphuric acid by chloride of barium.     M. Bromeis found
 in the white elaeolith from the Ilmen mountains 0.04 per
 cent. hydrochloric acid.                  I
                              obtained the following results:—

   The first and second experiment with the nepheline differ
very much, which probably arises from a quantity of those
crystals being taken which were employed for the analyses
10 and 11, containing foreign minerals which, as for instance
davyne, might easily increase the amount of the acids. As the
quantities are so small, I will not vouch for perfect accu
racy in the quantities stated”; thus much                however, cer       is,

 after an hour water was added to               and      was filtered.

conceives that alumina may still be contained in the silica,
separated from the heated alumina, by long digestion, in hy
drochloric acid. The quantity of it can, however, be but ex
tremely slight, as this residue acted before the blow-pipe as

     The mineral might therefore be regarded     as consisting of
1   atom soda elaeolith (according to the older formula),  and of
1   atom calcareous spar, and should have the following com
position:

But if      my formula                  be adopted as the correct one for elaeo
lith, cancrinite would be expressed by the formula Naº Ši
 + 2 Al Si + Ca C, and calculated accordingly, should have
the composition:
                 Silica . . . . . 39'11

                                                                        100'00
A more satisfactory agreement of the formula with the com
position found can scarcely be expected in analysis. They
appear merely to differ in the formula giving the amount of
lime about 1 per cent. higher; but this difference disappears
almost entirely if we admit that the potash replaces a portion
of the lime. That lime and potash replace one another
is evident from the analyses 10, 11, and 12 of nepheline.
This latter           is,
                  indeed, only essentially different from the other
elaeoliths        by
                the greater quantity        lime     contains; butof       it                          it
seems that    principally   the amount        potash  has been dimiof
nished      by     its
                 occurrence, while the soda does not           differ                   at    all
in proportion.      Cancrinite, therefore, actually contains lat.                                      of
nepheline          of
                    composition, such
                             a                was formerly adopted as
for the Vesuvian      nepheline,  but which has hitherto not been
found   in an isolated mineral.
   On closer consideration,        will be found that the cancrinite
                                                   it
affords even       better test for the correctness

one   (if3                   2   Ål,   1-6   Na, and 0.4 Ka are added)                       =      3877.

   Only two              of
                the analysed varieties    this mineral possess          of
colour, those from Fredricksvärn, the one green, the other
brown.    When both are finely powdered and decomposed
with concentrated hydrochloric acid, the silica separated has
the same colour, only        less degree.in This
                                              a      especially                          is
evident      the green elaeolith, which
                    in                         more intensively              is
coloured than the    brown,   and with which    therefore chiefly            I
performed experiments. Even when the concentrated hydro
chloric acid     evaporated, and the dry mass again moistened
                         is
with  acid, and treated with water, the filtered silica still re
tains         its
          colour, which, however, immediately disappears on
heating the silica.         further destroyed when the silica
                                   It    is                                                                 is
heated with nitric  acid,    the mineral decomposed by fuming
                                             or
nitric acid. This latter action sufficiently proves the colour
to    be  organic origin. But the colouring substance must
              of
certainly           be
                  peculiar nature,

      the various classes of  compounds    that ammonia is ca
pable of forming, it has been my lot to submit to the consider

I  had been led by my experimental results, and by which I
conceived that the mutual connexion of the different classes of
ammoniacal compounds could be explained, and their origin
and properties accounted for more satisfactorily than it was
possible to do by means of the ideas that had been previously
received in science. In advancing this new theory of the na
ture of ammonia and                  its
                                  compounds,        was not       Isanguine                so

    The completeness of the analogy thus indicated is acknow
ledged by Graham, who proposes to extend the Berzelian the
ory so as to include these cases. He assumes, that in the
compound radical ammonium the                  may be replaced
by a metal, and thus a cuprammonium        NH,   Cu, a zincam
monium N. H., Zn, a hydrargammonium          N. H., Hg, may be
capable of individual existence.   If Hg and H are replaceable,
then Hg, H, N is equivalent to H, N, and thus he agrees with
me that the type of sal-ammoniac and white precipitate
(Cl   H.  H. Ad and Cl  Hg-Hg      Ad on my theory) is the same.
    But  why  have we not Cl    Hga HN, or Cl Cu, HN, or Cl
Hg, N and Cl Zn, N, taking their place among these bodies
generated by ammonia?        For Cu, N or Zn, N would also be
equivalent to ammonium.       The replacement stops when there
remain yet two equivalents of hydrogen to the nitrogen; and
it is only by a temperature such as destroys completely the
constitution of these bodies that a metallic azoturet can be
produced.
   The compounds containing oxygen acids are precisely simi
lar to those chlorides just described. The bodies

are so obviously similar in constitution, that the one explana
tion of their internal structure must be admitted.
   There exist thus two sorts of compounds, which are ordinary
ammoniacal salts with metallic oxide in place of water, or in the
 words of the theory of Graham, that contain ammonium in
which hydrogen is replaced by a metal; those as Cl. Hg    NH,
in which one equivalent, and those as Cl. Hg       NH.   Hg, in
which two equivalents have been thus replaced.         The sub
stitution stopping there shows that N H, is fixed, and thus that
even if these various sorts of ammonium be admitted, the ami
dogene must be considered as pre-existing in them; and as

extended so as to embrace a large class of the ammoniacal
compounds newly discovered,—but can it embrace all? When
calomel is treated by water of ammonia there is formed the
body, Hg, Cl + Hg, NH2. If the ammonium theory be ap
plied to      a.
              body, are we to make a new compound radical,
and say       it is Cl +     NH, Hg, and   to say that the correspond

Here, then, is no parallel whatever; these bodies                altogether           lie

which       is  present quite unfit for science, the even partial
adoption of at   which would throw into confusion the most posi

sesses, and hence               do
                              much harm and           good.      Having    no                             so

how many more hypotheses must they adopt for the theory of

that the number of hypothetical bodies necessary for the com

sible metallic amidides, therefore equal to the number of me

Angelica Archangelica, Colchicum autumnale, Helianthus tube
rosus, &c., and in a few lichens, as L. frawineus and L. fasti
giatus.      Although known to be closely related to starch, and
interesting as a probable member of the starch family (espe
cially in being converted into gum and starch sugar by the
action of dilute acids), no examination of                 composition has, its

          I    am   aware,     been made.      To   supply    this deficiency,
I    have  performed         few

     The inulin analysed was prepared from the root                          the                     of
 dahlia,     asfollows: the moist root, with the skin previously
 removed, was sliced, macerated, and washed with cold water.
 This was boiled           five parts

   The analogy of this formula (the lowest whole numbers
which can be given) to gum, starch, grape and cane sugars,
will at once be apparent; each of these containing the mole
cular group, 24 carbon, united to hydrogen and oxygen, in
the proportions to form water.      But in the whole of these
(with one   exception, the compound   of chloride of barium and
cane sugar, lately examined by Peligot, C2, Hai O,1--Ba Cl,
or C2. His Ois + 3 H O, Ba Cl), the number of atoms ad
mitting of division, the equivalent becomes doubtful. In
crystallized cane sugar, for instance, should the formula be
Cai H2, Oza, or Cha Hu On? While in the case of inulin
this division is impossible.
   To satisfy myself as to the constitution of this substance,                                 I
endeavoured to combine it with metallic oxides, but the only
one attended with success was oxide of lead. Neither ace
tate nor subacetate of lead precipitates the aqueous solution
of inulin; but       on mixing                    its
                                       solution with the ammoniacal
acetate    of
            lead,                  on

    As first precipitated in the cold, these inulates are hy
drated; they retain this water if dried in the air, give it off
 slowly by being kept over sulphuric acid, and readily to air at
 212°. The one which contains 5 PbO gave only 2:00 per cent,
 the other gave 7:00.       This last, with allowance for hygrome
tric  moisture,   approaches    6-4, which is the calculated number
 for five equivalents, making the formula C2. His Ols--3 PbO
  + 5 H O. Thus, it would appear, that anhydrous inuline is
 C2. His Os (isomeric with anhydrous cane sugar), which, in
 the case of inulin dried at common temperatures, is combined
 with 3 H O. With this water it does not part without decom
 position.     In the two lead compounds inulin is combined, in
 one with 3 HO + 5 Pb O, and in the other with 3 PbO
  + 5 HO. It is also possible that inulin in solution may be
 combined with eight equivalents of water, thus making the

     That the group of three atoms of water is more strongly
  attached than the group of five atoms, is proved, first, by dry
  inulin containing three, and not five atoms of water, in
  combination with C3a His Ols; and secondly, by the compound

180                       Mr. C. T. Coathupe on certain
tion of the remainder, while the other lead compound loses
five equivalents of water at 200°.
    The constitution of these substances may be viewed in
a somewhat different light. Water, existing as such, com
bined with any substance allied to starch, either basic or con
stitutional, as supposed above, is never known to be so inti
mately combined with the substance as to be incapable of
displacement by oxide of lead, especially under such a favour
able circumstance as the presence of free ammonia.              When
substitution appears impossible, it is therefore reasonable to
conclude that the water, if it exists at all, is neither basic nor
constitutional, but is essential to the substance itself.
    The remarkable circumstance of inulin giving off at one
time three equivalents of water, and not at another, under ap
parently the same circumstances, suggests the idea that two
inulines exist, having the same composition, but one con
taining water capable of displacement, which the other does
not. This substance has, indeed, been obtained by chemists
in two different physical states, gummy and pulverulent (al
though       Ihave never obtained but the former dry); and                                          I

   each a range of 600°Fahrenheit, were suspended from an
   iron pin at a distance of two inches from the interior surface

   renheit upon each pair of observations.    Hence 23°1 of Fah
  renheit were retained by the covered bulb, which were evi
  dently reflected, and lost to observation, by the bright metallic
  surface of the unclothed bulb.
      In another series of experiments wherein the temperature
  indicated by the unclothed thermometers averaged only 124°5
  Fahrenheit, from twelve pairs of observations, the increment
  shown by covering one of the bulbs with a thin bag of black
  “merino,” amounted to 34°66 Fahrenheit.        Hence the quan
 tity of heat that is reflected from the bright surface of a ther
 mometer diminishes as the heat itself increases.
      Exp. 3. During the latter part of the founding process
 and whilst the clothed thermometer suspended from the brick
 pillar ranged from 320° to 325° Fahrenheit, a small black
 iron cylindrical pan filled with water was placed upon a thin
 iron shelf, which had been fixed against the pillar and close
 by the side of the thermometer.       It was reasonably antici
 pated that water thus placed in a temperature of 320° to 325°
 would boil; but after waiting until the half of it had evapo
 rated, it showed no tendency to ebullition.
     Exp. 4. The top of the iron pan was now covered with a
 pane of window-glass, and in a few minutes it boiled vio
lently.    This experiment demonstrated that the cooling pro
perties of rapid evaporation can neutralize one of the direct
effects of heat to a very surprising extent; and to ascertain
the amount of this influence the following experiment was      in
stituted.
     Exp. 5. A clothed thermometer, whilst the mercury was
indicating a temperature of 310°Fahrenheit, was immersed

                                Iffects of Temperature.                            1.33
in a vessel of boiling water. The mercury instantly fell to
212°, and then very gradually sunk to 14.1°. The merino
envelope had become dry, and the mercury had commenced
rising when the bulb was immersed a second time into the
water. The mercury rose to 202°, and then gradually fell
to 139°.    By a third immersion the mercury rose to 198°,
whence it fell gradatim to 133°.      The envelope was now sa
turated with water at about 140°Fahrenheit, but the mercury
speedily reassumed the temperature of 133° Fahrenheit, and
remained at this fixed point for nearly five minutes, although
the real temperature of               its
                              situation was, and had been for
many previous hours, 3100 Fahrenheit.
    The effects        of
                   rapid aqueous evaporation were thus clearly
shown to influence the indications of the thermometer when
 placed       indry atmosphere

 the circumstances   described,    the surprising extent

XXI.     Remarks on some Tide Observations, published in the
   Transactions of the British Association.         By Richard
   THoMAs, Civil Engineer".
IN     the Transactions of the British Association for the year
     1838, is an account of a level line measured from the
Bristol Channel to the English Channel, from which the writer
draws the conclusion, “that the mean tide must be taken as
the level of the sea,” and that this mean tide is the same, or
nearly the same elevation at                           all
                                     places, whatever may      the                                          be

or for ascertaining their causes; and until this be done, no
mean tide-level could be determined on.        But, after all, such
standard level must have reference to some fixed or bench mark
in order to make it useful, and could only be applied to one
neighbourhood, as it could not be depended on with reference
to tides at any distant part of the coast, which may be exem
plified by a reference to the tides between the                 and
King-Road; and although this example may be taken as                                                 al
most an extreme case, nevertheless it will serve the better to
elucidate the uncertainty of tide-marks.
     “Itmust be evident that the particular formation and trend
ing of the coast as connected with the set of the tide will tend
to alter the elevation of the high-water as well as of the low
water marks. The Bristol Channel, from          form narrowin            its
upwards       the Severn, causes the tidal wave
             to                                           rise muc                to

         reasons before stated, it appears that the level of the
low water at King-Road is higher
down the channel.

                      Now the half-tide mark of ordinary
spring tides at King-Road is about 22 feet above the low
water there. At Ilfracombe the half-tide is 15 feet above the
low water, and at the Land’s-end it is eight feet and a half.
   “Even supposing the low-water mark to be as low at King
 Road as at the other places, then the half-tide there is seven
feet above that mark at Ilfracombe, and thirteen feet and a
half above that at Land’s-end; but in all probability instead
of 7 and 18%, the differences are really about twelve and
tWentw.
  “The     low-water marks of the corresponding tides appear
to present   a much better approximation to a true level than
the half-tide mark, and these are taken for determining the
elevations ascertained in the Trigonometrical Survey of En
gland and Wales: but it would be desirable for many pur
poses that the movements of the tides should be better known,
which might lead us to a knowledge of a true level, or so near
an approximation as would answer                           all

          Tide Observations of the British Association.      1.37
clear that the effect will be more apparent on spring tides
than on neaps, owing to the greater velocity of the water, and
so it appears to be.
     On the south coast of Cornwall the rise of ordinary spring
tides is about 16 to 17 feet, and of ordinary neaps a little
more than 7 feet. At Axmouth the rise of spring tides ap
pears to be about 10 or 11 feet, and of neaps about 7 feet.
Hence we see that although the rise and fall of neaps at Ax
mouth     nearly corresponds    with that  of the south coast of
Cornwall, yet there is a difference of six feet in the compari
son of spring tides; this appears strongly corroborative of
the idea of the tide currents operating in the way I men
tion.
     By a reference to the table of contemporaneous observa
tions of the tides (plate 2.) accompanying the paper referred to
in the Transactions of the British Association, it will be seen
that the high- and low-water marks at Plymouth are so placed
that the line of mean tide shall about coincide with that of
the tides at Axmouth. There appears to be no authority for
this, as it does not appear that any levels have been extended
to Plymouth.      For the reasons as above stated, I should con
clude that the high-water mark at Axmouth would probably
be higher than #. high water at Plymouth; but supposing
it the same, then in the series of tides observed, would the
mean level at Plymouth be at neaps nearly one foot, and at
springs nearly two feet lower than at Axmouth; and be it
remembered that the greatest rises at Plymouth, as stated in
this table, are only 14 feet, which I should consider as much
less than the average rise of spring tides there, seeing that on
the neighbouring coast of Cornwall it is nearly three feet
more.      I should also think that the high water at Axmouth
  is more elevated than at Falmouth; but if it be only at the
same level, then will the mean-tide mark be three feet higher
at Axmouth than at Falmouth.
     In the tide-table above referred to, it appears that the
 mean-tide line at King-Road is about one foot above that at
 Axmouth. In this comparison the greatest tides observed
at King-Road rise about 36 feet, in which series the greatest
 difference of mean-tide level does not amount to one foot.
 Other tides appear by the table to have been observed there,
 some of which had a rise of 41 feet, and the range of mean
 tide differed as much as two feet and a half. In the year 1815,
 as before stated, I observed a series of tides at King-Road,
 which ranged from a rise of 19 feet to a rise of 46 feet, dif
fering in their respective elevations of mean tide as much as
33 feet; the greatest tide rising from 0 on the scale to 46

feet, and the smallest from            10 to 29 feet; the differences in
the levels        of     low water being 10 feet, and of high water 17
feet.
   Had the differences between the levels of low water of spring
tides and of neap tides at King-Road and at the Land's-end
been about the same, we might be led to conclude              that                                        all
the difference of rise and fall would have been due            the                          to            in
creased elevation        high      of

constantly coming out less on returning to them than on
leaving them, which the operator suspects might have hap
pened from the alterations of refraction.  But surely he could
easily have detected errors arising from such source by look
ing again at the back staff after he had observed the elevation
on the fore staff.
   To say nothing of the absurdity of supposing that the re
fraction was always decreasing during the survey, which it
must have been to have brought about such results, the                                        di
stances   from the instrument to the staff (44 fathoms) were
so small,   that even supposing every day during the hours of
work the refraction should at first have amounted to an angle
equal to half the contained arc of the earth's surface, and
should have decreased to nothing by the time the day's work
was ended, and allowing a quarter of an hour to elapse be
tween taking the back and fore observations, the error arising
from refraction would not have amounted to half an inch on
the whole distance from Portishead to Axmouth; nor would
the daily shrinkage in the length of the staffs account for                                    it,

Blood from a prick of the tail.
  140. Ring-tailed Lemur, (Lemur catta,)           an adult male.
All the  following sizes common,   1-4000th,   1-3840th,   1-3644th,
1-3600th, 1-3557th, 1-3429th of an inch. Extreme diameters
 1-6000th and 1-3000th.      There were several corpuscles about
 1-8000th of an inch in diameter, but it is doubtful whether
these were true blood disks.
   The size of the corpuscles was altogether remarkably irre
gular.    The blood was obtained from a prick of the ear: the
animal was apparently not very healthy.
   In some blood obtained from another full-grown male, a
few hours after death, the corpuscles were also very irregular
in size, but the most abundant disks were chiefly of small and
large dimensions, the former being generally 1-5000th of an
inch in diameter, and the latter 1-3500th. There were also
a few about 1-7000th of an inch, and also some as large as
 1-3000th.     The majority, however, were the small and large
kinds first noted, with but very few intermediate gradations.
The smaller corpuscles presented a remarkably dark and
distinct outline.    Blood from the heart, from the coronary
 veins, as well as from the renal and mesenteric veins.

grown male. The following diameters                   all

 1-3555th of an inch.        Extreme diameters 1-5333rd and
1-3200th.
   Blood from     a    wound    of   the   tail; also from       a      prick    of   the
hand.
  In  the Lemurs the corpuscles were remarkable                being        as
                                                             or is be                  of by

notice that most       of
                       the animals were more          less diseased,
and died very rapidly, chiefly             of
                                     tubercular consumption,                           in
connection with which the blood particles were perhaps more
or less modified.
  In   the black-fronted Lemur (141.) the disks appeared,

                       two trials made       different times,

and 1-4000th of an inch.
   Blood from a vein of the ear, also from a prick of the velvet
of the young growing antler. The corpuscles obtained from
these different parts were identical in size and appearance.
   A recent examination of the blood corpuscles of some va
rieties of the common sheep (42.) gave the following results.
   a. A four-horned Sheep from North Africa.
   b. A two-horned hairy variety from Africa, presented to
the Zoological Society by the Duke of Sutherland.
   c. A hairy variety from Demerara.
   All the above were full-grown males, and the blood was
obtained from small incisions of the lips. The corpuscles in
the different varieties appeared to be of the same size; the
most frequent diameters being 1-6000th, 1-5615th, 1-5331st,
and 1-5028th.     Extreme sizes 1-7110th and 1-4570th of an

the air, previous to the descent of the aerolite, and which was at
tended by a blue stream of smoke, extending from north to west.
Some of the fragments which had been seen to fall, and which had
penetrated into the earth, were picked up by the witnesses.       One
of them falling on grass caused it to smoke ; and was too hot to ad
mit of being touched. The mass which was sent to England by
H.M.S. Scout, weighed, when first picked up, four pounds. The
paper is accompanied by a map of the district, showing the course
of the aerolite.
    A paper was also read, entitled, “An account of the Shooting
Stars of 1095 and 1243;” by Sir Francis Palgrave, K.H., F.R.S., &c.
    The author gives citations from several chronicles of the middle
ages, descriptive of the remarkable appearance of shooting stars which
occurred on the 4th of April, 1095, on the testimony of independent
witnesses both in France and England.     One of them describes them
as “falling like a shower of rain from heaven upon the earth:” and in
another case, a bystander, having noted the spot where the aerolite
fell, “cast water upon       which was raisedit,  steam, with    great        in                         a

a thin plate of any transparent substance, the edge being turned

Messrs. Dunlop and Sulivan are discussed in this view; and the
value of results obtained under circumstances of due precaution is
pointed out by their success.
   The position of the lines on the land portion of the map is derived
from 120 determinations in various parts of Europe, Africa, and
America, between the years 1834 and 1839, of which about the
half are now first communicated.
   The series of Messrs. Dunlop and Sulivan contain also observa
tions of the magnetic intensity made at sea; Mr. Dunlop's by the
method of horizontal vibrations, and Lieut. Sulivan's by the instru
ment and method devised by Mr. Fox. The degree of precision
which may be obtained by experiments thus conducted, is shown by
the comparison of these observations with each other, and with the
isodynamic lines previously derived from observations made on
land.
    The first section of this paper concludes with discussions on the
relative positions of the lines of least intensity and of no dip, and
of the secular change which the latter line has undergone in the ten
years preceding 1837.
    In the second section, the observations of Mr. Dunlop are combined
with recent observations on the coasts of Australia, by Captains
FitzRoy, Bethune, and Wickham, of the Royal Navy, to furnish a
first approximation to the position and direction of the isodynamic
lines over that portion of the Indian ocean which is comprised be
tween the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope and New South
Wales.

where, in consequence of disease of the bodies of the vertebrae, the an
terior columns of the spinal chord, and anterior roots of the nerves
were affected, and paralysis of the muscles to which those nerves are
distributed was produced, while the posterior column of the cord was
uninjured, and the sensibility unimpaired. The author next consi
ders the respiratory system of nerves, which he regards as being
both muscular and sensitive, and describes as arising from a tract of
the spinal cord, on the outside of the corpus olivare, and anterior to
the processus ad cerebellum ; and which constitute columns having
no decussations with one another, as is the case with the other
systems.        The conclusion he originally formed, that both the phre
nic and the spinal accessory nerves are provided for motion, which
he had deduced from the anatomical fact of the former taking a di
rect course to the diaphragm, and the latter a circuitous one for the
purpose of associating the muscles of the respiratory organs with
those which act on the chest,                    is,

interspace nearly equal to the antero-posterior diameter of the first
molar. The second and remaining molars are in close juxtaposition.
The third and fourth molars form the principal difference between
 the dentition of the present genus and that of the Chaeropotamus,
 being larger and more complex in the grinding surface. They
 present a sudden increase in size and change of form.               The
 plane of the crown is triangular, with the base outwards, and the
posterior and inner side convex: it supports three principal cusps,
 two on the outer, and one on the inner side ; there are also two
 smaller elevations with a depression on the summit of each, situated
 in the middle of the crown, and the whole is surrounded with a ridge
 which is developed into a small cusp at the anterior and external
 angle of the tooth. The three true molars closely correspond with
 those of the Chaeropotamus. The sockets of the canines indicate
 that these teeth were relatively as large as in the peccari.
    The bones of the head are separately described: the palatal
 processes of the maxillary bones are shown to be rugous, as in the
peccari; the eye to have been full and large, as indicated by the size
of the optic foramen and the capacity of the orbit, equalling an inch
in vertical diameter: the general form of the skull is described as
partaking of a character intermediate between that of the hog and
 the hyrax, though the large size of the eye must have given to the
physiognomy of the living animal a resemblance to that of the Ro
dentia.
    These indications, Mr. Owen says, scanty though they be, of the
 form of a species nearly allied to the Chaeropotamus, are extremely
 interesting, on account of the absence of similar information regard
ing that genus. The resemblance of the molar division of the
 dental system in the new genus, for which the name of Hyracothe
 rium is proposed, and the Chaeropotamus, is sufficiently close to
 warrant the conclusion, that the canines and incisors if not similar
would differ only in form and proportion; and that hence it may be
 ventured to solve analogically some of the doubts entertained by
 Cuvier respecting the dental characters of the Chaeropotamus, and
to affirm confidently that it had canines in the upper as well as the
lower jaw.      The incisor teeth with the ossa intermaxillaria are
wanting in the specimen of the Hyracotherium, and have not been
found in any fragment of the Chaeropotamus.
    2. The remains of birds described in the paper consist of a sternum,
with other bones, and a sacrum, the former belonging to the collec
tion of the late John Hunter, in the Royal College of Surgeons,
and the latter to the cabinet of Mr. Bowerbank.        Both the speci
 mens were obtained from     Sheppey.    The Hunterian fossil includes
the sternum nearly entire, the proximal ends of the coracoid bones,
a dorsal vertebra, the distal end of the left femur, the proximal end
of the corresponding tibia, and a few fragments of ribs. Mr. Owen
first shows, in approximating to which of the three great groups of
birds, terrestrial, aerial, or aquatic, the Ornitholite belonged, that
from the length of the sternum and the remains of the primary         in

                           Geological Society.                        151
termuscular crest or keel, it could not have been a strictly terrestrial
bird, though these characters do not prove that it was a bird of
flight, as they occur in the Penguins or other Brachyptera, which
have need of muscular forces to work their wings as paddles under
water.    In the present fossil, however, from the lateral extent
and convexity of the sternal plate, the presence and course of
the secondary intermuscular ridges, the commencement of the keel
a little way behind the anterior margin of the sternum, Mr. Owen
says there is no affinity with the brachypterous family.      The cora
coid bones or posterior clavicles, he also shows are less available in
determining the habits of the Ornitholite, as they relate much more
closely to the respiratory actions than to the movements of the
wings, and are strongly developed even in the Apteryx. There re
mained consequently for comparison the ordinary birds of flight;
and of these, the native species, which resemble the fossil in size,
first claimed Mr. Owen's attention.        Though the sternum is not
complete, yet sufficient remains to have enabled him to set aside the
 Gallinaceous, and those Grallatorial and Passerine birds which have
deeply incised sternums, and to restrict the field of comparison to
such species as have the sternum either entire, or with shallow pos
terior emarginations.     After a rigid comparison of the minor struc
tural details and   pursuing  it from the sea gulls and other aquatic
birds  upwards  through  the Grallatorial and Passerine orders, omitting
few British species, and no genus, he at length found the greatest
number of correspondences in the skeleton of the accipitrine spe
cies.   The resemblance, however, was not sufficiently close to ad
mit of the fossil being referred to any native genus of Raptores: the
breadth of the proximal end of the coracoid removes it from the
owls (Strigidae), the shaft of the same bone is too slender for the
Falconidae; and the femur and tibia are relatively weaker than in
many of the British Hawks or Buzzards.          It is with the Vultures
that Mr. Owen has found the closest agreement; but he says the
fossil indicates a smaller species than any known to exist in the
present day, and is probably a distinct subgenus.
    The professed ornithologist, Mr. Owen remarks, may receive
with reasonable hesitation a determination of family affinities arrived
at, in the absence of the usual characters deduced from the beak
and feet; but in the course of a long series of close comparisons, he
says, he has met with so many more characters, both appreciable and
available in the present problem, than he anticipated, that he confi
dently expects, in the event of the mandibles, the bones of the feet,
or the entire sternum of the bird in question being found, they will
establish his present conclusion, that the Sheppey ornitholite is re
ferrible to a member of the group of Accipitrine Scavengers, so
abundant in the warmer latitudes of the present world.
   The Ornitholite in Mr. Bowerbank's museum consists of ten sa
cral vertebrae anchylosed together, as is usual in birds with a con
tinuous keel-like spinal ridge.     Four of the vertebrae are analogous
to the lumbar vertebrae in the mammalia, and they are succeeded by
five others, in which, as in the Vultures, the inferior transverse pro

cesses are not developed.        This character, however, Mr. Owen says,
is not  peculiar   to the Vulturidae.       Though the part of the fossil pre
served is   eminently    characteristic of the class of birds, yet it is not
calculated to throw light on the closer affinities of the species to
which it belongs: nevertheless it supports rather than affects the
determination of the Hunterian specimen.                For the apparently ex
tinct bird indicated by these fossils, the name of Lithornis vulturinus
is provisionally proposed.
    3. Mr. Owen commences his description of the remains of an ex
tinct species of Serpent found at Sheppey, by pointing out the es
sential characters by which the vertebrae of an Ophidian Reptile are
distinguished.
    Vertebrae joined enarthrodially by a deep anterior transversely
oblong cup and a corresponding prominent posterior ball, and fur
ther articulated by projecting posterior oblique processes, wedged
like the carpenter's tenon into a mortice, excavated in the anterior
oblique processes of the succeeding vertebra, supporting moreover
on each side of the fore part of the body an oblong convexity for
the moveable articulation of the rib, can belong, Mr. Owen ob
serves, to no other than a reptile of the Ophidian order.
    One of the specimens described in this portion of the memoir,
consists of about 30 vertebrae possessing the above characters; also
of a number of long slender ribs, having expanded concave vertebral
extremities cemented irregularly together by a mass of indurated
clay, and it forms part of the Hunterian collection of fossils; an
other specimen, consisting of 28 vertebrae, and some others of less
magnitude, belong to Mr. Bowerbank's collection.                 All the speci
mens, Mr. Owen considers, are referrible to the same species, and
they were      allfound      Sheppey.
                            at
    The vertebrae      in each specimen present the same conformation,
 and nearly the same size, being equal             this respect
                                                        in           those       to           of    a

 from Crotalus, Coluber, Naja and Trigonocephalus.                    The long
 and comparatively narrow spine, the outward prolongation                      the          of

                                              of
 distinguish these Ophidian vertebrae from those               any other genus
                                                                       of
of   the order with which Mr. Owen has been able                 compare them.

none of the differences above noticed indicating any obstacle to the

the length (11 feet) which it may be inferred the creature attained,
Mr. Owen concludes it was not provided with poisonous fangs.
 Serpents of similar dimensions exist in the present day only in
 tropical regions, and their food consists principally of the warm
 olooded animals. Mr. Owen therefore in conclusion states, that had
 no evidence been obtained of birds or mammals in the London clay,
he would have felt persuaded that they must have coexisted with
the Palaeophis Toliapicus.

      Feb. 24.—A communication was read, entitled, “Justification of
  Mrs. Somerville's Experiments upon the magnetizing Power of the
  more refrangible solar Rays”.”        By George James Knox, Esq. and
  the Rev. Thomas Knox.
      Professor Morichini of Rome was the first to observe that steel,
  when exposed to the violet rays of the solar spectrum, becomes
  magnetic.       Similar experiments were tried by Mr. Christie in 1824;
  but the most accurate experiments upon this subject have been per
  formed by Mrs. Somerville in 1825, who determined that not only
  violet, but indigo, blue and green, develope magnetism in the ex
  posed end of a needle, while yellow, orange, and red produce no
  sensible effect. As many philosophers have failed in repeating these
  experiments, we were induced, in the course of the summer, to un
  dertake the investigation of this subject, “which has so often dis
  turbed science.”       Having procured several hundred needles, of dif
  ferent lengths and thicknesses, and having ascertained that they
   were perfectly free from magnetism, we enveloped them in white
   paper, leaving one of their extreme ends uncovered. Taking ad
  vantage of a favourable day for trying experiments upon the che
   mical ray, (known by the few seconds required to blacken chloride
   of silver,) we placed the needles at right angles to the magnetic
   meridian, and exposed them for three hours, from eleven to one, to
   the differently refrangible rays of the sun, under coloured glasses.
   Those beneath the red, orange, and yellow, showed no trace of mag
   netism, while those beneath the blue, green, and violet, exhibited,
   the two first feeble, but the last strong traces of magnetism.
       To determine how far the oxidating power of the violet ray is
   concerned in the phaenomena, we exposed to the different coloured
   lights needles whose extremities had been previously dipped in nitric
   acid, and found that they became magnetic (the exposed end having
   been made a north pole) in a much shorter time than the others,

   and that this effect was produced in a slight degree under the red
   (when exposed a sufficient length of time), strongly under white
   glass; and so strong under violet glass, that the effect took place
   even when the needles were placed in such a position along the
   magnetic meridian, as would tend to produce, by the earth's       in
   fluence, a south pole in the exposed extremity.
       Conceiving that the inactive state produced in iron (as observed
  by Schoenbein) when plunged into nitric acid, sp. gr. 1-36, or by
  being made the positive pole of a battery, or by any other means,
  might throw some light upon the nature of the electrical change
  produced, experiments were instituted to this effect, which showed
  that no trace of magnetism could be thereby produced.

made a communication       respecting certain geological phaenomena of
elevation, and their probable connexion with the existence of vol
canos.      When a district is traversed by a number of faults of
which the directions are nearly parallel, and the planes of which de
viate (as is generally the case) from verticality, the mass contained
between any two adjoining faults will form a perfect or truncated
wedge, according as the line in which the planes of the faults, or
those planes produced intersect, lies within or without the elevated
mass. A double system of wedges will thus be formed, of which

                    Cambridge Philosophical Society.                  155
one part will have their thicker portions upwards and the other
downwards.       The latter will manifestly be acted on respectively by
elevating forces greater in proportion to their mass than the former,
supposing the uplifting force to act uniformly over the lower surface
of the mass; and consequently after the fissures are produced by
the elevation and extension of the mass, the lower system of wedge
will be forced upwards more than the upper one, and thus the two
systems will be relatively displaced in such a manner as to bring
thicker portions of them in contact than in their original positions.
The two systems being thus jammed into each other, the uplifted
mass will be supported as an arch, provided the abutments on which
the extremities rest be sufficiently firm to support the pressure thus
thrown upon them.
   If we conceive a vertical line to be drawn downwards from any
point in which the plane of a fault meets the earth's surface, the
line will not generally coincide with the plane; and it is found that
the relative displacement of the portions of the mass on opposite
sides of the fault is usually such, that that portion in which the
above vertical line lies appears most elevated.
   Mr. Phillips has established this law by numerous observations,
as a very general one. In considering the relative positions of the
two systems of wedges above-described, after their displacement, it
will easily be seen how simply this law is generally thus accounted
for.
   It thus appears, also, how great horizontal forces, and conse
quently great horizontal displacements may be produced, for which
it would be difficult perhaps so easily to account in any other
manner.
   Mr. Hopkins explained the probable bearing of the above views
on the theory of volcanos in the following manner. The tempera
ture of the earth, in accordance with actual observations at com
paratively small depths, may be such at the depth of twenty or
thirty miles, as would under the pressure of the atmosphere fuse
most of the substances composing the surface of the globe.             No
complete fusion, however, of the matter of the earth at the above
depth can take place, because it is shown by the observed amount
of precession, that the thickness of the earth's solid crust must at
least be much greater than that quantity.          This apparent discre
pancy can only be removed, it would seem, by supposing pressure
an antagonist cause with reference to heat considered as the cause
of fluidity.    This still requires the verification of experiment, but
here   assuming    it to be true, it is easily seen how the crust of the
earth   may  be  generally   solid to any depth, while portions of it may
be   necessarily  fluid, from the removal of the superincumbent press
ure   by the formation over it of an arch or a dome in the manner
above described.

                            URINE OF THE ELEPHANT.
  T is   shown by the experiments of MM. John and Vogel, that the
    urine of the elephant does not contain benzoic, but hippuric acid.
M. Brandes has examined it and has obtained the same results, and
his experiments prove that it contains a notable quantity of hippuric
acid, and he procured it perfectly pure.
   He found in this urine:
   Hippuric acid combined with urea (hippurate of urea).
   An azotized extractive matter, soluble in water and in alcohol.
   Traces of a fatty matter and of a black resinous substance.
   Hippurate of potash.            Carbonate of lime.
   Chloride of potassium.          Phosphate of lime.
   Sulphate of potash.             Carbonate of magnesia.
   Carbonate of ammonia.           Mucus.
The urine of the elephant does not then form an exception to the
constitution of herbivorous animals; and M. Brandes concludes from
his experiments, that the urea is combined with acid, as demon
                                             -
strated by the researches of MM. Cap and O. Henry. The ele
phant's urine contains a considerable quantity of earthy salts.—

   The properties of acechlor-platina are, that when dry it is                                                    in
odorous, has a metallic astringent taste, burns on the approach of a
taper, with a greenish flame, and leaves metallic platina; when heated
in a glass vessel by means of an oil-bath, it supports a heat of 383°
Fahr. without emitting any odour and without apparent change;
but when heated to about 3979, it begins to blacken and to yield
an acid and penetrating odour. At 437°, in one experiment, the whole
was converted into a black mass, with the disengagement of acid
vapours, and a peculiar smell.    After a heat gradually increased to
5720 Fahr., it appeared to yield no further odour; and when heated
to redness it gave only a slight acid smell. The residue is perfectly
black before contact with the air, nor do any metallic particles after
wards appear in            it.

     AVING      read with much care Mr. Weaver's paper
       published in successive Numbers of the Philosophical
Magazine, relative to the mineral structure of the south of
Ireland, &c., in which he endeavours to support his own
viewst in opposition to mine, respecting the order of succes
sion of the rocks, and the geological position to which each
is referable, I think it incumbent on me briefly to reply to
those views and statements, which are quite inconsistent with
facts carefully observed by me, and represented in my large
geological map, as well as in several sections, exhibiting what
appears to me to be the true order of succession of the strata
of the south of Ireland: some of these sections have been
published in the Journal of the Geological Society of Dublint,
and others in the Numbers of this Magazine for March last.
   As the boundaries of the several rock districts as repre
                        ...?
sented on the map, and their relative positions as exhibited in
the sections, differ materially from those published by Mr.
 Weaver, they are               by him to be imaginative com
positions, and consequently unworthy of credit; but        hope   I
to be able to   prove  that my map  and sections are founded
 solely on a careful observation of facts, and in no case from
 hypothetical deductions.

    It is quite true that in the counties of Waterford, Cork and
Kerry, I have made considerable changes in the colouring of
my large geological map of Ireland, as compared with the
small one appended to the Second Report of the Irish Railway
Commissioners; but I should observe that, at the period of
the publication of that map, and of the condensed Outline
of the Geology of Ireland which accompanied                          enter               it,

 the same geological position, and presenting the same mineral
 character and composition (as in the Monavoullagh and Knock
 mildown mountains, and other portions of the counties of
 Waterford, Cork and Kerry) were coloured as belonging to
 the upper portion of the transition series.   The investigation
 which led to this change having been very extensive and
 minute, enabled me to make numerous corrections in the detail
 of the outlines of the rock districts throughout the southern
 counties, and I think it right firmly to assert that every one
 of those subdivisions to which Mr. Weaver has applied the
 term gratuitous, has been the result of careful observations
laid down on the spot, on a map on a large scale. Whether
the subdivisions of the strata I have made may or may not
 eventually be considered as indicative of the boundary of
distinct formations, still they will be valuable as indicating
the boundaries of different rocks presenting distinct mineral
characters and fossil remains. Thus, in my map and sections
I  have endeavoured to represent with accuracy the relative
positions of the several rocks as they occur in geological se
quence, and when a more correct nomenclature shall be esta
blished, it can be applied to both without difficulty and with
out altering a single line.
    Mr. Greenough, in his introductory memoir to the new
edition of his geological map of England, has classed the old
red sandstone with the graywacke formation, and has quoted
from Dr. M'Culloch's System of Geology, the characters
of the formation as exhibited in Scotland, which he thinks
are equally just when applied to the west of England, and in
my opinion correspond very accurately with those of Ireland,
particularly of the south; but          I
                                   still adhere to the propriety
of separating these strata from the transition class on account
of their almost universal unconformability”, which forms a
stronger line of distinction between the transition slate and
the old red series than we find between the old red and the
strata which succeed        where it,       no
                                        unconformability     ob          is
served, each suite,       the ascending series, succeeding the
                              in
                                                                             up
                                                                    is far
other     regular succession without any break,
           as in                                               as            at
least    the new red sandstone; consequently, there       really
more difficulty     determining the line between the old red
                        in
sandstone and the carboniferous limestone series, than between
it and the transition slatet.

   As to the term old red sandstone, I agree with most others
in thinking it objectionable ; but if this rock occurs in similar
positions and presents similar mineral characters in the west
of England, in Scotland, and in Ireland, a local name, as
“Devonian,” cannot be considered suitable, and the provin
cial term killas, recommended by Mr. Greenough, though
preferable, as not indicating any particular locality, does not
appear to be applicable to a general series of rocks.

    Instead       of

refer    to
          the  geological   structure         the south of   Ireland, with  of
the large geological map, Mr. Weaver has compared them
with the small map, and the “Geological Outline” which
accompanied            it;
                     we need not therefore               surprised     be  his                at
observing differences and incongruities, and through them
attempting         throw discredit
                     to                                 on
                                              everything which          have            I
done.
    Itis true that Mr. Weaver has introduced notes                   several            in

        to the Mineral Structure of the South of Ireland.    165
places referring to the large geological map, in the first of
which he states, “that his paper was drawn up before he
had seen another geological map on a large scale, published
in 1839;” and he observes, “that as the alterations that have
been made in the new map do not materially interfere with
the course of his argument, which in the first instance bears
on the map attached to the outline, he has left the text un
altered.”    Now in his text Mr. Weaver does not confine his
observations to the outline and small geological map, but re
fers equally to the three papers read by me before the British
Association, and the Geological Societies of London and
Dublin, the whole being compared with the small geological
map, though at the period of the publication of his paper in
April 1840, my large geological map had been in the posses
sion of the London Geological Society for eleven months,
and was to be seen exhibited in Mr. Gardner's, in Regent
Street, for upwards of a year; so that it does appear extra
ordinary, that Mr. Weaver, who in the commencement of his
paper alludes to my several communications above-men
tioned, in each of which my large geological map is men
tioned, should not have seen it when he drew up his paper
for the Philosophical Magazine.
   With this explanation I will conclude my observations on
the subject of the discrepancies noticed by Mr. Weaver be
tween my small geological map, and the sections and papers
intended to illustrate the large one.
   In comparing Mr. Weaver's geological map of the south
of Ireland with mine (the large one), it must be admitted
that the differences are very considerable, both in the great
scale and in the detail. The latter is not to be wondered at,
   I
as possessed much better maps, and had many opportunities
of examination in almost every locality; but in regard to the
great features, some explanation appears to be necessary.
Mr. Weaver considers the whole of the schistose strata        si
tuated to the south of the river Suire in the county of Water
ford, and thence to the south coast of the county of Cork, to
belong to the transition series, on the northern part of which,
particularly on the summits of the Knockmildown and Mona
voullagh mountains, strata belonging to the old red sandstone
series are superimposed in an unconformable position; and
that the limestone of the valleys of the rivers Suire and Black
water belong to the carboniferous series, while that of the
valleys of the rivers Bride, Lee, &c. is transition, and alter
nates with the transition slate.
   According to my view, the transition slate within the above
mentioned limits is confined to the dark gray slate district

166        Mr. R. Griffith on Mr. Weaver's Paper relative
 south of the conglomerate of the valley of the Suire and east of
 that of the Monavoullagh mountains; while the conglomerate
 of these mountains rests unconformably on the slate strata to
 the north and east, and dipping to the southward, forms the
 substratum or base of the whole of the arenaceous, quartzose
 and schistose strata to the southward; and consequently, as

long sections this        most important,

placed one beneath the other, by which means the continuity
is broken.
    Suppose the scale of height adopted for a section of a
mountainous district be 2000 feet to an inch, and the distance
between the termini be 100 miles, on equal scales, the length
of such a section would be 22 feet; while by adopting a scale
of 8 to 1 for the height, the length would be but 2 feet 9 in.,
and if carefully constructed the latter would give as clear a re
presentation of the structure of the country as the other.
    In regard to the second point, namely, the accuracy of my
sections, Mr. Weaver observes, “that they appear to him in
many respects drawn rather according to the conceptions of
their author, than the occurrences in nature.”               This is cer
tainly not complimentary; but as my sections through the
same district differ in many important points from those made
by Mr. Weaver,

    We    may next consider the Monavoullagh conglomerate,
which in his map Mr. Weaver shows as an insulated tract,
surrounded by transition slate; I, on the contrary, show in
my section a precipitous escarpment to the north, but a gra
dual declivity towards the south and south-west.             If Mr.
Weaver be correct, his conglomerate, which he represents as
a mountain cap, must rest unconformably on the transition
slate on the south as well as on the north side; now,          posi        I
tively assert that such is not the fact, but that the   alternating
series of red clayslate and conglomerate, which presents so
striking an escarpment on the north face of the mountain
range, forms the lower part of the red slate series, and that pro
ceeding from the summit of Crotty's rock to the southward we
regularly ascend in the series, till at length in approaching
the Blackwater near Lismore, we meet the yellow sandstone
with calamites, which in so many localities alternates with the
                                       I
carboniferous limestone, that have been induced to consider
it rather as the lowest member of the carboniferous limestone
than the upper part of the old red sandstone series*.           Now
    I
if am right in this position, what becomes of Mr. Weaver's
mountain cap, or of the occurrence of the old transition slate
to the southward of the Monavoullagh mountains? As an ad
ditional proof of the correctness of my views on the subject,
I  have made a careful examination of the district within the
last month, and have prepared a plan which has been con
structed with great care, and which, I think, will set the
matter at rest.
    The plan represents that portion of the county of Water
 ford extending from Ballyvoil Head in a western direction,
 along the valley of the Ballyvoil river to Gloundolgan, a                          di
stance of four miles, and southward from thence to Dungar
van.     In this district we have the unconformable outgoing of
the conglomerate of the Monavoullagh mountains, extending in
an eastern direction without interruption to the coast at Bally
voil Head. Now Mr. Weaver statest in his paper, “that
there is no apparent connexion whatever between the horizon
 tal sandstone and conglomerate          the Monavoullagh range
                                           of
and those beds          conglomerate
                           of          and red slate             of
                                                          the coast
 which continue eastward from Dungarvan           several separate
                                                       in
discontinuous bands interstratified with the other transition
 rocks.”     Inopposition     this opinion, beg
                                 to             I    state, that the

                          red clayslate and conglomerate         the           of
 Monavoullagh escarpment, does extend uninterruptedly from
 Crotty's rock        to
                    the shore     Ballyvoil Head, where they rest
                                      at
equally     in   unconformable position

        to the Mineral Structure of the South of Ireland.      169
The contact of the conglomerate with the transition        slate is
clearly visible at Island Hubbock, about a quarter of a mile
north of Ballyvoil, Head, and their unconformability is un
questionable, as the conglomerate rests upon the upturned
ends of the slate, and strongly adheres to them.       In illustra
tion of this fact,  I beg to refer to the section No. 1, which
gives an accurate representation of the red slate and conglo
merate strata as they occur, resting unconformably on the
dark gray transition slate, from Island Hubbock westwards.
The succession is as follows:
    1. Unconformable base composed of alternations of black
ish gray and reddish-gray clayslate with chlorite slate and
gray quartz-rock, the blackish-gray clayslate greatly predomi
nating; dip of strata from 10° to 20° east of north, at angles
 varying from 60° to 75°.
    2. Alternations of reddish-gray and red conglomerate, red
 dish-gray compact sandstone, and dark-red slate, the conglo
 merate predominating; dip of strata about 35° west of south,
 at angles varying from 60° to 80°. The thickness of these
 alternating strata is about 300 feet.
     3. Dark reddish-gray clayslate, reddish-gray quartz-rock,
 and sandstone, the slate predominating: thickness about 300
 feet.
    4. Dark red micaceous sandstone, and red clayslate, with
 occasional beds of conglomerate, the sandstone predomina
 ting; dip 25° west of south at angles varying from 60° to 85°:
 thickness about 750 feet.
     5. Dark-red slate, red quartz-rock and sandstone, the slate
 predominating: thickness about 300 feet.
     6. Brownish-red quartzose rock, red clayslate, and yellow
 ish-gray sandstone, the sandstones predominating: dip 20°
 west of south, on an average at an angle of 65°; thickness
 about 600 feet.
     To the south of the yellowish-gray sandstone and red slate
 the strata are concealed from view by diluvial matter for a
 distance of about half a mile, beyond which alternations of
 dark-gray carboniferous slate and limestone are visible, both
 of which contain abundance of fossils belonging to the carbo
  niferous limestone series.
     I  also give a section of the strata as they occur, from the
  unconformable contact of the red slate and conglomerate with
  the transition slate at Gloundolgan, to the coast at Ballyna
 courty in the harbour of Dungarvan, in which the succession
 of the strata between the lower conglomeritic base, the yellow
  sandstone, the carboniferous slate, and superincumbent car
  boniferous limestone are clearly shown.
      Now if we compare these sections with that originally

   170      Mr. R. Griffith   on Mr. Weaver's Paper    relative
  published by me as extending southward from Crotty’s rock in
  the Monavoullagh mountains to Lismore, we find exactly the
  same suite interposed between the conglomerate base and the
  carboniferous limestone of the valley of the river Blackwater.
      It is true, that the distance between Crotty's rock and Lis
  more, is greater than between Gloundolgan and Knockna
  #.          in section No. 2, or between Ballyvoil Head and
     allyvoil bridge, in section No. 1; but it will be observed
  by referring to the plan, that the conglomerate and red slate
  at the coast dip to the south at an angle of 70°; while at
  Gloundolgan, four miles west of Ballyvoil Head, they dip
  south at an angle of 45°; further to the westward the dip is
  south at an angle of 15°; and as we approach the summit of
  the Monavoullagh mountains at Crotty's rock, the strata effect
  a nearly horizontal position.      Owing to this circumstance,
  though the section is complete at Ballyvoil Head in the hori
 zontal distance of one mile and a half, yet between Crotty's
 rock and Lismore the same suite occupies a horizontal           di
  stance of eighteen miles.
      Having stated these facts, I think it unnecessary to do
  more than observe that Mr. Weaver's argument in proof of
 the impossibility of the red slate and conglomerate at Crotty's
 rock composing a part of the same series with the red slate
 and conglomerate of Ballyvoil Head, namely, the nearly hori
 zontal position of the one, and the highly inclined angle of the
 strata of the other, is untenable; and    I confess I am surprised
 at such an argument being used, as every practical geologist
 must be aware of its weakness.
     The northern part of Mr. Weaver's section between the
 Suire and the Blackwater does not take the same line as mine,
 as his crosses over the Knockmildown mountains, and mine
 over the Monavoullagh range situated to the east; but to en
 able me to test the accuracy of his section, I have made one
 nearly in the same line. (See section, No. 3. in the plate.)     If
 we compare this section with Mr. Weaver's, nothing can be
 more dissimilar.       Mr. Weaver's section represents a base of
graywacke slate, which supports unconformably a cap of old
red sandstone; but according to my section, it is evident that
    e entire mountain range belongs to the old red sandstone
 series.    The anticlinal axis is exposed to view in the valley of
the river Ownashad, at Corrignagour, three miles north of
Lismore: it consists of alternations of dark-red slate and dark
red quartzose rock, the slate predominating.          These strata
are succeeded both on the north and south sides of the axis
by beds of brownish-red quartz-rock, red sandstone, and red
clayslate, occasionally associated with fine-grained conglome
rate, a thin bed of which appears at the surface on the south

        to the Mineral Structure of the South           of Ireland.          171
side of the axis at Shrugh, and on the north side at Crooked
 Bridge on the road from Lismore to Clogheen.          In the lower
part of this series the quartz-rock and sandstone predominate,
but in the upper part the red clayslate is the prevailing rock.
    Descending the hill on the north side towards Clogheen,
and on the south towards Lismore, we find the last-mentioned
 rocks succeeded by alternations of gray sandstone and red
 clayslate, beyond which we have the limestone series alter
nating in the commencement with dark-gray clayslate. There
is much diluvial matter at the base of the declivity on the
north side, and in consequence the yellow sandstone with ca
lamites is not visible there; although to the north of Lismore,
at Reaf, and in other parts of both valleys, it may be observed
associated with the dark-gray slate, which alternates with the
lower beds of the carboniferous limestone.
   If  we compare the succession of rocks which form the stra
tification of the Knockmildown mountains, as above described,
with those that occur at Ballyvoil Head and Gloundolgan, it
 would appear that the lowest visible rocks of the Knock
mildown range belong to the upper part of the old red sand
stone suite, which will account for the absence of the thick
beds of conglomerate which abound in the lower part of the
series in the Monavoullagh range, as at Crotty's rock, Gloun
dolgan and Ballyvoil Head.
    In my paper printed in the Journal of the Geological So
ciety of Dublinº,      I
                      have entered so fully into my reasons for
considering that the limestones of the valleys of the Suire, the
Blackwater, the Bride, the Lee, &c., occupy the same geolo
gical position, both by the order of succession of the strata
and by fossils, that I do not think it necessary to discuss the
                                                        I
subject a second time; and conceiving that have shown that
the red slates and conglomerates which overlie the conglo
meritic base at Crotty's rock, at Gloundolgan, and at Bally
voil Head, occupy the entire space between the dark-gra
transition slate and the carboniferous limestone, I think I have
substantiated my case, and shown that the strata situated to the
south of the unconformable junction with the transition slate
of the county of Waterford, do belong to a newer series, to
which, for reasons already given,       I
                                       have applied the name of
old red sandstone in my large geological map, and in the
papers referable to          shall, however, reply
                           it.                           one state

                                         to                     the     of
ridge interposed between the valley           of
                                           the river Blackwater
and the Bride, which,             he
                             observest, “are said        Mr. Grifby
fithto   partake of  similar

172       Mr. R. Griffith   on Mr. Weaver's Paper      relative
side of the Blackwater near Lismore, &c., forming in the
centre of the ridge an anticlinal axis.”      He further observes,
“The anticlinal axis I have not seen, the dip which I observed
being throughout to the south,” &c.
           I
    Now must assert that the anticlinal axis does erist, and is
clearly visible in the section of the strata of this ridge, which
is exposed to view on the west bank of the river Blackwater,
which in this locality takes a southern course, and cuts through
the ridge between Killahally, opposite to Dromana Castle on
the north, and Camphire on the south, as may be clearly
seen by reference to my large geological map.            The anti
clinal axis is visible nearly in the centre between Camphire
and Killahally, the strata at the axis and on either side con
sisting of alternations of red quartzose rock and red clayslate,
which are succeeded both on the north and south by alterna
tions of gray quartz-rock and red slate, those to the north
dipping north at angles varying from 60° to 85°, and those
to the south dipping at angles varying from 35° to 40°.
These strata are succeeded on the south side by yellow sand
stone containing calamites, and lastly, by alternations of lime
stone and black clayslate.        On the north side the yellow
sandstone is not   visible, owing to a covering of diluvial matter,
but the limestone alternating with black clayslate is visible
immediately to the north of Killahally, dipping to the north
at an angle of 60°; consequently, there can be no doubt of the
identity of the limestone of the valley of the river Blackwater
at Lismore, and thence to Dungarvan, with that of the Bride
 at Tallow, Camphire, &c.
    It is to be observed, that the limestone of the valley of the
Blackwater immediately to the south of Lismore, as repre
sented in my section, published in the Journal of the Geolo
gical Society of Dublin, dips to the south at a very high angle;
but fortunately this is not universally the case, as at Killahally,
three miles south-east of Lismore, the strata, as above-stated,
dip to the north, which in regard to the trough-shape of the
limestone, proves by observation what       I had previously sup
posed to be the case by induction.
   In like manner I am prepared to follow my section in de
tail from the valley of the Bride to the south coast at Cork
Head, and to show that at each point the strata do actually
dip in the direction exhibited on the section; but I must
remark in reference to the section published in the Journal of
the Geological Society of Dublin, that in one point, namely,
on the west side of Cork harbour, the lithographer has re
presented the beds of the carboniferous limestone as abutting
against the subjacent carboniferous slate, while in the original
drawing, as in nature, they are conformable.

  I  shall now make a few remarks with regard to Mr. Wea
ver's section as compared with my own, and particularly with
reference to the position of the limestone of the several troughs
in which it occurs.
   We agree with respect to the limestone of the valleys of the
Suire and the Blackwater, both considering it to be carboni
ferous; but what are the geological circumstances under
which these limestones occur 2 They both rest conformably
on the red slate and conglomerate series, which in the valley
of the Suire Mr. Weaver calls old red sandstone, but in the
valley of the Blackwater transition slate.     In respect to the
latter, I have shown that he is mistaken by means of my ori
ginal section, and the sections from Ballyvoil Head and Gloun
dolgan; but Mr. Weaver in his section exhibits the carboni
ferous limestone of the Blackwater at Lismore in the form of
a trough, the north side dipping to the south, and the south
side to the north, which is not the fact; as in that locality, as
already mentioned, the carboniferous strata dip to the south
on both sides of the valley, on the north side at an angle of
30°, and on the south at an angle of about 60°.
   If  Mr. Weaver had carefully examined the dips of the
strata, he must have observed this fact; and, following the
principle he has adopted in other places, he should have                                in
cluded this limestone in his transition suite; but knowing
this was not the fact, from                 its
                                     connexion with the great lime

                                           his section  truly  represents

 cases,      as the Old Head
                  at                   Kinsale, where the strata are

        unusually compact, the sandstone passes into quartz-rock, but
        it still exhibits the calamites.
           In many localities the carboniferous slate includes beds of
        limestone, which, together with the slate, contains fossils simi
        lar to those which occur in the lower beds of the carboniferous
        limestone.     This is the case at Blackball Head", on the
        north-western extremity of Bantry bay; also at Brickeen island,
        near Killarney; at Kenmaret; at Clonea Castle on the coast

  I  shall next advert to Mr. Weaver's observations respecting
my section which extends from Brandon bay, at the extremity
of the peninsula of Dingle in the county of Kerry, in an east
ern direction across the Cahirconree or Slieve Meesh range
of mountains, thence traversing the limestone valley of Castle
island, and terminating in the great millstone grit of Munster*.
    Of this section, Mr. Weaver observes, “That the portion
which more immediately claims attention, is that which ex
tends from the summit of the old red sandstone of the Slieve
 Meesh range, to the carboniferous limestone of Castle island.
The former is represented as constituting nearly a cap or
 sheet, formed on an inclined plane, from west to east, the
strata corresponding and succeeding each other in that                                                di
rection to the junction with the carboniferous limestone.”
Mr. Weaver further observes, that he “knows of no such
arrangement; on the contrary, the strata of the old red sand
stone are accumulated to a great depth, and certainly, in some
quarters, at least to the level of the sea, being disposed in a
gently arched form from north to south.”
    In the latter observation Mr. Weaver is perfectly correct:
in fact, the Slieve Meesh or Cahirconree range may be com
pared to a semicone, having                base        its
                                                      the west and apexto

outer    edges   alternates with   purple   clayslate;    the   nearly   up

                   these strata are covered              series    byuncon  a         of

and   many   obscure casts of     bivalves,  one of which was named
by Mr. Sowerby as the Avicula modiolaris ". The upper
beds of the sandstone alternate with a dark-gray, and occa
sionally blueish-gray quartzose-rock, and they are succeeded
by dark-gray clayslate, alternating with carboniferous lime
Stone.       hese strata, at Riversville quarry, which              have                 I
lately visited, dip to the east at an angle of 15°. It was here
that Mr. Weaver could discover traces only of the graywacke
formation; now the upper part of the quarry just mentioned
contains thin beds of carboniferous limestone; and imme
diately to the south and east we have large quarries of that
rock partaking of the same strike and dip as the schistose
beds beneath          it,
                    which rest conformably                           on

derlies and alternates with the undoubted carboniferous lime
stone of the valley of Castle island, is precisely similar to
the carboniferous slate which underlies and is interstratified
with the lower beds of the carboniferous limestone at Clonea
Castle, on the east coast of Waterford, near Dungarvan;
it is likewise similar to the rock which alternates with the
limestone of Cork harbour, of Killarney, of Kenmare, and of
many other localities in the south of Ireland; consequently,
as Mr. Weaver persists in the opinion that the limestone
of Cork harbour, of Killarney, of Kenmare, &c., belongs
to the transition series, it would be fatal to his argument
to class the carboniferous slate of Clonea Castle, or of
Currens, with the carboniferous limestone series.       But                                       I
will  observe,  that in the localities just mentioned, beds of
undoubted carboniferous limestone alternate with slate, pre
cisely similar in fossils, as well as in lithological character, to
that of Cork harbour, &c.
     I
     do not think it necessary to pursue this argument further
than to observe, that in endeavouring to form a distinction
between the admitted carboniferous limestone of the valley of
the river Laune, and that of Killarney, and also between the
admitted carboniferous limestone of the valley of the Black
water, below Mallow, and that westward of Clonmeen Castle
                                                      j,
in the same valley, Mr. Weaver has involved himself in an
untenable dilemma.        There is no difference in geological
position, in mineral character, or in fossils, between the lime
stone of Killarney, and that of the valley of the Laune between
Beaufort bridge and Killorglin,               are all contained in
                                                          on
                                      be all
the same valley, and          repose       the same base; and
similar statement    may      made     regard        in
                                                   the limestone      to                         of a

                      of

178     On the Mineral Structure of the South of Ireland.
   It should be observed, that the red conglomerates and red
slates of the district of Killarney are situated on the south side
of the carboniferous limestone valley of Castlemaine, while
those of Cahirconree are on the north side; that the upper
beds of both graduate into the carboniferous limestone series,
at Currens on the north side, and at Brickeen island in the
Lower Lake of Killarney on the south side of the valley. The
unconformability of the conglomerate beds with the transition
series on Cahircomree, and their conformability on McGilla
cuddy's Reeks, the Purple Mountain, &c., is no proof that
the rocks are not identical, as, in England, the old red sand
stone graduates both into the    Silurian and mountain limestone
Series.
   In respect to the fault described by me, the occurrence of
which is doubted by Mr. Weaver, I shall observe, that it is
clearly visible at the Gap of Dunloe and at Brickeen island;
and   I will assert, that the positions of the old red sandstone
strata on one side, and the chloritic rocks on the other, in
both those places, are as clearly indicative of a fault as any I
have ever seen.      On the west side of the Gap of Dunloe, we
have a perpendicular cliff upwards of 200 feet in height,
which is traversed by a nearly upright cut or crack about 20
feet in breadth.     On the south side of this cut we find strata
of dark-green chloritic quartz-rock dipping to the south at
an angle of 30°, while the strata on the north side dip to the
west at an angle of 10°, and are composed of rather fine
grained conglomerate and a red quartzose-rock or compact
sandstone identical with that which lies beneath the red con
glomerate of Cahirconree.        I am of opinion that these ap
pearances do prove that there has been a fault.
    Figure No. 4 in the plate is an accurate representation of
the fault as above described.
    Similar observations are applicable to the appearances at
Brickeen island.       There also, the strata on the south side
of the fault consist of green chloritic rock, having rather a
slaty structure, which dip to the south ; while on the north
side, we have in succession, red quartzose-sandstone and red
slate, red limestone, and yellowish-green slate containing
calamites, abutting obliquely against the chloritic rock on
the north side.
    Towards the conclusion of his paper, Mr. Weaver observes,
“Proceeding now to the Dingle peninsula, the succession
given also by Mr. Griffith from north to south, namely, from
 Brandon bay to Foylaturrive, is as follows: 1st, dark gray
clayslate,” &c. The above sentence is a misquotation from
my paper.      My words are,    “If  we make a section across the

Dingle peninsula, from Foylaturrive on the south to Brandon
bay on the north, we find that the strata consist of a base of
dark blackish-gray clayslate,” &c.     Now by reversing the
points, Mr. Weaver has made the dark gray clayslate to
occur on the north side of the peninsula, namely, at Brandon
bay, while it really occurs on the south: the misquotation was
doubtless unintentional, but as Mr. Weaver's argument was
founded on this misconception, it is unnecessary to reply to                                        it.

dify the opinion on the function of the organic radicals, we
should cite in the first place the important observations of M.
Laurent on the essence of bitter almonds, and those not less
remarkable of M. Piria on the hydruret of salicyle +. To re
sume; nothing hinders me from retaining the name of organic
radicals for certain molecular groups capable of being substi
tuted for elementary bodies which may reciprocally be sub
stituted for them, but these groups may in their turn be mo
dified by substitution, like the other bodies which do not per
form this function.
   I had  a memoir of M. Gehrardt put into my hands, but
too late for me to make use of it in the present notice, in which
these questions are examined        in a manner which appeared to
me   very  worthy    the attention of chemists.
   Nomenclature.—Amongst the questions which are presented
to us as being the immediate consequence of the point of view
which we have just set forth, there is one which deserves par
ticular attention; it has relation to the principle itself of our
chemical nomenclature, and to the modifications which the
progress of the science has led us to make it undergo.
   At the memorable period when the French Atºmician,
under the influence of the immortal discoveries of Lavoisier,
conceived and unfolded the project of a reform in the old che
mical nomenclature, they grounded themselves upon the view
which Lavoisier himself had just established, that           upon the            is,
existence      those undecomposed substances which were recog
                of

of molecular types.
   If    acetic acid is deprived of                   all   its
                                                hydrogen, and chlorine
substituted for that         hydrogen,    we   say   that acetic acid and
chloracetic acid possess the same molecular arrangement, and
that they should possess the same general actions                    long                  so             as

 M. Millon have            well proved; whilst M. Berzelius, relying
                                 so
 on   ingenious researches, was induced                           to
                                                     assert that lime when
  uniting with chlorine gave rise                      to
                                               chlorite.

 the    theory         of

  formulae would possess actions quite opposed                   those which         to
  have been recognized                      by
                                    M. Malaguti.
        In   all
              cases    which the theory
                            in                substitutions and the theory
                                                           of
 of   types see single molecules losing some                              of
                                                          their elements and
   substituting others for them, without the edifice being modi
   fied      in
             its form       its exterior actions, the electro-chemical
                                 or
   theory reduces (dédouble) these same molecules, solely                 must                      we
   say   to find those two antagonist groups, which                afterwards         it
   supposes combined,            virtuein  their reciprocal electrical ac
                                                      of
   tion.
      Thus          my opinion the electro-chemical theory has been
                   in
   drawn out            of
                      the circle which experience traces for us, when
 it   would have explained the new facts                                  of
                                                          organic chemistry.
    But  is   it   to   be
                     asserted that the electrical    properties     bodies are            of

188           M.   Dumas on the Law                    of Substitutions, and      the
without influence on chemical phaenomena? Unquestionably
not: only it must be agreed, that it is at the moment when the
combinations are made, at the moment when they are de
stroyed, that the function (róle) of electricity may be observed.
   But when the elementary molecules have taken their equi
librium, we know not any longer how to define the influence
that their electric properties may exercise, and no one has put
forth views on this subject which agree with experience.
     Ihave then been induced to declare that the facts which I
 have just discovered were irreconcilable with the eleetro-che
 mical theory of M. Berzelius, who considers, hydrogen as                                       al
 ways positive and chlorine always negative, whilst we see them
supply each other's place, and perform the same function.
          I
    But am far from denying, on that account, that the che
 mical and electrical forces may be the same, and there is no
reason to take up the defence of the general function of elec
 tricity in chemical phaenomena, when it is simply a particular
 electro-chemical theory which is under discussion.            What I
 wished to say, what I said,                    is,
                                    that when we have endeavoured
to   represent the electric state                     of
                                      the combined molecules, pure
hypotheses have been attained without any result for the sci
ence.
    When,          on
                 the contrary,              as
                                   has been done       happily       so
                                                                   our                  to by

advantage          of
                 this electricity which shows itself      the moment      at
of  chemical combinations          decompositions, results the most
                                            or
important and the most fruitful have been obtained.
  It     is   this class of facts that the beautiful discoveries of
              in
Davy may               be
                  classed, those which M. Becquerel pursues with
so   much perseverance and success;           fact, the experimental

                                a
     In its
in    true  place      our minds.
                            in
       fact, we have admitted that substitutions may unveil
the molecular grouping          bodies    furnishing
                                          of               by equa               a    set   of

190            M. Dumas                on the   Law of Substitutions,
tions   of condition which the general formula ought to satisfy.
Now it is evident that the metamorphosing actions are often
nothing but means for operating substitutions, by taking ad
vantage of affinities more complicated than those which are
made use of in the ordinary substitutions.
   It is therefore more than ever requisite to apply to the
study of the actions of bodies, and not to trouble ourselves
about the distance which often separates the point from which
we started from that which we reach; for it may well happen,
that these two points, so unlike in their properties, are really
united to each other by the theory of substitutions, and belong
to the same molecular grouping.
  The law of substitutions expresses, then,         a simple experi
mental    relation; it is limited to the  expression    of a relation
often observed between the hydrogen lost and the chlorine
absorbed, by a hydrogenated body submitted to the action
of chlorine. This law establishes only, that if the substance
loses 1, 2, 3 equivalents of hydrogen, it will gain 1, 2, 3 equi
valents of chlorine; but it does not explain this fact.
   The theory of types goes further; it explains what the law
of substitutions is content to determine. It considers organic
bodies as being formed of particles, which may be displaced
and have their places supplied by others without the body
being destroyed, so to speak.       In the cases above-quoted, the
molecule of acetic acid, that of aether, may lose hydrogen and
                                                                        j
take chlorine, without ceasing to constitute an acid or basic
molecule, formed of the same number of equivalents and en
dowed with the same number of fundamental properties.
    It is then because, that on pain of being destroyed, the mo
lecule of acetic acid must take an equivalent of chlorine to
stand for the equivalent of hydrogen which it loses, that this
substitution, this remplacement is effected.     Thus it is that the
 theory of types explains the law of substitutions.
    The substitution of one element for another, equivalent for
 equivalent, is the effect; the preservation of the type is the
 cause. The organic molecule, the organic type, constitute an
 edifice, in which a course (assise) of hydrogen can have                                 its
 place supplied           by
                        course
                           a      chlorine, of bromine,      of  oxy        or      of
 gen, without the exterior relations                  of
                                          that edifice being thereby

modified. But        necessary, when the course
                          it
                          is

nomena;     and to explain by a last word the meaning which
I  attach to their respective functions,             I
                                              shall say that in
chemistry the nature of the molecules, their weight, their form
and their situation, must each exercise a real influence on the
properties of bodies.
   It is the influence of the nature of molecules that Lavoisier
has so well defined, it is that of their weight which Berzelius
has characterized by his immortal labours.      It might be said
that the discoveries of Mitscherlich relate to the influence of
their form, and the future will prove whether the present        la
bours of the French chemists are destined to give us the key
to the function which belongs to their position.
   We subjoin to the preceding memoir by M. Dumas, a
translation of an extract of a letter from M. Baudrimont,
published in the Comptes Rendus, for March 16.
     “M.  Dumas says, that the law of substitutions, and the
theory of chemical types, are unconcerned in the reclama
tions of M. Baudrimont, who does not admit them. This re
quires an explanation from me.
     “I cannot admit M. Dumas's law of substitutions; first,
because it has not the character of a physical law; secondly,
because it is but the strict expression of an order of facts,
much more extended than M. Dumas supposes; but             I   admit
chemical  substitutions;   for substitution is only one of the modes
by which bodies may enter into combination.
     “Ishould without doubt do more than M. Dumas in say
ing to the Academy: Chemical compounds are produced, either
by direct combination or by displacement, or by substitution,
or lastly, by several of these modes united. Substitution may
be non-equivalent, equivalent, isotypic, isorhythmic, or isomor

cyanic acid, which is speedily decomposed into a pale blueish
cyanuret of iron.      When, however, further additions of this
acid are    made,    the potassium takes oxygen, forms potassa,
deutoxide of nitrogen is evolved, and the solution becomes
dark coloured. This liquor, when neutralized with potassa,
is found to give no precipitate with the persalts of iron, but
forms Prussian blue with the protosalts of. that metal. The
rapidity of this change depends upon the heat of the solution,
for when warm the effect takes place immediately, whilst on
the contrary, two or three days are required at a low tempera
ture. When evaporated, a large quantity of nitrate of potassa
is deposited; and lastly some red crystals are formed. When
acid is more used, the ferrocyanate is totally decomposed; the
black mass which is the result has at first a sweet, but afterwards
leaves a disagreeable metallic taste upon the palate. This
process can never be used advantageously to form the ferro
sesquicyanuret, from the quantity of acid which is required,
the degree of nicety which must be employed to effect the
change, and the impurity of the salt when obtained.
     The next highly oxygenated acid which we have to examine
 is the iodic; this when added to ferrocyanate of potash becomes
 decomposed, the oxygen passes to the potassium to form
 potassa, free iodine is evolved, and the potassa                    to
 another   portion  of iodic acid, and is precipitated   as the iodate       |
 of potassa. The free iodine can be readily removed by agi
 tation with a little aether, and in this way a tolerably pure
 ferrosesquicyanuret of potassium can be extemporaneously
 obtained, for the solution contains but little iodate of potassa
  from     insolubility*.

     Chloric acid operates       the same way
                                     in               iodic acid, but

      The last process in which nascent oxygen contributes to
  the formation of ferrosesquicyanuret of potassium,                  perhaps,           is,

but none that were tried, except the peroxide of manganese,
formed the red ferrocyanate; many of them were converted

   A current of oxygen gas passed through the solution of
the salt produces no alteratiou, showing that the gas must be

                               this explanation is correct, the action
of phosphorus must be classed with the other oxygenating
substances, for oxygen, and not phosphorus, removes the
potassium".
   No mode of abstracting the half equivalent of potassium by
sulphur is known, for if half an equivalent of sulphur be heated
with powdered ferrocyanuret, the ferrosesquicyanuret is not
 produced, and the alcoholic or terebinthine solution of sul
 phur, added to a solution of the ferrocyanuret, also failed to
 produce this change. Fven nascent sulphur arising from the
 decomposition of sulphuret of potash by an acid did not pro
 duce any effectt.
    A current of cyanogen gas passed through a solution of the
 salt is gradually absorbed, and it becomes of a very dark
 colour,    #.  red ferrocyanate is not formed.
    Doubtless many may be surprised that the action of iodine
 has not been adverted to before, and more especially that it
 should not have been mentioned with chlorine and bromine,

find iron in everything he examines.                                           With          excess      of alkali,
on the contrary, no precipitate of Prussian blue is produced;
and therefore if search be made for that most useful of all
metals, the experiment would declare that iron had no real
existence; but if the golden mean be employed, or the solution
be but very slightly acid, the ferrosesquicyanuret, as well as
the ferrocyanuret, become most valuable and delicate tests,
the one for the peroxide, the other for the protoxide of that
metal.
   The change by chlorine and bromine has been shown to
result from the abstraction of the half equivalent of potassium
by the formation of chloride or bromide of that metal, and
therefore the ferrosesquicyanuret is impure till that is removed
by alcohol. We have seen also that the change may be ef
fected by the iodic, nitric, and chloric acids, but by these
methods the salt is also contaminated to a great extent by the
nitrate of potash, but to a much less extent with the chlorate,
and scarcely at                     all
                      with the iodate; with phosphorus the salt
in    very impure state may still

   Mr. R. Hunt         on Hydriodates as Photographic Agents. 203
experiments are, the establishment of fixed principles, which
remove most of the uncertainty attending the use of the hy
driodates, an explanation of many of the anomalous
they give, and the discovery of some very remarkable pro
perties not before noticed.
    The uncertainty attending the application of the hydrio
dates, has greatly circumscribed their use, and it is the de
sire of forwarding the progress of a beautiful art, which now
makes me solicit a few pages of your valuable Journal.
    Sir John Herschel, in his very excellent memoir “On the Che
 mical Action of the Rays of the Solar Spectrum,” &c.” particu
larly notices the inconstancy of the effects exhibited by the
 hydriodates. “Nothing,” says that talented and indefatigable
 inquirer, “can be more variable and capricious than the re
 sults obtained according to the different intensities of the so
 lutions applied; the qualities of the paper; the degree of
 darkening induced on the paper before the application of the
 ioduretted solution, the state of the paper as to moisture or
 dryness, and other circumstances.”
                                              I
     That the various positions wish to establish may be com
 pletely understood, and to ensure the same results in other
 hands, it will be necessary to enter into a somewhat detailed
 account of several kinds of paper which have been used, and to
  give tolerably full directions for successfully using the same,
  either in the camera obscura, or for drawings by application.
     1. The preparation of the paper.—The variable texture of
  even the finest kinds of paper occasioning irregularities of im
  bibition, is a constant source of annoyance, deforming the
  drawings with dark patches, which are very difficult to re
  move; consequently my first endeavours were directed to the
  formation of a surface on which the photographic prepara
  tions might be spread with perfect uniformity.
     2. A   variety of sizes were tried with very variable results.
  Nearly    allthe animal glutens appear        possess     colorific
                                                            to               a
  property, which may render them available            many modifiin
  cations   ofthe processes published                 by
                                          Mr. Talbot, but they                                  all

  considerably mars the effect                of
                                     the finished picture.                          It       is a
  singular fact that the tragacanth and acacia gums render
  the drawings much less permanent.           therefore found
                                                       I           ne        of

   3. It occurred to me that it might be possible to saturate
the paper with a metallic solution, which should be of itself
entirely uninfluenced by light, on which the silver coating
might be spread without suffering any material chemical
change. The results being curious, and illustrative of some
peculiarities to be explained when the hydriodates come un
der our examination (65.),                I
                              shall record a few of them.

in certain proportions, overcame many of the first difficulties,

on which the light acts with the most power become the
darkest of the drawing, while the shaded parts are whitened.
   The dark specks which abound in some kinds of paper
must be avoided, and the spots made by flies very carefully
guarded against. These are of small consequence, indeed are
not noticed during the darkening action; but when the hy
driodic wash is applied they form centres of chemical action,
and the bleaching process goes on around them independent
of light, deforming the drawing with small rings, which are
continually extending their diameters.
   13. The Muriated Solutions.—These saline washes may be
considerably varied, and combined to an indefinite extent with
a continued change of effect, which is singularly interesting.
In their application I am invariably guided by the combi
ning proportion of the salt; for having tried solutions of                                            all
strengths,    am   I length satisfied

The other hydriodic salts correspond nearly with these in
their action; a certain point of dilution is necessary with all.
   21. Hydriodate of ammonia, if used on unsized paper, has
some advantage as to quickness over either the salts of potassa
or soda. This preparation                      is,

   28. Directions for taking Photographs.-For drawings by
application less care is required than for the camera obscura.
With a very soft flat brush apply the hydriodic solution on
both sides of the prepared paper until it appears equally ab
sorbed, place it in close contact with the object to be copied,
and expose to sunshine. The exposure should continue until
the light parts of the picture (iodide of silver (54.)) are seen
to brown. The observance of this simple rule will be found
of very great advantage in practice. Immersion for a short
time in soft water removes the brown hue, and renders the
bright parts of the picture more clear than they would other
 wise have been.
   29.       If
          the paper is intended to be used in the camera, it
is best to soak it in the hydriodic solution, until a slight
change is apparent from the chemical action on the silver; it
is then to be stretched on a frame, and not allowed to touch
in any part but at the edges; placed in the dark chamber of
the camera at the proper focus, and submitted to luminous                          in
fluence.
        If
       the wetted paper is placed upon any porous body, it
will be found, owing to the capillary         communication esta
blished between different    points,  that the solution is removed
from some parts to others, and different states of sensitive
ness induced.    Another advantage of the frame                  is,

be ultimately adopted for these purposes. There seem at
present some difficulties as to the best mode of using this
combustible; since by sudden exposure to an incandescent
furnace it is apt to split or exfoliate into minute fragments,
which choke up the draught of air, or are thrown out like dust
by any rapid motion.        Dr. Ure assigns as the cause of this,
I  believe truly, that being a bad conductor of heat, the super
ficial parts expand and break off from the cooler internal
portions; the remedy for which appears to be some contri
vance for gradually heating the coal before it comes into
contact with the fire, and of supplying a constant current of
hot air; these precautions are not required for common fires.
Mr. Player has secured a patent for such a process, which is
exhibited on the Thames in the steamer called the Anthracite,
the action of which every one is disposed to praise, yet no one
adopts: for this no reason appears but the difficulty of over
coming prejudices, or the fear of engaging in novelties in the
first instance requiring some additional expenditure.

between two     plates   connected with the     opposite    poles. The
reason why Professor Daniell's water battery, which you em
ployed       in
            some       your experiments, failed, was first, that the
                               of
cells were not    separately    insulated, and secondly, that they
were too few        number.

   All the rays of light, with perhaps the exception of the yel
low, leave an impression on the iodide of silver. The less
refrangible rays, however, act much more slowly than those
which are at the opposite end of the spectrum.            In the com
mon kinds of     glass, the most    energetic   action takes place in
the indigo, or on the boundary of the blue.            Now the retina
receives an impression with equal facility from each of the
different rays, the yellow light acting as quickly upon it as the
red or the blue.     Vision is therefore performed independently
                                        all
                                                                  of it

time enters     as   an
                     element; the blue ray may have effected                                        its
full  change, whilst the red      yet only beginning slowly
                                        is                         act;                   to

plain that     an

                     a
maximum energy have just completed their action, those that
are more dispersed but             of
                               slower effect, will not have had time
to   leave any stain.     We work,          fact, within    temporary             a

used, lies probably within the indigo space:  therefore fol                  it

Dec. 18,         PAPER was afterwards read, entitled, “Observations
   1839.          on the locality of the Hyracotherium,”    by William
Richardson, Esq., F.G.S.
    In 1829, when Mr. Richardson first examined the coast from
Whitstable to Herne Bay, it presented an uniform, geological struc
ture, composed of a capping of vegetable mould, under which was a
stratum 3 or 4 feet thick of yellow brick earth, containing in the
upper part rolled and angular flints, mammalian remains and fossils
derived from secondary strata; and beneath, forming the mass of
the cliff, was London clay of a dark brown colour, abounding in
septaria, selenite, pyritous wood, teeth and vertebrae of fishes, Nau
tili with other characteristic marine testacea, Encrinital and Penta
crinital remains, and crustaceans.
    The whole of the line of coast undergoes rapid degradation in con
sequence    of the encroachment of the sea and land springs; and the
changes thus annually produced, effect great alterations in the physical
outline of the cliffs. The geological structure, however, presented by
them in 1829 remained for the greater part the same in the autumn
 of 1839, except at the part called Studd Hill. At this point, the dark
brown incoherent clay had been removed, and a deep blue, tenacious
 one exposed. A change had also taken place in the character of
the fossils, the marine remains having gradually become less promi
nent and been replaced by others of a fluvio-marine character.        In
the autumn of last year, Mr. Richardson could not find a single ma
rine shell, and only a few fragments of crinoidal stems. Terrestrial
vegetables have, however, become so prodigiously abundant, that
he has obtained at different times above 500 fossil cones, fruits, and
other seed-vessels; and fragments of small trees converted into py
rites occur in so great quantities, that they have been removed by
barge loads for occonomical purposes, and become a source of con
siderable profit to the neighbouring peasantry. These remains pre
sent no indications of having been transported from a distance.
Neither land nor fresh-water shells have been observed.
    From the abundance of vegetables, and the knowledge that Nature
ever directs her means as well in number as in fitness to particular
ends, Mr. Richardson inferred, that remains either of quadrupeds or
birds would be found in Studd Hill; and though his search was long
fruitless, it was at last rewarded by the discovery of the portion of
the Hyracotherium described by Mr. Owen in the preceding memoir.

transition rocks of Bohemia, by David T. Ansted, Esq., F.G.S.

geologist in a country so little frequented as that visited by himself,

  A letter was afterwards read, addressed to Dr.Buckland, P.G.S.
by the Rev. John Gunn, and dated Dec. 21st, 1839.
  This letter was accompanied by three paramoudras from the chalk
near Norwich; and they had been selected by Mr. Gunn on account
of one of them presenting a tuberculated exterior, a character which
he states a paramoudra commonly assumes when it is in contact
with horizontal lines of nodular flints; and the other two had been
chosen because Belemnites and shells are imbedded in their sub-.
stance. The letter contains some observations on the irregularities in
the surface of the Norfolk chalk, and on the pipes or sand galls by
which it is penetrated. With reference to these tubular hollows,
Mr. Gunn refers to Mr. Lyell's description of them, read at the
meeting of the British Association at Birmingham, but he calls at
tention to their being constantly filled in the district examined by
himself, with sand, gravel, or crag, to the total exclusion of all ma
terials belonging to the strata between the chalk and the crag ; and
he therefore infers, that the sand galls were not eroded during the
eocene period, but that during that long period the Norfolk chalk
 was denudated.
   The letter was also accompanied by some specimens from the
boulders contained in the diluvial (drift) strata of Norfolk and Suf
folk. Mr. Gunn is of opinion that these masses of rock indicate
what were the strata that formed the shore against which the (so
called) diluvial waves washed; and that the masses were borne out
to sea in a similar manner to the portions of cliff now annually de
stroyed by the waves. If the bottom of the present sea were raised,
he says it would present features analogous to those of the crag and
diluvial formations of Norfolk and Suffolk.
      XXXIV.         Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                   PH MENOMENA          OF CALEFACTION.
M        BOUTIGNY has read a paper before the Academy of Sci
      • ences on Calefaction, by which term he designates the singu
lar phaenomenon presented by water when drops of it are thrown
upon a very hot metallic surface.
   It has generally been supposed that this effect is produced only
at a very high temperature, but M. Boutigny finds that it occurs in
a lead crucible, and consequently below 612°Fahrenheit.
   M. Boutigny has observed also that aether gradually dropped into a
platina crucible nearly red-hot, calefies as well as water, that is to
say, the mass becomes round, without the occurrence of any appear
ance of ebullition, is afterwards rapidly agitated, and does not
seem to wet the crucible.     The quantity, however, goes on dimi
nishing, but much less rapidly than if the vessel were cold.      Du
ring this slow evaporation, a very irritating vapour arises, which
does not at  allresemble that      of
                                  aether, but which     smell greatly

                 air appears      necessary    the production

                                                                  this
vapour.    The commissioner        whom M. Boutigny's paper was

                        Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                       231
consigned, made an interesting observation: having immersed a
piece of litmus paper into the crucible to try whether the vapour
was acid, he observed that the part immersed retained its colour,
whilst that which was even with the orifice of the crucible became
evidently red. The temperature was therefore higher in this place,
and it is to be presumed that slow combustion took place analogous
to that which occurs in the interesting experiments of Dobereiner.
   Anhydrous sulphurous acid presented M. Boutigny with phaeno
mena still more remarkable than aether; he found that when a little
of this acid dropped upon a platina capsule heated almost to redness,
the drops were strongly agitated, became round, immoveable and
opalescent, and seemed even to crystallize. The small spheroid when
placed on the hand produced a sensation of cold.
   M. Boutigny was of opinion, that in this case the sulphurous
acid suffered so great a diminution of temperature that it solidified.
The commissioner rejects this explanation, and is satisfied with ad
mitting, that the acid under these circumstances evaporating more
slowly than in the open air, produces nevertheless, by this slow eva
poration, so considerable a degree of cold as to congeal the moist
ure of the surrounding air, and to become hydrated. This explana
tion is apparently confirmed by the fact, that if the small solid
globule be rapidly projected into a tube, and it be immediately
corked, the globule disappears, but leaving in the place which it
occupied a dew, that remains even when the tube is uncorked.
   M. Boutigny is of opinion that the phaenomena described may
be connected with the explosions in steam-boilers, and he is still
occupied with the subject, and has made a great number of experi
ments with different liquids, and particularly with alcohol of dif
                                                                  oil

          COMPOSITION OF CRYSTALLIZED PHOSPHO RIC ACID.
     In the opinion of Prof. Graham, phosphoric acid may combine
with water in three different proportions, and form a phosphate,
biphosphate, triphosphate of water.         The existence of these com
pounds has hitherto been hypothetical, except the first, which ap
pears to be vitrified phosphoric acid.       The analysis of crystallized
  hosphoric acid has not yet been attempted, or at any rate not yet
published.     M. Peligot has attempted to supply this void in the
history of phosphoric acid, by analysing crystals which slowly formed
spontaneously in bottles filled with syrupy phosphoric acid.           One
of these bottles contained two very distinct crystalline layers. The
upper crystals were transparent and hard; the lower ones were soft,
and had the appearance of sugar of honey.
   The crystals, separately collected, were dried in vacuo, on plates of
absorbent porcelain; the quantity of water was determined by cal
cining them with oxide of lead. According to M. Peligot's analyses,
the upper crystals contained from 27 to 28 per cent. of water, and
the lower crystals 22 to 23 per cent.
   The extreme avidity of these crystals for water, renders a precise
analysis of them very difficult;                        if,       as
                                               theoretically supposed                               by
M.   Peligot,  hydrated   phosphoric  acid   containing   three equivalents
of water   ought         to
                     contain 27.4  per cent.,  and the  bihydrate 20 per                   l

and platina has been hitherto ineffectually attempted; he has, how
ever, succeeded in procuring by means of decomposing acechlor
platina by heat.
    When acechlor-platina is heated in a retort, to which a receiver
is adapted, with a bent tube, it begins to decompose and yield a
little gas at about 4.19%; at 464° the disengagement of gas is plenti
ful, and a brown liquid distils. This continues with the gradual
increase of the heat up to 527°, a little colourless liquid coming
over from time to time; at 572° much gas and liquid were pro
duced; when this heat ceased to produce any effect, the retort was
heated to redness in the sand-bath; this occasioned a copious dis
 engagement of gas; so that the quantity obtained at this period

                               SULPHATE OF CARBYLE.
     M. E. Magnus states, that when anhydrous sulphuric acid is ab
sorbed by absolute alcohol, there are formed, under the influence of
particular circumstances, white silky crystals in the alcohol; they
are a sulphate of carburetted hydrogen, to which M. Magnus gives
the name of sulphate of carbyle, from carbo and hydrogenium.            The
method adopted was that of exposing the alcohol in a small tube to
anhydrous sulphuric acid in a stopped receiver.        Crystals are rarely
formed   immediately;    the tube must be    put  into a second receiver
containing sulphuric acid, and sometimes even into a third.              For
the sulphuric acid in the receiver also absorbs alcohol, which causes
the cessation of the absorption of the acid by the alcohol which is
contained in the tube. The formation goes on without the disen
gagement of sulphurous acid.
   The crystals which form in the alcohol tube are, it is true, sur
rounded with fuming acid, but M. Magnus succeeded in isolating
them.     In pouring off the liquid acid which filled the interstices,
they yield abundant vapours: they rapidly attract humidity from the
air and deliquesce; to dry them they were placed upon a plate of
baked clay, slightly heated in the air-pump over sulphuric acid until
they yielded no more vapour.
   When aether was employed instead of alcohol, no crystals were
obtained; it is possible, however, that under some circumstances
they might be formed; the experiment confirms the previous state
ment of M. Magnus, that when aether is absorbed by anhydrous
                                oil
sulphuric acid, heavy           wine    always produced, which
                                                   is                 never
                                                                                         is as is
                                of
the case with absolute alcohol.       This may        regarded       one be                          of
the strongest objections against the opinion that alcohol                hy              a
drate      aether; for
          of               this were the case, the sulphuric acid ought
                               if
to remove the water, and then act upon                 were aether, which
                                                               it   as

evidently does not occur.
   When these crystals are cautiously heated, they fuse without de
composition, and          on
                       cooling become crystalline mass. a      They com
bine with water and alcohol with the disengagement               heat, and          of
by evaporation they                 do
                               not separate from the solution.          The
aqueous solution, saturated with barytes, yields soluble salts with
a  little sulphate      barytes.

                  on HELLENIN.       By M. c.   GERHardt.
     This substance, obtained from Izala        hellenium,  is to be distin
  guished from inulin yielded by the same root. It is readily obtained
 by treating the fresh root of the elecampane with alcohol of sp. gr.
 0.837; when the excess of alcohol is separated by distillation, the
  concentrated liquor becomes milky by cooling, and deposits abun
  dance of crystals.     They are purified by redissolving in alcohol and
  recrystallizing.    When the root is distilled with water, downy
 flocculi, which are very white pure hellenin, are obtained in the
 receiver; but the quantity is so small that it is better to employ
 alcohol.
     Hellenin crystallizes in four-sided prisms; they are perfectly
 white, their smell and taste is extremely weak, and they are lighter
 than water. They are insoluble in water, but very soluble in aether
 and alcohol, and these solutions are precipitated by water.         It dis
 solves also in all proportions, in essential oils and in creasote. It
 may readily be pulverized when it is rendered impure by the resin,
 which always exists with it in the root.         Its fusing point is about
  161° Fahr. ; it boils at 527° to 536°, and volatilizes before it boils,
 exhaling a very weak odour.        At this temperature, however, it is
 more or less altered, so that the density of its vapour cannot be
 ascertained.
     When hellenin is fused at a gentle heat, it recrystallizes in a
 mass on cooling; but if the heat be continued for some minutes,
 the mass on solidifying does not possess a crystalline texture, but
 resembles resin in appearance. The caustic alkalies do not decom
 pose hellenin, even when heated, a property which it possesses in
 common with several substances, such as camphor, the oil of ani
 seed, mint, &c.      On heating it in a solution of potash, it first fuses
 and eventually dissolves, and on the addition of hydrochloric acid
 the hellenin is precipitated without alteration.       When heated with
 hydrate of potash, a great part of it is volatilized, whilst another
 portion is carbonized; on dissolving the mixture afterwards in water
 a slightly brown coloured liquid is obtained, which becomes slightly
turbid on the addition of acids.
    Acids act upon hellenin as they do upon the greater part of the
essential oils; concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it at common
temperatures, forming a red coloured solution, without the evolu
tion of any sulphurous acid, provided no heat be employed; never
theless after a considerable time the mixture becomes black, as if
acted upon by heat. The solution then contains a certain quantity
of a peculiar acid, to which M.  -  Gerhardt has given the name of sul
pho-hellenic acid.
    When hydrochloric acid gas is brought into contact with hellenin,
it absorbs a large quantity of the gas, and a liquid of a violet co

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  237
lour is formed; when exposed to the air             it  exhales hydrochloric
acid.
    Nitric acid of middling strength dissolves hellenin without the
evolution of any hyponitrous acid, and water precipitates it unal
tered ; when the mixture is heated the hellenin is converted into
what M. Gerhardt calls nitro-hellenin.
    Concentrated acetic acid dissolves hellenin; the solution is colour
less, and deposits by evaporation unaltered crystals of this substance;
water precipitates the solution.
    Anhydrous phosphoric acid acts upon hellenin as it does upon
camphor, converting it into a carburetted hydrogen, which M. Ger
hardt has named hellenene.
    Cold chlorine gas does not act upon hellenin, nor even when ex
posed to the direct rays of the sun; but when the mixture is heated,
hydrochloric acid is disengaged and a resinous body is formed, in
which a certain number of atoms of hydrogen are replaced by an
equal number of atoms of chlorine; a drop of bromine produces with
hellenin an effervescence of hydrobromic acid; the product is of a
yellow red, dissolves in alcohol, and is precipitated from it by water.
 It is probably a compound analogous to that formed with chlorine,
and the author terms it hydrochlorate of chlorehellenin.
    Bichloride of tin and protochloride of antimony, the latter in
 a state of fusion, colour hellenin of a deep red colour, exactly like
 concentrated sulphuric acid.
    When distilled with lime, hellenin yields a yellow inflammable
 liquid; it is neutral, does not mix with water, and in smell resembles
 acetone.                                     -

 with that of M. Dumas, and he considers it as constituted of

  CHEMICAL AND CONTACT THEORIES OF VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY.
      After giving an extract from Professor Faraday's Sixteenth Series
  of Researches, of which an abstract appeared in Lond. and Edinb.
  Phil. Mag., vol. xii. p. 122, M. de la Rive remarks, “The question
  of which Mr. Faraday treats in the memoir from which the fore
   going extract is given, is the subject of a warm controversy at the
  present time, especially in Germany, where the partizans of the
  voltaic theory of contact are numerous.              The authority of Mr.
   Faraday, and the clear and decisive manner in which he declares
   himself in favour of the chemical theory, are of great weight; the

numerous investigations which this philosopher has made in elec
tricity, and his great practical acquaintance with voltaic apparatus,

tricity.
   “In beginning the memoir here alluded to, he has done me the
honour to mention that I am one of those who have most strongly
pleaded for fifteen years in favour of the chemical theory; he has
repeated most of the experiments upon which I have rested my
opinion, and he has found them correct. I hope soon to be able, in
like manner, to take up the experiments lately made in Germany in
favour of the theory of contact, in order to show that they are in
no way contrary to the chemical theory, and to add to this theory
some new direct proofs.      At the meeting of the Société de Phys. et
d'Hist. Nat. de   Genève,  on the 21st of May last, I read a memoir on
this subject, which will appear in one of our earliest Numbers.”—

           HYDRO MELLONIC ACID AND METALLIC OXIDES.
    The hydromellonic acid is decomposed by metallic oxides into a
metallic mellonuret and water; it decomposes the carbonates both
in the dry state and in solution, and the iodides and bromides on
fusion.    Its compounds with the alkaline metallic oxides and with
the earths are insoluble in water.
    Mellonuret of Potassium.—Prepared by fusing sulphocyanuret of
potassium in a porcelain crucible at a red heat, and adding mellon
as long as an evolution of sulphuret of carbon and sulphur is re
marked.      A brown opake glassy mass is obtained, which dissolved
in boiling water yields, as the solution cools, hydrated crystals of
mellonuret of potassium.       It may also be formed by fusing 5 parts
of chloride of antimony (butter of antimony) with 8 parts of sul
phocyanuret of potassium, and removing by boiling water the soluble
portions of the residue after the escape of the sulphur and the sul
phuret of carbon.      It is also formed as a secondary product in the
process for the preparation of the sulphocyanuret of potassium; it
is present in the solution in small, but in the residue in larger quan
tity, from which it may be removed by boiling water.
   Prop.–Crystallizes from water in colourless fine needles, which
unite into dense flakes; a concentrated solution congeals to a soft
white mass, which is with difficulty dissolved by cold water; the
crystals contain water of crystallization, which they lose at a high
temperature; they then fuse without loss of weight to a clear yellow
glass. The solution is tasteless, and precipitates          all
                                                              earthy and
metallic salts.
   By fusing sulphocyanuret      ofpotassium with mellon, the sulpho
cyanogen   is liberated, andis  instantly decomposed    by the high tem
perature into sulphuret    of carbon, sulphur, and mellon.      By fusing

anuret of potassium with sulphur, the sulphocyanuret of potassium,
and sulphocyanuret of iron, are formed; 4 eq. of the latter decom
pose into 4 eq. sulphuret of iron 4 Fe S, 2 eq. sulphuret of carbon
2 C.S., and 1 eq. of mellon, which as soon as it is formed decomposes
l eq. of sulphocyanuret of potassium into mellonuret of potassium
and sulphocyanogen; the latter is further decomposed into sulphur,
sulphuret of carbon, and mellon.

                            CYANILIC ACID.
   By a long-continued boiling of mellon in dilute nitric acid, a so
lution is effected with the evolution of gaseous products, and the
liquid yields on evaporation colourless, transparent, octohedral cry
stals; by re-solution in hot water, hydrated cyanilic acid in soft tabu
lar crystals of a mother-of-pearl lustre are obtained. This acid has
the same composition as the crystalline cyanuric acid; contains, like
the latter, 4 eq. water of crystallization, which it loses at 212°, when
it becomes opake and falls to a white powder. By the destructive
distillation it is converted into hydrated cyanic acid; by solution in
sulphuric acid and caustic potassa into cyanuric acid. This acid
has been but little examined.    Its formation admits of explanation
on the   supposition that the elements of 1 eq. of mellon and 3 eq. of
water give rise to 1 eq. cyanilic acid and l eq. ammonia, and the
latter is in point of fact found combined with the nitric acid; ac
cording to this, its formation ought not to be dependent on the use
of nitric acid alone.—Ibid. p. 798.

  XXXV.       Comparative Measure of the Action of two Voltaic
     Pairs,  the one Copper-zinc, the other Platina-zinc.              By
     M. JAcoB1*.
  I   HAVE      the honour to communicate to the Imperial Aca
      demy of Sciences, the result of my comparative experi
 ments, concerning the force of two different voltaic pairs with
 partitions, the one copper-zinc,        charged with sulphate of
 copper and sulphuric acid dilute with six parts by volume
 of water; the other platina-zinc, and charged, according to
 the recommendation of Mr. Grove, with concentrated nitric
 acid, and with the same diluted sulphuric acid. The first pair,
 copper-zinc, had 36 square inches of surface, the pair platina
 zinc had only 23 square inches. To measure the force of the
 current, I employed M. Becquerel's electro-magnetic balance.
 This instrument is valuable for accurate measures, provided
 the helices be so disposed as to be able to fulfil the conditions
 of stable equilibrium, which necessarily ought to exist in a
 balance.    This is attained by making the repulsion only act
between the magnetic bars and helices.               For this purpose,
one of the helices      ought  to be fixed  below,   the other above
the said bars. This        #.   helix is traversed by the rod, by
which the bar is suspended from the beam of the balance.
It is still necessary that a correction be adapted to the cur
rents measured by the balance. This correction, of which
other synchronous investigations have shown the necessity, is
in proportion to the square of the force of the current.             For

let k' be the actual current, k the current measured by the

the voltaic combinations in question.     The first column con
tains the resistances, L, of the helices which serve as conjunc

    In the application of the above principle, we take the origins
of the elementary waves on any proposed surface as that of a
reflecting or refracting substance, or an aperture, without                                        its
being necessary that this surface should coincide with any
one wave surface as          arrives.

    There are    only    few cases       which the integration for the

 they suffice for proving the discordance              the results   ofthe                   of

   A fact stated by M. Fresnel, which I have confirmed by a
severe experimental examination, bears upon the point, of
the effect of the limits of apertures.   His experiments for the
diffraction by  a single edge of an  opake plate (see the before
mentioned memoir, page 429.) were, in fact, made with an
aperture generally of a centimeter in breadth, whilst his                                     lu
minous point and micrometer were in some measures distant
about seven metres from each other.       Notwithstanding    the
small breadth of the aperture compared with            distances                      its
from the luminous point and micrometer, yet we find him
stating that the fringes formed                           by
                                    one edge were not affected
 by the other edge, and that his measures might         taken                          be      as
if made with     single edge. The principle under discussion
                         a
shows, that with the quadrilateral, sectorial    circular forms                  or
of apertures, the intensity should depend      the limits, how              on
ever distant.
   The same results arise when we take plane reflectors
place     apertures, only then the point
             of                               must     taken            B             be       on in
the same side as that on which the waves are incident.

                     of

 an  important question presents itself-is the substance ex
amined the radical                 of
                         the sulphocyanides,           product       the          or   a                  of
decomposition       that radical? To settle this point, the basic
sulphocyanide             of of
                    lead (the double sulphocyanide and oxide                                                   of
lead), was first examined for hydrogen.            gave me 0-39 per              It

                             should contain 78.26     per   cent. The
carbon and hydrogen agree for either view.           Liebig obtained
 (see memoir above-quoted) 74°958 per cent.                  lead; two                         of
analyses gave me the following results.
     1. 53.67 grains treated with nitric and          little sulphuric                a
acid, gave 53-97 grains        sulphate     lead, equal
                                               of              39'58  of                            to         of

 comes of this     oxygen   2      have  observed,  Ithat however slowly
 the chlorine be      passed   through   the solution of sulphocyanide
 of potassium, an oxidizing action on the sulphocyanogen                                                     al
 ready formed takes place, even at the commencement of the
 operation; sulphuric and cyanic acids being produced.                   It
 does not appear how this action can be satisfactorily ex
 plained on the old view (a simple removal of potassium by
 chlorine), for it involves the decomposition of water by chlo
 rine in a strong solution of sulphocyanide of potassium, or in
  fact, that water is more readily decomposed by chlorine than
 sulphocyanide of potassium.             But on the view given above,
  an oxidizing action on sulphocyanogen already formed is
  easily explained; it is even essential, since no evolution of
 oxygen gas is to be noticed.
     The production of this substance by nitric acid can be ex
 plained in a similar manner.           Six equivalents of water, sul
 phocyanide of potassium, and nitric acid, are equal to six of
 nitrate of potash and six of hydro-sulphocyanic                  acid, or
  Sla C1, Ng Hº, which with four equivalents of oxygen from
 the decomposition of another portion of nitric acid, become
  S12 Cls Nº Hs O, and 3 H. O.
     Four equivalents of oxygen of the atmosphere acting on
  six of hydro-sulphocyanic acid, produce the same effect.
     With regard to the arrangement of the elements in this
 substance, it is obvious that many formulae might with equal
 probability be selected.         All that can be reasonably assumed
 on this   subject                  is,
                        that the carbon and nitrogen exist          cyano                               as

                it   probable
                     is          that the   cyanogen    and  sulphur   are
 more intimately connected with each other than either                                                       of

    We are indebted to Woehler and Liebig for                    that                    all           is   as

but this subject was not studied               completely       sothem                       by             as

connected with the sulphocyanides                their remarkable rein
searches.
     Itappears from their experiments, that when sulphocyano
gen      digested
         is           solution  in   potash,      of
                                                 small portion      a   dis                        is
solved, and the remainder becomes redder, partly soluble                                                    in
water, and partly         alcohol.   inAfter alcohol and water had
been    successively  applied      this altered sulphocyanogen until
                                                 to

phuration             of
                 cyanogen.      But his    analyses       this substance       of
do not sufficiently accord with any theoretical numbers                                                     to
 decide its constitution.
     My own experiments certainly confirm the above                   far                         as        as
 they go, but       would  appear

cyanogen, the name hydrothiocyanic acid will perhaps not
be inapplicable.             Its

cyanic acid being liberated. It is blackened by alkalies, an

cyanide of copper is ignited in a tube, it gives off sulphur,
hydrated cyanic acid, and bisulphuret of carbon, leaving
a residue of sulphuret of copper.
   Lead.—Solutions of hydrothiocyanic acid produce a yellow
F.F.        in acetate and subacetate of lead, which is decom
posed by the stronger acids, and by sulphuretted hydrogen,
the acid being reproduced unaltered in the last case.     Nitric
acid instantly produces sulphate of lead. On being heated in
a tube, it gave rise to similar products as the copper salt;
hydrated cyanic acid, sulphur, bisulphuret of carbon, and
sulphuret of lead. Like most insoluble salts of slightly solu
ble acids (when prepared from solutions of the acid), this is
contaminated with a large excess of acid. Two combustions

       1. 8:62 per cent. of carbon        49 of hydrogen.

   2. 10-77 treated in the same manner, gave 8'19 of sulphate,
or 51.93 per cent.
   Calculated according to the formula They 4 Pb -- 4 aq, it
should contain 790 of carbon, 51 of hydrogen, and 53.40 of
lead per cent. ; notwithstanding this difference, no other
formula could have been selected, in accordance with the ulti
mate composition obtained for the acid.
   Like the copper salt, thiocyanide of lead is blackened by
alkalies, a subsalt being produced.
   Silver.—The behaviour of the solution of hydrothiocyanic
acid with nitrate of silver is very peculiar and characteristic,
forming a test sufficiently delicate to detect one part of the
acid in 10,000 of water.     On mixing the solutions a yellow
flocculent precipitate is formed, which on standing a short
time, or immediately on heating, aggregates, changing to a
black colour, without any evolution of gas or odour of cy
     ††
anogen. The change is not hastened by solar light. When
the     substance is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, the
acid is reproduced, and sulphuret of silver formed. Concen

cyanogen is precipitated of a light yellow colour, and does
not subside readily. I have ascertained, by experiment, that
this light yellow substance is not sulphocyanogen, but hydro

had permeated  coloured media, the absorptive powers of which

place between the extreme upper edge of the blue, and a line

this influence the shadows are browner than before; the lights
scarcely changed. GREEN. The yellow much increased in

those just mentioned.

of  coloured media, vol. xvi.      p.  270  of   your Journal,      I have
already mentioned the singular change which ensues upon ex
posing this kind     of  drawing   to   light under media such          we as
are now    considering.     To that    paperI     refer you.

extends up to the green rays, beyond which a different power
is exercised; the deoxidizing                     appearing to be great
est in the blue rays, whilst the yellow iodide of silver suffers
decomposition in the most refrangible rays.

   A  few hours of daylight occa
sioned the hydriodic solution in the

of the iodide of silver was formed

dipping in the salt of silver. (The

to elucidate,  may  be had by  operating  with chlorine. Its first
action on one of these hydriodic photographs is the separation
of iodine, which, when exposed to the light, is seen to act on

the edges first, and gradually over the whole extent of the

                 it        evident, that before we can expect

clined, however, to believe, that examination of these phaeno
mena by a fixed spectrum will prove a shifting of the actions
according to the kinds of paper used; but I am satisfied the

    %. The very curious       brightening of those parts of the pho
tograph corresponding with the darks of the engraving, at
tracted my attention powerfully.            My first impression was,
that the carbonaceous matter of the ink used in printing ex
erted a kind of catalytic action in directing the formation of
an iodide of silver.           think  I             I
                                         have proof of this to some
extent.
   71. Most printed pages, unless they are very old, when
placed in juxtaposition in the dark with an hydriodidated
photographic paper, leave an impression after some hours,
and I have succeeded in partially copying some engravings
thus. However, the result is uncertain; the copy, at                                             all
times faint,      often very imperfect, being sometimes bleached

XXXIX.        On the Form of Ilutile.   By W. H.               MILLER,
    Esq., Professor of Mineralogy in the University            of Cam
    bridge.
THE   following values of the angles
  the faces of rutile were obtained
                                         between normals to
                                         from two extremely
 erfect crystals, for which I am indebted to Mr. Brooke.
  The instrument used as a goniometer was a twelve-inch theo
dolite.   The coincidences of the signals were observed with
         º
a telescope having a power of about twelve.     Each result is
the mean of two observations made with the signals inter
changed, in order to eliminate the error arising from the im
perfect centring of the crystal.     In one the faces p", p"

  were intended to        express   the angles p p", ss" (“a on a over
 summit = 90°, c on c over summit = 109° 47'”) are very
 erroneous, probably through some mistake in transcribin
 them, for the errors (which remain uncorrected in the fourt
 edition) are much too large to have been errors of observa

 XL.      Note upon    Mr. Griffith's Paper “upon the true Order of
    Succession     of the Older Stratified Rocks near Killarney and
     Dublin.” By CHARLEs WILLIAM HAMILTON, F.G.S. &c.”
THERE            are   a few points      in this paper to which        I think
        it necessary   to reply.
    I
                                                   i.
       brought forward the result of my own observations with
diffidence, because I felt that they had been few and imper
 <U+017F>ect; but I think they are not useless, and that have, as I    I
then hoped, “pointed out an interesting field of inquiry, and
helped to show that a large portion of                        is still a sub
ject for Geological debate;” and besides, I am still convinced
 that my observations, as far as they went, were not inaccurate,
 as Mr. Griffith asserts, although his subsequent observations
 may have shown that some of my conclusions were so.
    M.     Griffith has represented the fault which is observable
at Brickeen Island (L. & E. Phil. Mag. vol. xvi. Pl. 2. fig. 2.)
as involving an upcast of about three thousand feet, and the
beds of chloritic slate, quartz-rock, and old red sandstone as
cropping out at a low angle on the south-eastern slopes of
Glena mountain, at the base of which the fault is to be seen.
    Now in this case           I am thoroughly convinced that my re
                      * Communicated      by the Author,

  on the Older Stratified Rocks near Killarney and Dublin. 271
presentation is correct and Mr. Griffith's incorrect; and as it
is a point easily accessible to any geologist who may visit
Killarney, I do hope that some one will take the trouble of
comparing the two observations.         I believe that the suc
cession of the strata is in exactly the reversed order, that
there is an anticlinal on the summit of Glena mountain, that
the strata on the south-eastern slopes dip to the S.E. at an
angle approaching very nearly to the perpendicular, and that
consequently the slates at the back of Lady Kenmare's cot
tage are in the highest and not the lowest part of the series
there developed.
    Mr. Griffith attaches much importance to the difference
of strike upon the opposite sides of the fault.    I  have made a
 great many careful observations, and although until we get a
 correct map it would be impossible to lay these down so as
 to draw any correct conclusions from them, I may observe
 that the observations taken at the same side of the fault vary
 quite as much among themselves as they do with those on the
 other side.
    In p. 173 Mr. Griffith says, “it appears to me that Mr.
 Hamilton is mistaken in separating the old red sandstone
 from the Devonian system;” but the very quotation he makes
 explains clearly that   I made no such separation, but referred
 the compact arenaceous rocks overlying the coarse red con
 glomerate to the upper part of the Devonian system.
     I shall not occupy your pages with other points in which
 I  am still hardy enough to rely upon my own observations in
 opposition to so high an authority as my friend Mr. Griffith;
 but   I could not leave these unnoticed, because   I wish to press
  upon the attention of geologists the fact that the difficulties
  of this district have not yet been cleared away, and that Mr.
  Griffith is premature in referring to the Silurian epoch, that
  vast depth of sandstone and conglomerate which occurs be
  tween the bays of Kenmare and Castlemaine, and the whole
  section between Foillatarriv and Brandon; I have before
  expressed my opinion (Journal of the Geological Society of
  Dublin, vol. i. p. 282.) that this latter section bears the
  strictest analogy to that between the Bangor quarries and
  Llyn Schal, and I see no reason for retracting that opinion.
        o Mr. Weaver’s remarks and insinuations of “an unre
  strained indulgence of fancy,” &c.,   I shall not reply; his ob
 jections to the possibility of the old red sandstone dipping in
  one place to the south, and another to the north, seem hardly
  to require an answer; and the correctness of his observations
   has been already subjected to a sufficiently rigorous inquiry
   by Mr. Griffith,

                             Temperature calculated
        The abscissa represents the temperature in degrees of the centigrade     thermometer, and
                                    the ordinate the height in miles.
  At first   the decrements of temperature are nearly equal for
equal increments of altitude.      These observations by no means
furnish so   good   a criterion of the accuracy of my formula as the
observations which have been made of the temperature of steam
and other vapours. The determination of the constants y and E
for the atmosphere must be repeated at some future time; for it is
obvious that no great reliance can be placed upon the extreme
precision of the values now obtained * until other ascents have
been made, and many similar observations have been compared to
gether.   We may then hope to obtain constants accurately apper
taining to a mean state of the atmosphere, and the variations which
take place in their values corresponding to fluctuations of the tem
perature; the pressure and the humidity of the atmosphere at the
earth's surface may then be investigated. . M. Biot has suggested
that balloons furnished with self-registering instruments should
be moored over each of the principal observatories of Europe. This
plan appears to me subject to great difficulties.   The weight of the
line attached will diminish the    buoyancy,  so that I apprehend it
will be found impossible to send up a balloon so fastened to any
considerable altitude.      The escape of gas will, I imagine, render
it very difficult to maintain the balloon at the same height for any
length of time. The height of the balloon will also be subject to
great variations from the tension of the line changing with the force
and direction of the wind.      I am disposed to attach much greater

value to well-regulated ascents, in which every effort should be
made to reach the highest possible altitude, and of course simulta
neous observations                          be made at the earth's surface at such
short intervals of time that every observation of the aéronaut may
be comparable with a similar observation at the surface of the earth.
As, however, the density and temperature of the atmosphere above
the height of five miles from the earth's surface can never be the
subject of direct experiment and observation, the observations which
                                                         j.
can be made upon the conditions of steam and other vapours will
always maintain an indirect importance from the light which they
throw upon the conditions of the atmosphere.                             I  do not think that
an examination of observations made in aérostatic ascents will ever
furnish a sure guide to the relation sought between the temperature
and the pressure, although if such a                                 is furnished by theory
and corroborated by observations of other vapours, (which can be
carried through a greater extent of the thermometric scale, and,
above all, through the low pressures where the variations of tem
perature become more rapid,) the obervations of aeronauts may
serve to determine with sufficient accuracy the constants involved in
the formula for atmospheric air.
    The following table”, calculated by Mr. Russell, shows the den
sity and temperature of the air at different altitudes, calculated by
means      of my expressions and with the constants

 It was   also inserted in the Annales for December, 1831 (p.402.).
 My     second series of Researches, bearing date of 21st of De
  cember, 1831, was read before the Royal Society on the 12th
  of January, 1832, and may be found in the Annales for June,
  1832 (p. 113–162.).           These are my only publications upon
  this  subject,  up  to the   present  time, excepting a few notes ap
  pended to memoirs by other authors; and the whole were
  written, and publicly read, anterior to any publication on
  the same subject, by any individual whatever.
     During this time, my letter to M. Hachette, which was                                          in
  serted in the Annales, attracted the attention of Messrs. Nobili
 and Antinori, and those laborious philosophers published a
 memoir, of the date of 31st of January, 1832, and which was
 thus posterior to                all
                              my publications.       This memoir        con                   is

 second memoir, entitled “New Electro-magnetic Experiments,”
 by   those gentlemen, dated 24th           March, 1832, appeared

words, for the correction of the errors committed in the ex
periments might have been left to time.
   Messrs. Nobili and Antinori write (Annales, vol. xlviii.
p. 428.), “Mr. Faraday considers M. Arago's magnetism of
rotation to be entirely connected with the phaenomenon which
he discovered ten years ago. He ascertained THEN, according
to the statement in the notice, that by the rotation of a metallic
disc under the influence of a magnet, electric currents may be
produced in the direction of the radii of the disc in sufficiently
considerable quantities to render the disc a new electrical ma
chine.    We are entirely ignorant how Mr. Faraday discovered
this fact, and we know not how a result of this nature could
remain So LoNG generally unknown, and, so to speak, FoR
GoTTEN in the hands of the discoverer,” &c.
   Now        I
           never said what is here imputed to me.      In my
letter to M. Hachette, quoted at the head of the notice,                            I
gave a short account of what I had recently discovered, and
read before the Royal Society on the 24th of the preceding
month.    This notice may be found at page 402 of the same
number of the Annales, and is as follows: “The fourth part
of the memoir treats of M. Arago's equally curious and ex
                                                                         nºi
traordinary experiment, which, as is known, consists in ma
king a metallic disc revolve under the influence of a magnet.
Mr. Faraday considers the phaenomenon which is
in this experiment as intimately connected with that of mag
netic rotation which he was so fortunate as to observe ten
years ago.    He has ascertained that by the rotation of the
metallic disc under the influence of a magnet, electric currents
may be formed in the direction of the radii of the disc, in
sufficient number to render the disc a new electrical ma
chine.”
     I
     never either said, or intended to say, that I had obtained
these electric currents by the rotation of a metallic disc, at an
epoch previous to the date of the memoir that      was then en      I
gaged in writing; but I said that the extraordinary effect dis
covered by M. Arago was connected in                             its
                                                         nature with

284         Mr.   Faraday on Magneto-electric Induction;
have always admired M. Arago's prudence and philosophic
reserve, in resisting the temptation to give a theory of the
effect which he had discovered until he could offer one per
fectly applicable, and in refusing his assent to the imperfect
theories of others. Admiring him I adopted his reserve in
this respect, and for that reason, perhaps, had my eyes open
to recognise the truth as soon as it was presented.
    We now arrive at that part of the subject which relates to
 the philosophy of my memoirs.            The fourth part of my me
 moir of the 24th of         November,     1831, contains my opinion
 on the cause of the phaenomenon discovered by                  Arago, º
 an opinion that even now               I
                                   see no reason to alter. , Messrs.
 Nobili and    Antinori,     in their papers of the 31st of January
 and 24th of      March,     1832, animadvert upon certain errors
 which they attrilute to me, and enter upon extended deve
 lopments of magneto-electric phaenomena.                          I
                                                          cannot, how
 ever, discern that they have added a single fact to those con
 tained in my memoirs, unless it be the obtaining of a spark
 with a common magnet, a result that I had myself previously
 obtained, but only with the electro-magnet.              On the other
 hand, these gentlemen's memoirs appear to me to contain
 erroneous ideas upon the nature of magneto-electric currents;
 they exhibit also mistaken views as to the action and direction
 of those currents in Arago's revolving disc.               They say,
 “We have recently verifted, extended, and perhaps corrected in
 some particulars      the results of the English philosopher,” &c.
 (Annales, vol. 1. p. 281.)      And again at page 298, comment
 ing on what they suppose to be my ideas (for though my
 papers had been read, and were published, they had not
  thought proper to consult them), they say, “We have                                al
 ready given our opinion upon this idea, but if at the com
  mencement of our researches it were difficult to reconcile it
  with the nature of the currents discovered by M. Faraday, what
  can we say after      allthe new observations that we have made
 during the progress              of
                               our investigations       We say that we
                                                               2

 means the question must                be
                                    decided.”
     With the most sincere desire                         be

be necessary to refer to any experiments that are not therein
contained.
   It is not my intention further to animadvert upon Messrs.
Nobili and Antinori's first memoir. An English translation
of it appeared in the Philosophical Magazine”, to which I
added some corrections in the form of notes, copies of which
I had the honour of sending to you, and to the authors. My
present object is to compare the second part of their publica
tions with the fourth part of my first memoir, and with parts
of the other memoirs, as a means of throwing light upon the
general principles.    The intention of the two articles is to
explain Arago's phaenomenon, and as fortunately they are
both contained in the fiftieth volume of the Annales, they may
be referred to with facility.    The reference to my own papers
will be thus, (F. 114.), and to those of Messrs. Nobili and
Antinori by a simple indication of the page of the Annales.
   At page 281, after a few general remarks, we read, “We
have recently verified, extended, and perhaps corrected in
some particulars the results of the English philosopher; we
then said that magnetism of rotation found a real support in
the new facts developed by Mr. Faraday, and that, conse
quently, the theory of such magnetism then appeared to
be so far advanced as fully to merit an effort to develope
the physical principles upon which it depends.            It is to this
object that the present article is devoted,” &c.      Upon this ex
tract I  shall only remark, that exactly four months previously
I   had said the same thing, in the memoir that I read before
the Royal Society, and had given, what I hope will prove, a
true and exact explanation of the philosophy of the effect
 under consideration (F.4–80.).
    At page 282 we read, “We have already noticed these
 currents in our first researches, that             is,
                                                  the first paper

 “already noticed these currents” four months earlier (F. 90.).
    At page 283 are described “galvanometrical explorers                            or
 probes,” which are nothing more than what had previously de

wire placed in any situation occupied by a cylinder, and I
have shown that they produce currents in their state of rota
tion, if their opposite extremities are connected with the gal
Vallometer.
   It is said at page 284, that the formation of currents is
“wholly due to another condition, they being manifested only
at the moment when the spirals are brought near to the mag
nets, or removed from them. So long as the spirals are pre
sent, whether they move or not, there is no current.         So also
there is none in the case of central rotation,” &c.     Now in my
first paper I showed that the essential condition was not the
approximation or removal of the metal in movement, but
simply that it should intersect the magnetic curves (F. 101.
 116. 118. &c.); and that consequently, caeteris paribus, the
movement without change of distance is the most effective
and powerful means of obtaining the current, instead of being
the condition in which the result is absolutely nothing.          In
my second paper I proved that a movement through the mag
netic curves was the only condition necessary (F. 217.); and
that so far from the approximation or removal of the metal
being necessary, currents may be produced in the magnet
itself, merely by moving it in the proper direction (F. 220.).
    Lastly, when treating of this “central arrangement,” and
the supposed absence of effect when “the points of the disc
remain constantly at the same distance from the magnetic
pole,” Messrs. Nobili and Antinori say (p. 285.), “by thus
renewing the combination of continued presence to which
Mr. Faraday's new laws in relation to currents do not assign
any effect;” and in a note we read, “These laws are reduced
to three,” which are specified, at first fully, and then in a more
condensed form, as follows: “FIRST LAw.            During gradual
approximation: the current produced contrary to the current
producing; repulsion between the two systems.               Second
LAw. The distance unvarying. No effect. THIRD Law.
During recession. The current produced in the same direc
tion as the current producing.       Attraction between the two
systems.”    I have never myself given these as the simple laws
which govern the production of the currents that I was so
fortunate as to discover; nor do I understand how Messrs.
Nobili and Antinori can say that they are my laws, though at
page 282 one of them is so called.         But I described these
three cases together in my first memoir (F. 26. 39. 53.), as
well as in the notice, that   is,    my letter
                                    in           to  M. Hachette,
as  effects that I  had observed.        It
                                         has been   established,  by
what I    have already said, that they are not the laws      of  the
action  of  magnetic  electricity, for the  simple  fact that cur

rents of electricity may be obtained by means of the re
volution of a cylinder (F. 219.), or of a disc in connection
with a magnet (F. 218.), or of the magnet itself (F.220.), dis
proves         of them. ONE LAw, which includes all the ef

when moistened with water.
   At first sight was obvious that

                         ...;
considerably adulterated; for not only was their colour much
deeper than that          ordinary linseed oil, but they were all
                            of
extremely viscid,                    castor oil,     this respect, much

more than the comparatively thin and fluid commercial                                              lin

the  latter,  that the adulterant was common colophony (black
rosin),I     endeavoured         ascertain whether my conjecture
                                      to
was well-founded, and           so,if   determine the proportion

colophony contained           the several samples; especially
                                 in                                   the                     as
adulterated oils were       likely     become the subject

these unsuccessful trials; I therefore at once proceed to ex
plain the mode I ultimately adopted for detecting and esti

specimens of oil.
     I
     found that when colophony was dissolved in pyroxylic
spirit, the solution gave a bulky white precipitate, on the ad
dition of acetate of lead also dissolved in pyroxylic spirit; but
that when unadulterated commercial linseed             was digested               oil

100 grs. of rosin.
    This experiment was repeated with 40 grs. of rosin dis
solved in a little oil, and this mixture treated in the manner
above described.       In this instance 267 grs. of the precipitate
were obtained, which is equal to 66.7 per cent. of the resin
employed.       It appears, from these experiments, that although
this method is incapable of affording strictly accurate results,
I  presume from the slight solvent action of the spirit upon the
precipitate, yet that an approximation to the quantity of colo
phony contained in oils adulterated with this substance, may
be obtained, which perhaps by some subsequent modifications
of and precautions in the process, may lead to a mode ca
pable of yielding not merely a tolerable approximation, but
 rigidly accurate results.
    When unadulterated commercial linseed oil is treated with
 rectified spirit in the manner described, the alcoholic solution
 affords no precipitate on the addition of a spirituous solution
 of acetate of lead, but it merely becomes turbid, exhibiting
 appearances very different from the bulky precipitate which
 is produced if colophony be present. The samples of adul
 terated       oil

observes, is only disengaged at the positive electrode. He also finds
that the odoriferous principle can be preserved in well-closed glass

odour are gold and platina; but dilute sulphuric, phosphoric, and

   The author finds that              long pillars

the resistance to crushing by flexure is about three times greater
when the ends of the pillars are flat, than when they are rounded.
A long uniform cast-iron pillar, with its ends firmly fixed, whether
by means of disks or otherwise, has the same power to resist break
ing as a pillar of the same diameter, and half the length, with the
ends rounded, or turned so that the force would pass through the axis.
The strength of a pillar with one end round and the other flat, is
the arithmetical mean between that of a pillar of the same dimen
sions with both ends round, and one with both ends flat.                        Some
additional    strength    is given   to a  pillar   by   enlarging       diameter              its                   in
the middle part.

pillars with relation              to

 Professor Forbes's empirical formula respecting the gradual diminu
 tion of the daily oscillations of the barometer, within certain limit
 hours, from the equator to the poles.          Professor Forbes has laid
 down an assumed curve, in which the diurnal oscillation amounts
 to 1190 at the equator and 0 in lat. 64° 8' N., and beyond that lati
 tude the tide should occur with a contrary sign, plus becoming minus.
 Now Alten being nearly in lat. 70°, if Professor Forbes's law hold
 good, the maxima of the diurnal oscillations should occur at the
 hour for the minima at the equator, and a similar inversion should
 take place with respect to the minima.          Mr. Thomas has himself
 however modified the value his observations would otherwise have
had, by adopting 2 P.M., instead of 3 P.M., for the hour of his ob
 servations for the fall; and he has adapted his barometrical ob
 servations to a mean temperature of 50° Fahr., instead of 32°.
 The first year's observations commence on the 1st October, 1837,
 and terminate on the 30th September, 1838. The barometer stood
 66 feet 5 inches above low-water mark, and the thermometer hung
 at 6 feet above the ground; but care was not always taken to pre
 vent the sun shining on            The mean height
                                       it.                   the barometer     of

most coincident with the freezing point, viz., 32°-017.                  The
 maximum height         of
                        the barometer was 30°-89         January, and thein
 minimum 28°71 in October.           The mean of the barometer at                                   9

stated that globules approach one another and coalesce to form
threads, which in many places have the appearance of a necklace,
but subsequently lose the traces of division, and become cylinders.

Dumont to receive it on his behalf, said:—
      DR. FITToN,
  I  am highly gratified that it has become my duty on the present
occasion, to commit to your care as the Representative of
                                                          our common
friend, Professor Dumont, the Wollaston Gold Medal,
                                                            which has
been awarded to him by the Council of this Society for his Me
moir on the Geological Constitution of the province of Liége pub
lished at Brussels in 1832.
   The grounds of our tardy recognition in 1840, of the merits
of a work published so long as eight years ago, are the same, that in
1830, prompted the Judges appointed by the Academy
                                                         of Brussels,
to select this Memoir as most worthy of the Prize then proposed by
that Academy, for the best Geological description of the province
 which has formed the subject of M. Dumont's successful labours.
   In the work thus doubly crowned, the Author has described the
mineralogical and zoological characters of the rocks
                                                         which occupy
this district, and determined in minute detail, the relative places in
order of succession, and the superficial extent of each subordinate
division of the several formations.         He has also illustrated the
same by an accurately coloured Geological Map, and by coloured
Sections, showing the general disposal of the strata in
                                                           their original
order of deposition, and the extraordinary derangements and dis
turbances that have subsequently thrown them into a state of almost
inextricable confusion.     In the execution of this work, M. Dumont
has evidenced unusual powers of discriminating and accurate obser.
vation, combined with a high capacity of reducing
                                                        the minutiae of
local details under the dominion of enlarged and masterly theo
retical generalizations.    Advancing at the early age of twenty one,
to a task of gigantic labour, in a region where the unexampled dis
turbances, and almost incredible complexity of             its
                                                      component strata
had baffled the sagacity          of
                                 the most experienced geologists, this
extraordinary youth        at
                          once withdraws the veil           of
                                                       confusion which
 had hitherto disguised the stratigraphical arrangements         of

province, and   as     were,       by   an

placing into your hands the award that has been made to you by the
Council of the Geological Society, of one year's interest of the Wol
laston Fund, in order to facilitate the continuation of your researches
in Mineral Conchology.—The services are great which have been
rendered to Geology by the extremely useful and well-timed work
on fossil shells, which was many years ago begun by your excellent
father, and continued by him to the end of his life, and has been
since conducted by yourself; and the association of his name with
that of Dr. Wollaston, recalls to my mind, as it must to the minds of
most of my hearers, pleasing and grateful recollections of the bene
fits which during their lives they both conferred on this Society,

   D.D., F.R.S., Corresponding Member of the Institute of France,
   President of the Society.
      GENTLEMEN,
By    the Report just read, you have      seen that the state of our
 Society is one of steady and salutary progression; forty-three new
 Members have been added to the List of our Fellows, from which
seventeen have been removed by death or resignation, leaving our
actual number 768, with an increase of twenty-six during the last
year. The vacancies that have occurred upon our foreign list have
been supplied by three highly distinguished cultivators of science
on the Continent, each pre-eminent for his successful labours in high
departments of our subject, namely:
   Major Puillon de Boblaye, in Positive Geology,
   Professor Adolphe Brongniart, in Vegetable Palaeontology,
   Professor Gustave Rose, in Crystallography and Mineral Analysis.
   We are rich in property, though our funds are, at this moment,
low, but they will speedily be repaired by the sale of two large
and costly parts which have been added to our Transactions.
   The Reports of the Library and Collections in our Museum are
satisfactory.    The chief additions to the former consist of presents
from Authors and Members of the Society.          Our principal bene
factor has been Mr. Greenough, who has given us a Collection of
the older Authors, supplying many of our deficiencies in the
Literature of Geology and Mineralogy. Considerable progress has
been made in the arrangement of the Cabinets by our Sub-Curator,
Mr. Woodward, under the superintendence and directions of Mr.
Lonsdale; one hundred and sixty drawers of rock specimens and
fossil remains having been labelled, and in part catalogued, since the
meeting of last year. It is satisfactory to find that the number
of persons who come to study our Collections has been much in
creased.
   Our entire establishment continues to receive the inestimable
advantages it has long enjoyed, from the zealous superintendence,
and scientific acquirements of our Curator, Mr. Lonsdale.
   Our Wollaston Medal has been awarded to Professor Dumont,
for his Map, Sections and Memoir on the Geological Constitution

of the Province of Liége, published in 1832; and one year's interest
of the Wollaston Fund has been presented to Mr. James De Carle
Sowerby, to facilitate the continuation of his researches in Mineral
Conchology.
    More than a quarter of a century has now elapsed since I became
a Member of this Society; and fifteen years have passed since I was
first placed, by your kindness, in the honourable position of filling
this Chair, at that important period of our history when we received
the national recognition of a Royal Charter.        I shall never cease
to consider it one of the brightest rewards of my labours in geology,
that my name is enrolled in that charter, as the first President of the
Society in       its
                corporate capacity.
    Since that important  epoch, our chartered body has received from
the Government         the country the valuable sanction and advantage
                            of
of   anestablishment       the very convenient apartments

House, which we now occupy.           The number and character        the                          of
scientific labourers who have joined our ranks, and the volumes
added      our Transactions, since these events, show that such en
          to
couragements have not been conferred                 society disposed on   a                            to
slumber under the sunshine          prosperity; of

advantages, we have endeavoured           maintain   steadily progressive

course,     the great work
            in                  illustrating the physical structure
                                           of                         the                          of

   Occultations of Stars by the Moon to the end of 1839.       By Ro
bert Snow,   Esq.                              -
   Catalogue of the Pleiades.   By Robert Snow, Esq.
   The author states that this catalogue  does not lay claim to strict
accuracy, but was constructed in order to form a chart, which might
be consulted with advantage when occultations of stars in the
Pleiades by the moon take place.     Piazzi's stars falling within the
limits of the chart were taken as standards, and the differences be
tween them and the other stars determined by a wire micrometer.
For some stars, too faint to allow of illumination, the ring microme
ter was used; but they were more usually put down by estimation,
which may be done with nicety when many are in the field together.

312 Royal Astronomical Society:—Sir             J.  F. W.   Herschel
which far exceeded my idea at the moment of what was its natural
state.     Proceeding to compare it with other stars of the first magni
tude (Sirius being, of course, out of the question), their arrange
ment for the night was found to be as follows:
Capella     II   a Orionis |  Rigel  Il Procyon  ||  Aldebaran   | Pollux.
    “In this and subsequent arrangements of the same sort, the
number of vertical strokes between the names indicates the estimated
amount of interval, or the grades or steps of magnitude by which
the stars differ.        Thus, the step from Capella to a Orionis is a
great one; that from a Orionis to Rigel, a distinct but moderate one;
 from Rigel to Procyon, a great one, admitting of the easy insertion
 of a star decidedly inferior to one, and superior to the other, between
 them ; from Procyon to Aldebaran, a very great step, admitting, at
 least, two such insertions of imaginary stars decidedly diverse in
 lustre between them; and so on.           Now as I distinctly recollected
 having, on a great many occasions, placed a Orionis nearly on a par
 with Aldebaran, there could be no doubt of a change. Referring
 next morning to my father's Catalogues of Comparative Brightness,
  I find that he makes the star in question slightly inferior, or at most
 equal, to Procyon, and much greater than Aldebaran.
     “In consequence of this observation, I proceeded forthwith to
 draw out in order all the comparisons of a Orionis with other stars
 made at the Cape, on the voyage homewards, and since my return.
  In so doing, I must confess I was hardly less surprised than at the
 sight of the star itself to find in my star-lists, containing the results
  of a partial reduction and arrangement of my Cape observations,
 a Orionis not merely marked as variable, but distinct entries made
 of it in that list at its maximum and minimum,_the maximum
 being stated as above Rigel, the minimum below Aldebaran.           This,
 however, had entirely escaped my memory, but being thus recalled,
  and so forcibly corroborated, I resolved to watch the star more nar
  rowly in future; the more especially as it seemed to follow, from
  the tenour of the observations, that its diminution of brightness
  was likely to be rapid : and so, in fact, it has proved to be.”
     The author then proceeds to give the observations on which the
  evidence of the former changes of the star is grounded. They extend
  over the years 1836, 1837, 1838, and 1839, and are as follows (de
  noting, for brevity, a Orionis by the word Orion):—

        22.   Rigel, Procyon, Aldebaran, Orion, Pollux, Regulus.
Nov. 26. Orion, Rigel, Procyon, Aldebaran, Pollux.
    On examining the above series, the general order of arrangement
(leaving out Orion) is found to be Rigel, Procyon, Achernar, Alde
baran, a Crucis, Pollur, Regulus; and the instances in which the
arrangement is different are accounted for by some peculiar circum
stances connected with the observations.          Thus, with respect to
the observation of October 24, 1837, the author states that the mis
placement of Achernar is accountable for by the circumstance of the
two comparisons of Orion having been made (as appears by the
notices high and low) first when rising with Achernar then high,
and Rigel low; and at a later period of the night with Rigel then
high, and, consequently, Achernar low. On January 2, 1838,
a Crucis is set down as inferior to Pollur; but these two stars are
difficult of comparison, both from situation and difference in colour,
and from being, in fact, not very different in lustre.        The trans
position of Procyon and Rigel in the observation of the 14th of
April, 1838, is unaccountable, except from some unsuspected partial
haziness in that part of the sky. This observation was made at sea.
    With regard to Orion, the observations evidently show three
maxima, viz. in Nov. 1836, Oct. 1837, and Nov. 1839; and also
 three minima, viz. those of March 1836, Jan. 1838, and Jan. 1839.
 “Reasoning from this, the most obvious conclusion is that of an
 annual, or nearly annual period.      But in that case, we must admit
 the decrease to be comparatively sudden, and the increase slow;
 whereas, if we admit of a period of about six months, this supposi
 tion will not be necessary, and as the star cannot be observed (for
 this purpose) in the summer months, there is no prima facie reason
 against adopting the latter period; respecting which, however,
 further observation will soon enlighten us.”
    The observations subsequent to Nov. 26, 1839, confirmed the
 expected decrease of the star in a very decided manner:—
     1839.   Nov. 30. Rigel | Orion, Procyon || Aldebaran.
             Dec. 11. Rigel | Orion          |  Procyon || Aldebaran.
                   29.   Rigel,  Procyon,  Orion,  Aldebaran.
     1840.   Jan. 2. Rigel || Procyon | Orion || Aldebaran.
                    5.   Rigel || Procyon | Orion || Aldebaran.
                    6.   Rigel || Procyon || Orion || Aldebaran.
     In a note to this last observation, it is stated that “the difference
  between Orion and Aldebaran is evidently and rapidly on the de
  crease. The stars are    all  high,  at nearly equal altitudes, and ad
  mirably arranged for comparison.”

    “M. Poisson, in a late memoir, has considered the possible con
sequences, in a geological point of view, of the sun and solar system
having, in long by-gone ages, passed through a region in which
the actual temperature of space should be much greater than in its
present locality t. The great authority justly attributed to every
idea thrown out by this philosopher, must render it a matter of dif
fidence and difficulty to maintain a contrary view.           Without, how
ever, as a matter of abstract speculation, denying this possibility,
I would observe that the temperature at any given point of space
can arise only from two sources: 1st, That of the aether, as a fluid
susceptible of increase and diminution of temperature; and, 2ndly,
The radiation of the stars. Of the temperature of the aether as a
fluid, I confess I have no conception.           Of the existence of such a
 fluid as the efficient cause of light, we have demonstrable evidence.
But the properties of heat are so linked and interwoven with those
 of light, that it is asking more than can be granted to demand our
 admission that the aether is a fluid capable of being heated and cooled,
 while it is yet undecided (with a leaning to the affirmative side)
 whether it be not the efficient cause of heat itself.
     “As regards the radiation of the stars.-There is a region in the
 heavens where starlight is decidedly more dense than elsewhere—
 the milky way.        And we have, I may almost say, ocular evidence

Of these, there is none which can be compared to Uranus in intrinsic
brightness, to say nothing of the moon.       Supposing, then, our
system to be suddenly plunged into the bosom of one of these
nebulae, an increase of temperature would take place less than that
which would arise from superadding to our own that which the
surface of Uranus receives from the sun, or less than the 400th part
of that which we actually receive from it; and this supposes
 Uranus to reflect all the light incident on                              it.

test of the value of commercial iodide of potassium, assuming the
salt of which we are now speaking as a standard of comparison.
How far it may be depended upon as a test, will appear from what
follows.
    If tartaric acid in solution be added to a solution of pure iodide
of potassium, the commixed solutions are at first colourless, but
quickly become slightly yellow, owing to the action of atmospheric
oxygen on the hydriodic acid which is thus generated.
   On making this experiment with the salt in question, I found,
to my great astonishment, that free iodine, in quantity, was                                                                       in
stantly developed. I was at first at a loss to account for so great a
difference in the behaviour of this salt to that which I had prepared
myself, and knew to be pure iodide of potassium; but from the ap
pearance of the crystals of this salt, and from the circumstance of
its not being soluble in water to the extent that it should be, I
 suspected the existence of iodate of potash in                    and have since             it,       I
convinced myself          the fact    of        presence. of       its

                                               who sent specimen                                            a                     of

both by heat and solution in water.
   M. Dumas found that the gas extricated from this variety of salt,
when mixed with oxygen gas, detonated like hydrogen; nevertheless
he supposed carbon to exist in                              it.

 line was carried from the Bristol Channel to the English
 Channel by Mr. Bunt, under my direction: the conclusion
 which I drew from the operation was, that the mean height
 of the sea was at the same level at the two extremities of the
line; and this conclusion Mr. Thomas disputes. I beg to
offer a few observations on the subject, suggested by his re
marks.

    In the first place, will make one or two observations on
the theoretical view of the subject. It is certain (although
this view does not appear to be familiar to most of those
 who turn their thoughts to the question) that according to
theory, the mean surface of the sea (in open water) is invari
able in    itsheight; and that however different may             the          be

consistent with mechanical principles; for the difference of
pressures in different parts of the channel is precisely the
force by which the tide-wave is transferred along the channel.
These oscillations of the pressure and of the surface, corre
spond to each other; being respectively the changes of force
and the motion produced.             But the deviations above and
below the mean pressure and the mean surface, balance each
other in the course of a few hours.                If the mean surface
were not a level surface, the mean pressures would not be in
equilibrium, and there would be in one part of the fluid a
permanent resulting excess of mean pressure; which excess
                                                                                                    a its

therefore affect the mean waters as                            deduced from these. Thus,
for instance, the diurnal inequality at Bristol might make two
successive high waters differ by four feet; and thus would
make the height of mean water differ by two feet, according
as the one or the other of these high waters was compared
with the intermediate low water.            Add to such inequalities
those arising from the varying pressure of the atmosphere,
the wind, and the like, and we may easily conceive the pos
sibility of such deviations from constancy in the half-tide
mark as Mr. Thomas records.                 Yet these deviations do
not prevent the mean of any fortnight's observations from
being constant within a very few inches; as it will be found
to be at Liverpool, Plymouth, and any other place similarly
circumstanced.
    It will be observed, that I allow that in a river the line of
 mean water slopes towards the sea; but this condition does
 not affect either end of our level line; and therefore I consi
 der that the result which we obtained, namely, that the height
 of mean water is the same at                             its
                                          two extremities, represents
 the general condition of the ocean.

326     Mr. Gulliver             on certain Peculiarities            of form in the
 under which these particles were produced; and although
 my researches have not hitherto proved perfectly satisfactory
 in this respect, yet it appears to me that they afford evidence
 that the blood corpuscles have a contractility or irritability
 inherent in themselves, which may continue some time after
 their removal from the body, and enable them to assume
 permanently the very anomalous forms which I have de
  scribed and figured.         In some instances a large number of
 the red   granulated     particles   appeared to be produced by the
 irregular shrinking of the smooth discs”, in others there was
 a manifest contraction of the particles while under examina
 tion in their own serumt, and the corpuscles were very
 quickly and remarkably modified in figure when extravasated
 and subjected to contact with the neighbouring                   tissuesi,
 evincing the readiness with which the blood discs assume
 new forms, perhaps connected with the plastic force.                It has
 appeared to me also, that in some cases modifications in
 the shape of the blood discs might be attributable in great
 measure to violent action of the heart produced by the fright
 and struggles of the animal; for when the blood was ob
 tained without at           alarming him the irregular corpuscles
                               all
 were not      numerous,     while these particles were seen abun
 dantly     in blood which was taken when the deer was con
 fined, and made every effort               struggle and get loose,
                                                     to                                       so
 that the circulation became            greatly   accelerated.           the            In
 Muntjac,        avery shy and wild animal, the peculiar particles
 were always seen         great numbers; but from the more docile

operation, and           such cases the irregular shapes were ob
                          in

328      Mr. Gulliver         on certain Peculiarities              of form in   the
in any class of animals. . These corpuscles I have examined
particularly in the Muntjac, Porcine, and Mexican Deer.
    Iobserved in the blood of these animals a large quantity of
crescentic or lunated particles, besides a few of the common
circular figure. The former are very remarkable from their
great number and distinct shape; they are acutely pointed at
the ends, gibbous in the middle, with a convex and concave
margin; or being without the concavity, they merely present
the figure of the segment of a circle.
    But there are other forms equally singular: frequently they
are not curved, but straight, and gibbous at the sides—lanceo
late, to use a botanical term; occasionally they are obtuse at
one end, something like a comma in shape; or, from an acute
projection of the convexpart, approaching to atriangular figure.
I   have seen them also nearly square, and not uncommonly
with elongation of the angles and concavity of the margins,
the latter peculiarities being also sometimes observable in
the triangular particles.     Finally, they may present a sigmoid
 figure, as if from twisting of the ends of the lanceolate forms.
    Like the common blood discs, these peculiar corpuscles
are easily deprived of their colouring matter and rendered                             in
visible by water; but if only a very small quantity of this fluid
be added to them, they quickly swell out and assume an oval
or circular figure, forming, by the approximation of their
edges, long bead-like strings. When treated with saline solu
tions, the oblong particles become rather smaller, but preserve
their figure tolerably well.
    These singular particles constitute the greater number of
those present in the serum, particularly if the blood be kept
three or four hours after having been taken from the animal;
and the forms are often well preserved in cool weather for
nearly a week; in perfectly recent blood they seem to be rather
less numerous, although in a short time                       all
                                                 the shapes may                        be
recognized abundantly".
    If  these singular corpuscles are merely the result      changes       of
of   form   in the circular   discs,  such transformations would
appear   to      be
                 altogether peculiar, and             at
                                              variance with      our             all
previous knowledge            of
                           the blood  corpuscles    the mammalia.   of
    The first impression will probably           that some    be  the            of
forms   I  have described are those which may          presented     be                by

therefore exactly coinciding with that of the first combina
tion.    From the above-mentioned composition of the latter,                                                         ,
it appeared    probable that the small quantity of sulphur in it
was combined with the likewise only small quantity of copper
forming the sulphuret of copper; and that this was merely
mechanically mixed with the remainder of the combination.
This seemed to be the more admissible, as small quantities
of the sulphuret of copper often collect as slag (speise) on
the floor of the smalt-ovens at Modum".          The analysis of
the second combination       proves,  however,  that copper and
sulphur do not stand in any relation, for here the quantity of
the first is increased to 8.90 per cent., while that   the latter                          ..
amounts merely to 0:50 per cent.
   With respect to the formula for the two combinations, it
must turn out to be the same for both, as the atomic rela

in an ammoniacal fluid, from which it has to be precipitated by sulphuret

lized in octahedrons, and is deposited from the smalt fur

to the second cobalt ore described in the preceding Article,
and is evidently the product of a further process of purifica
tion: nor was it obtained directly from a smalt-work, but
from the German silver manufactory of Mr. Henniger in
Berlin. This process of purification seems to resemble that
which is practised at Modum with the cobalt ores.
                           i.
   The analysis was performed in the laboratory of Professor
                                         sº
Henry Rose; and         course pursued quite similar to that
employed for combinations of arsenic. The nickel and iron,
however, were not separated by succinate of ammonia, but
determined according to Dr.               method. The result
of the analysis was
                     Sulphur............   101
                     Arsenic ............ 34.07

                                      10'06      101*00.
   The    peroxide  of iron obtained was   again  dissolved in hy
 drochloric acid, and precipitated by ammonia in excess. Sul
 phuret of ammonium produced no perceptible alteration in
 the filtered ammoniacal fluid. From the obtained oxide of
nickel, however, 0.009 grammes of nickeliferous peroxide of
iron were separated by solution and the addition of ammonia:
 which quantity had not been separated by the above method.
   In this separation, therefore, Dr. Scheerer's method gave
a better result than that with succinate of ammonia in the
analysis of the cobalt ore described in the preceding Article.
   If it be admitted that the slight quantity of sulphur takes
the place  of a part of the arsenic, the atomic weight of the ar
senic is to that of the other metals as
                                7-74 : 18:10,
therefore, exactly as in the combinations detailed in the pre
ceding Article. The formula for this nickel ore would ac
cordingly likewise be

In this case the atomicproportion should be
                            7.74 : 18:06,
coinciding,    therefore, very nearly with that given by the     ana
lysis.   If,   onthe other hand, the formula

and with this the analysis agrees exceedingly well. According
to the second formula (Ni" As”), on the contrary, the compo
sition should be

   Now, whichever formula may be considered as most cor
rect, thus much is certain, that the combinations described in
the preceding Paper, and in this, are by no means composed
according to simple relations, as 1 : 2, or 2: 3; nor will this
appear at      all
               extraordinary,                 in

forms   anacid  consisting           of
                               two atoms                         of
                                             radical and five atoms
                      to is,
of oxygen.      It   indeed, questionable whether the formula Ni"
As”, laid claim                by
                         Prof. Wöhler for the nickel ore analysed
 by him, does not likewise possess                          an
                                           atomic relation similar
to that of the combinations here treated of.
   Now the proportion            3:5 approach one another very

     OISSON,    in his Mémoire sur le Mouvement de la Lune autour de

sion for the variation of the semi-axis major contains no argument
of long period, accompanied by a               of m less than m”. In
this  paper  he has taken into account the terms which arise from

   In the Lunar Theory terms of the order mº, and of the nature of
those under consideration, may arise not only in the third but in
every succeeding approximation, and hence it becomes absolutely

 LI.       Some Observations   on the aqueous Solution of Carbonate

 I       HAVE been   induced to institute some experiments on the
     solution of carbonate of magnesia in water strongly im
pregnated with carbonic acid gas, in consequence of the high
 repute, on very questionable grounds, which it has lately ac
 quired as a medicine.
    The solution I have used is that prepared and sold by Mr.
 Dinneford of New Bond-street, with the designation of Dinne
ford's Solution of Magnesia, and with the following recom
mendation on the label: “The great advantages of this elegant

who have examined this compound; the variation or want of
perfect accordance, probably chiefly depends on the degree
of dryness of the preparation examined, or on the quantity
of water retained in the powder admitting of expulsion at
212°, which water being hygrometrical, at least in part, must
vary with the degree of dryness of the atmosphere to which
it is exposed.
    The method by which these two compounds of magnesia
and carbonic acid were analysed was a simple one, admitting
of considerable accuracy.
  . The quantity of water expelled at a temperature of 212°
was determined by exposure of an hour or more to the heat
of a steam-bath; the quantity of carbonic acid, by acting on
the compounds, very carefully weighed, by muriatic acid,
saturated with carbonic acid, over mercury in a graduated
tube; and the quantities of magnesia and of water expelled at
a higher temperature than 212° by the action of a red heat,
continued for two or three hours, till no further loss of weight
was produced by a continuance of the high temperature.                   In
estimating the proportion of carbonic acid, the calculation was
made on the ground that 100 cubic inches of this gas weigh
47.262 grains.

an insoluble carbonate containing a smaller proportion of car
bonic acid; and in the other, that the same insoluble subcar

the proportion of carbonic acid required for this being ex
pelled in the form of gas. The results of the trials         have            I
made have not confirmed either of these conclusions.       It has
appeared to me to dissolve both in hot and in cold water,

                                              have not been able
to obtain an insoluble subcarbonate of magnesia by acting on
the prismatic salt by cold water, or carbonic acid gas from it
by boiling water, for instance, boiling it in distilled water in a
retort connected with a mercurial pneumatic apparatus.          It
is true, that when this carbonate is thrown into hot water,
there is a disengagement of air, but the air is common air me
chanically entangled, not carbonic acid gas which had been
chemically combined.
   Both the hot solution and the cold, on evaporation, yielded
the prismatic compound. 1000 grains of water at the tempera
ture of 60° appear capable of holding in solution about four
grains; thus 326:6 grains of the solution of carbonate, after the
excess of carbonic acid gas had been expelled by the air-pump,

350                  Professor  Daniell on the
to the amount of electrolytic force in action, with a view to
increase our knowledge of the constitution of saline bodies in
general.
   For this purpose an apparatus was constructed in the fol
lowing manner, which Mr. Daniell calls “the double dia
phragm cell.”
   “It  consists of two cells formed of two glass cylinders, with
collars at their lower ends, fitted by grinding to a stout glass
tube bent into the form of the letter U, and firmly fixed on
a wooden foot.      The ends of this piece project a little into
the interior of the two cylinders, the upper extremities of
which are furnished with bent tubes for the collection of
gases.    A stout piece of platinum wire is ground to the upper
part of each cell, to which an electrode of platinum or any
other metal can be screwed on the inside, as occasion may
require: the wires pass down upon the outside, and terminate
in two mercury cups, by which connexion can be made, at
pleasure, with the battery.      Each cell will hold about seven
cubic inches of liquid, and the connecting tube two inches.
When the cell is charged, the connecting tube is filled with
the liquid, and a piece of fine bladder tied over each end, so
as perfectly to exclude the air. The bladders are firmly con
fined to their places by means of circular grooves ground
round the ends of the glass tube. The cylinders are then
carefully fitted to their places, and filled with the proper
quantities of the solutions to be acted upon, and after the
operation their contents are easily decanted.” The quantity
of liquid in each cell during the experiment was about 4.5
cubic inches. The power employed was that of a small con
stant battery of Mr. Daniell's construction, containing thirty
cells six inches in height, with tubes of porous earthenware,
charged in the ordinary manner. (See Phil. Trans. for the
year 1836.)
   From this battery the current was made to pass through
the apparatus just described, filled with a solution of the salt
to be examined, say sulphate of soda.      A common voltame
ter charged with dilute sulphuric acid, was also included in
the circuit, so that the mixed gases evolved might be collected,
in order to ascertain the exact amount of electrolytic force
really in circulation.
   The gas given off from each side from the double dia
phragm cell was also collected, and the united bulk of the
oxygen and hydrogen so evolved was found to be exactly
equal to the volume of the mixed gases collected from the
common voltameter. From numerous experiments it was found,
that on decanting the saline liquid from each cell, and care

               Electrolysis    of Secondary  Compounds.           351
 fully neutralizing   with acid or alkali, as the case might re
 quire, the quantity of salt decomposed was almost, if not ex
 actly, equivalent to the gas evolved.
     (Thus if 11.8 cubic inches of oxygen had been evolved from
 the zincode, and 23.6 cubic inches of hydrogen from the
 platinode [the results of the decomposition of 4.5 grains of
 water], by neutralization it was found that the zincode cell
 contained about 20 grains of free sulphuric acid, and the
 platinode 16 grains of free soda, numbers which are equiva
 lent to the quantity of water decomposed; meantime from
 the single voltameter 35.4 cubic inches of mixed gases [also
 the result of the decomposition of 4.5 grains of water] had
 been collected).
    These experiments were repeated upon sulphate of potass,
phosphate of soda, sulphate of ammonia, showing the analogy
 of ammonia with metallic salts, and nitrate of potass, with
 corresponding results. The determination of the quantity of
 alkali in the latter instance was not possible, owing to the
 formation of a quantity of ammonia at the platinode, from the
reaction of the disengaged hydrogen upon the nitric acid of
the salt.
    The carbonates were examined in a similar manner with
like results. Oralate of ammonia yielded nothing but pure
carbonic acid at the zincode, whilst hydrogen and ammonia
appeared at the platinode.        The reason of this is evident from
the following formula:—
 º
                  Oxalic acid.         Carbonic acid. '
               (2C    +  3O)     +  O = 2 (C + 2 O)
the equivalent of oxygen afforded by the electrolytic decom
          of the salt being just sufficient to convert one equiva
  ent of oxalic acid into two equivalents of carbonic acid.
    Sulphovinate of potassa was decomposed also in equivalent
proportions,the acid and oxygen passing to the zincode whence
the gas escaped uncombined—hydrogen and potassa being as
usual developed at the platinode.          From the preceding ex
periments it appears, “that in the electrolysis of a solution
of a neutral salt in water a current which is just sufficient to
separate single equivalents of oxygen and hydrogen from a
mixture of sulphuric acid and water, will separate single equi
valents of oxygen and hydrogen from the saline solution, while
single equivalents of acid and alkali will make their appear
                                   i.
ance at the same time at the respective electrodes.”
    These relations were found equally to hold good, whether
the oxygen was allowed to                 from the zincode of the
double diaphragm cell, or whether it was absorbed by an

352                       Professor Daniell on the
electrode     of copper, or of zinc,                 as in the           ordinary cells of the
battery.
   Further experiments showed that whenever dilute sul
phuric acid is used, there is a transfer of acid towards the
zincode, and the determination of the proportions in which
 such a transfer occurs led to some curious results, to which
 we must presently revert.
    In order, however, to remove the ambiguity which might
 thus possibly be conceived to arise from the employment of
 dilute sulphuric acid as the measure of the electrolytic force,
 the following arrangement was substituted for the ordinary
 voltameter: a green glass tube (into the bottom of which, as
 platinode, was welded a weighed platinum wire) was filled with
 chloride of lead, maintained in a state of fusion by a spirit
 lamp; the corresponding zincode was formed of plumbago.
 At the termination of the experiment the tube was broken,
 the wire and adhering button of lead weighed; and the result
 showed that “the same current which is just sufficient to re
 solve an equivalent of chloride of lead, which is a simple elec
 trolyte unaffected by any associated composition, into               equi                 its
 valent  ions,  produces     the  apparent     phaenomena       the resolu       of
 tion of  water into its elements; and               the same time of an

                                   these experiments, we must
                                           of
bear  inmind the fundamental principle, “that the force which
 wehave measured          by      its
                          definite action   any one point            at                          of

circuit cannot perform more than an equivalent proportion of
work at any other point of the same circuit.”—“The sum of
the forces which held together any number of ions in a com
pound electrolyte, could, moreover, only have been equal to
the force which held together the elements of a single elec
trolyte, electrolyzed at the same moment in one circuit.”
    In the electrolysis of the solution of sulphate of soda, and
many of the other salts, “water seemed to be electrolyzed; at
the same time acid and alkali appeared in equivalent propor
tion with the oxygen and hydrogen atthe respective electrodes.”
—“We must conclude,” from the above-mentioned principle,
“that the only electrolyte which yielded was the sulphate of
soda, the ions of which, however, were not the acid and alkali
of the salt, but an anion composed of an equivalent of sul
phur and four equivalents of oxygen and the metallic cathion
sodium; from the former, sulphuric acid was formed at the
anode by the secondary action and evolution of one equiva
lent of oxygen; and from the latter, soda at the cathode by the
secondary action of the metal and the evolution of an equiva
lent of hydrogen.”
    To avoid circumlocution (but only when speaking of elec
trolytic decomposition), Mr. Daniell proposes to adopt the
word ion, introduced by Dr. Faraday, as a general termina
 tion to denote the compounds which in the electrolysis of a salt
pass to the zincode, and that they should be specifically distin
guished by prefixing the name of the acid slightly modified,

  copper, interspersed with oxide of copper of a black colour,
  and hydrated oxide of copper of a light blue.

                                 these forces.    As has been already
said, these gentlemen consider that the parts adjacent                  the                   to

the pole       which they approach, and consequently they are
                to
repulsive; and they consider that the parts that recede have
currents identical          direction with those which are near the
                               in
magnet from which they recede, and consequently these parts
are attractive. The sum of each of these various forces                                              is

following their opinion, corrected by experiment, the result
should be attraction instead of repulsion.  But Arago was
right in saying that it is repulsion; and consequently the
theory    of the effect given cannot be the true one.

first paper.               I examined

the centre, the extent whence the force emanates will pass it;
and as this part in excess is considered, though erroneously,
as inactive, the portion situated towards the circumference is
more powerful, and impels the pole towards the centre.
    Two or three slight objections present themselves to this
opinion, but they are nothing, so to speak, in comparison with
that which arises, when it is recollected, that in conformity
with the author's own ideas upon the action of currents, the
error with respect to the direction of those which are excited
near the pole obliges us to substitute attraction for repulsion,
as I have already shown when treating of the first of these
forces: consequently                     all
                                 the movements which are connected

 force in proportion to the increase of rapidity in the motion
 of the parts of the disc that intersect the magnetic curves
 (F. 258.). Let us now trace a circle a b around a magnetic
 pole as a centre, and it will represent the projection of mag
 netic curves of equal intensity upon the disc; a and b are
 points situated at an equal distance from the pole, in the pass
 ing radius which is immediately under the pole; but as the
 part or point a passes by the pole with much greater velocity
 than the part b, the intensity of the electric current which is
 excited in this part a is proportionably greater.                This is also
 true for the points in any other radius of the revolving plate
 cutting the circle a b, and true likewise for any other circle
 traced round N as a centre, and representing consequently
 magnetic curves of equal intensity; with the exception, that
 when the circle extends beyond the centre C of the revolving
 disc, as to c d, instead of the existence of a feebler current at
 the point d than at the point c, there is then a tendency to
produce an opposite current.

rection alone, it will move towards the centre c, for the cur
rents produced by a marked pole (north) are exactly such as
by their action on the pole to impel it in that direction.
     This relation of the currents to the pole by which they are
generated, may be proved by experiment as easily as by cal
culation.        I
                 have shown (F. 100.) that when a pole marked
north is above a disc revolving in the direction of the arrows R,
in the figures annexed either to Messrs. Nobili and Antenori's
memoir or to mine, the currents (indicated by the circles) are
as is represented in figures 3, 6, or 7.             Upon arranging a
metal wire which would conduct the currents in this double
direction (fig. 8.), and placing over it a marked pole (north)
capable of moving only in a parallel direction to r c, at any
point in the line r c, I found it had not any tendency to move.
 There was also another line perpendicular to the first, and
which crosses it at the point of contact of the circles, in which
 the pole had no tendency to move.                            If
                                                 placed in any other                     si
 tuation than    upon  these two   lines, it moved either in one direc
 tion or the other; and when placed in the positions marked
 1, 2, 3, 4, it moved in the direction of the arrows represented
 at those points.      Now the position of the pole, with regard
 to the currents in Arago's experiment, when the magnet and
 the disc are arranged as in figures 5 and 7, is exactly that
 of the point 1 in fig. 8, and hence that pole has a tendency
 towards the centre C.
      We will now direct our attention to the result obtained if
 we gradually move the pole from the centre towards the cir
 cumference.       Let figure 9. represent this new condition at a
 given time, as figure 5. represented the first state; it is evi
 dent that the velocity of the parts a b of the radius beneath
 the pole, will not differ from each other so much as they did
  previously, being only about 3:2 instead of 6: 1; and the
 difference will also be less with                   all

“the revolution of the currents is circumscribed within narrow
limits,    and there is little to add to the results that form the
basis of the [our] whole theory;” but that when the motion
is rapid the currents envelope the whole disc, “so as to become
a species of labyrinth.”         For my part I believe the currents
have the same general direction as has been assigned to them
in the figures, whether the rotation be slow or rapid; the only
difference is an increase of velocity.
    A circumstance is then selected which is really simple, though
it may at first appear complicated; namely, that in which the
opposite poles are adjusted over a disc in one diameter, but
towards the opposite edges on each side of the centre. This
circumstance, with the direction of the movement and the cur
 rent produced, is exhibited in fig. 7 of Messrs. Nobili and
 Antenori's memoir. It is unnecessary to quote pages 296 and
297, which contain the explanation of this figure, but shall                                           I

am not disposed to alter anything that    have published;   I                   I

regret at having been obliged to write it; but if it be recol
lected that Messrs. Nobili and Antenori's memoirs were
written and published after my original memoirs; that their
last paper appeared even in the Annales de Chimie et de Phy
sique after mine; and that it had consequently the appear
ance of advancing the science further than       had done; that I
both   papers  accuse me of error in    experiment   and theory,
and also of dishonesty; that the last of these papers is dated
in March, and though it is now December, has been followed
by no correction or retractation on the part of the authors;
 and that I sent them several months ago (at the same time
 that I forwarded them to you and others,) copies of my ori
 ginal memoirs, and of my notes to a translation of their first
 memoir; and if it be considered that, after all, I have not to
 reproach myself with the errors of which I am accused, and
 that these gentlemen's memoirs are so framed as to compel
me to reply to their objections;—I hope that no one will say
 that I have written too hastily what might have been avoided;
 or that I should have shown respect for the truth, and done
justice to my own publications, or to this branch of science,

whirlwind, which      the northern hemisphere proceeds from
                         in
S.W. N.E. The example there more especially investigated

                  H. W.          Dove on the Law     of Storms.                     367
which travelled from Brest to Cap Lindenaes in Norway. The
rotation in this whirlwind was in the direction S.E. N.W.,
consequently on the S.E. side of the storm, that is to
say, in France, Holland, Germany,               Italy, Denmark, and
 Prussia the weather-vane veered from S.E. to S.W. and W.
through south; on the contrary, towards the Atlantic coast of
 North America the direction was N. E. At the same time I
observed in this memoir (p. 599.), that the greater number of
 hurricanes in the southern hemisphere, which I had examined,
 are whirlwinds rotating in the opposite direction.
    Three years later, Mr. Redfield of New York, arrived at
 the same result by independent observations, as appears from
 his memoir, entitled “Remarks on the prevailing Storms of
 the Atlantic Coast of the North American States.” (Silliman's
 Amer. Journ. of Sc., 1831. Avril.) In a later memoir, how
ever, on the gales and hurricanes of the western Atlantic (ib.
vol. xxxi.), Mr. Redfield has added a new and weighty fact
to those already accumulated by me.             From the storms, the
course of which the American philosopher has there dis
cussed and delineated by a chart, it follows, that the hurri
canes taking their rise within the tropics, so long as they are
confined between these limits, retain unaltered their original
direction from S.E. to N.W.; so soon, however, as they reach
the temperate zones, they suddenly bend round almost at a
right angle, and then travel from S.W. to N.E., Finally,
Lieut.-Colonel Reid, in his valuable treatise “On the Law of
Storms,” published in 1838, confirms by new examples the
results already obtained, and especially calls attention to the
fact, that by this change in the direction of                  its
                                                              course the
whirlwind spreads itself out continually from the centre more
and more.
   So  long ago      the year 1735, Hadley proposed
                       as                                            solveto

fruitful principle                 I
                    am now prepared to explain theoretically
the phaenomena   of storms.
   Let a b be a series of material points parallel to the equator,
which are set in motion by a certain impulse in the direction
a t from south to north.    The rotation of the earth combined
with this  impulse will produce  a motion of a b towards gh, if
the space d b h is void of matter. But if this space is filled by
quiescent matter, the particles at b will, as they move, come
into contact with particles in the space d bh, which rotate with
less velocity; their motion in the direction of east will there
fore be retarded, and the point b will move not towards h but
towards f. The particles at a are, on the contrary, in juxta

of rotation, and consequently move as they would in a vacuum,

LV.    On the Electricity of a Jet of Steam issuing from a Boiler.
    By H. G. ARMSTRoNG, Esq., in Letters to Professor
                                                                    -
   Faraday”.
      SIR,
      FEW     days ago, I was informed that a very extraordinary
     electrical phaenomenon, connected with the efflux of steam
from the safety-valve of a steam-engine boiler, had been ob
served at Seghill, about six miles from Newcastle.           I there
fore took an    early opportunity  of  going   over to that place, to
investigate the truth of what I had heard, and by so doing
I  have ascertained the precise facts of the case, which appear
to me to possess so much novelty and importance, that deem    I
it right to transmit the particulars to you, believing that in
your hands they will prove most conducive to the advance
ment of science.      Without further preface, I shall proceed to
narrate what I saw and heard on the spot.
   There is nothing remarkable in the construction of the
boiler, which is supported upon brick-masonry in the usual
way. The annexed sketch represents an end view of the
              * Communicated  by Professor Faraday.

                  of a Jet of         Steam issuing      from a Boiler.                        371
                        .
boiler and safety-valve, by which it will be seen that the valve
is placed on the top of a small cylinder, having a flange round
the lower end, which is fastened by bolts to the summit of the
boiler, between which and the flange, a cement, composed of
chalk,      oil
            and tow,     interposed for the purpose
                                 is                      making                     of
the joining  steam-tight.
   About three            ago the steam began     escape     this       to                at
joining, through      fissure
                            a     the cement,
                                            inand has ever since
continued     issue from the aperture
                  to                              copious horizontal
                                                             in   a
jet.   Soon after this took place, the engine-man, having one
of  his hands accidentally immersed              the issuing steam,
                                                             in
presented the other              to

adjusting the weight, when           was greatly surprised
                                              he                   the                    by
appearance         brilliant spark, which passed between the
                   of   a
lever and his hand, and was accompanied                            by
                                                       violent wrench a
in  his arms, wholly unlike what          had ever experienced be
                                                   he
fore. The same effect was repeated when                   attempted       he                    to
touch any part     the boiler,
                        of          any iron-work connected with
                                              or
it, provided his other hand was exposed         the steam. He next

                     held one hand        the jet      in

                                                                                         it;

       a                                               much stronger  a
 shock than one who merely stood           the bricks.  on
    These singular effects were witnessed and experienced                                       by
a  great many persons, and among others                two gentlemen  by
with whom      am personally acquainted, and who fully corro
                  I
borate the above account, which          obtained from the engine
                                                   I
Iman.
      The boiler had         been cleaned out the day before                        I     saw   it,
and    a    thin incrustation  calcareous matter reaching
                                       of                        high                    as
 as  the water level had been removed, and the consequence
 was, that the indications               of
                                  electricity, though still existing,
 were   very  much diminished.      Still, however, what remained
was very extraordinary; for when             placed one hand
                                                   I                the                   in
jet    ofsteam and advanced the other within           small distance   a
of  the boiler,      distinct spark appeared, and was attended
                       a
with    a slight electrical shock.
    From the effect produced                  by
                                      the cleaning      the boiler,       of                    it
 appears pretty obvious that the phaenomenon                     great         is   in   a
 measure, though not wholly, dependent upon the existence
 an                                                                                             doof
      incrustation within; and the reason why such effects
       in any degree attend the effluxion                     of           jet
 not                                                      steam from

372              Mr. H. G. Armstrong                    on the Electricity
through an aperture in a non-conducting material, while in a
vast majority of cases the escape must take place through a
metallic orifice.  Can the explosion of boilers, respecting the
cause of which so much uncertainty at present exists, have
any connexion with the rapid production of electricity which
thus appears to accompany the generation of steam?
   In the present case the incrustation in the boiler is very
rapidly formed, and I therefore expect that in a few days the
effects will have become as strong as they were at first.
Whenever this takes place I shall again go over to witness
them, and if you wish for any further information, I shall
be glad to obtain it for you. In the mean time you are at
liberty to make any use of this letter that you think fit.

greatly increased,         well   as  the twitching sensation

                 of a Jet of   Steam issuing from a Boiler.       373
 the other, was fully an inch.         A Florence flask, coated with
 brass   filings   on both   surfaces,  was charged to such a degree
 with the sparks from the knob, as to cause a spontaneous
 discharge through the glass; and several robust men received
 a severe shock from a small Leyden jar charged by the same
 process.       The strength of the sparks was quite as great
 when the knob was presented to any conductor communica
ting with the ground, as when it was held to the boiler.            It
appeared to make very little difference in what part of the
jet the plate attached to the conducting wire was held; but
when a thick iron wire was substituted for the plate, the effect
was greatest when the wire was held very near to the orifice.
The valve was loaded at the rate of thirty-five pounds per
 square inch; but the pressure of the steam fluctuated consi
derably, which gave me an opportunity of observing that the
quantity of electricity derived from the jet increased and        di
minished with the pressure. The electricity of the steam was
positive; for when the pith balls of the electrometer diverged
upon an instrument connected with the steam, they were at
tracted by a piece of sealing-wax rubbed on woollen cloth;
and when a pointed wire was held by the person on the stool,
 under the shade of a hat, a pencil, and not a star, of electrical
light became visible.
    Besides the principal jet of steam which         Ioperated upon,
there were several small streams issuing from different parts
of the boiler, and in each of these the electrometer indicated
the presence of electricity.          From the peculiar manner in
which the steam blew off from the safety-valve when the weight
on the lever was lifted, it was quite impossible to try any satis
factory experiment upon the steam which was allowed to escape
by that means.          I applied the gold-leaf electrometer to vari
ous parts of the boiler, which, I ought to observe, is in direct
communication with the ground by means of the steam-pipes,
but could scarcely detect a trace of electricity in any part
of it.
    The engine has another boiler besides the one in question,
 and the two boilers       lie  immediately adjacent     toeach other.
 Having been informed that similar phaenomena had been dis
                this second boiler,      proceeded     apply the elec

in  different    parts,  and found the same indications which I   .#
observed under similar circumstances           in the first boiler.
                                                                  I
then raised the safety-valve, and the column             of
                                                          steam which
 escaped from           proved   ashighly charged with electricity

 which the phaenomenon had first been observed.

374    Mr. H. G. Armstrong         on the Electricity of a Jet of Steam.
    Upon inquiry,      I found that the water used in the boilers
was obtained from a neighbouring colliery, where it was
pumped out of the mine, and that the same water was used
for the boiler of a small high-pressure engine adjoining the
colliery from which the water was procured.               In order, there
fore, to form an opinion whether or not the phaenomenon in
question was dependent upon the quality of the water from
which the steam was generated,             I  proceeded to examine the
steam evolved from the boiler to which I had been referred,
and which proved to be a very small one.                   The valve was
loaded with      only  twenty     pounds     on the  square   inch, and     I
learned from the      engine-man       that no  appearance    of electricity
had ever been noticed in the steam.               Upon trial, however,      I
succeeded in     obtaining    very   distinct  sparks  of electricity from
 the column of steam which issued from the            safety-valve.     The
sparks were certainly weaker than those obtained at the other
engine, but this may reasonably be ascribed to the inferior
pressure of the steam, and smaller size of the boiler.
     I  then repaired to another high-pressure engine, which
belonged to the same establishment, and the boiler of which
was supplied with rain water instead of that drawn from the
mine.      In this case the pressure of the steam was forty pounds
on the    square  inch. The valve was inaccessible, but a powerful
jet of steam was obtained from the upper gauge-cock;                I could
not, however, obtain any trace of electricity in the steam from
this boiler, not even sufficient sensibly to affect the gold-leaf
electrometer. The presumption, then, is exceedingly strong,
that the phaenomenon is in some way occasioned by the pe
culiar nature of the water from which the steam is produced.
 I  inclose you a specimen of the incrustation *, of a month's
   rowth, deposited by the water from the mine in the boilers
in which it is used.
     I  shall be glad to receive any further instructions from
you as to the proper mode of pursuing the investigation, and
should be much gratified to hear your opinion as to the cause
of this most curious phaenomenon t.

       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
  A VERY           singular phaenomenon, viz. the production of
         electricity by two steam-boilers, has been observed in
  this neighbourhood within the last few weeks, the particulars
  of which I have the pleasure of transmitting to you for publi
  cation in your valuable Journal.      The boilers in question are
  situated at   Cramlington   Colliery,  eight miles north-east of
  Newcastle, where they supply steam to a high-pressure en
  É.    of 28-horse power, employed on the waggon-way to
    aul full and empty waggons to the top of two inclined planes,
 leading to the Colliery on the one hand, and to the river
 Tyne on the other. The boilers are cylindrical, with circu
 lar ends, each twenty-one feet long, and five feet diameter.
 They are supplied with water from an adjacent pond by iron
 feed-pipes, four inches diameter, and the steam they produce
 is conveyed to the working cylinder by other iron pipes, six
 inches diameter, which pipes form also a direct metallic com
 munication between the tops of the boilers. By means of ap
 propriate valves the steam is supplied to the cylinder from one
 or other boiler at pleasure. A pipe, two inches diameter, leads
 from the bottom of one boiler on the outside of the brick-work
 to the ash-pit, through which the sediment deposited by the
 water is occasionally blown from one of Scott's patent collect
 ing cones, and a similar pipe is attached to the other boiler.
 The boilers are                  set in      brick-work in the usual way, the fires
 below, with flues reaching                             all
                                   round, and passing into the
chimney also       the usual manner. The flues are covered
                             in
with large flat bricks, and     the space between the boilers the
                                                   in
two flues are   necessarily  separated         brick wall. The         by   a
safety-valves are attached      the boilers    flange joints; and
                                                   to                       by
between the flanges,       render them steam-tight,

and linseed oil, mixed                        up

sal-ammoniac, as ordinarily employed by engine-wrights. The
steam is worked at a pressure of thirty-five pounds per inch.
    The joint between the top of one of the boilers and the
seat of          its
              safety-valve had given way, and steam was issuing
forcibly through this aperture, when                Tuesday, Septemberon
29th last, the engine-man, William Patterson, while standing
with this current                of
                          steam blowing upon his legs, took hold                                             of

                             touching the weight, this sensation was

 applied his finger gently           the lever, and perceived

facts of this extraordinary, and, as far as I know, unprecedented
case, but      I
               do not offer any theory to account for the phaeno
mena.     It is hardly possible to suppose that there is any local
peculiarity about these boilers, or the place where they are
situated, to occasion the highly electrical condition of the steam
produced in them; and yet it is as difficult to suppose the fact
of high-pressure-steam being electrical, a general one; for if it
were so, it could hardly, up to this time, have escaped observa
tion.   The conditions, therefore, under which steam becomes
electrical require to be investigated, and it is not unlikely that
the investigation may lead to important results.

LVII.      Note on Elimination.   By J. J. SylvestER, F.R.S.,

THE
  in
     object of this brief note is to generalize Theorem 2.
     my paper on Elimination which appeared in the last
December Number of this Magazine. The Theorem so ge
neralized presents a symmetry which before was wanting.
Here, as in so many other instances, the whole occupies in #.
memory a less space than the part.
   To avoid the ill-looking and slippery negative symbols,                                              I
warn my reader that I now use two rows of quantities written
one over the other, to denote the product of the terms re
sulting from taking away each quantity in the under from
each in the upper row.
   Let h, h, ...... h, be the roots of one equation of co

 ultimately adopted in forming a speculum three feet in diameter,
 subsequently applied to a telescope, mounted in a manner very             si
 milar to that of Sir John Herschel.           The author states, as the re
 sults he arrived    at, that  specula  can be made to act effectively, when
 cast of the finest  speculum    metal,  in separate portions, and retained in
 their   positions  by an  alloy  of zinc and copper, as easily wrought as
 common brass, and that they can be executed in this manner of any
 required size; that castings of the finest speculum metal can be ex
 ecuted of large dimensions, perfect, and not very liable to break;
 that machinery can be employed with the greatest advantage
 in grinding and polishing specula; that to obtain the finest polish,
 it is not necessary that the speculum should become warm, and that
  any temperature may be fixed upon, and preserved uniform during
  the whole process; and that large specula can be polished as
  accurately as small ones, and be supported so as to be secured from
  flexure.                            -

 in Light.      By G. B. Airy, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
      The existence of a polarity in the rays of homogeneous light, ha
  ving regard only to the sequence of colours in the spectrum, was in
  ferred by Sir David Brewster from some experiments, of which he has
  given an account, contained in the Report of the Seventh Meeting of
  the British Association.       The author states the results of his own
  observations of similar phaenomena, and their theoretical explanation
  on the undulatory theory, together with the mathematical develop
  ment of that explanation*.

      The author examines, in this paper, the action of chlorine upon
  the ferrocyanate of potassa, and the conversion of the latter into
  ferrosesquicyanuret; and proposes methods for obtaining this latter
  salt uncontaminated with impurities, and free from the difficulties
  and inconvenience attendant on the present mode of preparation f.

   6. On the Constitution of Pigotite, and on the Mudesous and
Mudesic Acids.      By James F. W. Johnston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
   In this paper  the author describes a substance, found by himself
and  by  the Rev. M. Pigot, forming an incrustation on the sides of
certain  caves, occurring in the granitic cliffs on the east and west
coast of Cornwall. This incrustation is in mass of a brown, and in
powder of a yellow colour; is insoluble in water and alcohol; when
heated, it gives off much water, blackens, yields empyreumatic pro
ducts, and leaves a black mass, having occasionally the lustre of
graphite.    In the air, at a bright red heat, this mass very slowly
burns, leaving a grey or white ash, which consists of alumina, with
some slight foreign admixtures.
                                                     -
   The  organic  constituent of this substance    (pigotite),  the author
considers to be derived from the decay of the various plants which
grow on the moist moorlands above, and which, being carried by the
waters into the fissures of the granite beneath, combines with the
alumina of the decomposed felspar; and when it reaches the air,
deposits itself on the roof and sides of the caverns, in the form of
layers, varying from a line to two or three inches in thickness. With
reference to its supposed origin, the author has given to the organic
constituent the name of mudesous acid (from Hvemats, signifying
decay through excess of moisture); and he mentions an observation,
communicated to him by Dr. Boase, that the roots of the sea-pink
(Statice Armeria) contain a colouring matter resembling, in appear
ance, the solutions of the mudesous acid.
   From numerous experiments and analyses detailed at length in
his paper, the author derives the following general results:
   1. That the native pigotite contains a dark-brown          soluble, not
deliquescent acid of vegetable   origin, which, in the anhydrous state,
is represented by C1, H, Os.
   2. That this acid, the mudesous, is tribasic, the salt of silver
(mudesite), being represented by (3 Ao O + Cls H, Os), and pre
cipitates the salts of the metallic oxides of a brown colour.
  3. That the native                mudesite of alumina              (Pigotite) is repre
sented as follows:
  a. Dried in          the   air   by   (4A14
                                                  C,   H,   O,   +   27   Ho).
   b. Dried     at    212°F.        by   (4   Air C.H.,        o,   +   8 H       ol,   losing    27
per cent.     of   water.
  c.    Dried    at  300°    F      by   (4   Å   4   C,   H,   O,   +
                                                                     8      Ho),        losing    32
per cent.     of   water.
   4.   That this native mudesite, however,                    is more probably           a   com
pound    of    the organic tribasic salt, with             a   hydrate    alumina,
                                                                            of                   and
may     be   rationally represented thus:
   a.   Dried   in    the   airby       (A  C.H.o.4, Ho)
                                             +                          +   3     (A    +   GHo).
   b.   Dried   at   212°F.        by   (Al-C, H.0,4-4HO)                 +   3   (Al-2Ho).
   c.   Dried   at   800°F.        by   (Al-c. H.o,4-2Ho)               +   3    (A1+2Ho).

                        of Pigotite   and the Resins.                    383
    5. That when treated with nitric acid, the native mudesite, as
well as the mudesous acid itself, are oxidized and converted into a
new brownish-yellow, soluble and deliquescent acid, containing more
oxygen, and in the anhydrous state represented by Cls H, Oro.
    6. That this new acid, the mudesic, combines readily with alu
mina and protoxide of mercury, giving salts of a yellow colour.
Both the acids described in this paper are distinguished for their
tendency to precipitate alumina and the protoxide of mercury.            The
mudesate of mercury dried at 300°F., is represented by (2 H, O +
Crs H, Oro).
    7. That chlorine, when made to act on either of the acids, or
their salts of alumina in contact with water, gradually deprives them
of all colour, while, at the same time, muriatic acid is formed. Col
lected on the filter, boiled in water till the washings cease to pre
cipitate nitrate of silver, and dried, the white gelatinous, apparently
altered mudesite or mudesate, is found on analysis to contain no
atomic proportion of chlorine, but to have sensibly the constitution
of the mudesic acid, or mudesates prepared by the direct action of
nitric acid. The author thinks it not unlikely that a chloro-mudesic
acid exists, and may be formed during this process, represented
probably by Crs H, Cl Oro, but which he has not succeeded in ob
taining in a separate state.
    The mudesous and mudesic acids are distinguished from each
other by giving, the former brown, and the latter yellow precipitates
with the neutral metallic salts—by being, the former unaltered, and
the latter deliquescent in the air. Both form deliquescent salts with
ammonia, and appear to undergo alteration by the long-continued
action of hydrosulphuric, or of concentrated sulphuric and hydro
fluoric acids.                   -
    7. On the Constitution of the Resins, Part V. By James F. W.
Johnston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.*
    In this paper the author continues his examination of what are
called the fetid resins, and from repeated analyses deduces for the
resin of Sagapenum the formula Cio         H,  O, and for that of Galbanum
Clo H. O. He then           compares    the formulae for the four resins:
        Opoponax = Cao     H,   Ola, Assafoetida = C,o Hso Oro,
        Galbanum = Co H2, Ozo, Sagapenum = Cso             H,   O, ;
and considers it     probable   that,  though   no  striking  analogy among
 the irrational formulae for these resins is     perceptible,  by which their
 analogy in physical properties can be accounted for, they may pos
 sess an analogous rational constitution which future researches may
disclose.
    Euphorbium consists of two resins, of which the more soluble,
A, gave the formula Co Hsu Os. Elemi also consists of two resins,
 of which the more soluble, A, is represented by Cao Hs, O, and the
 less soluble, B, by Cao Hss Or, as had previously been shown by Hess

and Rose. The Bdellium of commerce contains much gum, and a
resin Cao Hsi O,.
   The resin of Benzoin presented peculiar difficulties when sub
mitted to investigation, from the ease with which it undergoes de
composition, even attemperatures much below that at which it melts.
With regard to this resin, the author gives the following as the result
of his numerous analyses:—
    1. That the colourless resin of benzoin is represented approxi
mately by Cao Hso Oo.
    2. That by heat and dilute carbonated alkalies it is decomposed
into water, benzoic acid, a little volatile oil, and a resin Cao Hss O.,
or Clo H. O.
    3. That by boiling with quicklime, or concentrated carbonated
alkalies, it gives two resins, one in large quantity = Cso H, Os; and
another in small quantity = Cao Hso Oz.
    4. That by caustic potash the crude resin is resolved into two re
sins represented respectively by Cao Has O, and Cao Hso Oz, of which
the former is precipitated, and the latter remains in solution, when a
saturated aqueous solution of caustic potash is added to an alcoholic
solution of the crude resin.                                 -
    5. And that by oxide of lead two resins are separated, for which
analysis gave respectively the formulae Cao Hºs Oc, and Cao Hso Oro.
    The author concludes by stating that such metamorphoses are by
no means confined to this resin, though the more accurate know
ledge of their nature, obtained by the imperfect study he has made
of the resin of benzoin, has explained many anomalies he had pre
viously observed, with regard to the relations of the resins to the al
 kalies and metallic oxides. He considers the group of which dragon's
 blood is the type, and which he represents by the expression
 Clo H., H- r O, to be peculiarly susceptible of modification (or
 decomposition ?) by the action of bases; and he specifies among
 other results, with regard to which it is his intention to address the
 Society in a future paper, that dragon's blood, of which the lump
 variety = C,o     H,  Os, and the drop variety (heated to 300°F.)
 = Clo Hoo Os, gives by the action of quicklime and oxide of lead,
 among other products, two resins represented approximately by
 Cao Hso Oro and Cao Hso Orº 2–that guiacum = C,o H, Olo, with
 oxide of lead, gives a resin = Cso H, O, I, the resin of jalap
 = Cao Hs, Ors; by the action of the same oxide, a resin = CoH, Oso,
 and that of assafoetida = C<U+017F>o Has Oro, a new resin = C to Has Ols.
 These metamorphoses lead to the second great branch of inquiry
 respecting the nature and constitution of the resins. Certain results
 being established, at least approximately, with regard to the irrational
 constitution of the resins, and certain general irrational formulae by
 which to express   it, we are prepared for the study  of  their rational
 constitution.    This partof  the subject the author proposes   to  con
 sider fartherin   subsequent communications.

 the Rise and Fall   of  the Sea's surface  during  each tide. By the

                                  Royal Society.                                  385
Rev. W. Whewell, B.D., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
bridge*.
   The materials of the present investigation are five months’ tide
observations made at Plymouth; three months' observations made
at Liverpool, under the direction of Captain Denham, R.N.; and
twelve months' observations made at Bristol, by Mr. Bunt, by means
of his tide-gauge.   According to the theory of the tides, the height
of the surface of the water at a given place will increase as the sine,
while the time increases as the arc. Hence if the time be made the
abscissa, and the height the ordinate, the curve representing one
tide would be the figure of signs. The author on making the com
parison of the empirical curve of the rise and fall of the water, de
duced from observation, with this theoretical curve, finds a general
agreement between them; subject to certain deviations, consisting
principally in the empirical curve indicating that both the rise and
the fall are not symmetrical, like the theoretical curve, in conse
quence of the fall being generally more rapid than the rise, and thus
occasioning a displacement of the summit of the curve towards that
branch of it which corresponds to the fall.
   9. Researches in Embryology.         Third Series.—Additional Ob
servations.    By Martin Barry, M.D., F.R.S.'t
   Having in the paper to which the present is supplementary made
known the fact that the germinal spot in the mammiferous ovum re
solves itself into cells, with which the germinal vesicle becomes filled,
the author has since directed his attention to the corresponding parts
in the ova of birds, batrachian reptiles, and osseous fishes, which he
finds to be the seat of precisely the same changes. The numerous
spots in the germinal vesicle of batrachian reptiles and osseous fishes
are no other than the nuclei of cells.      The cells themselves, from
their transparency,    are at first not easily discerned, and appear to
have hitherto escaped notice; but after the observer has become
aware of their presence, they are, in many instances, seen to be ar
ranged in the same manner, and to present the same interior them
selves as the corresponding cells in the ovum of mammalia.
   In the representations given by Professor Rudolph Wagner, the
discoverer of the germinal spot, the author recognizes evidence of
the same changes in ova throughout the animal kingdom.       He con
firms and explains the observations of R. Wagner, that in the ova
of certain animals an originally single spot divides into many, and
that in the ova of other animals the number of spots increases as
                                                                         of all
the ovum ripens.    But he expresses also the opinion that in    ova
there is originally but single spot, this being the nucleus
                           a                                     the
germinal vesicle    or
                     cell.
   The analogy between the ova         of
                                     mammalia and the animal above
mentioned, extends also      the substance surrounding the germinal
                                to
vesicle, which consists      of
                           nucleated cells.

Fowler, of Torrington in Devonshire. By Augustus De Morgan, Esq.
Communicated by F. Baily, Esq., V.P.R.S.
   The arithmetical operations performed by the machine are those
of multiplication and division; the factors and product in the for
mer case, and the quotient, dividend and divisor in the latter, being
expressed in digits of the ternary scale of notation, every digit be
ing either — 1, 0, or + 1. In this system, unity being, in multi
plication, only an index, the rules for multiplication and division
must consist entirely in directions for the management of the signs
of unity; and it is on this principle that Mr. Fowler's machine is
made to act. A short account is given of the principal parts of the
machine, and of the mode in which they bring out the final results.
It is necessary, however, in applying it to use, to have recourse to
tables, both for converting the factors and reconverting the result;
operations which introduce both labour and risk of error.
    11. On the Minute Structure and Movements of Voluntary Mus
cles, in a letter addressed to R. B. Todd, M.D., F.R.S., &c.      By
William Bowman, Esq., Demonstrator of Anatomy in King's Col
lege, London, and Assistant Surgeon to King's College Hospital.
                                       -
Communicated by Dr. Todd.
   The objects of the author, in this paper, are the following.—1st.
To confirm, under     some modifications, the view taken of the primi
tive fasciculi of voluntary muscles being composed of a solid bundle
of fibrillae: 2dly. To describe new parts entering into their com
position: and 3dly. To detail new observations on the mechanism
of voluntary motion.
   He first shows that the primitive fasciculi are not cylindrical, but
polygonal threads; their sides being more or less flattened where
they are in contact with one another; he next records, in a tabular
form, the results of his examination of their size in the different             di
visions of the animal kingdom.          It appears that the largest are met
with in fish; they are smaller in reptiles, and their size continues
to diminish in insects, in mammalia, and lastly, in birds, where
they are the smallest of all. In all these instances, however, an
extensive range of size is observable, not only in different species,
but in the same animal, and even in the same muscle. He then
shows that    all the fibrillae into which    a   primitive fasciculus may      be
split, are marked    by alternate dark and light points, and that fibrillae
of  this description exist throughout the whole thickness          of the fasci
culus; that the apposition       of the segments    of   contiguous fibrillae,  so
marked, must form transverse striae, and that such transverse striae
 do   infact exist throughout the whole interior         of the fasciculus. He
next   inquires  into the form    of  the  segments    composing    the fibrillae,
and shows that their longitudinal adhesion constitutes fibrillae, and
their lateral adhesion discs,    or  plates, transverse       the length   of
                                                          of to
                                                                               the
fasciculus; each disc being, therefore, composed              a single segment
from every one      of the fibrillae. He shows that these discs always
exist  quite  as unequivocally     as the fibrillae, and gives several exam
ples and figures    of
                     a  natural cleavage    of the fasciculus into such discs.
It follows that the transverse striae are the edges,          or
                                                               focal sections   of

     I
    consider this Report as of the highest value, in showing the
general advantages which may be derived from connecting scientific
knowledge with practical arts; and I trust we shall hear no more of
such discreditable and unfounded assertions as, not long ago, passed
uncontradicted, at a meeting of an architectural society in London,
that Stonehenge is made of statuary marble.
  GEOLOGICAL COMMITTEE OF ENGLISH AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.
  The appointment of a Geological Committee, by the English
Agricultural Society, at their meeting in Oxford, in July last, shows
the sense entertained by that numerous body of landed proprietors,
and cultivators of the soil of England, of the important services
which may be rendered to them, by the application of geological
knowledge to the improvement of the productive capabilities of the
land.
   It is well known to geologists that an almost unbounded supply
of mineral manure may be found in the sub-strata, which in very
many districts are composed of ingredients different from those of
the surface.     So constant are the characters of many of the beds
of the geological groups which pass in long and narrow bands from
one side of England to the other, that a single experiment, carefully
conducted, on any one stratum of each formation, with a view to
ameliorate      soil,   its  admixture  by    an
                                           the ingredients    some other  of                         of

 such parts of these branches of knowledge as bear more especially
 on Practical Engineering, are added at Durham occasional survey
 ing excursions, both in the field and underground, conducted by a
 practical civil engineer.     More than thirty young men have, during
 the last  year,  been actively engaged in this new department of aca
 demical    study.”
    The locality of Durham, upon the margin of the great Newcastle
 coal field, and in the vicinity of the lead mines of Alston Moor, and
 Weardale, is in a peculiar degree favourable for a school of mining
and civil engineering;      enjoying advantages of position similar to
those of the     great  Saxon school at Freyberg, near the mining dis
tricts of the   Ertzgebirge  and the Hartz.
    The University of London also is taking measures to institute
examinations of Candidates for certificates of proficiency in Civil
 Engineering, and the arts and sciences connected with Mining.
    In University College, London, courses of preparatory experi
mental lectures and exercises in Natural Philosophy have, during
the last year, been provided for the students in that establishment,
who are destined for the Profession of Civil Engineers.
    And in King's College, London, a course of lectures in Civil En
gineering, and Sciences applied to Arts and Manufactures, is at this
time attended by more than fifty students, who have the opportunity
of adding practical to theoretical knowledge in a workshop and la
boratory established for their use.
                     SCHOOL OF MINES IN CORNWALL.
    Another proof of the direction of public attention to the col
lateral branches of our science has, within the last twelve months,
been afforded by the establishment in Cornwall, of a school for the
instruction in Sciences and Arts connected with MINING, of young
men who are to be engaged in conducting the important subterra
nean operations of that county.        The want of such a school had
been pointed out by Mr. John Taylor, in his Prospectus of a School
of Mines in Cornwall, February 7, 1825,t and in his Records of
Mining, published in 1829. It has at length been instituted chiefly
through the exertions and at the expense of Sir Charles Lemon.
This incipient school, and the University of Durham, form almost
solitary examples in England, of such scientific establishments as are
nearly universal in the mining districts of the Continent.           The
experiment has begun in Cornwall with Courses of Lectures in
Mathematics, Mechanics, Chemistry, and Mineralogy, by three pro
fessors; and a course of instruction, by a practical surveyor, in     Al
gebra, Drawing, and the Use of instruments: and during the next
year, still further additions are contemplated.

    Should this inquiry be extended through the endless departments
of art, industry and commerce, which have their origin in the
manufactories of metals, and in the power of steam, derived exclu
sively from the application of coal, the vast national importance of
mineral statistics, and of models, maps and sections, on which alone
their details can be effectually recorded, must be apparent to every
Olle.
     Still more extensive will be the statistical and political importance
of the next portion of this great work, now in progress by the same
highly accomplished geologist, which is to comprehend the coal and
iron districts of Monmouthshire and South Wales.
                      GEOLOGICAL MAP OF ENGLAND.
     You have this day the satisfaction to see suspended in your meet.
ing-room a new edition of Mr. Greenough's Geological Map of Eng
land, which has for many years formed the glory of this Society.
It is truly gratifying to observe how small a change this new edi
tion exhibits, either in the general dispositions, which it represented
nearly a quarter of a century ago, or in the complicated details of
the boundaries of the different formations.          Some alterations appear
in the Greensand series, the Wealden, the Lias, and the New red
 Sandstone. The principal additions are the introduction of the              Si
lurian divisions made in the slate rocks, by Mr. Murchison, in the
border districts of England and Wales; and the new distribution
 very recently assigned to the slate rocks of Devonshire and Corn
wall.
     A great improvement also has been made by the substitution of an
 entirely new Map of Wales and Siluria, founded on the Ordnance
 surveys of those regions, of which no accurate physical map ex
 isted at the time of Mr. Greenough's first publication.               Another
 improvement in the execution consists in the union of linear shadows
 with the colours representing the superficial extent of the strata.
 The combined effects of these elements of eapression, judiciously
 employed, has been to exhibit, more distinctly, the subdivisions
 of formations, without destroying the unity of the general mass to
 which they belong.        By the frequent introduction also of conven
 tional signs, and figures of reference, Mr. Greenough has produced
 a more condensed assemblage of scientific information, of varied
 kinds, than has been put together in any map of equal extent yet
 published.       Extreme attention has also been paid to the physical
 features of the country, and in the orographic details more than
 500 heights are given.        The hydrographic features also are deli
  meated with scrupulous exactness.
                       GEOLOGICAL MAP OF IRELAND.
      The last summer has witnessed the production of Mr. Griffith's
  large and splendid Geological Map of Ireland, containing the results
  that of the iron, lead, zinc, tin and silver, after fusion, in their first mar
   ketable condition — as pigs, blocks and ingots.        The coal is valued at
  the pit's mouth.

   Mr. Griffith had supplied an outline of this map published in
the Report of the Railway Commissioners for Ireland, 1838.      It is
obvious that the information thus conveyed, as to the nature of the
materials of which the island is composed, affords the most solid
basis for sound calculation as to the future improvement of Ireland
by the application of              its
                          natural resources.

                  BLUE OXIDE OF TITANJ UM IN                   SCORIAE.
      In analysing the blue scoriae of different countries, M. Kersten
 found small quantities of titanic acid, and that these scoriae possessed
  a blue colour similar to that of the blue oxide prepared in the dry
  way; he presumed, therefore, that this colour, instead of being
  derived from the protoxides of iron and manganese, which some
  times occur in them, might be owing to titanic acid [oxide 3). Ac
 cording to the facts above stated, it is very probable that titanic acid,
 which occurs very often in the ores of iron, after having been dis
  solved and scorified during the operations of the blast-furnace, is
 reduced to the state of oxide by the fused iron, similarly to what
 occurs in the humid way with solutions, and as has happened in se
 veral preceding assays.         If this assumption be well founded, it
 ought to be possible, with the substances usually contained in the
 scoriae and with titanic acid, to reproduce blue glass on the small
 scale.    M. Kersten succeeded, not only in fusing together silica,
 lime, alumina, titanic acid and iron, all of them pure, and in pro
                                     -
 ducing earthy glasses of a blue colour, resembling the blue scoriae
 of iron, but also succeeded in obtaining them with the same earths,
 titanic acid and zinc free from iron, or with pure tin.
     M. Kersten, therefore, concludes from these researches, that the
 blue colouring matter of many iron scoriae is the blue oxide of        ti
 tanium.     This blue oxide deserves some attention from its applica
 tion to the arts, and the author endeavoured to procure blue ena
mels upon porcelain by using it; and though they were not so fine
as those of cobalt, they most nearly approach them.—L'Institut,
No. 353.
          ON  THE PROTEIN OF THE CRYSTALLINE HUMOUR.
     This substance was discovered by Berzelius, and according to
him it constitutes 35.9 per cent. of the crystalline humour, and does
not become, like albumen, a coherent mass by coagulation, but a
granular one. In other respects its properties are similar.
     This new product may be obtained as follows:—
     The crystalline humour is to be carefully separated from fifty ox
eyes, they are to be washed, the cells torn, water is to be added
and filtered.     The liquor heated in a water-bath soon coagulates
and    deposits clots.   After drying, the pounded mass was subjected
to the action of alcohol and water, and boiled; after this it was
dried at 266°Fahrenheit.

        cepting Cornwall, or the mining counties of the north of
  England, so rich in mineral species as the neighbourhood of
  Glasgow, if we include under that appellation Lead Hills
  and Wanlock Head, and the ranges of mountains on both
  sides of the Clyde, constituting the Kilpatrick hills, and the
  ranges of hills behind Greenock and Port Glasgow, extending
  as far as Kilmacolm.
     The mines at Lead Hills began to be wrought during the
  reign of James IV., under the name of gold-mines, and it is
  said by Boethius that he extracted from them a considerable
  treasure. The jaspers, rubies and diamonds which Boethius
  describes in glowing terms, were doubtless the different species
  of lead ore which still exist in these mines, namely, the sul
  phate, carbonate and phosphate of lead, remarkable at once
  for the beauty of their colours, their figure and their lustre.
      In the time of James V. Lead Hills was a lead mine, as it
  is at present; and it is particularly described by Agricola in
  his celebrated work, De re metallica.          Now Agricola died in
  the  year  1555.
      Becher, who first attempted to establish a theory in che
  mistry, visited the Lead Hills mines in the year 1682, and ever
  since that period they have been wrought to a considerable
  extent.
      The principal ore    at Lead     Hills is galena or sulphuret of

lead, which occurs in the mine in all the different varieties
which that prolific mineral is known to assume.    The gangue
of the vein which    accompanies   the ore is most commonly
sulphate of barytes, which occurs in abundance, and in a
state of great purity.  Calcareous spar also is common, and
arragonite is met with in very beautiful crystals.
   Besides galena, no fewer than nine species of lead ore oc
cur in Lead Hills, some of which have not hitherto been ob
served anywhere else.
     Of thesenine species I may take a short review.
   1.  Sulphate  of lead.—Beautiful specimens of this species
of lead ore occur at Wanlock, crystallized, and perfectly
white. The crystal is a right rhombic prism, and the lustre
is adamantine, but I think less so than that of carbonate of
lead. Magellan, in his English edition of Cronstedt's Mineralogy,
  ublished in 1788, says, that this species was discovered by
Monnet, but I do not find any allusion to sulphate of lead in
Monnet's Mineralogie, published in 1779; so that the dis
covery of      composition must have been later than that pe
                 its
riod.     Klaproth first subjected this mineral        analysis                         to                  in
1802. The specimens which                             he
                                      examined were from                                               An

   2.  Carbonate            of

the result approaches pretty near the truth.               The specific
gravity by my trials was 5'000, but the specimen was not ab
solutely pure.
    From 3:29 grains,      I obtained

    Mr. Brooke      supposes   the copper to exist in this mineral
in the state of carbonate, but the result of the analysis just
stated, is quite inconsistent with that opinion.              It would,
however, be desirable, in order to be quite certain, to repeat
the analysis on a larger quantity of the mineral than            I could
procure.
    8. Chromo-phosphate of lead.—This beautiful mineral ex
ists in the Wanlock Head mine in considerable quantity.                It
has a beautiful orange colour, without any of the red tinge
 which characterizes chromate of lead. It is often in cauli
flower concretions; but it occurs also crystallized in six-sided
prisms, constituting the common form which characterizes
phosphate of lead. I ascertained many years ago that this
 beautiful orange colour which distinguishes this ore was owing
to the presence of about two per cent. of chromate of lead; the
rest was a mixture of subsesquiphosphate of lead and chloride
 of lead in nearly the same proportions as in the green va
 rieties.
    9. Wanadiate of lead.—This very rare ore has hitherto
 been found only in Mexico and at Lead Hills.               It was ana
 lysed in 1804 by Del Rio, who announced the existence in
 it of a new metal.         This was contradicted by Collet Des
 cotils, who affirmed that what Del Rio took for a new metal
 was chromium; and certainly the resemblance between
 chromium and vanadium is considerable.
     The specimens in my possession I got several years ago
 from Mr. Doran, an Irish mineral dealer, who told me that
 he picked them up in an old neglected lead mine in the county
 of Wicklow, in Ireland. But there is reason to suspect that
 he was mistaken.

   The colour is light brownish yellow, and, like phosphate of
lead, it is crytallized in six-sided prisms.
   My specimen was analysed a good many years ago by my
nephew, Dr. R. D. Thomson, who found it a compound of
1 atom of chloride of lead, and nearly 9 atoms of sesquiva
nadiate of lead ".
   Besides these ten species of lead ore which occur at Lead
Hills or Wanlock Head,        there are found also native copper
and   malachite,   or hydrous   dicarbonate of copper; a beautiful
green-coloured mineral often crystallized, and when large
specimens occur, as the well known ores from Siberia, they
are often cut into ornamental tables, &c.
   The Lead Hills malachite is rather a dark green, but the
specimen of it subjected to analysis was very nearly pure.
    Lead Hills also contains specimens of blende or sulphuret
of zinc. By far the finest specimens of hydrous silicate of zinc
which I have seen, are from Lead Hills; they constitute beau
tiful white crusts or plates.         specific gravityIts 3'1645, and                      is

Gehlen, showed that the mesotype of Haüy ought to be                                                         di
vided into three species, which he distinguished by the names
of mesotype, needlestone, and Thomsonite. The first two of
these constitute the natrolite and scolezite of Fuchs and Geh
len; but the third is a new species, which Mr. Brooke first
described.   He showed that these minerals differ in their
crystalline shape and in their specific gravity; Thomsonite
being the heaviest, and natrolite or mesotype the lightest.
   Thomsonite is a beautiful mineral, and is rather abundant
both in the Kilpatrick hills, and those on the south side of
the Clyde. When pure it is snow-white; the crystal is a right
rectangular prism.    The lustre is vitreous, and the specific
gravity is about 2:37, according to Brooke; though I have
found it as low as 2.29.   Before the blow-pipe it swells. It
contains about 13 per cent. of water, and is composed of
3   Al S--Cal               S-1-2),     Aq.
   There is a curious variety which occurs at Ballimony, in
the north of Ireland;      colour   brown, and its not cry         is                              it

prism is commonly terminated by eight faces, constituting two
four-sided prisms of different inclinations.
   It contains about 16% per cent. of soda, and 9% per cent. of
water. The other constituents are silica and alumina.
        Its constitution is       N S + 2 Aq.

   Mesolite.—Natrolite in a       pure   state, that is perfectly
destitute of lime, is uncommon in this neighbourhood.                             Al
most always we find a mixture of soda and lime constituting
the mesolite of Fuchs and Gehlen; they gave it that name
because they considered it as intermediate between matrolite
and scolezite, or composed of an integrant particle of natro
lite united to an integrant particle of scolezite.
   Mesolite is abundant both in this locality and in various
other parts of Scotland, where trap rocks occur; and we
find it in two different states.
   (1.) In four-sided prisms generally united so firmly to each
other, that we cannot easily separate them.       Fine specimens
of this variety are found at present at Bishoptown in Renfrew
shire, where a hill is perforating for a tunnel, constituting part
of the Greenock and Glasgow rail-road, at present forming.
This variety approaches very nearly to natrolite; since it
contains only 1% per cent. of lime, while there is no less than
13; per cent. of soda, and a small portion of potash. If na
trolite be
             3 Al S +                 NS”         + 2 Aq,
this variety  will be
             3 Al S + (;? N + ºr K+ 3. Cal) S + 2 Aq.
   Its specific gravity is 2.1365.
   The other variety constitutes veins in the rock. It is much
softer, has a foliated texture, and a specific gravity of 2:212.
   It contains 63 per cent. of soda and 3 per cent. of lime;
so that the atoms of soda are very nearly twice as numerous
as those of lime.        In other respects                   its
                                                 constitution agrees
nearly with the other variety.

We would naturally suppose that this friability was owing
 to the loss       portion
                       of
                        a       water; but  of  examining some re

410                      Dr. T. Thomson            on the    Minerals
markable specimens of this kind in my possession, I found
that the friable portion contained more water than the hard
and splintery.
    The crystalline shape of scolezite is the same as that of
matrolite, a right rhombic prism.       The obtuse angle is 10'
greater than in natrolite, being 91° 20', while that of natro
lite is 91° 10'.
    Scolezite differs from natrolite in lime replacing the soda.
It contains also more water, being
                    3 Al S + Cal S + 3 Aq.
    It deserves  attention, that though in some specimens the
soft hairy portion of this mineral appears to be a continua
tion of the fibres of the splintery central portion, yet the
constitution of the two portions is not the same.
  I    analysed a remarkable specimen of this kind from the
Giant's Causeway. The result was as follows:—

   8. Analcime.-This mineral, which Werner distinguished
by the name of cubizite, was first noticed by Dolomieu.         It
occurs rather abundantly in the Kilpatrick hills.        In these
hills it is white and                but in the Giant's Causeway
in Ireland, transparent crystals of it are found. It is crystal
lized in cubes, whose angles are usually replaced by three
planes. In most crystals these planes have increased so much
in size as to obliterate the primary faces. The crystal is then
an imperfect sphere bounded by twenty-four equal trapezoidal
planes. . This figure is well known to mineralogists by the
name of the leucite crystal.
    It is but an imperfect zeolite; yet it melts before the blow
pipe, though without ebullition; and like the other zeolites, is
soluble in muriatic acid. Its constituents are silica, alumina,
soda and water.                           Atoms.

     But it contains an additional atom of bisilicate of alumina
  and of water.
     10. Stilbite and Heulandite.—These two species are found
 in great abundance in the Kilpatrick hills and at Carberry in
 the valley which divides the Campsie hills from the Kilpatrick
 hills. They are always, or almost always, of a deep flesh-red
 colour, and generally crystallized, though seldom in very re
 gular shapes.       These two species were first distinguished
 from each other by Werner, who gave to stilbite the name of
 radiated zeolite, and to Heulandite that of foliated zeolite.
  Haüy confounded the two under the name of stilbite. Mr.
  Brooke pointed out the difference between them in 1822;
 and left Haüy's name stilbite to one of the species, while the
 other was named Heulandite, in honour of Mr. Heuland of
 London. It is unlucky that the names had not been reversed.
 The word stilbite (from the Greek artM30, to shine) was ap
 plied by Haüy, in consequence of the great lustre of the
 mineral.     Now the base of the prism in Heulandite has a
 much greater lustre than in stilbite, being pearly and splen
 dent.    In the specimens from this neighbourhood, the lustre
 is not so great as in those from the Feroe islands, which are
 white, and have the pearly lustre in perfection.
    The constituents of both these minerals are silica, alumina,
 lime and water.
     Heulandite contains most silica and least water.
             Stilbite is    2 Al S' + Cal S' + 5 Aq.
             Heulandite     3; Al Sº + Cal Sº + 6 Aq.
    11. The only other zeolite that occurs in any quantity in
 the Kilpatrick hills is harmotome.       It was noticed early by
 mineralogists under the name of cross stone, in consequence
 of the remarkable way in which the crystals frequently cross
 each other; that shape is not common in the harmotome of
 the Kilpatrick hills. It is usually crystallized in right rect
 angular prisms.       But the common modification is a terminal
four-sided pyramid, consisting of faces replacing the solid an
 gles of the base of the prism.
    The mineral called harmotome ought to be divided into
 three distinct species, which might be distinguished by the
names harmotome, Philipsite, and Morvenite; the first of these
only occurs in our neighbourhood; but the first and third
are common at Strontian. The second, or Philipsite, has been
observed in Sicily, and in other places. The first is a com
pound of silica, alumina, barytes and water; the second of
silica, alumina, lime and water; and in the third the propor
tions of the constituents differ very much from those of the
second species.

   Labradorite, as the name implies, was first noticed on the
coast of Labrador.        It is of a dark smoke-gray colour, and
in particular positions reflects a variety of colours, blue, green,
yellow, red and brown.         The crystals approach those of fel
spar, but differ a little in the measurement of the angles. The
constituents are silica, alumina and lime, with a trace of soda.
The presence of lime distinguishes it from albite; and the
proportion of silica is much smaller.

    I think  it unnecessary to mention mica, epidote, steatite,
iron pyrites or carbonate of iron, which constitutes so abun
dant a mineral in this neighbourhood.         Nor is it necessary to
give an account of the gray ore of manganese which has been
met with, though sparingly, in the hills in our neighbourhood.
 But there are two species of minerals which I believe to be
peculiar to the range of hills in our district, and which, there
fore, deserve to be described.         These are Kilpatrick quartz,
 and sulphuret of cadmium, or Greenockite, as it has been
 called.
    1.  Kilpatrick quartz.-This variety of quartz occurs in the
 amygdaloid    of the Kilpatrick hills.
    It is white and translucent, and constitutes spheres about
 the size of a hazel-nut, mixed abundantly with stilbite and
 calcareous spar. The spheres constitute an aggregation of
 crystals; the exterior termination of each, examined by the
 microscope, is a four-sided prism.        The hardness is the same
 as that of common      quartz;    but the specific gravity is 2.525,
 while that of common quartz is 2:690. It contains 3 per
 cent. of water, according to the analysis of Dr. R. D. Thom
 son, who found also a trace of sulphuric acid; while common
 quartz is anhydrous.
    These differences seem to warrant the propriety of consi
 dering it as a peculiar species of quartz. The same mineral
 exists in the mountains of Nova Scotia, which bear a striking
 analogy with those in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, both
 in their constitution and in the minerals which they contain.
    2. Sulphuret of cadmium.—This mineral occurs along with
 prehnite in an amygdaloidal rock at Bishoptown in Ren
 frewshire.     It has also been seen on the Cochno burn on the
 north side of the Clyde.         It was mistaken for blende by the
 mineral dealers in the     neighbourhood.        Lord Greenock ex
 amined it in the summer of 1840, and showed to Professor
 Jameson that it could not be blende.         Mr. Connel subjected

 418 Prof. Kreil's Deductions from the first Year's Observations
 it to analysis, and found it to be pure sulphuret of cadmium.
 His analysis was performed on 3.71 grains.
    It is always crystallized in six-sided pyramids. The sum
 mit is sometimes replaced by   a more acute pyramid: some
of the crystals show a six-sided prism.
  Translucent to transparent.
  Lustre vitreous, or sometimes almost adamantine.
  Hardness about 2.75.
  Specific gravity 4:534; but the specimen was not quite
pure. Mr. Connel states the specific gravity to be 4.842;
but the determination was made on 3.68 grains.      the im        If
purity in my specimen was prehnite, the specific gravity of
pure sulphuret of cadmium will be 4.546.
  On subjecting it to analysis I obtained
             Sulphur...... 22.4 or 1:009 atom.
             Cadmium ... 77-6 or 1 atom.
                                     100'0
  This very nearly agrees with Mr. Connel's analysis, who
obtained from 3-71 grains of the mineral,
                 Sulphur ............ 22:56
                 Cadmium ......... 77'30—99'86
   Professor Jameson has distinguished this mineral by the
name of Greenockite, in honour of Lord Greenock, who first
discovered it.

tervals than was done at Milan, namely, at every hour from
5 a.m. to 10 p.m. *. This we have done uninterruptedly for
a twelvemonth, viz. from July 1839 to June 1840, and I have
now the pleasure of laying before you a summary view of the
principal results.
   1. The variations of the magnetic elements exhibit a de
pendence on the seasons, for there appear in certain months
maxima and minima of which scarcely a trace is discernible
in the opposite months.     It is therefore desirable to separate
the observations of the winter from those of the summer, and
to consider each apart.    By uniting them we should risk ob
taining a daily march which would be wholly imaginary, and
would not correspond with the phaenomena in any month of
the year. Thus, for example, the declination in the winter
months shows regularly a minimum in the later hours of the
evening; in summer the minimum occurs in the morning;
 the mean of the whole year, therefore, would show two
 minima, one in the evening, and the other in the morning,
 whereas the occurrence of two minima on the same day is in
 every month of the year an exception to the ordinary course.
I  do not consider the difference in the time of the minima in
 summer and winter a mere displacement arising from the
                   —
 season; at least it is not so in the case of the inclination, in
which a similar difference is observable: but this point must
be decided by future observations continued through the
hours of the night.
  In the winter months, October to March, we observed,
                                                                                 1.

     The numbers here given are not corrected for the influence
of temperature,   because it appears to affect not only the                            in
tensity, but also the direction of the magnetic force, and we
must wait for more certain data. The continued and simul
taneous observations of the bifilar magnetometer and the                               in
clinatorium have shown, indeed, that changes of temperature
are always accompanied by changes in the horizontal intensity;
but they are also accompanied by corresponding alterations
in the dip, which increases as the horizontal intensity de
creases, and vice versd.
   In some months of the year a decrease takes place in the
horizontal intensity between 2 and 5 p.m., which may be
ascribed to the maximum of inclination which occurs in those
hours; this was previously recognized in the Milan observa
tions.

424     Prof. Kreil's Deductions from the first Year's Observations
creased     force in increased temperature, and vice versd; but
there is     a correspondence between these numbers and the
monthly      means of the inclination; the inclination having de
creased     and the times of oscillation increased from October
to March, whilst subsequently to March the inclination            in
creased, and the times of oscillation decreased.         Such obser
vations, continued with instruments somewhat differently con
structed, but having the same purpose in view, will soon show
what part of this apparent connexion in the variations of the
intensity and inclination is due to the instrument, and what
 to the phaenomena themselves.
     5. The influence of the moon on the magnetic condition of
the earth was examined in the same manner as was done
in the     case   of the Milan observations.       Having corrected
 approximately       the observed horizontal intensities for tempera
 ture and the loss of magnetism sustained by the bar, there
 appeared a confirmation of the results previously obtained,
 viz. that the magnetism of the earth is stronger at the time of
 the new moon than when the moon is full. The mean of the
 whole body of the observations showed an intensity
                 During the last quarter = 549.99
                 At the new moon              = 548-79
                 During the first quarter = 542-62
                 At the full moon             = 54 l'11
     6. The    difficulty referred to in  par. 2. of freeing the ob
 servations of the horizontal intensity from the influence of
 temperature, and the uncertainty of the correction for the de
 crease of magnetism in the bar, induced me to adopt a mode
 of arranging the observations in reference to the inquiry        re
 latively to the moon, by which the errors arising from both
 these causes might be avoided.         If the moon has an influence
 on the magnetic condition of the earth, it must produce a
 daily variation, masked by the greater effect produced by
 the sun, but recognisable when the latter is eliminated.      I con
 structed, therefore, tables, having for their argument the day
  of the month, and for the titles of the several columns the
  different distances of the moon from the magnetic meridian,
  i.e. her magnetic horary angles. To simplify the calcula
  tion,  I assumed that the moon passed the magnetic meridian
  an hour earlier than the true meridian.           I deducted from
  each observation the        monthly   mean   corresponding   to the
  solar time of the observation; thus eliminating the influence
  of the sun, considered as the cause of the regular diurnal
  variation. This deduction being made, the remainders repre
  sent the sum of all other influences; but as these numbers
  were sometimes + and sometimes — I augmented each by a

                at the Magnetic Observatory at Prague.          425
constant quantity.       The numbers thus obtained     were entered
in the tables, each in the column corresponding to the distance
of the moon from the magnetic meridian at the time of the
observation. From the great number of observations that were
in this combination, it might be expected that the effects of
other influences would disappear, and that of the moon alone
would be visible. The two horizontal elements, the declina
 tion and intensity, were thus treated, and the means obtained
 for the separate months were combined in a yearly mean,
 which is represented in the following       table:–

      From this table we may draw the following conclusions:—
      I. If we take the sums of the declinations during the
  eastern and during the western horary angles, we find
  the first sum to exceed the second by 2:60 scale-divisions
   = 70".79; therefore the declination is greater when the moon
  is east of the meridian, as already shown by the Milan obser
  vations.
      II. If we compare the sum of the declinations correspond
  ing to the horary angles from 6" to 17" with those from 18"
  to 5", the first sum exceeds the second by 4'40 scale-divisions
   = 119".79; the declination is therefore greater when the
   moon is in the neighbourhood of the inferior meridian ; and
   the table shows that it is greatest at the hour when the moon
   is on the inferior meridian.
       III.  From the comparison of the sums of the declinations
   corresponding to the horary angles from 21" to 2" with the
   sums of those from 18" to 20", and 3" to 5", it results that the
   first sum exceeds the second by 0-97 scale-divisions = 26",41;
    therefore it appears that at the time of the moon's passing
   the superior meridian, a second maximum of the declination

   From this table it appears:—
   I. That the intensity is stronger when the moon is west of
the magnetic meridian, for the sum of the intensities corre
sponding to western horary angles exceeds by 5-14 scale-di
visions the sum of the intensities corresponding to eastern
horary angles.
   II.  The intensity is decidedly greater when the moon is in
the  neighbourhood      of the inferior meridian than when she is
near the superior meridian, for the horary angles from 6" to
17h give a sum greater by 28-08 scale-divisions than do the
horary angles from 18" to 5".
   7. The increased frequency and the greater number of the
Prague observations enabled us to pursue the interesting phae
nomena of the magnetic perturbations with more exactness
than we had been able to do at Milan.                 We proceeded in
the following manner with both the horizontal elements.
The changes were noted which had taken place between each
observation and the next, and the sum of these (3) was taken
for each day without reference to their signs. The monthly
mean of these sums was taken and called X. Now if on any

horizontal intensity than in the declination.

served to occur on the same days on which the same phae
nomenon had taken place in preceding years. The days
which particularly deserve notice in this respect, are about
the 18th of January, from the 18th to the 22nd of February,
and the 18th of October.

very great perturbations which took place in the same month
on the 6th, 7th, and 9th.

   These numbers confirm for the declination the deduction
already derived from the Milan observations, viz. that the
declination is increased by the disturbances in the forenoon
and middle of the day, and diminished by those occurring in
the evening hours. In respect to the horizontal intensity, the
negative signs are the prevailing ones, so that, in general,
disturbances diminish this element, which is also in corre
spondence with the previous deductions; but it also appears
from the numbers, that this occurs in a much higher degree
during the hours of the night and morning than in the fore
noon and afternoon.
   10. During the greater disturbances we did not fail to ob
serve for several hours, from 5 minutes to 5 minutes, and to
study the march of the phaenomena in                     all

been continuous instead of  hourly,   the declination might also

cipal planes of a surface of the second order, there exist conic
sections, termed by him eccentric conics, confocal to the
sections of the surface in the principal planes; possessing
properties analogous to the foci of curves of the second order;
and cylinders perpendicular to those planes, bearing an ana
logy to the directrices of the same curves;” but this and other
theorems of the same class, may be considered rather as the
limiting relations of confocal surfaces, than as analogous to
the well-known properties of curves of the second degree;
and this view of the subject is further confirmed by the consi
deration, that the theorems above alluded to fail in the very
case inost analogous to that of the conic sections, when the
surface is one of revolution round the transverse axe.
   M. Chasles, indeed, in a very elegant memoir published
now more than ten years ago *, has given several of the ana
logous theorems in the case of surfaces of revolution round
the transverse axe, but has not hitherto extended his re
searches to the case of oblate spheroids, or to that of surfaces
having three unequal axes, to do which is the object of the
following pages.                                   -

                                       have been led to the dis
covery of a very extensive class of properties of surfaces of
the second degree, hitherto, I believe, entirely unknown; from
which may be easily deduced a series of theorems, relative to
curves of the second order, none of which, so far as         am                         I
aware, have been yet given to the public.
   The restricted limits of the present communication pre
clude the possibility of giving more than an outline of the
theory, and the enunciations of several new theorems, the
demonstrations of several of which being somewhat tedious,
have been suppressed; but this can cause no difficulty to any
moderately expert analyst.

    We now proceed to give the enunciations of a very few
theorems, merely as specimens of the results which flow from
the preceding definitions, and the application of the method
alluded to above; premising that neither the preceding de
finitions, nor the following theorems, are applicable either
 to the hyperboloid of one sheet, or to the hyperbolic parabo
loid; and this may suggest a natural division of surfaces of
the second order into two classes, the one containing the
umbilical surfaces, the other those surfaces whose generatrices
are right lines.

fulfilment of this important and responsible duty, the Asso
ciation has continued to act upon the principle already laid
down in the Address of the General Secretaries at the meeting
at Newcastle in 1838, namely, to seek the aid of Government
in no case of doubtful or minor importance; and to seek it
only when the resources of individuals, or of individual bodies,
shall have proved unequal to the demand. The caution which it
has observed in this respect has been eminently displayed in the
 part which it has taken with reference to the Antarctic expe
dition, and to the fixed magnetical observatories. It abstained
from recommending the former to the Government until it had
called for, and obtained from Major Sabine, by whom the
importance of such an expedition was first urged, a report in
                                                                       its all
which that importance was placed beyond                      doubt; and                      it
withheld from urging the latter, although                     necessity was
fully felt       by
                  some           ofown    its

Baron Humboldt              the Duke
                               to             Sussex gave authority and

must again look              the Government, and

of the British Association, to the                   meeting at Glasgow,             1840.445
Company, who will certainly not fail to present the result of
their munificence to the world in an accessible form.             The
latter can only be overcome by a well-organized system. The
planning of this system, will, of course, be one of the first duties
of the Royal Society; and it is important that it should be
so arranged, that while every facility in the way of reduction
may be given to those who shall hereafter engage in the theo
retical discussion of the observations, care is taken at the same
time that the data are presented entire, without mutilation or
abridgement. The Council of the Royal Society, will, doubt
less, be greatly assisted in this duty by the eminent individual
who has had in every way so large a share in the formation
of these widely scattered magnetic establishments, and whose
own observatory, founded by the munificence of the Dublin
University, has nearly completed a twelve months' magnetic
observations on that enlarged and complete system of which
it set the first example.

      Yet although this report is on British reptiles, we are fully
   alive to the great progress which this department has made,
   and is making, on the Continent, through the labours of Count
   Münster, Jäger, and Hermann Von Meyer. The last-men
   tioned naturalist has been for some time preparing a series of
  exquisite drawings of very many forms unknown to us in
   England, most of which have been detected in the Muschel
   kalk, a formation not hitherto discovered in the British isles.

both upon climate and upon soil, the structure of the country

The Association has to thank the author for valuable tables,

generally.

THE   discovery of a large quantity of free electricity in a
  jet of steamt is decidedly of great interest, but the cir
cumstances under which this electricity is developed, are still
involved in such great mystery, that I cannot omit to call
 the early attention of the experimenter to some points which
appear to me of primary importance.
   Is the electricity in the jet of steam developed by the simple
evaporation of water in the boiler, by the expansion of high
pressure steam in the air, or by the condensation of the steam,
that is in     to its
               transition from the gaseous state         that         to
                                                                   which         in
itbegins      become visible?
    It would        of
                 course       easy   be decide the first question
                                               to                                          by

                   a                            metallic wire into the
                                                         a
boiler, the inner portion                 of
                                  which being       course     ofcontact        in
with the steam        theinchamber,    and    precautions  being   taken
to prevent the escape         steam either into the cylinder
                                    of                               the              or
open air.
    IfI  recollect right, during the process                    of
                                                      evaporation, the
evaporated part has been generally found                 negative elec
                                                                to   be

       in            the  remaining
                         to             liquid;  during   condensation
the reverse takes place.        According        Mr. Armstrong's ac
                                                          to
count, the electricity       the jet was positive, and seems there
                                    of
fore     correspond
         to            with the electricity developed           the pro         by
cess of the condensation of steam.               we ascribe the elec

      same as when it comes in contact with the outside, except
      the inside of the sheet iron, by a process of oxidation, becomes
      a non-conductor of electricity in respect to the outside.     An
   incrustation, according to Mr. Armstrong's account, was found
   in the boiler only as high as the water reached; but in boilers
   in which the water becomes very muddy, and which, there
   fore, are apt to prime, a sort of thin incrustation is often
   spread over the whole interior of the boiler as well as the
   safety-valve, and therefore the state of the interior of the
   steam-chamber ought to be very closely examined.
      The number of sparks obtained by Mr. Armstrong from
   the boiler at a distance of a quarter of an inch, amounted to
   between 60 and 70 per minute.                             If
                                                we assume the quantity of
   water necessary for a 28-horse power high-pressure engine
   to be 2:47 cubic feet per minute, supplied by two boilers; one
   boiler evaporated, therefore, l'93 cubic feet per minute, and
   the evaporation of 35.5 cubic inches of water with two ounces
   of Newcastle coal would be necessary to produce one spark
   of a quarter of an inch length per second, a quantity of elec
   tricity which seems to bear no proportion with the small
...quantity      electricity produced during simple evaporation on
                    of
     small scale.

been in an indurated                  state before the other was deposited.
The layers assume a         crystalline form only when they are in
close contact with the      iron plates.
   I have also shown         in the above-mentioned treatise, that
during the deposition       of certain salts held in solution by the
boiling water the ebullition became interrupted, taking place
only at intervals, and always with a sort of explosion or sud
den development of steam, which often caused the glass flask
to burst.     During these sudden explosions the electricity of
the  escaping    steam became so distinct, that it was readily
indicated   by   a common gold-leaf electroscope; the electri
city of the steam, on the contrary, escaping under ordinary cir
cumstances being so feeble, that it cannot be detected without
the aid of a condensator.
   The development of electricity during the crystallization
of certain salts is very well known, and many chemical de
posits occur only under a certain pressure, to which the liquid
containing them is subjected. Thus the carbonaceous de
posits in common gas retorts are entirely obviated when the
gas from the coals is evolved without pressure in the retorts,
or even in a partial vacuum.
   The columns of vapour and smoke arising from the craters
of volcanos generally discharge flashes of lightning in                                      all   di
rections, and         it obvious that the discharged electricity
                           is                                                                       is

 the same district, which were also supplied with colliery water,
 strongly impregnated with lime and other mineral matter.
 The steam from the safety-valves               these boilers also proved

propagated      under different pressures, and from water                              of va
rious descriptions; and by insulating myself and holding a
conducting-rod in the steam discharged from the safety
valves, I succeeded in every instance in obtaining electrical
sparks, which varied in the different cases from about one
fourth to about half an inch in length.
   In company with Mr. Robert Nicholson, the engineer of
the Newcastle and North Shields railway,         next tried the          I
boilers of the locomotive  engines  used on that railway, and
finding electricity in great abundance in the ejected steam
from these boilers,            I
                       determined, with Mr. Nicholson's per
mission and assistance, to institute a set of experiments upon
one of them, with a view to a fuller investigation of the sub
J eCt.
     I
     shall now briefly describe such of these experiments as
have been the most marked in their results, and shall divide
them into two classes, first taking those which were chiefly                                in
tended to exhibit the extent to which electricity existed in
the issuing steam, and then proceeding with the experiments
which were undertaken to ascertain the cause of the electric
development.    Nearly                  all
                               the experiments were made                                    at
night, under cover             of
                         the engine-shed, and the atmosphere
was generally humid; but when         happened       otherwise,
                                                      it                 to       be
the  quantity    of
                electricity  derived from the  jet was greatly
increased.
                                                                             by by

adopted   in the  previous   cases, that        say,      standing

 an insulated stool and holding with one hand               light iron          a
rod immediately above the safety-valve, while the steam was
freely escaping, and then advancing the other hand towards
any conducting body, sparks          about       of
                                                inch              an

obtained: but       was soon observed, that
                     it                                         by
                                                    elevating the rod
in the steam the electricity was gradually increased, and that
the maximum effect was not attained until the end of the
rod was raised five      six feet above the valve,
                               or                        which point         at
the length      of
                 the sparks occasionally reached two inches.
Small sparks were even obtained when the rod was wholly re
moved from the steam and held               the atmosphere
                                                       in          the                 at
distance   of two     three feet from the jet, and the electricity

454   Mr. W. G. Armstrong                         on the Electricity   of Effluent Steam.
the abstraction of electricity from the steam, and a sprin
kling of wet was undoubtedly felt on the face and hands
by the person holding the rod, so long as he remained                                          in
sulated, but the effect ceased as soon as the insulation was
destroyed.
    After fully trying the steam with a simple iron rod, as a
conductor, recourse was had to other conductors which pre
sented a larger surface to the steam, but the effect was not
materially increased until a bunch of pointed wires of different
lengths was attached to an iron rod and held in the issuing
 steam, with the points presented downwards.                The iron rod
 terminated in a round knob at the end next the hand, and
 from this knob sparks of the measured length of four inches
 were actually drawn, almost as rapidly as they could be
 counted, while a stream of electricity was at the same time
 passing off from the rod, at the part which most nearly ap
 proached the chimney of the engine.           Very perceptible sparks
 were also obtained when the         points   were held in a clear at
 mosphere, at the distance of at least eight feet from the nearest
 part of the jet.
    In     all
           the preceding experiments, the effect appeared                                     to   be
 proportionate        the quantity
                              to         steam discharged from the

 valve, when other things remained the same; and the elec
 tricity became quite imperceptible when the escape was very
 inconsiderable.

 dark, the edges          the lever and margin

    The application of this apparatus will be
easily understood.                 If
                             the steam were in the
same state of electricity in the boiler as when
it issued into the air, it would necessarily com
municate positive electricity to the insulated
cock C, in passing through the tube.         Or, if the

allowed the steam to expand in a very great degree before it
issued into the air, and caused it to be discharged in the state
of low-pressure steam; but no diminution of electricity could
be perceived in the jet, when thus attenuated; so that the elec
trical development does not appear to depend upon the de
gree of violence with which the steam comes in contact with
the atmosphere.
    The entire absence of negative electricity seemed to pre
clude the possibility of the phaenomena arising from expan
sion, and the only remaining supposition appeared to be, that
the condensation which took place in the jet, set free the
electricity which the steam had absorbed in the process of
evaporation.      This supposition had been previously rendered
 probable, when it was discovered that the upper and most
opake part of the jet yielded the most electricity, although
I   was at first inclined to attribute that circumstance to the
 dampness of the steam, in that part of the jet, rendering it a
                                                                                              to its
 better conductor, and causing it to part more readily with
 electricity.   Experiments were next, therefore, commenced

was very hot, and the production        the steam consequently          of
very rapid, the electricity given out was always most powerful.

                                    Electricity of Steam.                        461
  10.   I then insulated   an iron pan, twelve inches diameter and
two inches deep, and attached to        it a pith-ball electrometer,
with balls   three-eighths   of an inch diameter, and threads five
inches long, and also attached to the pan a metallic wire, the
pointed extremity of which was placed about one-twentieth
of an inch distant from the point of another wire connected
with the ground. The iron pan was then filled with cinders,
very hot, from a wind-furnace, and on projecting upon them
a few ounces of water, steam was evolved with great rapidity,
and at the same moment the pith balls diverged to the                                di
stance of an inch, and sparks passed between the metallic
 wires. This was several times repeated.
    These experiments enable us, I conceive, to give a clear
explanation of the electrical phaenomena presented by steam.
 There is no doubt whatever, as Dr. Faraday conjectures in
his note to Mr. Armstrong's paper in your last Number,
 “that this evolution of electricity by vaporization is the same
as that already known to philosophers on a much smaller
 scale.” The electricity appears to originate at the instant of
 vaporization, and the steam as it collects within the boiler is
electrified with positive electricity, the water and metallic
 boiler being at the same time negative. In this condition the
electricity of both is latent, like the electricity of the two plates
 of an excited electrophorus; but the instant steam is suffered
                 of its
 to escape,      positive electricity, being carried off along with
it,  and out      the influence               of
                                      the equivalent quantity     ne        of
gative electricity       the boiler,
                               in     becomes free, and hence the
 steam      electrical with positive electricity.
           is                                        The same thing
 takes place with the boiler,        which negative electricity
                                              in                   set          is
at  liberty     as
                the steam   escapes,  and which becomes evident                      on
 insulating the boiler.
     When steam much mixed with water,              what engine-men
 call “wet    steam,”  escapes   from     boiler,             it or
                                                    evidently cannot
                                                    a
 be   very highly electrical, for the negative water will tend                        to
 neutralize the positive steam, and this may perhaps            some       in
                                                                                     of on

lowering the water within                     its

The two methods are, in fact, so dissimilar in principle, and
in their results, that if one is right the other must be wrong.
But after the lapse of some years I am not able to discover
any error either in the principle or the details of the method
I have employed in the Philosophical Magazine, nor of that
in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions.       The object of
my present communication is to give a third solution, which
applies expressly to vibrations of the ball in a compressible
fluid.
   It will be proper to begin with proving generally that the
same equations apply to the motion of the fluid when directed
to or from a moving centre, as when directed to or from a
fixed centre.

where, from the nature of the investigation, the differential
coefficients are evidently partial.
    Now suppose the motion of the fluid to be directed to or
from a moving centre, and let two spherical surfaces separated
by a very small interval be described about this centre, the
interior one always passing through the point of space at
which we consider the motion. On account, therefore, of the
motion of the centre, the spherical surfaces will not be sta
tionary.     We may, however, conceive a conical surface, de
scribed as in the former case, to have            axis always passing                     its

        The day on which M. Gay Lussac made his ascent                                                                was   very
warm, and the values of y and H determined from his observations
may differ slightly from those mean values which will be obtained
hereafter from more complete data. The preceding theory supposes
implicitly that a given temperature at the earth's surface always cor
responds in any given place to a given pressure; this, owing to the
currents, the winds, and to other causes, is not the case; for the
atmosphere is never in a state of repose, and         temperature and                               its

poverty of our archives in this respect.    Mr. Henwood's Survey of
the Mines has  probably  brought together  a larger collection of copies
of mining  plans than had ever before been obtained ; but unless simi
lar labour be still devoted to their accumulation, it is vain to hope
for them, unless at an expense which would perhaps but seldom
be repaid by their value to any but practical miners.
   The rock formations of Cornwall had, until recently, been thought
among the most ancient; but the late researches of Messrs. Sedg
wick and Murchison induce them to place our “killas” at an epoch
not anterior to the old red sandstone, on zoological evidence of much
force; whilst to the granite and                     its
                                       congeners they ascribe       still                               a

                        ATOMIC WEIGHT OF CARBON.
        M. DUMAS and Stas have, together, performed fourteen expe
       riments relative     the atomic weight
                              to                   carbon; the results all
                                                              of
agree, and were obtained either              by
                                       the combustion     pure charcoal
                                                                    of                      or
 ofhighly carbonated and well-known substances. The combustion
was performed      oxygen, and care was taken
                   in                               dry the gases obtained
                                                               to
either    by
           sulphuric acid          or
                                chloride            of
                                             calcium.    Thus dried, they
were passed through two pieces           apparatus filled with solution
                                              of                                            of
potash, and    a third filled with potash       powder.  inThe increased
weight     the solutions and dry potash gave the weight
          of                                                       the car     of

                                                         of                                 of
the carbonic acid gas obtained, were known; and from these, with

 478                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
out any hypothesis, the proportions in which the bodies combine
could be deduced. According to M. Berzelius, the proportions are 200
of oxygen to 76.52 of carbon. According to the recent experiments,
above-mentioned, by MM. Dumas and Stas, the result will be very
different, for they gave by the combustion of naphthalin, four ex
periments, 75:21, 75:01, 75:08, 75.07; by the combustion of cam
phor, three experiments, 75.1, 75.1, 75-0; by the combustion of
benzoic acid, two experiments, 75-09, 75.03; by that of the native
graphite of Ceylon, three experiments, 74.91, 75-05, 74-99; by
artificial graphite extracted from an iron which contained most of
 it,two experiments, 74-87, 74°90. “All these numbers,” M. Dumas
remarks, “agree        showing that the true atomic weight
                               in                                    carbon                            of
is 75, and not 76-52. There            consequently  is  error    the indis         an         in
pensable elements         fixing the formulae now employed
                                is                                  organic

                                                                    be                               to in
chemistry.     That         say, there will
                                to              many   formulae     modify,
many analyses         repeat, especially                           of
                             in to
                                              those substances which are
rich   in carbon,      which very considerable errors may have been
committed.”
   M. Dumas adds, that the Academy will remark with interest, that
this long and laborious series         experiments has brought
                                                     of                 the                             us   to

                                             who had long supposed that
the atomic weight        charcoal was exactly equal

 serious verification.
    “The Academy,” continues M. Dumas, “will remark also with
interest, that the atomic weight                         of
                                         carbon which results from these

IN  friend Professor Challis, on the theoretical resistance to
the motion of a sphere vibrating in an elastic medium.    The
problem is so difficult, and so important in           application  its                     to
geodesy, and therefore              general   interest,

has been in a great measure removed by the analysis of Cauchy
and others, who have considered the distances of the undula
tory particles as quantities comparable to the length of a wave;
velocities of propagation of the different rays of the spectrum
are made to depend upon the length of wave which constitutes
a ray of a given colour, and upon certain constants proper to
the medium; these constants being obtained from observations
on refractive indices for certain definite rays (or dark lines)
of the spectrum, the refrangibility of any other definite ray
(whose wave-length has been ascertained by examining an inter
ference-spectrum) becomes known, and may be compared with
observation as a test of theory; such experiments have been
made by Frauenhofer, Rudberg, and Professor Powell, who
has given a tabular view of the various results, without, how
ever, instituting the comparison between theory and observa
tion, which it would be desirable to extend further than has
yet been done. It would be important also to elucidate the
disturbing effect of temperature, which prevents even existing
observations from being rigorously comparable.

degree be removed, as far as regards our own country, by pro
curing, and causing to be published, translations of foreign
scientific memoirs judiciously selected.        Accordingly at each
of the   meetings    at Newcastle and      Birmingham        a grant of
 100l. was  placed   at the disposal  of a committee      appointed  to
carry this purpose into effect.      Aided by the contributions of
several translations which have been gratuitously presented to
them, the committee have been enabled, in the two last years,
to publish fourteen memoirs on subjects of prominent interest
and importance in the mathematical and physical sciences,
bearing the names of some of the most eminent of the conti
nental philosophers.
   Such, gentlemen, is an imperfect review of our recent pro
ceedings. In two essential respects the British Association
differs from           all
                  the annual scientific meetings        the Continent,

     Ithink that the discrepancies about 854, 86, 86}, are caused by
irregularities in the refractions of the Tab. Reg. Groombridge,
who made many observations for the purpose of determining the
amount of the refraction near the horizon, makes the horizontal re
fraction, for barometer 30 inch, and therm. Fahr. 50°, 2075".4.”
There      is,
             however, some uncertainty respecting this quantity, and
generally respecting the amount                                       of
                                          refractions near the horizon.
 Upon this point see Delambre, Ast., vol.               319.     Mr. Ivory            i.    p.
says “There         great probability that the horizontal refraction
                      is                                                                                                          is
very near 2070", and does not exceed that quantity.”
    But for the irregularity       Bessel's table, which
                                                   in          clearly seen                             is

   In atmospheres which extend to       an infinite distance m (or r" in
the notation of this treatise) is infinite and e always = 1, so that in
this case the method employed by Mr. Ivory in p. 211 of his me
moir, Phil. Trans., 1838, would seem at least to require further
elucidation.   Mr. Ivory has avoided this consideration, which
would otherwise arise with the atmosphere which he has assumed,
by imposing an arbitrary limit to the altitude of his atmosphere,
while, however, if I am not mistaken, upon his own assumption,
the density and the pressure are still finite.      When n is large the
numerators of the separate quantities of which the quantity            E,                  A,
in p. 211 is composed become large also.
   I do not find in Mr. Ivory's paper any remarks tending to prove
that the quantities which he has discarded depending upon the
higher powers of          f
                       and h are incapable of producing any sensible
effect; taken separately they are by no means insignificant.         Nor
do I think it follows as a matter of   course, even if the  positive and
negative terms are numerically of equal value at the horizon, and
so fortunately cut one another out, that the same thing will happen
necessarily at       all
                     other altitudes.   Unless the approximation

     It is unnecessary to dwell any further at present upon this sub
ject, because if my theory of the Heat of Vapours be correct, the
 calculation of Astronomical Refractions, founded upon conditions
 which are not in conformity with that theory, becomes a problem of
 mere curiosity.

              POSITIVE GEOLOGY..—DEVONIAN          SYSTEM.
   the Home Department of Positive            Geology, the most striking
INcircumstance has been an announcement           by Professor Sedgwick
and Mr. Murchison of the conclusion          to which they were led by
Mr. Lonsdale's suggestion in December 1837, founded on the inter
mediate character of the fossils in the Plymouth and Torbay lime
stone—that the greater part of the slate rocks of the south of Devon
and of Cornwall belong to the old red sandstone formation.
   The order of the observations which have led to this important
result, is nearly as follows:—
   In a paper read at Cambridge, during the winter of 1836–37,
Professor Sedgwick considered the fossiliferous slates on both sides
of Cornwall to be of the same formation, and coeval, or nearly so,
with the calcareous rocks that lie between the slates of South
Devon.
  In 1836 and 1837 also", Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison pro
posed to transfer the culmiferous or anthracitic shale and grits (Shil
lot and Dunstone) of North Devon to the carboniferous system;
withdrawing them from the grauwacke in which they had before
been included, and thus assigning a much more recent date than
heretofore to the strata which occupy nearly one third part of the
map of Devonshire.
   But the relations of the slates and limestones of South Devon still
remained to be determined ; the mineral characters of the former
being different from those of the old red sandstone beneath the car
boniferous group, in many parts of South Wales and in Hereford
shire, while the true position of the limestones (e.g. those of Ply
mouth, Torbay, and Newton Bushell,) was doubtful.        At this period
(1837), the fossils of this district were examined by Mr. Lonsdale
and Mr. Sowerby, to whom the organic remains, both of the car
boniferous and Silurian systems, were familiar.      It was soon per
ceived, that while some of the South Devonshire fossils approached
to those of the carboniferous strata, and others to those of Siluria,
there were still many species which could not be assigned to either
system; the whole, taken together, exhibiting a peculiar and inter
mediate palaeontological character.      Mr. Lonsdale therefore sug
gested, that the difficulties which had perplexed this inquiry could
be removed by regarding the limestones of South Devon as subor
dinate to slaty rocks, which represent the old red sandstones of Here

Devonshire being intermediate between the culmiferous basin of
North Devon, and the Silurian strata,-if the latter exist in that
county.
   The value of this suggestion was not at first appreciated; but
after the lapse of more than a year, Mr. Lonsdale's views were
adopted (March 1839) by Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison*, who
soon afterwards applied this new arrangement not only to the groups
of Devonshire originally under review, but with a boldness which
does credit to their sagacity, extended it to the whole of the slaty
and calciferous strata of Cornwall,               then known only        grau

  510        Geological Society:—Anniversary Address.
     Mr. Austen, in a communication relating to the structure of the
 south of Devon, has identified the calcareous slate and limestone
 of the south of Cornwall with the limestones of this district, and con
siders that of Torbay among the newest deposits in the latter series.
    The Rev. D. Williams also has communicated two papers re
specting these disputed rocks, which he refers to the transition
 or grauwacke system, and endeavours to show that the strata of De
 vonshire can be distinguished into certain groups by their litholo
gical characters.
    Mr. De la Beche in his map of Devon and Cornwall, published
in 1839, has adopted divisions of the strata, similar to those of Pro
fessor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison, as to their order of sequence;
applying, provisionally, to the culmiferous rocks the name of Car
bonaceous series, and to the Devonian and Cornish slates the appel
 lation of Greywacke.
    We know also on the authority of Mr. De la Beche that tin mines
are worked in carbonaceous rocks at Owlescomb near Ashburton,
on the east side of the Dartmoor granite, and on its west side at
Wheal Jewel near Tavistock. He further informs us that one of
the richest tin mines now worked in Cornwall, namely the Charles
town mine, east of St. Austle, is in a fossiliferous rock containing
 Encrinites and corals, and that the same corals occur also near tin
mines at St. Just; and in the neighbourhood of Liskeard the Rev.
 D. Williams has found slates which contain vegetable impressions,
dipping under other slates which are intersected by lodes of tin and
copper.
    From  these   new facts, we learn that the killas and other slate
rocks of Cornwall and the south of Devon do not possess the high
antiquity which has till lately been imputed to them; and that tin
occurs, as copper, lead and silver have long been known to do, not
only in slate rocks that contain organic remains, but even in the
coal formation.
    Soon after the publication of the views of Messrs. Sedgwick and
Murchison,     a similar change was applied by Mr. Griffith to the
south-west portion of his geological map of Ireland. In a paper
that accompanied the presentation of this map to us on 22nd of
May last, he states that he has now coloured, as old red sandstone
and carboniferous limestone, extensive districts of the counties of
Kerry, Cork, and Waterford, previously considered of higher anti
quity; imputing his former erroneous opinion to the identity in
lithological character of the shales and grits of the old red sand
stone and carboniferous systems, with the older rocks in the transi
tion series.
    Mr. Griffith has also demonstrated by sections the unconform
able position of the carboniferous and old red sandstone formations,
which overlie older and more highly inclined slates in the counties
of Kerry, Cork, Waterford, and Wexford.
    Mr. Charles William Hamilton has likewise adopted similar
changes; and believes that the slates which occupy a large space
between the Mourne Mountains and Dublin are equivalent to those
near Cork, which he now transfers to the old red sandstone.

                                               Devonian System.                                             511
    Mr. Greenough, in the new edition of his map of England, repre
sents nearly the same boundaries and order of succession in Devon
and Cornwall as we find in the maps of Mr. De la Beche and Messrs.
Sedgwick and Murchison; but in his memoir connected with the
map, adopting the name of Carbonaceous series for the culmife
rous rocks, he substitutes that of Upper killas for the Devonian
system of Sedgwick and Murchison, (including under that term
the old red sandstone of Herefordshire,) and Lower killas for the
slates inferior to the Silurian system, which they have termed Cam
brian.         -
    Mr.   Greenough,      in his memoir, also shows by quotations from Dr.
MacCulloch, that the undisputed old red sandstone of the north of
Scotland exhibits, at intervals, the same great changes of mineral
character, that occur in the strata intermediate between the Carbo
naceous and Silurian systems in the west of England and on the
borders of Wales; and justly infers the inadequacy of any one term
to characterize formations which vary so much in lithological com
position, that at one place they present the condition of a fine
grained silky slate, at another of sandstone, and at a third that of
coarse gravel and conglomerate rock.
    Thus, with respect to the slate rocks of Devon, Cornwall and
Wales, the difficulties are reduced to those of an unsettled nomen
clature; whilst nearly           parties are allunison        the fundamental
                                                                       in             as   to

                                          COAL FORMATION.
    The Society has received from Professor Ansted a paper on the
Carboniferous and Transition Rocks of Bohemia, a country which
he visited last summer, directing especial attention to the district
between Prague, Luditz and Pilsen, which he has illustrated by sec
tions made from personal observation.             Above the fundamental
granite and gneiss he found extensive deposits of grauwacke, on
which lie, in unconformable superposition, disconnected patches of
the coal formation.       The age of this coal is well known, from the
fossil Flora of Count Sternberg, who resided in the midst of it near
Swina, to be identical with that of the great Coal formation of En
gland.     Mr. Ansted gives information also as to the action of trap
rocks in producing disturbances of the strata in this district; and re
specting dislocations, by which the grauwacke is several times placed
on a level with the coal measures, whilst in some cases the strata are
inverted and the coal measures laid beneath the grauwacke.
    We have received an interesting communication from Mr. Hawk
shaw respecting a remarkable disclosure made in the Bolton Railway,
six miles north of Manchester, of five fossil trees in a position vertical
to the plane of the strata in which they stand. The roots are im
bedded in a soft argillaceous shale immediately under a thin bed
of coal. Near the base of one tree, and beneath the coal, more than
a bushel of hard clay nodules was found, each inclosing a cone of
Lepidostrobus variabilis. The bark of the trees was converted to
coal, from one quarter to three quarters of an inch thick; the sub
stance which has replaced the interior of the trees is shale; the cir
cumference of the largest of them is 15% feet at the base, 7} at the
 top, and      its
               height      feet. One tree has spreading roots, four feet
                                11
in   circumference, solid and strong.       By the care     Mr. Hawkshaw            of
these trees have been preserved, and             covering      erected over
                                                                   a                  is
them. The attendant phaenomena seem                  show that they grew     to
upon the strata that             lie
                             immediately beneath their roots”.
     Mr. Barber Beaumont,            communication respecting these same
                                           in   a
 trees, considers that               no
                              drifted plants occur     coal fields, and that   in
 all  the vegetables which are now converted into coal, grew upon
 swampy islands covered with luxuriant vegetation, which accu
 mulated       in
                the manner         peat bogs; that these islands, having
                                           of
 sunk beneath the sea, were there covered with sand, clay and shells,
 till they again became dry land, and that this operation was repeated
in   the formation         of
                        each bed      coal.     denying altogether the pre

siderable distances from the spots on which they grew.         Proofs are
daily increasing in favour of both opinions: viz. that some of the
vegetables which formed our beds of coal grew on the identical
banks of sand and silt and mud, which being now indurated to
stone and shale, form the strata that accompany the coal; whilst
other portions of these plants have been drifted, to various distances,
from the swamps, savannahs, and forests that gave them birth, par
ticularly those that are dispersed through the sandstones, or mixed
with fishes in the shale beds.
   The cases are very few in which I have ever seen fossil trees, or
any smaller vegetables erect and petrified in their native place.
The Cycadites and stumps of large Coniferous trees on the surface
of the oolite in Portland, and the stems of Equisetaceous plants
described by Mr. Murchison in the inferior oolite formation near
Whitby, and erect plants which I have found in sandy strata of the
latter formation near Alencon, are examples of stems and roots over
laid by sediment and subsequently petrified without removal from
the spots in which they grew.       At Balgray, three miles north of
Glasgow, I saw in the year 1824, as there still may be seen, an un
equivocal example of the stumps of several stems of large trees stand
ing close together in their native place in a quarry of sandstone of
the coal formation.
   In a paper on the sinking of the surface over coal mines, Mr. Bud
dle has shown that the depressions produced on the surface by the
excavation of beds of coal near Newcastle-on-Tyne are regulated by
the depth and thickness of the coal, the nature of the strata above
it, and also the partial              or

   A paper has been read by Mr. Henry Lawes Long on the occur
rence of numerous subterraneous chasms or swallow-holes in the chalk
on the west of Farnham, with observations on the drainage of the
country near the west extremity of the highly-inclined ridge of chalk,
called the Hog's Back, between Guildford to Farnham. The land
springs immediately on the north of Farnham descend southwards
in open gulleys over tertiary strata, until they arrive at the narrow
band of chalk which passes under Farnham Park, where they are
suddenly engulphed in transverse fissures or swallow-holes, through
which they pass under ground to a considerable distance, and again
break forth on the southern side of the chalk.               Seven of these
swallow-holes occur near         Farnham,   from some of which the water
emerges in sufficient force to turn a mill.         They are probably con
nected with subterranean faults and transverse fractures, the origin
of which was coeval with the elevation of the narrow band of chalk,
which forms the Hog's Back, and which, near Farnham, is inclined
at a high angle to the north.         The water that now passes through
the Farnham swallow-holes may tend to enlarge the chasms through
which it takes        its
                        subterraneous course,                   by

•   In illustration of the history of the Eocene division of the tertiary
 strata, Mr. Bowerbank has concluded, from his personal observations
 at White cliff bay in the Isle of Wight, that there are no well-defined
  zoological distinctions between the London and plastic clays, but that
  in the cliffs of this bay the same shells are common to alternations
  of these clays with one another. At Alum bay also he found many
 London clay fossils in beds of greenish grey sand and clay below
  the variegated sands and clays referred by Mr. Webster to the pla
 stic clay.       A similar rectification was sometime ago proposed by
  Professor     Sedgwick.
     We have also witnessed during the past year the commencement
  of a valuable publication by Mr. Bowerbank on the fossil fruits and
 seeds of the London clay, illustrated with very numerous and accu
 rate engravings by Mr. James Sowerby.
     The great attention the author has long paid to the remains of fruits
 and seeds which occur in such vast abundance in the Isle of Sheppy,
 whence he has collected not less than 25,000 specimens, place him
 in a position peculiarly advantageous for the object before him.
 In this work drawings will be given of the anatomical structure of
 many of these fossils, as seen under the microscope. The simple ex
 pedient Mr. Bowerbank has adopted of preserving these fruits in jars
 of water, has kept him in the entire possession of every specimen
 ever placed in his collection; whilst of the thousands of similar
 fossils that have been deposited in other collections, including that
 at the British Museum, nearly                      all
                                            have perished from the decompo

occasional intercalation or juxta-position of stratified materials is
ascribed to the action of currents on materials also falling from
melting icebergs.
    Mr. Lyell refers the complicated bendings and tortuous foldings
of many beds of this formation near Mundesley and Cromer to la
teral pressure from drifting ice, especially where extremely con
torted beds repose upon undisturbed and horizontal strata.                  But he
admits that some of them may be due to landslips of ancient date,
and which had no connection with the present line of cliffs.                     At
the bottom of the boulder formation, and immediately above the
chalk, extensive remains of a buried forest occur, the stools of the
trees being imbedded in black vegetable earth.                 From the position
of this forest a vertical subsidence of several hundred feet and a
subsequent rise of the land to the same amount is inferred.                     This
forest and a bed of lignite are connected with fluviatile or lacustrine
deposits, which occur about the level of low water below the drift;
but at Mundesley they are partly above                            it,

 Pliocene period.                                                       230 species

 30  per cent. This group therefore Mr. Lyell ascribes                the Miocene             to
 era.      A collection       345 species
                                     of         Coralline Crag shells
                                                            of                   Mr.                     in
 Wood's cabinet was then compared                like manner, and sixty-seven

 were determined               identical with recent species, being about
                                to    be                                                                           19
 per cent. Mr. Lyell, therefore, considers that the Coralline Crag also                                  is

                      Supercretaceous formations,                  517
Miocene, although belonging to a more remote part of that period
than the Red Crag. Having obtained from M. Dujardin a collection
of 240 shells from the Faluns of Touraine, he found with Mr. George
Sowerby's assistance that the recent shells were in the proportion of
twenty-six per cent., so that he has now come round to the opinion
long ago announced by M. Desnoyers, that upon the whole the Crag
of Suffolk corresponds in age with the Faluns of Touraine, both be
ing Miocene, although the species in the two countries are almost
entirely distinct, those of England    having a northern and those of
France a sub-tropical character.      I am also informed by Mr. Lyell,
that out of 400 marine and freshwater species, from the Eocene strata
of the London and Hampshire basins, Mr. G. Sowerby was scarcely
able to identify two per cent. with living shells. It is satisfactory
therefore to observe that the test of age derived from the relative
approach to the recent Fauna is in perfect accordance with the      in
dependent evidence drawn from superposition.          We ascertain for
example by superposition that the freshwater strata of the mud cliffs
of East Norfolk rest on Norwich crag, and are the newest forma
tion of all. They are then followed in the descending series by, 1st,
the Norwich, 2ndly, the Red, and 3rdly, the Coralline Crag, beneath
which is the London Clay. The same order of sequence is indi
cated by the organic remains considered independently, and simply
with reference to the degree of their correspondence with the ex
isting Fauna.
    It has been known for many years, that near Bridlington, in York
shire, sand and clay containing marine tertiary shells had been ex
posed on the coast. From an examination of the shells collected
there by Mr. Bean, Mr. Lyell finds the deposit to agree in age with
the Norwich Crag.
    I  cannot conclude these remarks without observing, that some
 part of the confusion and apparent inconsistency of the opinions of
different conchologists, respecting the age of the Crag, must have
 arisen from the intermixture of fossils derived equally from
 the Norfolk and Suffolk beds, or from strata, some of which now
 turn out to be referable to the Older Pliocene, others to the Miocene
 period.
     From an examination of some fossil shells, identical with recent
 species collected by Capt. Bayfield from the most modern deposit
 near the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and near Quebec, Mr. Lyell infers,
 that the climate of Canada was colder than now during the era im
 mediately antecedent to our own times. The shells, which were de
 termined by Dr. Beck, differ in great part from those now living
 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, agree more nearly with arctic genera
 and species, and resemble those which Mr. Lyell collected at Udde
 valla, in Sweden; whereas, if the living shells most abundant in the
 Swedish and Canadian seas are contrasted, they differ almost en
 tirely.    From notes sent by Capt. Bayfield, it appears that at
 different depths in the stratified sand and clay containing the
  fossil shells, near Quebec, insulated boulders are numerous, which,
  it is presumed, have    been   brought down at distant intervals   by

melted.
   While Mr. Lyell, by the aid of Dr. Beck's determination of fos
sils, had adopted these views respecting the climate of Canada, Mr.
James Smith, of Jordan Hill, had been led by independent observa
tions to a similar conclusion respecting the climate of Scotland
during the Newer Pliocene era, arguing from the arctic character of
the Testacea found in the raised beds of the valley of the Clyde, and
other localities. In the first of two papers communicated by this
author, he regarded               all
                             the deposits abounding           recent shells               in                       in
Scotland and Ireland          belonging
                                     as       one group; but to    his second                      in
memoir he contends that there are two distinct formations on the
Clyde,                        of                          fifteen per cent.                                        of

 that fell on board the Roxburgh off the Cape de Verd islands in
 February, 1839, the cause of which was not apparent. The sails
 were covered with a fine powder, resembling the ashes of Vesuvius,

     In the department of Palaeontology Prof. Owen has, during the
 past year, contributed many papers, with his usual zeal and ability,
 to the elucidation of this most essential and perhaps most generally
 interesting branch of our subject.    At the head of these we must
 place his determination of a tooth and part of a jaw of a fossil mon
 key, of the genus macacus, with part of the jaw of an opossum, and
 the tooth of a bat, in Eocene strata of the English tertiary forma
 tion. These remains were found at Kingston, near Woodbridge in
 Suffolk, by Mr. Colchester, in strata which Mr. Lyell has referred
to the London clay; thus proving the existence of quadrumanous,
marsupial, and cheiropterous animals in this country during the
 Eocene period. We have now evidence of fossil Quadrumana in
the tertiary formations, not only of India and Brazil, but also of
France and England; respecting which Mr. Owen has observed,
that they appear under four of the existing modifications of the
quadrumanous type: viz. the tailless ape (Hylobates), found fossil in
the South of France; the gentle vegetable-feeding Semnopithecus,
found fossil in India; the more petulant and omnivorous Macacus,
found in Norfolk; and the platyrrhine Callithriw, found in Brazil.
This genus is peculiar to America,           and            its

      About twelve years ago we witnessed the creation of a new de
  partment in geological investigations, viz. the science of Ichnology,
  founded on the evidence of footsteps made by the feet of animals
  upon the ancient strata of the earth; this new method commenced
  with the recognition of the footmarks of reptiles on the New Red
  Sandstone near Dumfries, and not long after (1834) was followed
  by most curious and unexpected discoveries in Saxony and Ame
  rica. The Chirotherium of Hessberg and Ornithichnites of Con
  necticut were among                       its
                                 early results. Our own country has during
  the last two   years been    abundantly    productive       similar appearances       of

rain drops on different parts of the same footstep has varied with the
unequal amount of pressure on the clay and sand, by the salient
cushions and retiring hollows of the creature's foot; and from the
constancy of this phaenomenon upon an entire series of footmarks
in a long continuous track, we know that this rain fell after the
animal had passed. The equable size of the casts of large drops
that cover the entire surface of the slab, except in the parts im
pressed by the cushions of the feet, record the falling of a shower of
heavy drops on the day in which this huge animal had marched
along the ancient strand; hemispherical impressions of small drops,
upon another stratum, show it to have been exposed to only a
sprinkling of gentle rain that fell at a moment of calm.
   In one small slab of New Red Sandstone found by Dr.Ward near
Shrewsbury, we have a combination of proofs as to meteoric, hydro
static, and locomotive phaenomena, which occurred at a time incal
culably remote, in the atmosphere, the water, and the movements of
animals, and from which we infer with the certainty of cumulative cir
cumstantial evidence, the direction of the wind, the depth and course
of the water, and the quarter towards which the animals were
passing; the latter is indicated by the direction of the footsteps which
form their tracks; the size and curvatures of the ripple-marks on
the sand, now converted to sandstone, show the depth and direction
of the current; the oblique impressions of the rain drops register
the point from which the wind was blowing, at or about the time
when the animals were passing.
    Demonstrations founded solely upon this kind of circumstantial
evidence were duly appreciated, and are well exemplified, by the
acute author of the story of Zadig; who from marks he had noticed
on the sand, of      long ears, and teats, and tail, and from irregular im
                             its

                                                                          of of

    During the last year the Society has received no communication
 on Mineralogy; and almost the only volume that has been published
 in England on this much-neglected subject, has been a small but
 highly elaborate treatise on Crystallography by Professor Miller, of
 the University of Cambridge. In this treatise the author has adopted
 the crystallographic notation proposed by Professor Whewell in his
 paper on a General Method of calculating the Angles of Crystals,
 and the laws according to which they are formed, published in the
 Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1825; and Professor
 Naumann's method of indicating the positions of the faces of a cry
 stal by the points in which radii, drawn perpendicular to the faces,
 meet the surface of a sphere. The expressions which have been
 thus obtained are remarkable for their symmetry and simplicity, and
 are     all
         adapted     logarithmic computation, and for the most part
                               to

of Arts awarded him their medal and a premium of £50.                   In the
same year also his stratigraphical      collection of organic remains was
purchased for the British Museum; this collection having formed
the basis of his two separate volumes, entitled “Strata identified
by their Organized Fossils,” 1815, and “a Stratigraphical System of
Organized Fossils,” 4to, 1817.
   During the six years which followed the publication of his map
of England, he put forth twenty geological maps of English coun
ties on a larger scale, and several coloured sections across the south
of England, and a general Geological Section of England and
Wales, from London to Snowdon.
   Among his unpublished papers were found unfinished and in
part printed, an introductory work on geology, and preparations
for a volume on OEconomic Geology, both illustrating      -     the original
ity of his views.
   Mr. WILLIAM SMITH entered on the field of his honourable ex
ertions as a Civil Engineer and Mineral Surveyor at a time when
his labours in geology were but little appreciated, and almost solitary.
Amidst difficulties and discouragements, and at intervals snatched
from the duties of a laborious profession, he accomplished the gi
gantic work of a general mineralogical survey of England, founded
almost entirely on his own personal observations, which he ulti
mately recorded in a nap of fifteen coloured sheets, published by
                                                        -

   Inevitable delays retarded the appearance of this work nearly to
the time when a more detailed and perfect map, by a distinguished
president of this Society, eclipsed in some degree the fame which
would have accrued to             author had       its

surveyor and civil engineer.          His early professional occupations
from the year 1791         1799, whilst surveying collieries, constructing
                                         to
a  part      of
            the Somerset coal canal near Bath, and preparing reports

 528        Geological    Society:-Anniversary Address,
respecting a supply of water for the Kennet and Avon Canal, and
the trade it was likely to derive from carriage of stone and coal,
&c., placed him in daily contact with geological phaenomena espe
cially calculated to illustrate the order of superposition of the English
strata, and laid the foundation of his future discoveries.
   By carefully noting the characters of the beds which he found
in juxtaposition,  and making comparative sections in various direc
tions in the  vicinity  of Bath, he ascertained that an uniform order
of succession   pervades  the groups exposed in the escarpments of the
hills in that part   of  England,  and that this uniformity is attended
by a similarity in the organic remains of certain beds, which differ
entirely from those of the groups above and below them; by dili
gently collecting and collating these remains, he drew the inference,
that each group of strata contains extraneous fossils peculiar to itself.
   His next step was to infer that the strata thus identified by himself
in Somerset and Wiltshire were not of insulated and local occur
rence, but formed parts of the great system of deposits extending
over England; and thus, after many years of intense labour and
continual travel, he succeeded in extending the principles first
caught sight of in the neighbourhood of Bath, into that philoso
phical generalization which became the basis of his geological map
of England.
   Before Mr. Smith had quitted his occupations in Somerset and
his residence at Bath, he indicated on a coloured map the geologi
cal structure of that neighbourhood.        This document, dated 1799,
is in the museum of our       Society.   He had also arranged his col
lections of rocks and their    organic  remains in the order of succes
sion and continuity of the several strata; but neglecting to ap
propriate to himself the merit of these discoveries by immediate
publication, he liberally imparted a knowledge of each, as it gra
dually arose, to his private friends, through whose oral communi
cations they obtained such general currency, that their real author
was frequently lost sight of or unknown.        I was myself indebted to
Mr. Smith, though at that time a stranger to me, for my first know
ledge of the order of succession in the oolitic series.    This I derived
from information imparted to me by the late Rev. B. Richardson of
Farley Castle, who had himself acquired it from Mr. Smith. A ta
bular view of the superposition of the English strata, written by Mr.
Richardson, from the dictation of Smith in 1799, at the house of the
Rev. Joseph Townsend, in Bath, and since also presented to this So
ciety, forms a documentary proof of the extent of his discoveries be
fore the conclusion of the last century.
   In 1817 he planned the beautiful museum of Scarborough, in
which he employed his original and instructive method of repre
senting, by sloping shelves passing one beneath another, the inclined
position of the strata; each shelf bearing the fossils that are re
spectively characteristic of the stratum it is intended to represent.
   These works of William Smith undoubtedly place him in the
position of an original discoverer, who was the first to establish,
on an enlarged basis of evidence, the important facts of constancy

in the order of superposition, and continuity in the horizontal ex
tension of the strata of this island; and to prove that each of these
strata is characterized by organic remains peculiar to itself. But it
must not be forgotten, that both in this country and on the conti
nent, other investigators, many of them no doubt unknown to him,
were simultaneously collecting similar evidence in support of this
great physical generalization.         It only enhances the value and con
firms the accuracy of Mr. Smith's conclusions, that the results of
other independent inquiries were found to be in perfect harmony
with his own.       It is known to                            all

                           observed       the petrifactions      contains; and               it

534          Geological Society —Anniversary Address.
  The meetings held for the purpose of forwarding Count Bour
non's work by some of the most distinguished mineralogists of that
day, when collections in geology were rare, was one of the steps that
brought together our first founders: many of them were till then
strangers to each other, and being thus accidentally introduced, they
resolved from thenceforth to cooperate for the furtherance of objects
in which they felt a common interest, and became the germ of the
Geological Society.
    Sir John St. Aubyn was at this time occupied, like his friends
Sir Abraham Hume and Mr. Greville, in making large and costly
additions to his cabinet of simple minerals, the nucleus of which
consisted of the specimens he had purchased of Dr. Babington in
the year 1799, and which are described by Babington in his cata
logue (one vol. 4to) published in the same year. These specimens
had previously been the property of Lord Bute.
    The position of his seat at Clowance, in the centre of the greatest
 mining district of Cornwall, afforded facilities for acquiring the most
 choice productions of that great repository of mineralogical trea
 sures, and of these facilities he assiduously availed himself during
 many years. His other seat on the picturesque granitic pinnacle
of    St.Michael's Mount         inthe bay            of

to which he gave the name of Zoogene; and he also supposed that
he found the same substance in the thermal waters of Ischia, and in
waters produced by the condensation of the steam disengaged from
Vesuvius.     A similar mucous substance, in the thermal sulphureous
waters of Roussillon, was supposed by Professor Anglada, of Mont
pelier, to be a chemical product, from elements held in solution by
the waters at the time they issued from the earth, and deposited
by them in a flocculent form when they come in contact with the
air. De Saussure, however, Decandolle, Dillwyn, and Daubeny",
founding their opinions on the structure it exhibits under the micro
scope, refer this gelatinous substance to minute Confervae; but the
more recent discovery, by Ehrenberg, of infusorial animals in the
warm springs of Bohemia, gives some probability to the supposition
that these may be mixed with Confervae in the so-called zoogene
of Gimbernat.      The decomposition either of Confervae or of        In
fusoria would afford the azote found in zoogene; but their presence
would transfer the origin of this organic substance from simple che
mical agency to the instrumentality of organic life. On quitting
Naples, in 1820, he retired to Switzerland, where he fell into bad

1839t.
    FREDERick Mohs, Professor of Mineralogy in Vienna, was born
at Gernrode, in the Harz Mountains, about 1770.              He lost his
father, a merchant, very early, and was expected to succeed him in
the business; but his predilections for science, particularly for ma
thematics, had marked him out for higher destinies.
    He began his studies, 1796-98, at Halle, and continued them in
the mining institution at Freyberg.
   We find him in 1802 at Vienna, occupied in describing the mi
neral cabinet of the banker Von der Nüll, where he first conceived
those views which he afterwards developed in his system of mine
ralogy.
    #.    fondness for geology and the art of mining induced him to
visit Styria, Saltzburg, Carinthia, Carniola, Hungary and Transyl
vania, &c., and he received from the Austrian Government, in 1810,
a commission to examine those parts of Passau, Austria, and Bohe
mia, where porcelain clay is found.
    Having thus attracted the notice of the Archduke John, and un
dertaken a journey to Styria in 1811, he was nominated Professor
 of Mineralogy in the Johanneum, at Gratz.
    In 1818 he visited England with Count Bretiner, who had been
 his pupil at Gratz; his conferences at Edinburgh with Jameson,
whom he had known at Freyberg, made a strong impression on
the Professor, in favour of what he called the “ natural-history
system" of mineralogy, which he in part adopted, and first made

   known to British mineralogists in 1820°, and afterwards more fully
   explained in 1821+ and 1822f.
       On the death of Werner, in 1817, he was called to the chair of
   Mineralogy in the Mining Academy of Freyberg; but in 1826
   went to reside at Vienna, as Professor of Mineralogy, and Super
   intendent of the Imperial Cabinet.          In 1804 he published a volume
   of practical importance, containing “A Detailed Account, illus
  trated with a Ground Plan, of the Mines and Mining Operations
  at Himmelsfürst,       near Freyberg.”        In this work he describes, not
  only the geological relations and mineral products of these mines,
  but gives full details as to the methods of working them; their
  buildings and machinery, ventilation and drainages, preparation of
  the ores, receipts, expenditure, &c.
      His great work on Mineralogy, or “the Natural History of the
  Mineral Kingdom,” is best known in this country by                  translation,                   its

   Having been born at the University of Old Aberdeen, in which
his father was Theological Professor, he had early imbibed a thirst
for knowledge and for scientific pursuits; and at the age of sixteen
he entered the military service of the East India Company.       Ha
ving considerable abilities as a surveyor, and being desirous of
travelling, he soon got an appointment, and was sent to survey the
province of Malwa, where he prosecuted his instructions under a
burning sun, with great accuracy and constancy of purpose. He
procured at his own expense the most costly instruments, and un
dertook several surveys in the Himalaya Mountains, suffering every

540        Geological Society :—Anniversary Address.
Society of London, vol. i. p. 343. From the diary of this survey
Mr. Colebrooke selected notes of Geological observations; and
 from specimens then collected, duplicates were sent to our Society.
 Upon these notes, and on Captain Gerard's letters, written during
his survey in the middle valley of the Sutlej, a sketch of the Geo
logy of the Himalaya was prepared by Mr. Colebrooke and pub
lished in the Geological Transactions of London".
    The second volume of Sir W. Lloyd's recent narrative of a jour
ney in the Himalaya, contains an account of Captain Gerard's at
tempt to penetrate on the north side of the Himalaya by Bekhur,
to Garoo and the lake Manasarowara, near the source of the Sutlej.
These letters are interspersed with many interesting geological ob
servations respecting the mineral productions and nature of the rocks
of the country over which he travelled. He found the inclination of
the strata to be usually perpendicular to the direction of the range,
presenting long continuous slopes on the side towards which they
dip, and terminating abruptly in rugged precipices towards the axis
of the mountain chain. Near Bekhur, at the north side of the        Hi
malaya, on the margin of the great table land of Tartary, elevated
15,786 feet above the sea, he mentions the occurrence of gravel
studded with Ammonites, not far from the Hookeo Pass, which
presents mural precipices of limestone.
   In one excursion in the Himalaya he fell in with the late Bishop
Heber, who devotes a long and eloquent passage in his journal to
the expression of his praise and admiration of the scientific talent
and enterprising spirit of Captain Gerard. He was an excellent
Persian scholar, and acquainted with several other oriental lan
 guages.
   He performed many of his surveys under a burning sun, the
thermometer ranging from 100 to upwards of 112 degrees. As
many of his observations were required to be taken at mid-day, the
consequences were frequent suffering and illness from strokes of the
sun; but he continued his labours until his health totally failed.
He died at Aberdeen in December last, at the age of forty-seven,
having apparently sacrificed his life to the promotion of science,
stimulated in his labours by the wish to benefit mankind, without
the hope of worldly remuneration.
   To his late equally zealous and indefatigable brother, Dr. James
Gilbert Gerard, surgeon of the Hill corps stationed at Subathu,
and the companion of Captain, now Sir Alexander, Burnes, in his
perilous journey through Central Asia, we owe the discovery of
extensive collections of fossil shells in the Himalaya mountains, at
the height of 17,000 feet. The greater part of these closely re
semble shells that occur in the Oolite formation of Europe, particu
larly Ammonites and Belemnites; whilst a few, e.g. Orthoceratites
and Spirifers, are similar to shells we find in rocks of our Transition
Series.   The Rev. R. Everest has described and figured some of
these in the eighteenth volume of the Asiatic Researches.

  His third brother, Captain Patrick Gerard, is remarkable as the
author of a Meteorological Journal, kept in 1819–20 at Kotgerh,

and recording hourly observations during nearly two years”.
   Feb.   26.-A paper was first read, entitled “Further observations
on the fossil trees found on the Manchester and Bolton railway;”
by John Hawkshaw, Esq., F.G.S.
    Since Mr. Hawkshaw's former communicationt, another fossil
tree has been found on the opposite side of the railway. It is about
three feet in height, and three feet in circumference, and stands on
the same thin stratum of coal as those first discovered, and perpen
dicularly to the surface of the bed. Mr. Hawkshaw                        therefore,            is,
strengthened          his belief,
                         in        that the trees    grew        the   positionin                               in
which they are found.

 might hereafter present a seam of coal, which would afford but few
 distinct traces of palms and forest trees. These phaenomena, he says,
 may explain in part, why so few distinct forms remain of the num
 berless forest trees, which must have formed a portion of the vege
 table kingdom, at the time of the accumulation of our coal deposits.
    Mr. Hawkshaw does not attempt to explain the process by which
 dicotyledonous trees are rendered hollow in tropical forests. He
 expresses doubts respecting the probable nature of the Calamites
 of the coal measures, and offers no explanation of the means by
 which they have been preserved in so great abundance.         If the coal
 be considered as the debris of a forest, he says, it is difficult to ac
count for not finding more trunks of trees than have been discovered
in our coal basins; and he observes, it is only perhaps by allowing
the original of our coal seams to have been a combination of vege
table matter, analogous to peat, that the difficulty can be solved.
In this case, he is of opinion, but a few isolated trees might be ex
pected to be found, and that the remains of vegetable forms most
frequently discovered, would only be confirmative of the antiseptic
qualities of their original nature, as previously advanced by Professor
Lindley, and not of the number or importance of their particular
genera at the time of their deposit.
   In conclusion, Mr. Hawkshaw says, that whatever opinion may
be drawn from what is conjectural in his paper, it will be obvious,
that though fossil remains may be found filled with a mechanical
deposit, and containing traces of other vegetables, yet that this con
dition does not prove, that the plants were originally hollow, nor
even render it the most likely hypothesis, as they may have been
hard wood-trees, the centre of which had been removed by natural
processes.

                        BLUE OXIDE OF TITANIUM.
         KERSTEN has shown that oxide of titanium may be pre
       • pared containing less oxygen than titanic acid, and that this
blue substance, which has hitherto been prepared only in the moist
way, may be obtained in the dry way, and in several modes:
   1st. By passing the vapour of zinc over titanic acid heated to
whiteness; the acid then assumes a dirty blue colour, but loses       it,
and becomes again white when exposed        to  oxygen     at

                                                                 oxide
of zinc mixed with charcoal, and then covering the whole with        ti
tanic acid   or titaniferous earthy silicate, and heating the crucible
                  a
for several hours to whiteness. Fused masses of        a lavender blue
colour are thus obtained; they are opake, and contain blue oxide
of titanium and oxide of zinc.

 less, become more or less blue.

 manner with metallic tin. A slight addition of charcoal in powder
 appears to favour the formation of blue glass.
     5thly. M. Kersten found that titanic acid might, under certain
 circumstances, be reduced, by means of hydrogen, to the state of
 blue oxide of a very fine colour.               If into biphosphate of soda, kept
 in fusion in a    porcelain    crucible,   fine titanic acid be projected, it dis
 solves   readily   at a low   temperature,       and a white, transparent saline
 mass is formed. If this mass be            put    into a bulb of difficultly fusible
 glass, and hydrogen gas which has been dried by chloride of calcium

cipitate, after washing with cold water, is to be dissolved in boiling
alcohol; the solution is to be filtered and allowed to cool. In this
operation the greater part of the chelidonia crystallizes, and by eva
poration more is obtained.       The crystals are to be washed with
alcohol to separate extractive. The mother-water and the washings
are to be evaporated by a gentle heat, and then the pirropina cry
stallizes with a little chelidonia; these crystals are in yellow la
minae, and a portion is deposited on the sides of the vessel in
blackish discs.
   The properties of chelidonia are, that it crystallizes partly in
transparent tables and partly in cubes, and varieties.        In the state
of crystals it dissolves with difficulty in hot alcohol and in aether;
it crystallizes on their cooling. The concentrated acids, even when
heated, act slowly on this substance; nitric acid gives it a yellow
colour, and sulphuric acid blackens         The diluted acids form co
