               Sidney Young recently had the kindness to place
   DR. at our disposal an            interesting series of compounds for
   optical examination.          They were the halogen substitution-
  compounds of benzene described by him (Journ. Chem. Soc.
   1889) ; substances that had been prepared with great care,
  and which were redistilled before they were handed to us.
       The following were the determinations of the principal
   lines of the solar spectrum : —

    Before dealing with these observations, it may be well to
compare them with figures obtained from totally different
specimens of bromobenzene and iodobenzene, which have not
yet been published. The observations on bromobenzene were
part of a series made some years ago with a view of testing
the law that the specific refractive energy of a liquid is very
little, if at all, altered by changes of temperature. The
method adopted was that of determining the refractive index
and density of the same specimen on a cold winter's day and
on summer days, the liquid being carefully preserved in a
well-stoppered bottle between the observations. The iodo
benzene was a specimen prepared by Dr. Perkin.

   These figures are almost identical with those determined
from Dr. Young's spocimens.             They not only increase our
confidence    in the accuracy      of  the data, but the experiment
with bromobenzene shows that we may practically disregard
the question of temperature.
   Adopting the data in the first two tables, we can estimate
the molecular refraction of each halogen in combination by
deducting the value for C6HS.            This has been arrived at by
taking the average refraction of several good specimens of
benzene for the six lines, and by subtracting from them the
assumed value for hydrogen.

Deducting these figures from the values given in the second

   So far as the well-known halogens chlorine, bromine, and
iodine are concerned, these figures are principally interesting
as compared with the values already determined for them in
other organic compounds.      From their combinations with the
compound     radicals (CH2l(+i), the numbers given in the first
division of the following table have been deduced ; but from
some other OTganic compounds, such as chloroform and its
congeners, olefine compounds, &c, somewhat higher numbers
have been obtained, as in the second division of the table*.
The third division gives the figures ol tained from the benzene
compounds. In each case merely the molecular refraction
for the line A is given, with the molecular dispersion, that                                       is,
the difference between RH and RA.

the benzene substitution-products are analogous to their values
in the olefine compounds rather than the others. This more                             is
significant in the dispersion thau in the refraction.
   But  a  greater interest attaches to the optical properties of
fluorine. No organic compound containing this element had
hitherto been examined, while      was known that the refrac

A   glance at the sixth Table will show that in the benzene
compounds also the effect of fluorine upon the light transmitted
is very little.  But there      another peculiarity.
                                            is          Whereas
the values of chlorine, bromine, and iodine increase from A
to H, those of fluorine regularly decrease     so that, in fact,       ;
while the refraction-equivalent for A     only 0"63, the disper

atomic refraction of fluorine at 0*92 for the line A, and 0*84
for the line H, showing again a minus dispersion.
    No minus dispersion-equivalent of the kind has hitherto
been met with, unless it be in some of the thin metallic prisms
examined by Kundt,and more recently by du Bois and Rubens.
It  is true that in iodine vapour, as in fuchsin and a few other
substances, the irrationality of the spectrum is so great that
the order of certain parts is actually reversed, but there is not
the regular progressive reversion exhibited in the case of
fluorine.
    The refraction-equivalent of fluorine had been already
determined by Mr. George Gladstone at from 0 29 to 032
from observations on metallic fluorides, and at from 0"59 to
0*84 from observations on fluosilicates.           It became of interest
to see whether the same fluorides would indicate this reversed
dispersion.
    Fluor-spar. — Among the many determinations that have
been made of the refraction of fluor-spar there are three which
 will answer our purpose, as they give the index of several
 lines.    Not one of them gives the density of the particular
 specimen ; but we shall not be far wrong in taking 3*18 as
 the specific gravity.
    Bailie (Annates du Conservatoire, vii. 1867) gives the
 refractive indices for the lithium-line, C, D, F, and a blue
 copper-line.      From these we may calculate the molecular
 refraction ; and from the number so obtained, by subtracting
the values for calcium, we get the presumed values for two
atoms of fluorine for different parts of the spectrum.

   Sarasin (Ar. Geneve, x. 1883) gives the refractive indices
of fluor-spar from the line A to very far into the ultra-violet.
In the figures so given there seems to be no break, but a
regular progression quite comparable with that of quartz. It
is only possible for us to calculate the amount due to fluorine
up to the line H.

   All   these different calculations from the indices given by
different observers show not only the small atomic refraction
for fluorine, but also a regular decrease on proceeding from
the less refrangible to the more refrangible portion of the
spectrum.

   Hydrofluoric Acid. — Notwithstanding the difficulty of work
ing with hydrofluoric acid, we succeeded in obtaining a de
termination for the line D in an aqueous solution of this
substance. The strength was 23*2 per cent. ; the specific gravity
 was 1-101 ; the refractive index was 1"3155 ; the molecular
refraction for D was therefore 2-64.         Deducting 1'31 for the
hydrogen, we obtain RD=l-33 for the fluorine.                 This is a
somewhat larger figure than what is given by other com
pounds ; but that is only in accordance with what occurs in
the case of the other halogen acids, which always give figures
in excess of theory. The length of the spectrum was evidently
very small, but no trustworthy measurements were made.
   Hydrofluosilicic Acid. — Different preparations of this acid in
 aqueous solution gave rather discordant results.         But the two
 most trustworthy gave the following :      —

one are given below, and from these are deducted the values

This gives Ec for fluorine = 0*88, and, again, a scarcely
appreciable negative dispersion.
    As the six metallic fluosilicates are all doubly refractive,
and we do not know how to deal with that phenomenon, we
have not endeavoured to make any precise calculation, espe
cially as the dispersion of the metallic element in each case
has not yet been determined.              Mr. George Gladstone has
already shown that they give a probable refraction-equivalent
for fluorine varying from 0-62 to 0*84; and it is quite evident
that the dispersion is excessively small, even if it be not a
negative quantity.
    These results all tell the same tale as fluorbenzene in regard
to the optical properties of fluorine.         It is true the figures do
not appear very accordant ; but it must be remembered that
all the errors of experiment as well as those arising from
impurity of substance fall upon these residual numbers, and
where the numbers are so very small discrepancies appear
important which would otherwise scarcely be noticed. The
values taken for the atomic refraction and dispersion of silicon
and the metals must be looked upon as merely approximate ;
but, whatever rectifications may be made in them hereafter,
it is hardly possible that they should affect our general con
clusions, viz. that the atomic refraction of fluorine. in combi
nation is extremely small, in fact less than 1*0, and that it is
smaller for the violet than for the red end of the spectrum.
    II.   The Chemical Equilibrium of Solids, in its Relation          to
         Pressure and to Temperature.          By Carl Barus*.
 1.    TN   a recent number     of the  '
                                          American Journal,' t com- I
     -L     municated certain data on the effect of dilatational
strain on the electric resistance of glass.          These experiments,
 though decisive as to results, were somewhat complex in cha
 racter ; and from their important bearing on the chemical
 equilibrium of solids,     I resolved to attack the subject from a
 new point of view.        The present work is direct, and        I  hoped
 that results could thus be reached without necessitating auxi
 liary hypotheses or experiments. In this expectation 1 de
 ceived myself : the insulating oil, which transmits pressure to
 glass, shows a pressure-coefficient usually much larger than
 the glass itself.     Both must therefore be studied.         Neverthe
 less,  the confirmation    of  my   earlier  results  which  the  present
                  *  Communicated   by the Author.
                  t Amer. Journ. xxxvii.   pp. 339 to 361 (1889).

  10                      Mr. Carl Barns on     the
  paper gives, is gratifying.        I  am thus able to carry the de
  ductions one step further.          Again, the behaviour of liquid
  hydrocarbon insulators under pressure presents many points
  of special interest in relation to the formation and occurrence
  of ions.
                                                           I
     As a result of the investigation of different oils, have been
  able to increase the efficiency of my screw-compressor* in
  marked degree.         By using a sticky mineral machine-oil,
 thick enough to be almost opaquely fluorescent t, not only
  does the screw of my apparatus run more easily, but leaks at
 high pressure are practically absent.          Moreover, the gasket
  of marine glue is not in any measure dissolved (this is the
 case with sperm-oil), and it therefore lasts indefinitely.
  Finally, the insulation of barrel and piezometer is now at
 least as high as 10,000 megohms, and need not be less than
  1000 megohms.        This is an important requisite in experi
 ments like the present.
     The special work on the effect of pressure on the electro
 motive force of the cell NaHg/glass/Hg has intrinsic interest
 apart from its subsidiary purpose as embodied in the present
 text. From experiments to be published in a Bulletin of the
 U.S. Geological Survey, 1 infer that the secret of the relation
 of tho Peltier contact to the Volta contact will probably mani
 fest itself, if a suitable cell, suitably compressed, be carried
 through a largo range of temperature, quite into rod heat.
    I  gain another inference by comparing the present results
with the data of my last paper f, on the effect of pressure on
the thermal relations of metallic and electrolytic conductivity.
    Finally, the present work is tributary to an extended series
of experiments on the relation of melting-point and pressure,
as will appear in § 6.       Thus it forms an essential part of the
work suggested by Mr. Clarence King.
                              Apparatus.
    2.  Hydrostatic pressures as high as 1500 atmospheres were
applied. Having found that within the limits of the present
paper nothing essentially novel was gained by excessively
high values of pressure,      I   facilitated my work by avoiding
them as much as possible.
    3. To obtain different constant          temperatures,   the tubes
were exposed    successively   to  vapours issuing from water (100°),
turpentine (160°), naphthalene (215°), and diphonylamine
(3 10°). A serviceable continuous vapour-bath for this purpose

ends of the brazed copper bath are provided with screw stuffing-
boxes of the ordinary kind, in which either asbestos packing
or a hollow cylinder of cork may be forced home by the gland.
Vapour-baths must be removed hot.                They then slide off the
smooth steel piezometer easily, and without jarring the
tube.
    4. In the compressor, the arrangement adopted is that of
insulating the piezometer-tube from the barrel- and com
pression-appurtenances.            Inasmuch as in some of the experi
 ments the resistances to be measured                amount to several
hundred megohms, the piezometer-insulation must be perfect
to at least several thousand megohms.              How this was gradu
ally accomplished will be explained in §§ 10 et seq. Gutta-
percha-covered wire and raised hard-rubber commutators are
essential.     Care must be taken to insulate the water-jackets
which cool the ends of the piezometer, and to allow the efflux
water to drop into a cistern discontinuously.                  The burners
which heat the vapour-bath must be insulated to prevent con
duction through the flame, &c. At high temperatures, where
the resistance of the glass will have decreased several hundred
to one, many of these precautions are superfluous.                They are
always necessary        when    oils are examined.

    5. The original apparatus for measuring the resistance of
 compressed glass is shown in figures 1 and 2, of which the
 latter is a diagram.         Fig. 1 consists essentially of two coaxial
 glass tubes, the larger completely surrounding the smaller.
 The diameter of the larger (thick-walled) tube is "4 to "5
 centim. ; that of the inner (thin-walled) tube is "2 centim.
 They are joined along the ring a a.             Two separate compart
 ments are thus formed, the inner of which is filled with pure
  mercury, and the outer with sodium amalgam, to a sufficient
 length to completely envelop the inner tube.                   The end of
  the large tube contains hydrocarbon oil, both to protect the
  amalgam against moisture or air, when the tube is not in place,

eliminate condensable air, when the tube is in place.       Mer
cury and the fluid amalgam are to be introduced by aid of
the air-pump, care being taken to boil out all traces of air.
The mercury of the inner compartment is in galvanic con
nexion with the platinum wire       which in its turn connects
                                            />,
with the piezometer-tube.     Hence    need not be insulated.

   Under the influence of hydrostatic pressure, the figure of
the glass tube     issymmetrically reduced in size.       Hence, with
regard   to the  conduction    hiking place    across the walls of the
inner tube, the resistance would be increased, in consequence
of changes of dimensions, only               by

essential to connect c c with the piezometer and to insulate
b b ; for by thus reversing the tube there is no tendency of
short-circuiting through oil and the outer tube.               Indeed, so
important      is this adjustment    that  I further modified the tube,
fig. 1, in the way indicated in fig. 3.

    Here the inner compartment is filled with mercury to only
about 7 centim. of the end.              The remainder of the tube,
containing hydrocarbon oil, runs completely through the
piezometer into the barrel, with which the insulated platinum
terminal connects.          To keep the mercury in place, the inner
tube is drawn down to a smaller diameter (see i, fig. 3) , into
which the mercury meniscus projects.               Air is excluded by
boiling the mercury with the platinum wire in place.                  The
latter amalgamates externally,           but  careful handling is none
the less advisable.        The outer tube, with its filling of sodium
amalgam, not only envelops the inner mercury-thread, but
extends in both directions as far as the cold parts of the sur
 rounding piezometer-tube.            Since c c connects with this, no
 current will pass through the film of hot oil and the outer
 glass tube.      All currents between piezometer and barrel must
therefore pass through the walls of the inner glass tube —a
condition which is further insured by making NaHg/glass/Hg
the acting electromotive force.           I  have purposely described
 these precautions at length ; and their importance is obvious
 when it is remembered that the oil medium has a larger
 pressure-coefficient than glass, and that the insulation of oil
 sometimes breaks down in marked degree with rise of tem
 perature (§ 19). The effect of cold oil can be found pre
 liminarily, when the whole apparatus is cold.
    6 b.  I have finally to show the apparatus for testing the
 resistance and pressure-coefficient of the liquid insulators
 at different temperatures.         This is given in fig. 4 (diagram),
and consists essentially of a cylindrical steel rod s s, adjusted

14                        Mr. Carl Barns on     the
coaxially     with the steel piezometer P P, containing the oil
to bo tested.       Tubes of glass, g g, hold the rod s s in position.
Owing      to the  fact that above 200° glass conducts better than
most hydrocarbon oils, this insulating arrangement is not quite
   Fig. 4. — Arrangement   for measuring the Pressure Increments of the

satisfactory ; but by using thin-walled glass tubes filled with
the oil, the data so obtained ure sufficient for the purposes of the
 present text, since the rate of breakdown with temperature is
accentuated.      It is seen that the measuring-current passes from
 the piezometer P P, through the cylindrical layer of oil, into
 the rod s s, and thence to the battery.         The diameters of steel
 core and piezometer-tube being *13 and '63 centim. respec
 tively, and the exposed part 9 centim. long, the specific
 resistance of the layer of oil is easily computed (§ 19).
    6 c. Digression. — By filling the greater part of the closed
 end of the inner tube (fig. 1 or 2) with the substance to be
 examined, and the open end as far as e with mercury, the tube
 is available for the sttidy of melting-point and pressure.             In
 such a case the forward motion of the inner mercury meniscus
 due to pressure proportionately decreases the resistance of the
 arrangement by increasing the opposed surfaces of mercury
 and sodium amalgam.              Increased delicacy is secured by
 enlarging the bulb at the end of the inner tube.                  At the
 solidifying-point the sample usually undergoes a phenomenal
 reduction of volume, corresponding, therefore, to a similarly
 large reduction of resistance.         This occurrence     I  propose to
 use as the criterion of solidifying-point and of melting-point.
 The apparatus is available above 100° under any pressure up
 to several thousand atmospheres.
    The criterion specified is also available when a fine platinum
 wire is stretched through contiguous coaxial columns of the
 substance and of mercury in a vertical piezometer.
    7. Besistances were first measured by a bridge method ;
 but owing to the fact that electromotive forces are involved
 which may themselves vary with pressure,             I lost faith in the

                  Chemical   Equilibrium of Solids.                15
safety of these methods and replaced them by simple circuit
methods.     The errors to be guarded against are primarily in
the experiment itself.      Again, the resistance-tube (figs. 1-3)
is well adapted for simple circuit-work, since the electro
motive force NaHg/glass/Hg may exceed a volt, and the
only pronounced resistance is in the cell. Only at 100° need
auxiliary cells be inserted.
    Throughout the work the low-pressure or fiducial resistance
is measured before and after the high-pressure resistance.
This safeguard is necessary.       From three to five minutes were
allowed for the elimination of thermal discrepancies. The
 fiducial resistance is to be measured under a pressure of 100
 to 200 atmospheres, both to condense the air retained in the
 pump and to make the oil less compressible (§ 32). Not much
 care was taken in measuring the absolute resistances, since
 the inferences of this paper are to be drawn from the in
 crements.
    8. In the high-resistance experiments       I  used the Elliott
 square pattern of Thomson's high-resistance astatic galvano
 meter.    The readings, however, were made by PoggendorfFs
 method of telescope and scale.       To adapt Thomson s concave-
 mirror adjustment for this purpose, I compensated the cur
 vature by an ordinary " No. 36
                                    '
                                       concave spectacle-glass fixed

                       slightly under-compensatus       the   mirror,
 leaving some magnification which is not undesirable. In
 how far a weak telescope may be made to do the service of a
 more powerful instrument, in virtue of the concave mirror and
 a lens even weaker than No. 36, remains to be seen.           With
 the above adjustment of lens and mirror, using a telescope
 magnifying somewhat over 20 diameters, and a scale some
 what further than 2 metres from the mirror,         I  obtained an
 image about 4-5 centim. long and sufficiently distinct for all
 practical purposes.      Thus, if one volt act in one million
 megohms,     the current produced would only just escape
 detection.
    At 200° the galvanometer was suitably shunted.
    9. Regarding other manipulations, the paper cited in § 2
 will have to be consulted.      Electromotive forces were mea
 sured by a zero method.

 six independent series of experiments, made at different times
 and often with different tubes.         The adjustment, however, was
 in the main that of fig. 2, reversed.

        11. A graphic construction shows the character of these
    divers series to be identical, though the individual pressure-
    coefficients show marked variation.                       The data of tbe third
    series are made in connexion with the following data of
    Table II., in which electromotive forces are measured before
    and afier the resistance measurements.                            As a rule, the
    galvanometer-needle            does   not    reach   its  position of equilibrium
    at once ; the slow changes registered are probably due to
    gradually vanishing thermal discrepancies (§ 37).
        12. Table II. gives results for the effect of pressure on
    the electromotive torce NaHg/glass/Hg.                        Here 8 is the tem
    perature    of   the    vapour-bath,       and    e the   observed electromotive
    force, in volts, corresponding to the pressure Sp, when the
    initial pressure is above 50 atmospheres (§ 10). ke = 8e/e . Sp
    is the pressure-coefficient.               Five minutes were allowed per
    observation.          Special experiments showed that e decreases on
    cooling.       The medium for transmitting pressure is again
    ordinary animal sperm-oil. Earlier observations were dis
    carded, and results are condensed as far as possible.

         To facilitate measurement, the greater number of
       13.
 experiments are made at 215°.       Polarization was observed ;
 and for this reason the measurement of temperature-coefficients
 by removing and readjusting vapour-baths was not tried. The
 increment of electromotive force is largest immediately after
 compression (temporary effect), and then decreases to the
 apparently constant values of the Table. The converse holds
 for the decrement on removing pressure.        At 100° no satis
 factory results could be obtained (§ 34). At 310°, although
 the temporary effects were distinct, the permanent effects are
 not warranted.

                     contains results, given on a plan identical
 with that of Table                  I.,

    The pressure-coefficient of sperm-oil      therefore decidedly  is
 larger, and the specific resistance of this oil    usually smaller,      is
 than that of glass (of.   19, Tables IX. §  X.) but the break    &        ;
 down of resistance with rise of temperature          more marked              is

      The resistance of gasolene is therefore enormous as com
  pared with sperm-oil, and above 100° more than 100 times-
  that of glass.         Moreover the breakdown of the gasolene
  insulation with temperature is remarkably slow ; but owing
  to the difficulty of keeping the apparatus free from leaks
  in the case of this very thin oil,       I  did not make experiments
  with the glass tube.
      A feature of these results is the negative pressure-coeffi
  cients found, which themselves decrease algebraically nearly
  proportionally to the temperature of the oil. At a given tem
  perature the resistance is not constant, but decreases; and
  since the gasolene is discoloured when removed from the
  press, the decrease of resistance is undoubtedly a solution-
  phenomenon.          Indeed, I  suspect tly.it negative coefficients are
  possibly to be associated with solution (§ 39).

     The specific resistance of petroleum is not so high as that
 of gasolene, though it is more than 20 times that of glass at
 215°, and the insulation breaks down less rapidly.                                   The
 pressure-coefficients          decrease    in    marked        degree     with   rise   of
 temperature, and nearly proportionally to it. and they actually
 pass from positive to negative values.                     The}' are of a larger

order of numerical magnitude than the glass-coefficients.                          At
310°, where the petroleum-coefficient is negative and the glass-
coefficient, according to Tables I. and III., positive, a crite
rion of the effect of the oil is obtainable.                   The glass tube \
does not stand this test fully, since the pressure-coefficients                     of
oil and glass in series IX. are both negative, though the effect
of the glass is a decided algebraic increase of the oil-coeffi
cient.         Moreover, as the trustworthiness of a tube like fig. 1
reversed is no longer vouched for,                   I  made the remaining ex
periments with the tube figure 3.                   I  also tested a better insu
lating oil.
     17. Tables VI. and VII. contain data for the insulation
and resistance of thin mineral machine-oil (" mineral sperm "),
and also for glass surrounded by it.                    At 215° the resistance
of the liquid is more than 50 times that of glass, and the
 breakdown in the former case much less rapid. Two glass
tubes of the form fig. 3 were used consecutively.                             In the
 first of these the internal and external diameters of the inner
 tube were '24 and "34 centim. respectively ; in the other the
dimensions of the inner tube were those given in § 5.

                          Another tube of higher resistance.
     Repetitions of this work led to virtually the same uniformity
 of result, as is well evidenced by the close coincidence of the
 data for 215°.          The coefficients of the two tubes, however,
 are not identical.         A feature of Table VI. is the change of
 sign     of  the  pressure-coefficient,   when the cil has become con
 taminated.         It is in these experiments (Table VI.) that               I
 specially observed the apparent accommodation detailed in
 § 37.        As a whole the data are in reasonable conformity with
 Table I.
     18. My final experiments were made with a very sticky
 mineral machine-oil (cf. § 1). Two tubes of the form fig. 8,
 but of different resistances, were used (§ 17).
     At 310° the oil-coefficients are negative, whereas the glass-
 coefficients remain distinctly positive.                This seems to be a
 conclusive test, since an effect of the glass in changing the
 sign, or in any way increasing the oil-coefficients is incon
 ceivable.        The increase of the latter with pressure at 215°
 (cf.   Table    VIII.) is probably an actual occurrence. The two
 tubes again differ in their properties.

    20. It appears from Table I. et seq., that the pressure-
coefficient does not decrease with the size of the pressure inter
val Bp. The tendency is rather in favour of an increase, but this
is obscure.        Hence the results obtained are properties of
either the oil or of the glass, and not incidental disturbances.
               I
Moreover, am warranted in taking the means of the divers
pressure-coefficients      found at any temperature as the probable
value at that temperature.
    21. Remarks on the discrimination of temporary and per
manent effects have been made, §§11, 13.
    22. In order to obtain a clear insight into the data of
Tables I. to      VIII.,  it is best to construct pressure-coefficient
as a function of temperature.              It would be more in keeping
with the present work to coordinate this coefficient with re
sistance ; but the latter data are not sufficiently accurate.                  In
fig.  5  the  number    of  the   series  is marked     on  the  curve.
   23. Turning attention first to the behaviour of the solid
insulator, it appears that the electrical resistance of glass in
creases in very marked degree with the pressure which is
brought to bear on it. In my earlier paper*, in which                           I
subjected glass to tensile stress (presumably dilatational),                    I
found that the resistance had pronouncedly decreased.                     I  also
found that the results at 360° were not as evident as at 100°.
Hence the present and the earlier observations, though
attacking the question from opposite points of view, are in
accord.      I  am thus justified in announcing that the chemical
equilibrium of a solid changes with each change of strain (§ 30).
   24. The tables further show that the pressure-coefficient of
resistance decreases with rise of temperature ; or that the
effect of pressure decreases algebraically as the number of free
ions available for the transfer of charges becomes greater.

26                           Mr. Carl Barus     on the
electrolyte like zinc sulphate in water, or of a liquid metal
like mercury, is a decrease of specific resistance.               Finally,
the present results for insulating-oils contain several examples
in which a passage of the positive into the negative pressure-
coefficient is directly observed.           I conclude that the curve for
glass, if prolonged, will eventually intersect the axis of tem
 perature somewhere in the region of low red heat, and that the
 further course will be negative. Hence for all substances,
solid or liquid, there is a point or state of electrolytic dissocia
tion at which the effect of pressure on resistance is nil ; or at
 which the increased molecular stability obtained by pushing
 the molecules nearer together, and, perhaps, of binding the
constituents of the individual molecule more firmly together,
 counterbalances the decrease of the path over which the ion
travels in conveying charge. Taking all the results for glass,
 oils, the solution and the metal into account, it appears that the
 complete functionality will be given by a curve which is
 asymptotic both to the vertical in the region of low tempera
tures and positive pressure-coefficients,           and to the horizontal
 in the region of relatively high temperatures and negative
 pressure-coefficients.         The nature of this curve I have not
 been able to work out (§ 22), nor will it be the same for all
 substancgp.
      25. Iiaving thus found a consistent behaviour in metals and
 electrolytes in relation to strain, I am prepared to accept the
 proposition italicized in § 23 as true for solids* generally.
  For the case of metals Osmond t has partially anticipated me,
 stating that strain more or less completely converts cold
 metals from one definite molecular condition into another.                I
 have been unable to find, however, that Osmond has any
 direct evidence to support this assertion, and             I have already
  pointed      outj  some of the difficulties which Osmond must sur
  mount before his view can gain general credence.                  If  me
  chanical stress is to convert a-iron into /9-iron, it is not to be
  overlooked that whereas the hardness called temper changes
  the electrical resistance of steel enormously (as much as 300
  to 400 per cent.), the electrical effect of mechanical strain is
  relatively negligible.        Even though much of this discrepancy
      * To my knowledge the only experiments on the effect of pressure on
  the resistance of solid metals are due to Chwolson (Carl's Repertorium,
  xiv. p. 26, 1878), who shows that their pressure-coefficient, like that of
  mercury, is negative.

can be explained away, direct experiments on metals confirm
ing Osmond's view will not be easily forthcoming.                         Two
years ago       I spent much time in endeavouring to throw light
on the polymerization of metals, by studying the hydroelectrics
of stretched and soft wires*, by dissolving hard-drawn and
annealed iron, by investigating the carburation changes of
strained steel ; but in no case have              I found evidence of an
indisputable bearing on the point at issue.             Finally, regarding
the mere statement f of inferences of the above kind, 1 believe
I    anticipated Osmond by interpreting viscosity in solids t
 with reference to Clausius's theory of electrolysis.
     2u. The proposition of § 23, taken in connexion with my
observation of the occurrence of volume-lag f under isother
mal conditions, suggests important inferences on the behaviour
of stressed solids generally, and leads naturally to an explana
tion of hysteresis.        If  the pressure under which a liquid just
solidifies, cat. par., is in excess of the (positive or negative)
external pressure at which it again liquifies (volume-lag §),
and if the chemical equilibrium of the solid acted on changes
 with each change of strain, then, quite apart from considera
tions directly involving the second law of thermodynamics,
quite apart from the energy dissipated in the cycle, the solid

    § A good example of the volume-lag is given by an undercooled liquid
like fused thymol (melting at 5S'5), for instance, which at, say, 30° solidifies
 under about 500 atm., and does not again liquefy on removing the ex
ternal pressure. I have worked with para-toluidine, naphthalene, a-naphtol,
 paraffin, and caprinic, palmitic, and monochloracetic acids. My original
 belief in the general character of these static phenomena has recently
 been disturbed by new experiments, in which 1 found for the special case
 of paraffin that it would be possible to be misled by local sohditieations
 of the column under pressure.      The volume-lag is always marked when
 there is even a suggestion of undercooling.         The action of pressure is
 then similar to the closing of a door and opening it again without lifting
 the latch.     Observations made at intervals of 20 minutes each, with
 palmitic acid, showed that at 66° this substance solidifies between 300
 and 400 atm., and then remains solid even between 200 and 300 atm.
 At 100°, «-naphtol solidifies at 600 to 600 atm., and when pressure is
 being removed it remains solid until about 160 atm.               Undercooled
 caprinic acid at 20° solidifies under 150 atm., remaining solid.       At 33°
 it solidifies at about 500 atm., and then fuses again at about 200 atm.
  Local solidifications here suggest the occurrence of isomers or other
 impurity.      Sometimes, as in the case of naphthalene, the volume-lag
  is not thoroughly static, but becomes viscous in character, &c.        1 have
  yet to study the effect of temperature on the magnitude of the volume-
  lag, i.e. on the difference of pressures isothermally       corresponding to
  solidification and to fusion.   Very large pressure-intervals are essential
  for this purpose.

                             Mr. Carl Barus on     the
at identical stress-points needs not be in the same chemical
condition while stress is being removed, in which it was when
stress was being applied ; for there will be certain groups of
particles, uniformly distributed throughout the solid, which
                "             "
during the stress on             phase pass from a first molecular con
dition to second, and which, in virtue of the volume-lag, do not
regain their original state at identical pressures of the stress
                                                                       "
off" phase. The march in the two cases is not a symmetrical
one.     This   I  take to be the inherent nature of the phenomena
studied by Cohn*, Warburg t, and others, and to which
E wing J, after much original research, has given the generic
name nysteresis.           In my note      I  pointed out the important
bearing of the volume-lag on the molecular behaviour of
matter§, though          I  have yet to specify my views in detail.
The occurrence of hysteresis, therefore, implies a favourable
molecular mechanism of the kind indicated, and one would not
expect to find it at once in all substances.
    Conformably with the above, the interpretation given by
Mr. C. A. Carus-Wilson || of his important discovery (to
which     I  alluded in a former paper), is much more than an
analogy.
    27.  Warburg and Ewing have proved that hysteresis is not
only    associated     with mechanical stress, but may be very
clearly evoked by magnetic stress.                Curiously enough, the
evidence in favour of the views expressed in § 26 is here
directly forthcoming.           Remsen'slf discovery of the chemical
influence of the magnetic field, additionally substantiated as
it now is by the ingenious experiments of Rowland and Bell **,
proves beyond a doubt that magnetic iron is more electro
negative than unmagnetic iron.              Conformably with the above
paragraphs,       I  therefore   infer  that  this phenomenon is to be
interpreted      as   directly evidencing a chemical difference be
tween magnetic and unmagnetic iron, and as such                    I consider
it an exceedingly important step towards an ion theory of mag
netism ft-       Thus the occurrence of the chemical difference in

   tt In ' Nature ' (xli. p. 370, 1890) I pointed out that closed helical paths
of molecular dimensions, each consisting of a right- and a left-hand screw-
thread, with their ends joined, can be generated by the symmetrical
interpenetration of two congruent Bravais nets.      I  inferred that electrical
charges urged along and around the said closed helical paths by the action

question, and the explanation of magnetic hyteresis, as given
in the present        and preceding paragraphs, mutually sustaiu
each other.
     28. Whether viscosity and dissociation in solids are to be
explained with reference to a single mechanism, or whether
we are to conceive of two mechanisms (molecular and atomic
frameworks), one, as it were, within the other, is at the present
stage of research a mere question of special convenience.                The
remarkably low viscosity at the yield-points of metals, as well
as the similarly low viscosity near the Gore-Barrett                    phe
nomena, are both in conformity with the sudden passage from
a first molecular state to a second, through an instability.
     29. It follows from Tables I. to VIII., that in an asolotro-
pically strained transparent solid like glass, electric conduction
is different in different directions, the difference depending
on the intensity of strain.             Suppose this be considered in
connexion with the doubly refracting property of such a
solid, and again with Warburg and Tegetmeier's* researches on
the electric conduction of quartz along its optic axis, with
non-conduction at right angles to it. Then the inference is
tenable, that the strain artificially sustained in one case is
naturally sustained in the other.              Tegetmeier's conducting
sodic silicate, ingrained in the crystalline structure of quartz,
and possessing larger molecular conductivity in quartz than
of the magnetic field, could be made to replace the usual conception of
molecular currents circulating in a molecule without resistance. From
this point of view magnetic and electric fields merely differ in the'
rotational character of the former as compared with the non-rotational
character of the latter.      Whereas in an electrolyte the ion-dissociation
 takes place as the result of chemical relations and heat, it takes place in
a metal under the mere influence of heat. The immediate action of both
 fields is directional ; and by taking advantage of the positions of labile
equilibrium of the ion, they act in a way analogous to Clerk-Maxwell's
demons (' Heat,' chap. xxii. § 10), producing marked effects at the ex
penditure of a relatively small amount of work.
    The advantage which 1 seek for in this tentative suggestion has direct
 reference to my own line of work.         I can picture to myself the role
played by the foreign ingredient chemically present in iron, in modifying
 the retentiveness and the magnetic stability of the metal.       Thus I con
 ceive the carbon atoms in hard steel to be so placed that after mag
netization they block out definite closed helical paths in the metal, along
 which the transfer of charges must thereafter take place. Hence an
 increase of magnetic stability as contrasted with pure iron, where from
 any point four or more such paths may be open.       Again, other substances
  (manganese, say) may be conceived to unite with the iron in such a way
 as to shut out the possibility of closed helical paths altogether.  The fact
 that my permanent magnet is essentially a self-exhausting engine does not
 seem to be a serious objection.

cuss some of the errors relating to both the measurements of
resistance and electromotive force.
   The effect of pressure on the polarization occurring in case
of the above cell and of exceedingly weak currents is some
what difficult to handle. Warburg’ and others have shown
that the reaction is essentially Na/glass/Hg changing to
Na/Na2SiOs glass/Na Hg, or a mere transfer of sodium through
the walls of the glass, by aid of sodium silicate as a con
veyancer.            I
                shall therefore have to rely on the data of
Table II., in which,  if a marked effect of pressure on polariza

be remembered that                  I

(po-50    to 200 atm.) to obviate incidental disturbances.

P  to Q. With the vapour-bath in the position b d, pressure
would thus cool the end A and heat the end B of the glass
tube A B ; but the cooling would exceed the heating. Hence
an error of the sign of the data, Table I. &c. Mow let the
vapour-bath be shifted to the position ac and the thermal
state be steady.   The B-half of the tube A B is now exposed
to cold, and compression can only have the effect of heating
these parts, seeing that the A-balf is protected.         Hence an
error of a sign opposite to the data of Table I. &c. Finally,
when the bath has the position ce, the error first considered
would be accentuated.

but found that this severe test did not change the character
of the results of Table I. Data are superfluous.         Again, de
creasing  the length  of the tube   A B  had no  appreciable effect.
Similar tests were made with reference to Table II.

resistance of glass and the electromotive force NaHg/glass/Hg,

out the change of resistance.      Let e, I, R denote the electro

proportional     to the  resistance  of the   glass.  The abscissae are
times, supposing that the times consumed in making each
triplet of observations are equal and similar.           The oscillations
are due to the fact that pressure is raised from about 150
atmospheres to about 600 atmospheres, and then lowered to
the first value again, thus giving the three points for each of
the triplets numbered.

examination of mercury and solution of zinc sulphate.           Both
coefficients in this case were negative, and      I was not prepared
for the positive coefficients (SR/R.6/>) so marked in the
present paper.       The data as a whole, therefore, show that it is
not permissible to pass from one substance to another ; doubt
less because the number of molecules which must split up per
unit of area to discharge the field varies largely from sub
stance to substance.        Inferences are to be drawn from one
and the same solvent, either electrolytically dissociated by
temperature, or modified by the solution of some given sub
stance, or both.
     39. The remarks of § 38 are substantiated by the incidental
results of Table VI., where the number of ions is increased by
dissolved dirt.      It agrees with the negative pressure-coefficient
found for zinc sulphate (I. c).           Moreover, by keeping the
 thick machine-oil at 310° for two or more hours,            I found
 that its resistance continually decreased, while the pressure-
 coefficient passed from indistinctly positive to pronounced
 negative values.       Dissociation is here to be inferred.
     I  have only touched upon this question in passing ; but if
 it can be proved that the occurrence of negative pressure-
 coefficients is an index of solution, then metals may also be
 regarded as holding ions in solution. In general a sequence
 of changes of state or of molecule corresponding to gas-liquid,
 liquid-solid, may be regarded as crowded into the solid state,
  though the external manifestations are here no longer obvious
 at once.
      40. The present research has been excessively tedious and
  elusive. Moreover the final values for the pressure-coefficient
  of glass (Tables VII., VIII.), although consistent, do not
  show the uniformity of values which 1 had hoped to reach.
  Nevertheless the results are marked, and unless there be some
  occult behaviour of polarization, I do not believe that have I
  been led astray in my inferences.           In so far as my results
  are correct, they contain the first direct and connected evi
  dence of the change of chemical equilibrium with strain.
      Regarding the behaviour of liquid insulators like the hydro
  carbon oils, the results found present many points of interest,
   and   I  have no doubt that a more systematic study of the
   subject than    I  have been able to make would throw much
   light  on  the details  of the mechanism by which electricity is

III.   On   the  Diurnal    Variations   of Magnetic Element*, a*
    depending    on  the  Method    of  Tabulation.     By William
    Ellis, F.R.A.S.,     of the  Royal Observatoiy, Greenwich* '.
          interesting paper of Messrs. Robson and Smith,
                                                                 " On
THEthe        Diurnal Variation of the Magnet at Kew," which
appears in the August number of the Philosophical Magazine
 (page 140), includes a comparison           between the diurnal in
equality of the declination-magnet as determined               at the
Greenwich and Kew Observatories in the years 1870, 1871.
1872, 1883, 188(5, and 1887.
    The Kew results for the years 1883, 188(», and 1887 were
determined by the authors of the paper by Wild's method,
the hourly ordinates for about five quiet days in each month
having been measured.          Those for the years 1870, 1871, and
1872 had been previously determined by Mr. Whipple, Super
intendent of the Kew Observatory, and by him communicated
to the 1886 Report of the British Association Committee on
Comparing and Reducing Magnetic Observations; and were,
as Mr. Whipple kindly informs me, calculated from the records
of four selected quiet days in each month of the three years.
The results for the whole six years are thus in every respect
comparative.
    The Greenwich      results with which those for Kew were
compared     were deduced, not from selected days, but from the
records for all days excepting those, comparatively few in
number, on which either the magnet was excessively disturbed,
or the record from some accidental cause was wanting.
Whenever results for all days are hereafter mentioned, it will
be understood to be with this limitation.           For the days thus
employed a pencil line was drawn by hand through each
photographic trace so as to represent the general form of the
curve, neglecting its petty irregularities, but giving con
sideration to deviations of marked character.              The hourly
ordinates    were   measured    from  such   pencilled line, and it is
on the measures so made that the diurnal inequalities con
tained in the Greenwich volumes, and employed by Messrs.
Robson and Smith, depend.
    Comparing together the Greenwich and Kew results for
declination, found in the way described, Messrs. Robson and
                      • Communicated   by tlie Author.

        On  the Diurnal Variations of Magnetic Elements.      37
Smith showed that there existed a periodical difference in the
diurnal inequality, similar in character, and generally also in
magnitude, in each of the six years treated. Mr. Whipple, in
the British Association Report before alluded to, had previously
pointed out the existence of this periodical difference in the
three years with which he dealt, and suggested that it might
be in some measure due to instrumental causes, and in some
degree also to difference of geographical position, which con
siderations would apply equally to the comparison of the
years 1883, 188(1, and 1887; but how far such causes may
have acted, it was impossible from a comparison of this kind
to determine.
    Circumstances have now, however, arisen which enable us
to make a direct comparison of the two methods of tabulation.
    In compliance with a request made by the Sub-Committee
of the Kew Committee of the Royal Society, the Astronomer
Royal has arranged to select, yearly, five quiet days in each
month, to be generally adopted for the discussion and com
parison of the diurnal inequalities of magnetism at the various
British magnetic observatories,       in consequence of which
diurnal inequalities will now be determined at Greenwich for
these selected quiet days, as well as for all days in the manner
which has been so long employed. The work at Greenwich
for the first year under this arrangement, that of 188!),
having been lately completed, opportunity is now given
for making a direct comparison of methods, a comparison in
which the question of difference of instruments or of geogra
phical position in no way enters.          Viewing the interest
attaching to this matter, the Astronomer Royal has kindly
given me permission to communicate to the Philosophical
Magazine the results arrived at for the year mentioned.
    The present comparison has been made 'not only for decli
nation, but also for the horizontal and vertical forces, and the
 results are contained in the accompanying Table. The diurnal
inequalities on the two systems, and their differences, are
given, in the case of declination in minutes of arc, and for the
horizontal and vertical forces in parts of these forces.     But
in order to make the comparison between the several ele
ments more complete,        the differences   have been further
 converted into metric measure, those of declination being
 expressed as westerly force, the unit employed in the Table
 being "00001 of the metric unit. The metric differences are
 also exhibited in the form of curves, for comparison with
 the curves for declination given by Messrs. Robson and

  38       On  the  Diurnal Variations of Magnetic Element/.
  Smith*. The Greenwich declination-curve is less bold than
  that of Messrs. Robson and Smith, but in other respects
  shows great similarity, both in form and in the position of
  the nodal points.       The deficiency in boldness may be a pecu
  liarity of the year under discussion, the epoch being one of
  minimum magnetic activity.
      The periodical difference shown by Messrs. Eobson and
  Smith to exist between the Greenwich and Kew diurnal
  inequality of declination, as deduced at Greenwich from all
  days and at Kew from quiet days, thus appears to depend on
  difference in the character of the records employed ; since the
  discussion of Greenwich records alone, on the two systems
  mentioned, leads to the same conclusion, not only as regards
  declination, but also for the horizontal and vertical forces.
  A difference of the same general character is shown in each
  element in all months of the year : these particulars could
  not well be given here, but it has been thought interesting
 to add in the Table the summer and winter effects, taking
  summer as including the months from April to September,
 and winter the remaining months of the year.
     The records used in the formation of the Greenwich all days'
 results contain many irregularities which are smoothed in the
 way before mentioned.            The quiet days, in 1889, contain
 practically no irregularities.         It might thus be conjectured
 that something may be due to systematic bias in the perform
 ance of the smoothing operation ; but it could, if necessary,
 be shown that no influence of this kind would produce differ
 ences so dissimilar in character for the different elements ;
 besides which irregularities in the vertical-force record arc so
 infrequent, and in the year treated so few and trifling, that
 practically no smoothing had to be done ; but yet the curve
 for vertical force, as may be seen, is quite as pronounced as
 those for either of the other elements, and indeed forms a very
 much larger proportion of the whole diurnal inequality for
 vertical force (see the Table) than is the case for either of the
 other elements.
     The difference between the two methods of determining
diurnal inequality thus appears to arise from a physical cause,
the form of the diurnal inequality-curve found by including
all days differing in a systematic way from that given by
using selected quiet days, in the manner shown in the diagram.
The nodal points in the horizontal-force and vertical-force
   * The vertical divisions on the diagram correspond each to -0002o
metric or -OOOOd-j C.G.S. measure, equivalent on the declinvtion-curve to
Qf'47 in arc, whilst those on Messrs. Kobjon and Smith's diagTam represent
each V CO.

IV.    Additional Notes on Secondary Batteries.           By Dr.   J.  H.
          Gladstone, F.R.S., and W. Hibuert,             F.'l.C*
                 the    publication of a series of papers by Dr.
 DURING   Gladstone   and Mr. Tribe in 'Nature,' 1882, on the
" Chemistry of the Plante and Faure Accumulators," a dis
cussion arose as to whether the sulphate of lead, to which
 they attributed so important a part in the reaction, could be
reduced by electrolysis.         It was shown at the time by expe
rimental proof    that  this  was   possible, even when the sulphate
of lead was pure, and it was contended that when intimately
mixed with peroxide of lead, as in actual practice, there was no
difficulty about the matter f.
    There arose, however, a belief that a subsulphate of lead
was produced on the plates.            Some experimenters found in
this belief an explanation of the difficulty in reducing those
masses of salt which occasionally form in practice, while others
looked upon the subsalt as more easily reducible than the
neutral compound.
    So far as we are aware, no specimen of the supposed sub-
salt was described till Professor Frankland published his paper
in the Royal Society's Proceedings, 1S8SJ, vol. xlvi. p. 304, in
which he gives an account of what he believes to be two
definite subsulphates.       That produced from litharge we have
already examined in our paper of last June J. Since then we
have turned our attention to the other possible subsalt made
by the action of sulphuric acid on minium.
    In the original paper §, Gladstone and Tribe gave the formula
of decomposition as
             Pb804 +   2H2S04=Pb03 + 2PbS04 + 2H20.
They showed by means of a quantitative experiment its
gradual slow formation, and said,             "It  is evident that in a
Faure battery      we    are  dealing    with  plates that consist of a
superficial layer of mixed peroxide and sulphate of lead."
    Frankland, while viewing this red substance as a sub-
sulphate, arrived at precisely the same ultimate composition,

             Additional Notes on Secondary Batteries.           43
 which he expressed by the formula S2Pb8Oi0.          He adduces,
however, no -evidence to show that it is not a mixture of
 Pb03 with 2PbS04.       We sought for some means of deciding
 between these two views.     A solution of acetate of ammonium
is known to dissolve sulphate of lead, and was in fact used
long ago for that purpose.       It might therefore be expected
to separate the sulphate from the peroxide, while it was not so
likely to bring about the decomposition of such a compound
as SjPbsOio.
    Some of the red substance         was prepared    by treating
minium with an excess of dilute sulphuric acid (1 of acid
 to 10 of water).      After four days the action was still in
 complete, but eventually it absorbed the full amount of acid
 required by theory.
    The percentage of lead in the resulting red substance was
just over 72 per cent.
    A portion of this, after treatment with a 3 percent, solution
 of acetate of ammonium, left a residue which was much
darker in colour than the original and contained 82 per cent,
of lead. That is to say, it was approximating towards PbOg,
 which contains 8G"G per cent, of lead.     The liquid was colour
 less, and the ratio between the Pb and S04 dissolved was
 determined in several different instances.    The ratio
                          Weight of Pb
                          Weight of SO,
 varied   from 2-0 to 2*15, pure PbS04 requiring 2*16 and
 Frankland's compound 323.          The portion dissolved there
 fore was not a basic sulphate, and the evidence tells against
 the original substance being a chemical compound.
    Of course, it is impossible to affirm that no subsulphate is
 ever formed in the reactions of a secondary cell, but all that
 we actually know is perfectly consistent with the old and
 simpler supposition that PbS04 is the salt alternately formed
 and decomposed.
                Action  of Sulphuric Acid  on Lead.
    In our former communication we described a comparative
 experiment in which dilute sulphuric acid, either alone or
 mixed with a small quantity of sodium sulphate, was allowed
 to act on spongy lead.      The experiment was allowed to con
 tinue lor five months, and hydrogen gas was given off for

44          Messrs. Boys, Briscoe, and Watson on                       the
such a length of time that we thought it would be interesting
to analyse the resulting substance.

consisted of 82 per cent, of sulphate of lead and 18 per cent,
of metallic lead, while that from the action of acid mixed with
sulphate of soda consisted of 8lt per cent, of lead sulphate
and 11 per cent, of metallic lead.
   Although the action of the acid on the lead was initially
diminished by the presence of sodium sulphate, the final result
in this instance was rather the other way. No doubt the
 whole of the spongy lead would have been converted into
 sulphate if it had not been for the large amount of insoluble
salt which protected the remaining particles.
   This result throws light on the reason why a lead plate
deteriorates during a long rest.

measured electromagnetic radiation by the increase in length
of a fine platinum wire stretched in a glass tube in consequence
of the heat developed by the induced currents within          one                it,

confirm      by some independent method the conclusion that
the wire was lengthened by heat, as           was not absolutely
                                                     it
certain, though exceedingly probable, that the increase in
length might not be apparent only and not real.
   The following      an account of experiments made
                       is                                    two              by
independent methods,    with   the view  of finding whether the
expansion observed        Mr. Gregory was such as might be
                              by
expected from the induced currents.
                                    First Method.
   Imagine two straight wires parallel and near together, but
not touching one another or any conductor.         Let them be
placed parallel to   and  at  convenient distance from
                                     a                    cylin              a
drical rod of the same length as either of the wires. Then,
if electrical oscillations are started in this rod by any well-

           Measurement     of Electromagnetic Radiation.           45
known method, the two wires will act as resonators, and
induced oscillations will occur in them, not necessarily in
absolutely the opposite phase to the oscillations in the pri
mary, but at any rate in the same phase in the two wires,
so that the electricity in each will surge up and down at
the same time.        If, then, the ordinary theories of electro-
dynamic and electrostatic action apply in the present case,
which may be true or may not, then the currents going np
together and down together will attract one another, while
the charges resting chiefly at the two ends, being at one
 moment -f above and — below, and at tho next moment
 reversed, will repel one another.        Owing to the harmonic
distributions of the current and the charges, the electro-
dynamic attraction will be mainly in the middle parts, while
the electrostatic repulsion will be mainly at the two ends.
Further, both these distributions vary harmonically with
the time, and are a quarter-period               removed    from one
another ; but the integral effect of each is equivalent to
a steady force, and the quarter-period difference of phase
has no influence as far as forces are concerned.
   In order to realize what these forces are, and what are the
relations between them, it will be necessary to consider them
separately.
                                      —
    (1) Electrodynamic Attraction. Let the wires be supposed
to be very close together, so that the force felt by any element
is almost entirely due to those elements of the other wire
which are so close to it that the variation of the current strength
in those elements along the wire is inconsiderable. Now, if the
distance apart is d, if c is the strength of the current at any
moment (measured electrodynamically), and if / is tho length
of the element, the force exerted by the other wire on this
element will be   '2    dynes.     But as the   current at any point
varies harmonically with the time, the average force will be
necessarily half the maximum force ; therefore the average
force on the centre elements will      be  —, , if c is the maximum
                                           a
current at the centre.
   Since, also, the current varies harmonically along the wire,
the average force per unit length over the whole wire will be
half that at the centre ; so that the attraction between the
               ciL
wires will be        where  L  is the whole length of the wire.
   (2) Electrostatic Repulsion.
                                   — In the same way, if q is
the quantity of electricity (measured           electrostatically) on

46            Messrs. Boys, Briscoe, and Watson on                        the
unit length at any part of the wire, the force of repulsion
upon an element          at any moment will be                  2          the average
force   on this element         will be — , and the total repulsion
between      the wires   will be
   Now to find the relation between these it is necessary to
remember that the wires are resonators ; that             the oscilla    is,
tions follow the natural period and are not, forced. Also that
the total quantity of electricity on one half of the wire          the               is
integral of the current that has passed the middle point.
Although there      no difficulty in finding the relation between
                    is
the attraction and repulsion, the following graphic method
may be worth giving.         In order to simplify matters, the
resonator will at first be supposed of such         length that the
                                                               a
oscillations occur at the rate of one       second, t. e.
                                                       a      will be          it
supposed to be    \of     1010 centim. long
                          3 X                   also the maximum
                                                           ;
current at the centre will be supposed unity.          Now let the
vertical line in   C(fig.    represent the wire, and the distance
                              1)
of the harmonic curve from        at any point the strength of the
 current at that point when          it it
                                     at a maximum.
                                             is
                                     Fig.         1.

     In the same way, let the distance of the harmonic curve in
Q  from the wire at any point represent the charge at that
point quarter-period later, at which time
        a                                             at maximum;
                                                           it       is    a
then the total quantity on     one   end, represented by the shaded
area,    the integral of the current which has passed the middle
        is
point p. Now this current varies harmonically with the time,
as shown in the time-diagram T.            This    divided into four
                                                           is
equal parts.     Thus    the   first   represents  (say)  an upward
current rising from zero         to  its  maximum      this just neu;
tralizes the previously charged wire. Then, in the second
period, the continuation of the current produces an equal and
opposite charge, which          is  maximum when the current has
                                     a
become zero.     In  the  third   period, the current in the opposite

direction has again neutralized the charges by the time that it
is a maximum ; and in the fourth period, it charges the upper
end negatively and has ceased to flow when the negative charge
is a maximum.
    Now divide the second period of the time-diagram of cur
rent, T, into n (=} of 3 × 10") elements, and the upper half of
the wire in the quantity-diagram, Q, into the same number of
        parts, which will therefore each be one centimetre long.
Qual
Now, since the total quantity of electricity represented by the
shaded part in Q is equal to the time-integral of the current
 which is represented by the shaded part in diagram T; and since
also each of these is bounded by a quarter-period of a sine
 curve, and is divided into an equal number of elements, it is
 clear that each space-element in Q, 1, 2, 3,... m, must equal the
 corresponding time-element in                T;
                                            or, in words, though the
 quantity of electricity that has passed the point p in the first
 element of time is spread over the upper half of the wire in Q,
 and so on, yet at the nth element we may consider that that
 which passed during the first element of time is stored on
 the element 1, that which passed during the second element
 of time is stored on the element 2, and so on. Now, since
 the current-strength in the first element of time is 1, and
 since this element of time has been made equal to 1/(3 x 10")
 second, the quantity of electricity on the end centimetre
 of wire is 1/(3 x 10") electrodynamic unit, or 1 electrostatic
 unit.    This will be repelled by the wire opposite with the
 same force as that with which the current in the centre
 element of one wire will be attracted by that in the other
 wire, both when each is at a maximum and through                     the                all
 harmonic variations.           the same way, the next element near
                                   In
 the end        in  will correspond               to
                                           the next element near the

 middle       in   and         over the whole length

 so, since the electrodynamic attraction over every element
     time and space          equal      the electrostatic repulsion

    It follows from this that, if the oscillations be forced and
made too slow, the accumulation of charge on the ends will be
 greater for a given maximum current than it would be if the
period were natural, and therefore the repulsion should over
power the attraction. In the same way, with too rapid vibra
tions the attraction should overbalance the repulsion.                 Also
 since, if the wires are not close together, the electrostatic
repulsion will have fallen away in a higher ratio than the
electrodynamic attraction, it would appear that resonators
which balance when close should attract one another when at
a distance, or that resonators           subject to forced oscillations
which repel when near might attract when at a distance.
     Prof. Fitzgerald, when the above theory of the mutual
 action of resonators was put to him, at once suggested that if
 the molecules of a body were subject to electrical oscillations
 it would be possible to imagine a physical cause
 for their supposed attraction when far, and                    Fig- 2.

     In order to -test the matter experimentally,
 the wires were made of a cranked form, as
 shown in fig. 2, so that the ends were on one
 side of a vertical axis (dotted), and the middle
 part on the other side.          Then, if one is held
 close to the other, and if the second one is free
 to turn about the vertical axis, the attraction of
 the centre and the repulsion of the ends should
 conspire to produce rotation in the same
 direction *.
     The first experiment was made with a pair
  of copper wires each one foot long, bent so
  that the end parts were each 2^ inches, the
  middle part 5 inches, and the horizontal part
  1 inch.     This was suspended in a glass jar by
 a quartz fibre, so that the vertical axis of
 rotation was halfway between the ends and                        ' i
 the middle portion. An ordinary galvanometer-
    *
       It may be worth mentioning that the invention of this method was
 made in a particularly vivid dream, in which   I found myself at the black
 board in the physical lecture-room, explaining that if the two wires were
 close together, the currents in each would be going up and down together,
 and so would attract one auother, and that m order to make this attrac
 tion evident, the wire should be suspended near the axis of rotation, for
 the reason that where quartz-fibres can be employed there is a greater
 gain owing to the reduction of moment of inertia than loss by reduc
 tion of statical moment.    I  did not in the dream see that the charges
 should repel, or the necessity for the cranked form of wire.    I may say
 that this was Bfter Mr. Gregory had described his instrument, but the
idea of looking for mutual attraction between a pair of resonators had
not before occurred to me. — C. V. B.

            Measurement   of Electromagnetic   Radiation.          49
 mirror was attached to the rigid glass hook from which the
 wire was suspended, and this could be seen through a plate-
 glass window in a torsion-box above the jar.          The oscillator
 consisted of two pieces of brass tube half an inch in diameter
 with hemispherical ends, each b' inches long in all. This was
 placed in a vertical position two or three feet away from the
 wires, and in the plane of the suspended wire, so that it
should not act directly upon it. The two parts of the oscil
lator were connected by very line wires with the terminals of
a Voss machine.      Then it was found that when the halves of
the oscillator were separated too far for a spark to pass, there
was no deflexion, while when they were gradually made to
approach one another, no motion was visible on the scale until
sparks passed, and then the motion was evident enough, the
light even going in favourable cases off the scale in the right
direction.
    However, this was only a preliminary experiment made
with materials at hand.      It was clear that the material which
was most suitable was that which had the highest, conductivity
for its density, namely, aluminium, and that only the outer
surface of the wire could be efficacious, since the oscillations
were at the rate of about 500,000,000 a second.        Accordingly,
thick aluminium wire was rolled into thin ribbon, which was
then drawn through successive holes in a draw-plate until a
perfect tube, cracked down one side of course, was formed.
    We used resonators made of this material in the next ex
periments, which were made with the view of
seeing whether the couple observed was due                Fig. 8.
equally to the repulsion of the ends and attrac
tion of the centre, or if one preponderated over
the other.     The fixed cranked resonator was
then replaced by a straight one, which was
held at first close and opposite to the ends of
the suspended      cranked resonator,      when     a
strong repulsion   was  observed,  as expected.    It-
was then held in the corresponding          position
opposite the centre part, when, instead of the
expected attraction, feeble repulsion was ob
served ; and finally, on being placed equidistant
from the two, the ends were repelled away.
    Since this appeared to show that the elec
trostatic repulsion was much greater than the
electrodynamic attraction, we tried the following
experiment, in' which the electrostatic action
was reduced to practically nothing.      A pair of
resonators    were made of the- form shown in
 fig. 3, and one was weighted with a non-conductor and sns*.

   nded so that the straight part was in the axis of rotation.
  he other was then held with the curl close and parallel to
the curl of the other, and so that at first the current in each
 should go round the same way, and then in opposite ways.
 No action was observed in either case. When also cranked
 or straight resonators were entirely immersed in water, no
 effect at all was observed.
    We have given a short account of the early experiments
 because at first they were so completely in accord with the
 result of the theory put forward,                           W.

 powerful than had been expected, that for a time we were
 deceived as to the real cause, and we wish to guard others

violently off tho scale, and then a Hertz resonator tuned to
the oscillations of the primary was placed in the jar and
surrounded by tho same acid duster when the sparks in tho
gap were evident, showing that the proper electromagnetic
waves did penetrate into tho jar as supposed.
   The turning moment corresponding to a deflexion of £ millim.
may be found from the following particulars : —
   Period of oscillation of mirror and stem (oscillator re
moved), *947 second.
   Period of oscillation with wire ring hung on, 4- 13 second.
   (Wire ring 1*8 centim. diameter outside, made of wire
•122 centim. in diameter ; mass "4635 gramme.)            Hence
           Couple = l-l x 10-5 C.G.S. units, and
           Average value of couple = 3' 7 x 10-7 C.G.S. units
              per centim. of wire of resonator,
which corresponds to a force of about 3 x 10-7 dynes, since
the distance from the axis is 1^ centim.     This is less than a two-
hundred-millionth of the weight of a grain, or a three-thousand-
millionth of the weight of a gramme.
   Since the wires were only "2 centimetre apart, this shows
that, if the currents in the wires, instead of being oscillating,
had heen simply ordinary steady currents, those currents could
not have reached the value of "00017 C.G.S. electromagnetic
unit or "0017 ampere.
   Now the moment, if the theory advanced is correct, is duo
partly to electrostatic repulsion and to electrodynamic attrac
tion which are equal to one another, but owing to the harmonic
distribution of both, both in time and in position, and owing
to the fact that the weaker part of each of these forces is
tending to counteract the stronger part, the total average
resultant force is by no means double or even equal to that
due to a steady current alone of a strength equal to tho actual
maximum.
   To find the relation it is necessary to first consider the
effect of the harmonic distribution of either, say the current,
along the wire. The square of this at any point is a measure
of the force at that point, so that the force varies from zero
at the ends to its full value in the middle, having passed its
half value at the points where the wire crosses the axis of
rotation.
   Thus, in fig. 4, the ordinates of the upper curve ab c, which
is half a sine curve, represent current strength, those of the
lower curve a d b e c, which is a complete sine curve on half
the scale, but shifted vertically by the amount of its own
 maximum ordinate, since

The difference of these, which is the area dbel,h the balance

current of the maximum strength over the whole length of
the wire is 2ir, so the force in the cranked conductor due to
the harmonically distributed current and the opposite effect
of the ends is   —  x that due to uniform maximum current over
 the whole wire.      The current is not steady, but varies har
 monically with the time, so on this account the value must
 be halved again, but this halving is exactly balanced by the
doubling which results from the fact that the electrostatic
exactly equals the electrodynamic effect.
    We have seen that the force was not so great as that due
to a steady uniform current of "0017 ampere ; therefore the
maximum current in the centre could not, if the oscillations
continued uninterruptedly,havereached the value of             x '0017
or *003 ampere.       Since in the most violent torrent of sparks
that can be produced the time during which the oscillations

             Measurement   of Electromagnetic Radiation.             55
 last is very small compared        to the interval between two
 sparks, it is quite possible, and even probable, that, the actual
 current during the earlier part of each spark greatly exceeded
 this, but this is a superior limit to the value of the square root
 of the mean square of the strength of the current in the par
ticular case.
     It should be noted that two errors, each of which is
 numerically insignificant, have, for convenience, been made.
 One is the supposition that the forces on the elements near the
ends of the resonators are the same as though they were con
tinued together with the stationary wave.              As a matter of
 fact, it is only the last few millimetres for which there is a
 falling off. The second error is made by supposing that the
 middle half of the wire is all at one distance from the axis
 on one side, and the two end quarters at an equal distance
 from the axis on the other side. As a matter of fact, the wire
 has to cross over, but as the two forces almost exactly balance
 on the small part which crosses the axis, it was not worth
 w hile to complicate the simple statement         of conditions illus
 trated by fig. 4 for the sake of an imaginary degree of
 accuracy which the nature of the observations would not
justify.
                            Second Method.
     As the first method, carried out with all the delicacy which
 under the conditions we could make use of, gave no promise,
 we determined to find by some direct process whether the heat
 which Mr. Gregory had inferred from the expansion of the
  wire was real.     For this purpose we made use of one of the
  most delicate heat-measuring instruments that exist, which is
  specially suitable for detecting very small quantities of heat
  diffused over a great length of wire, namely the convection
  air-thermometer of the late Dr. Joule*.            With this instru
  ment he was able to detect the direct heating-effect of the
  moon's rays unconcentrated by lens or mirror.
      His instrument consisted of a tube about 2 feet long and
  4 inches in diameter, divided longitudinally by a blackened
   pasteboard diaphragm, leaving spaces at the top and bottom.
  In the top space a piece of magnetized sewing-needle, fur
   nished with a glass index, was suspended by a single silk fibre.
  Any excess of temperature on one side of the partition caused
   an air-current, which at the top passed from the hot to the
  cold side and deflected the needle.
                * Proc. Manchester Phil. Soc. vol. hi. p. 73.

56           Messrs. Boys, Briscoe, and Watson on       the
    We have made use of Joule's instrument, not exactly in the
original form, but with two classes of index, and with an
essential improvement which makes it extraordinarily              sen
sitive without greatly affecting its simplicity.       The first class
of index depends for its working on the fact that when a small
piece of phosphorus is placed in air it gradually oxidizes, and
the oxide formed slowly falls, if the air is still, in a well-defined
column, appearing like smoke.          If there is any very small
motion of the surrounding air, this column of phosphorous
oxide will be deflected.       It thus forms an excessively de
licate and light index for detecting movements in the
 air.
    To overcome the difficulty of keeping the index at rest,
owing to radiation from neighbouring bodies or to draughts
 of varying temperature, we have surrounded the divided tube
by another, which was kept rotating continuously by clock
work.      If any part of this guard-tube becomes slightly heated,
it is carried round and made to heat the instrument equally all
 round, and so it produces no effect.
    As the determination on theoretical grounds of the most
 suitable dimensions presents considerable difficulties, we
 decided to make a series of tubes of different sizes and
 compare their sensibility.        The object of the instrument
 being to measure      the heat  developed by the electromagnetic
 radiation in a wire within the instrument, it was necessary
 to make both the tube and guard-tube of some insulating
 material, such as glass.
     The tube to be used was cleaned, and a roll of brown paper
 about 1 inch long was pasted round one end.               This fitted
 tightly into a mahogany ring, D (Plate V. fig. 5). The
 tube was divided longitudinally          by a partition of card
 board (F), which was made to fit tightly into the tube.          This
 partition   extended  from  the  bottom   to within   about an inch
  of the top, which end was closed by a cork.
     The projecting end of the mahogany ring (D) fitted into a
  corresponding hole in a piece of wood (E), which was itself
 supported on two blocks (A and B). The tube (represented
  by the dotted circles in the plan, fig. G) came directly over
  this space between A and B, the partition being parallel to
  their adjacent faces.
     Between A B, and immediately beneath the tube, two glass
  semi-cylinders were placed, with their convex surfaces facing
  each other.     They are shown in plan in fig. b" (MN), and
  one is shown in perspective in fig. 7. At 2 centim. from the
  top of oue of these semi-cylinders a small paper scale (fig. 5),
  divided in half-millimetres, was attached.         When a current

          Measurement    of Electromagnetic Radiation.        57
of air passes from one side of the tube to the other, it has to
pass through the narrow space between these cylinders.
    A hole was bored through the top of B, through which a
capillary glass tube could be passed.       This tube was filled
with phosphorus, and the glass broken away for about one
millimetre, so as to expose a clean piece of phosphorus when
ever the stream of oxide had to be observed.        The tube was
then passed through the hole (K), so that the exposed piece of
phosphorus came just beneath the partition and between the
glass cylinders.    It is shown in place at H in fig. 5.
    By this means the stream of phosphorous oxide was formed
at the narrowest part of the air channel, and so was affected
to the maximum extent by any passage of air from one side
of the partition to the other. The resulting deflexion of the
phosphorous-oxide stream could be read with an accuracy of
about one-tenth millimetre. In this form, when the phosphorus
index is deflected it is carried to a part where the channel is
much wider, owing to the curvature of the glass half-cylinders;
On this account the deflexion of the index is not any simple
function of the rate at which the air is passing.           With
a view to do away with this want of proportionality, and
also, if possible, to render the instrument more sensitive, the
glass half-cylinders were replaced by a pair of narrow flat
glass plates, near together, with a wide channel on each side
communicating with the tube above.          The instrument was,
however, found to be less sensitive in this form than when the
half-cylinders were used.
    The sensitiveness of the instrument could, to a certain
extent, be altered by moving M and N (fig. 6) further apart,
so that the phosphorus stream fell in a wider channel.
    The divided tube was surrounded by another glass tube
 (G, fig. 5), which was about 10 centimetres longer. This
 formed the guard-tube, and was suspended from one of the
axles of a clock (K, fig. 11), which made one revolution in
about eight seconds.
    By means of three levelling-screws the guard-tube was
 made to hang free of the inside tube, so that it did not touch
it at any part of its revolution. Thus no heat due to friction
 was developed near the divided tube.
    The phosphorus could not be placed at the top of the tube,
 as the falling column of oxide was found to go on one side of
 the partition, and its weight was sufficient to keep up a down-
 current of air on this side and an up-current on the other side,
 and so make the instrument unstable.
    Inside the divided tube, and on one side of the partition,
 two fine platinum wires wore stretched, reaching from the top

58          Messrs. Boys, Briscoe, and Watson on the
to the bottom. They were connected together at the top, and
at the bottom were brought out and connected to two binding-
screws fixed on the ring D (fig. 5).            By means of this
wire, whose resistance was measured, a known amount of
heat could be developed in the tube by passing a current of
known intensity.       The current was, in all the experiments,
supplied by a single Daniell cell, which contained in its
circuit, beside the wire of the instrument, a resistance-box
and a key.
   The clock was kept working for about half an hour before
the commencement of an experiment, in order to equalize the
temperature within the tube ; and then a fresh piece of phos
phorus was introduced.        When the phosphorus index was
quite steady,   and  approximately at the centre of the scale, the
reading    was   taken  (zero-reading), then resistance was un
plugged in the box, and the current passed till the index had
again come to rest.        The current was then stopped, and
another zero-reading taken.
    In testing the different tubes the largest resistance which
would give a readable deflexion was in each case ascertained.
The resistance of the cell and the connecting- wires could be
neglected in comparison with the external resistance.
    In the different tubes the total heat developed was not the
same when the same current was passed, as the wires were of
different lengths.     This, however, was not taken into account
in comparing the tubes together, as for the measurement of
the electromagnetic radiation it was necessary to get the
greatest possible sensitiveness per centiin. of tbe wire.
    It is hardly necessary to give particulars of the different
tubes experimented upon.        It is sufficient to say that, while
the length of the tube was of little consequence, it was found
that a wide tube was much more sensitive than a narrow one.
The results obtained in a particular case are given.
   Tube No. 3 : — Length 82, diameter 5 centimetres.           Re
sistance of wire 29 ohms ; outside resistance 500 ohms.
Deflexion 1 millimetre.
   To calculate the amount of heat corresponding to this
deflexion, we have, taking the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell as

over the whole length of the tube, or '000,000,3 calorie per
centimetre of the tube.

             Measurement   of Electromagnetic Radiation.        59
    While this very small degree of heating was within the
range of experimental certainty so long as the clockwork was
going, it was impossible to keep any index visible at all when
the clock had stopped, even though several concentric screens
were placed round the tube.
    The apparatus in this form was subject to the great fault
that the phosphorus refused to form the oxide at a temperature
below 15° C, which prevented the instrument being used on
many days.
    With    the  view of getting over this difficulty with the
 phosphorus index, and if possible of obtaining greater sen
sitiveness, a form of index was adopted which was a modifi
cation of Dr. Joule's arrangement.
    The tube was closed at each end, the partition reaching
right np to the cork at the top and leaving a space of about
fifteen centimetres at the bottom. Twelve centimetres below
the top of the partition a hole was punched in the card. Into
this hole a short cylinder of paper was glued. This is shown
at A in figs. 8 & 9.     A plane mirror, M, fitted into this tube,
allowing     about  1 millimetre    clearance all round.   It was
fastened to a cross bar, at the other end of which a counter
poise (W) was fixed.
    The mirror and counterpoise were suspended by a fine quartz
fibre from a pin (E, fig. 8), which passed through the cork
used to close the tube.     When the mirror is at rest it almost
completely fills up the hole in the partition, and forms a very
delicate means of detecting any differences of pressure in the
air at the two sides of the partition.
    A small recess (B, fig. 9) was made in the partition for the
counterpoise, and covered in so that it was not exposed to the
current of air.       The arrangement is shown in elevation
in fig. 8, and in section through K L in fig. 9. Fig. 10
shows the mirror and counterpoise separately.         A hole was
ground in the tube immediately in front of the mirror, into
w hich a lens of a metre focal length was cemented.
    In this form of the instrument the guard-tube, if continuous,
would have prevented the formation of a clear image.            It
was therefore necessary to divide it into two portions. Rings
of mahogany (N, fig. 11) were cemented to the top of
the lower portion and to the top and bottom of the upper.
The two rings N\ N2 were connected together by three bolts,
of such a length as to leave a space of about two centimetres
between the rings.      This break in the guard-tube came just
on a level with the mirror, and thus allowed the beam of light
to pass freely. The passage of the bolts before the mirror
produced no inconvenient effect on the image formed on the

60          Messrs. Boys, Briscoe, and Wiitson on          the
scnle.    The ends of the wire were brought out nt the bottom
of the tube, leaving &bont half an inch free. When using a
continuous current, two brass clips (A, fig. 11) were placed
on these ends so as to connect them to a pair of binding- screws.
When using the oscillator these clips were turned down (as
in the figure), so that the wire should not bo connected with
any body having capacity.
   The following are the dimensions of this tube (No. 4) : —
   Length 12(5 centimetres, diameter 4*7 centimetres.
   Length of wire 2 x 103 centimetres.
   Resistance of wire 38 ohms.
   Diameter of guard-tube 7 centimetres.
   Diameter of mirror 1"2 centimetre.
   Length of fibre 9 centimetres.
   As shaking interfered with the working of the instrument,
the experiments were performed in a vault, which, however,
was by no means steady.
   The following are the results obtained when testing the
sensibility of the instrument (scale at 100 centimetres from
mirror) :—
         Added Resistance. Total Resistance.       Deflexion.

                                                        f~
                                             = '000,014 calorie.
   This is equivalent to one calorie developed in      19 hrs. 42 min.
Or we may say that one calorie per day developed by the whole
wire could certainly be detected ; that is, one calorie in
103 days per centimetre of tube.
   The oscillator used to set up the electromagnetic radiation
consisted of two hollow brass cylinders (D E, fig. 11),
fixed to ebonite cross pieces (F, C), which could be placed at
different heights in a wooden stand.          Short brass cylinders,
with well-rounded ends, fitted into the ends of D and E, and
allowed the length and sparking-distance to be altered. These
cylinders were connected by very fine wire with the terminals
of the large Ruhmkorff's coil belonging to the Physical

            Measurement     of Electromagnetic Radiation.          '{51
 Laboratory.      The length of the oscillator was the same as tint
of either of the wires in the tube, and it was placed so as to be in
the plane of the partition of the tube, at n distance of about
30 centimetres (fig. 11).       The best length of spark was about
half a centimetre.
    At first, on separating the knobs of the oscillators, so that
no spark passed, the instrument showed a large deflexion in
the direction of cold.     This was due to electrostatic attraction
between the oscillator and the mirror.         To prevent this action
a piece of tin-foil (B F G H, tig. 8) was pasted round the
tube at the level of the mirror, a hole being cut in it the
 size of the lens, which effectually put a stop to this action.
    The instrument now indicated a considerable amount of
heat developed in the wire whenever the coil was worked.
    The effect of altering the capacity of the oscillator by adding
pieces of tin-foil to the ends was tried, but with no beneficial
result.
    A wet duster was hung between the oscillator and the in
 strument for the purpose of seeing whether the radiation would
pass through.      The deflexion produced was only slightly less
 than when no duster was interposed.
    In order to measure the heat developed by the induced
 currents in the wire, the deflexion produced when the coil
 was worked was noted ; then a steady current was sent
 through the wire, and the resistance in the circuit altered till
 an equal deflexion was obtained.        The readings obtained with
"the oscillator were somewhat varied, owing to small changes
in the character of the sparks.        Another difficulty was caused
by the coil often refusing to work continuously for the time
necessary to get a reading (about 1^ minute), as the contact-
 breaker became burnt by the sparks.
    The following are the deflexions obtained in centimetres : —
            45  ;  44 ;  37  ; 36 ;   35-G  ;  3G-9 ; 44-8 ;
                      45 5  ;  40-2  ; 40  2 ;  39.
                          Mean 40*4 centim.
    One Daniell cell working through a total external resist
ance   of 115 ohms gave the following deflexions : —
                  41-0; 40-0; 39-3; 40'0;          41-0.
                          Mean 40*3 centim.
    Wo may therefore say that the heating-effect due to the
oscillations (oscillator at 30 centim.) is equal to that pro-

62          Messrs. Boys, Briscoe, and Watson on the
duced by one Daniell cell when the external resistance            is
115 ohms, and the working resistance 38 ohms.
    Therefore the heat produced per sec.
                            38       1    .   .
                       =                calones>

                        = •000685 calorie;
or it would take 24 minutes 20 sec. to produce one calorie.
    The steady E.M.F. between the terminals of the wire
which produces the same effect as the oscillations is "33 volt.
Mr. Gregory gives -5 volt as the equivalent E.M.F. in his
experiments. Though the conditions were not sufficiently
similar to make the numerical results strictly comparable,
nevertheless the fact that the figures obtained are of the same
order goes to show that the expansion observed by Mr.
 Gregory was a true expansion due to heat, and that his results
were real.
    In calculating from the heat developed the mean square
of the current produced in the wire by the electrical
oscillations, it is necessary to take into account the fact that
these rapidly alternating currents are not uniformly diffused
throughout the cross section of the wire, but only pass
through a thin stratum at the surface.           On this account the
resistance which the wire offers to these rapidly alternating
currents is greater than that which it offers to steady currents.
    Lord Rayleigh * gives a formula for calculating the effec
tive resistance of a wire of round section to an alternating
 current of given frequency. It is
                           R' =  VpB),
 where R' is the effective resistance ; R the resistance to
 steady currents in C.G.S. units ; ^>27r times the number of
 oscillations in one second ; I the length of the wire ; and /*
 the magnetic permeability of the substance of which the wire
 is composed.
     In the following calculation one of the wires only is con
 sidered.
    The length of the primary oscillator is 109 centimetres,
 and therefore the wave-length of the radiation given out is
 218 centimetres.      If n=number of oscillations per sec, then
                                = 1-376 xlO8.

    The length of the       wire (/) is 103 centimetres,     and its
 resistance   19 ohms=19x 10" C.G.S. units.
    In the case of platinum fi may be taken as unity.
    From this it follows that
                             R' = 29  ohms,
and since     H (half the heat developed         in the two wires)
 = •000342 calorie per second
                                   = •000049.
    Owing to the harmonic distribution of the current along the
wire, in order to produce a given amount of heat in the whole
wire, the strength of the current at the centre must be V2
times as great as that which would be necessary if the current
were of uniform strength in all parts of the wire.
    .*. the square root of the mean square of the current at
the centre ="01 ampere.
    While it is impossible from the heat found to form any
conclusion as to how fast heat was being generated during
each spark, or what fraction of the whole time the oscillations
lasted, yet here, as in the former case, the final result depends
on the mean square of the current.          We found by the first
method that the square root of the mean square was certainly
not *003 ampere, if the theory was correct ; while by the heat we
find the square root of the mean square to be "01 ampere. The
arrangements in the two cases were not strictly comparable,
for in the first the oscillator was only 30 centimetres long, while
in the secondit was 109 centimetres, and because the distance of
the primary from the secondaries was relatively greater in the
first than in the second case. We intended to have made a
second set of measures in which the suspended cranked oscil
lator should itself be in the tube of the convection-thermometer
together with the fixed cranked oscillator.         In this way the
force,   if any, between   them   could  be  observed  and measured
at the same time that the deflexion of the mirror due to the
heat was read ; then, by making contacts with the ends of the
fixed cranked oscillator alone, and passing a current through
it so as to produce the same deflexion, all the data would be
obtained to tell for certain whether the absence of force, or, if
force was observed, if the actual force was that which the
provisional theory set out at the beginning of this paper in
dicated. The discrepancy of 3 : 10 in the present instance

  64      Mr. F.    J. Smith on   the Measurement   of the Fall
  cannot he taken as proving that the theory is wrong,
  and that the forces ought not to be observed, but it does
  clearly show that they must be excessively minute, and that,
  if they exist, it is only by great refinement that they can bo
  made evident.       No doubt, as Prof. Fitzgerald suggested, the
  use of concentrating cylindrical mirrors of proper form would
 greatly increase the sensitiveness of the whole apparatus.
     We have been prevented from completing this work be
 cause the elementary laboratory was required, and it is im
 possible to carry on any really delicate research requiring
 uniform conditions and steadiness in so unsuitable a building
 as the Science Schools.         We have therefore published our
 results in their present imperfect condition, partly because we
 believe that the methods employed may be useful to others,
  but chiefly because wc hope that some physicist who has the
 advantage of having a steady underground room may be
 induced to make the experiments under more perfect con
 ditions, and so carry the matter to a successful issue.
 VI.   The Measurement of the Time of the Fall of Magnetization
    in a Magnetized Iron Cylinder.         By Fkedeuick     J.  Smith,
    M.A., Millard Lecturer on Mechanics and Physics, Trinity
     College,  Ooford*.
                  working at the construction of electromagnetic
 WHILE     styli,  as used in the Tram Chronograph, described at
p. 377, Phil. Mag. xxix.,        I  wished to determine the con
ditions for producing a stylus with a small "latency."            One
of the principal things to be determined was the time of the
fall of magnetization in different iron bars.          As the deter
mination of this period of magnetic change appears to be a
subject of interest apart from the way in which it affects the
action of styli, I beg respectfully to send you a brief account
of the method by which           I  have arrived at certain results
respecting it.
    If an iron bar be magnetized by a current of electricity
and the current be broken, the bar after a short time loses
some of its magnetism.         The time varies with the kind of iron
used   and   the  magnetizing force.
    If  the terminals of the coil conducting the magnetizing
current could be quickly shifted from the battery to the ter
minals of a galvanometer, then a deflexion would be expected
if the pole changing took place before the magnetization of
                    *  Communicated  by the Author.

          of Magnetization in a Magnetized Iron Cylinder.      65
the bar had quite run down.       The experiment was tried, and
always gave     the expected result.
    If, then, the exact time taken for pole changing could be
measured, when the galvanometer just showed no sign of an
induced current, this period of time would be that of the fall
of magnetization of the bar. In practice such a change is
just as well performed by having an arrangement, shown in
the diagram, where an inductor-coil is suddenly connected
to the galvanometer instead of the primary circuit, and tho
time is very gradually increased until no deflexion is produced.
                            N
    AB     is a long primary coil of known dimensions ; within
 this the iron cylinder to be tested is placed ; it is in circuit
 with a battery C, and a contact-piece E.       I is an inductor-
 coil of known induction area, in circuit with the galvano
 meter G, the inductor H, and the contact-piece F.
     The inductor H forms part of a system, consisting of a long
 helix M K, a battery N, an ampere-balance L, and a key 0 ;
 by means of this system the value of the throw or deflexion of
 the galvanometer is determined        in C.G.S. units, by the
 method of Sir W. Thomson.
     The contact-pieces E and F differ from each other in their
 action. The circuit at E is broken when E is hit by a pro
 jection, D, attached to the carriage of the chronograph moving
 in the direction of the arrow, whereas the induction circuit
 is closed when D hits F. E is fixed, and F can be placed at
 any required distance from it. The distance E F determines
 the time which elapses between breaking the primary circuit
 and making the induction circuit.         The primary circuit is
 always broken before the inductor-coil is connected to the

galvanometer circuit; so that the induction due to the iron
cylinder, apart from that due to the coil, is measured at any
time after the breaking of the primary circuit. The time of
traverse of the distance E F is determined from the trace of
the chronograph up to the gºno second.
   All the induction apparatus is placed at a great distance
from the galvanometer, so that it is in no way affected by                                                  it.

  in the Korea."        By Thomas H. Holland, Esq., of the Geological
  Survey of India, late Berkeley Fellow of the Owens College.
     The southern half of Korea traversed by Mr. Gowland is of a
 hilly character. The rocks forming the hills arc chiefly crystalline
 schists — gneisses with graphite, garnet, dichroite, and fluor occur-
 ing in considerable abundance, and the whole group is probably
 part of the great Archaean mass of North-east China.            The author
 describes these metamorphic rocks in detail.
     Stratified rocks, probably of Carboniferous age, lie unconformable
 upon     the schists in the south-eastern part of the peninsula, and
  petrographical notes of these are given in the paper.        Through the
 crystalline schists and stratified rocks various igneous rocks have
 been erupted as dykes or in large masses.         Amongst these the most
 conspicuous rock is granite.      Biotite- and muscovite-granite are most
 widely distributed, and in places are cut by dykes of eurite and
 veins of quartz and pegmatite.           The more basic class of rocks is
  represented by diorites, propylites, andesites, basalts, dolcrites, and
 gabbros.      Interesting cases of the gradual passage between the so-
 called intermediate and basic rooks are found, and various stages in
 the devitrification and decomposition       of andesitic lavas represented.
 These are described in detail by the author, and compared with
 similar cases in other regions ; and full descriptions of the intrusivo
 rocks are furnished.
     There arc now no active volcanoes ; and there is a notable lack of
 mineral wealth in the southern part of the Korea.

 the    London    Basin (north side)."     By the Bev. A. Irving, D.Sc,
 F.G.S.
     1. The author brings forward new evidence from well-sections,
 clay-pits recently opened, and excavations, confirming the reading of
 the country between Wellington-College          and Wokingham Stations
 on the S.E. Railway, as put forward by him in 1887 (Q. J. G. S.
vol. xliii. and figure 1 of the paper).       We have now actual data for
the gradients of the clay-beds, and the thinning-out of both the Lower
 (fluviatile) Sands and of the Middle green-earth series ; the latter,
 when taken into account, bringing the clays in the Wokingham out
lier into stratigraphical alignment with the basal clays of the Middle
Group.       Certain clays at California arc also shown to be in align
ment with these; and a sketch-section from Ambarrow to Barkham
Hill shows the relative gradients of certain horizons to be such as to
justify the relegation of the Febble-bed there to the base of the
 Upper Sands ; while a microscopical examination of the sands above
 it brings out the lithological identity of these and of the sands cap
 ping Farley Hill with the basal beds of the Upper Sands at Welling
 ton College and on Finchampstead Ridges. The accidental occurrence

  (58                      Geological Society : —
  of thin    seams of pipe-clay is rejected as a test of horizons, as
  affording only ambiguous evidence.
      2. A similar succession is shown in a section drawn from Wel
  lington College Well through the sand-pit at the brick-yards by
  Ninemile Ride (base of the Middle Clays exposed), Easthampstead
  Church Hill (with more recent data), and Bill Hill (Easthampstead).
  to the S.W. Railway at Bracknell, bringing the higher beds of those
  two hills into the horizon of the Upper Sands.       Further notes are
  also added to those of the author's 1888 paper (Q. J. G. S. vol. xliv.)
  on the Ascot Hills, Englefield Green, and Windsor Park, where the
  transgressive relation of the Bagshot Beds to the London Clay is
  maintained.
      3. In conclusion, the author points out that the new well-sections
  confirm the trustworthiness of that at Wellington College as a vertical
  datum-line ; he criticizes the views of previous writers and maintains
  that, with the aid of Lieut. Lyons' recently published contour-map.
  we can now discriminate between the effects of contemporaneous
  and post-Eocene earth-movements in the area ; and that the physical
  history of the Bagshot Beds, which he has himself propounded, is
  substantiated by the stratigraphies! evidence.

      1. " Account of  an Experimental Investigation of the Law that
 Limits the Action of Flowing Streams." By R. D. Oldham, Esq.,
 A.R.S M., F.G.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Geological Survey
 of India.
     The author brings forward evidence derived from experiments in
 support of the views expressed in a paper submitted to the Society
 in 1888.      His apparatus consisted of a sloping trough, through
 which various amounts of water containing definite percentages of
sand could be sent.      The lower ond of the trough issued on to a
semicircular platform.
     In three experiments with the trough at a slope of 1 in 20, and
 with the same work to be done in each case, the resulting slopes
 after sand had accumulated in the trough were as follows: — With
one part of sand to 42 of water, a slope of 1 in 40 ; with 1 of sand
to 28 of water, 1 in 20 ; and with 1 of sand to 14 of water, 1 in
13'3. These slopes were obtained when a condition of equilibrium
had been maintained so that the water was just able to transport
its burden.     By increasing the supply of water from 14 : 1 to 42 : 1,
the original slope was eventually obtained.
     On the fan formed on the horizontal platform variations in the
water-supply did not produce nearly so marked an effect as in the
confined channel, and the slope varied considerably in different
directions.
    After a time a channel was cut back into the fan, and its sand
swept forward and deposited as a secondary fan in front of the first :

                         On the Rocks of North Devon.                                              69
and as this grew, it cut back into the reach above, and this in turn
cut back towards the head of the fans, and sometimes into the
trough. In some cases other secondary fans were formed on the
margin of the main fan, but the apparatus was not large enough
for further formations.    The general slope of the fans, both pri
mary and secondary, was '06, and that of the reach only '04, while
at the head of the reach, where it was cutting back into the face
above, there was a gradient of '08.
   The general tendency of the experiments supports not only the
specific conclusions as to the normal form and behaviour of a river
which has attained a state of equilibrium, but to a greater degree
the fundamental assumption that a river will adapt its channel to
such a slope and form as will enable it to just transport a solid
burden cast upon         it.

 River at Holt fleet about 8 miles above Worcester."           By Henry
John Marten, Esq., M.Iust.C.E., F.G.S., &c, Engineer to the Severn
Commissioners.
    The Weir referred to in the paper was built in 1844 of soft red
 sandstone,   and some of the stones composing the apron of the Weir
 showing signs of decay were removed in 1887.         The average quan
 tity of water passing over each square foot of the stones composing
 the apron has been estimated ot about 2000 gallons per minute.         A
large proportion of the stones had been dri'led through and through
by the action of the current upon small pebbles lodged in hollows or
between the joints of the stone ; and the author estimates that as a
result of 43 years of erosion, six of the stones of the apron, which
may be taken as a sample, had lost the following amounts respec
tively : — 45, 60, 48, 50, 37, and 58 per cent.

in the United      States of America."   By Prof. Edward Hull, M.A.,
LL.D.,    F.R.S., F.G.S., late Director of the Geological Survey of
Ireland.
    The area described in the paper is occupied by the Unaka or Blue
Ridge, which may be regarded as one of the parallel ridges of the
Alleghanies, and the prolongation of Prof. J. D. Dana's
                                                              " Archaean
Protasis." It runs in a general south-westerly direction, and attains
an elevation of 0760 feet.     At its base, and to the north-west of it,
is the Valley of East Tennessee, about 40 miles wide, and furrowed
by north-east and south-west ridges and depressions, parallel to the
strike of the Cambrian and Silurinn beds.       Through this runs the
Tennesseo River, which, instead of running south to the Gulf of
Mexico, turns to the north-west, some distance below Chattanooga,
and cuts through the Cumberland table-land, a prolongation of the
Appalachian mountains, and flows into the Ohio river.
    The Cumberland table-land has an average height of 2000 feet
above the sea, and 1350 feet above the Tennessee River at Chatta
nooga.     It consists of a synclinal of Carboniferous rocks resting
conformably upon the Devonian beds, and is bounded along the East
Tonnessee Valley by a curved escarpment ; a similar though more in
dented escarpment forming its north-western margin, and separating

                 Intelligence  ami Miscellaneous    Articles.           71
it from the Silurian plain of Nashville.      The tahle-land is about 40
miles wide, and is intersected by the valley of the Sequachee Eiver,
running iu a north-easterly direction along a subsidiary anticline from
near Jasper for a distance of sixty miles.
    From the base of the Cambrian beds, the whole Lower and Upper
Paliuozoic formations succeed each other in apparently conformable
sequence, except at the junction of the Upper and Lower Silu
rian series, where a probable discordance occurs.          The prolonged
period of subsidence and deposition at length gave way to elevation ;
acting with the greatest effect along the Alleghanies.         Under these
circumstances, denudation preceded most rapidly along the tract
bordering the Protaxis, whilst the synclines were protected from
erosion to a greater degree ; and as the elevatory movement was
more rapid along the Unaka range, the flow of the streams was
generally westward.         At a later period the Cumberland plateau
began to be formed by backward erosion of the strata in the
direction of the dip ; so that it owes its development to the erosion
of the Tennessee and Clinch rivers on the one hard, and to the
Cumberland river on the other. Where the Tennessee Eiver flows in a
north-westerly direction through the Cumberland plateau, the divide
 between it and the Gulf of Mexico is only 280 feet above the river
 bed, whilst the table-land is 1400-1500 feet above.            The author
 infers, therefore, that when the river began to erode its channel the
 plateau was relatively lower than the tract to the south of the
 present course of the stream, but that by denudation the relations
 have been reversed, whilst the river has nevor left its originally
 selected course.
     The author compares the state of things with that which must
 have occurred in the case of the northerly rivers running from the
 centre of the Wealden axis ; but mentions that Prof. Safford and
 Mr. J. Leslie account for the Cumberland plateau by faulting, though
  he thinks that the well-defined escarpment along the valley of East
 Tennessee seems to show that this cause is insufficient.
     In conclusion, he believes that the denudation was accelerated
                                         "
  during the pluvial or " Champlain        period, and calls attention to

  to the deposit of red loam by which the surface of the country of the
  valleys of the Tennessee and Sequachee is overspread, and which is
  probably referable to a similar stage.

  The velocity of propagation t' is thus a function of two forces which
 are independent of each other — <j (gravity) and T (surface-tension).
  On the other hand, considered as a function of X, it has a minimum,
 namely 23"11 centim. for the wave-length X=l-709 centim. ; so
 that from this there results a natural division of waves into two
 classes — ripples and large waves.      Although observations on ripples
 have been made by Thomson, Matthieseu, Lord Kayleigh, Arendts,
 and others, these observations are wanting in the requisite accuracy,
 and accordingly the author has carred out systematic observations
 by various methods which control each other.            In the first method,
 tuning-forks were used to produce the waves ; in the second, the
 simultaneous vibration of the armatures of two electromagnets ;
 aid finally in the third, which was made on a large scale in the
 Rostock filtering-basins, small plates which were fixed to rods at
 the level of the water.        Stationary waves were always used, as
 these are more favourable for observation and for calculation.
 Reference must be made to the original for the observation of the
 numbers of vibrations and the wave-lengths in the individual cases,
and for the manner in which the numerous difficulties were over
 come.     As the results of the various methods are essentially the
same, it will be sufficient here to give a summary of that of the first.

that the experiment agrees sufficiently well with the theory

in which T0 is the expression within brackets of the first formula.
This latter value vanishes for X=28 centim. ; according to Thomson
the influence of surface-tension on this wave-length would still be
T0=0-1 centim., that is about ^ per cent. For an infinitely small X
T0
    = 0-070, which agrees sufficiently with the values ordinarily
assumed.        It may be observed that with other methods the num
ber of vibrations went down to 2-67 and the wave-lengths rose to
21-915, while the T0 sank to 0-0130, and that nevertheless the above
two formulae for i? agreed very well. The actual state of the case
lies between Kolacek's formula and that of Thomson for X= 1-672 :
for instance, according to Thomson n = 13-83 ; according to
Kolacek,      n=   12-33   ; experiment, n = 13-33.

      ON THE CONDENSATION OF AQUEOUS VAPOUR                   IN CAPILLARY
                SPACES.      BY    G. VAN DER MENSBRUGGHE.
      The author propounds the task of furnishing an exact experi
   mental proof of Thomson's theory, that the maximum pressure of
   aqueous vapour for a given temperature is smaller for a concave
   surface than for a plane one, and continually decreases with
  increasing concavity.        In the first part of the present research a
  number of facts are collected which serve as examples for the
  condensation of aqueous vapour in capillary spaces.              Meution is
  made of the microscopic capillary slits in organic hygroscopic
  structures, the deposition of ice-flowers on the dusty parts of our
  window-panes, the phenomenon that particles of iron rust most
  when they appear protected by materials, such as cloths, dry wood,
  and the like, which are in contact with them.
      In reference also to Aitken's experiments on the fog-producing
  action of suspended particles of dust, the author urges as the ex
  planation the irregular shape and the ultra-capillary cracks of the
  individual particles.      The author observes incidentally, that the
  rapid rotting of fabrics, such as tulle, which are often coated with
  aqueous vapour even in air which is far from its point of satura
  tion, may be explained by thermoelectric currents which are
 formed on moistening and on drying {Bull. Ac. Belg. [2] vol. xli.
 p. 769, 1876).       The durability of the clothing with which Egyptian
 mummies are wrapped depends on the filling of the capillary cracks
  with wax. The author strongly recommends that for the preser
 vation of oil-paintings they should be varnished on the back. — Bull.

              ON   ELECTRICAL CONVECTION.             BY A. RIGHI.
     In this note the author       describes new experiments, which taken
 in conjunction       with those he has previously published appear
 to him to establish : —
     That in all cases in which there is an escape of electricity either
 by a point, or by an incandescent body, or by a metal exposed to
ultra-violet radiations, the phenomenon is due to convection ; and
that the particles in movement follow sensibly the lines of force of
the field in which they move.               In more or less rarefied air the
trajectories     seem     to diverge       more  and more from the lines
of    force;  and    in  the  case   of   an  extreme   degree of rarefaction
they should    become    almost   rectilinear,  as appears to be the case with
the particles    of  radiant  matter    in  Crookes's tubes.
     The  author   proposes   to  make    experiments to see if this gradual

  ON  THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ACTION         OF ELECTROMAGNETIC        WAVES.
                       BY FRANZ VON DOBRZYNSKI.
    For several months      I have been engaged in investigating the
photographic action of electromagnetic waves.             On May 1      I
observed an indication of this action, and on July 9 the action
itself.
    The electromagnetic waves were obtained by the method of
Hertz. They acted on dry bromide of silver and gelatine ' Nys
                                                                         '
plates procured from Geissler in Bonn.
    The plane of the plates either included the axis of the vibrator or
was at right angles to it.        The exposure was three hours. No
sensitization of the plates was made.           The development and
fixation took place in the ordinary manner by ferric oxalate and
hyposulphite.
    The action was visible after development and fixation by the
appearance of alternating bright and dark bands across the direction
of vibration of the waves, or by the appearance of dark bands in
the direction of the vibration.      Both kinds of bands could occa
sionally be observed together.
    In many experiments the plates were covered with tinfoil.
Portions of the coating of the tinfoil were cut away. The tinfoil
did not prevent the formation of bands. This points to the fact
that the chemical action which here comes into play is not a
primary one.
   The cross bands suggested stationary vibrations.          They might
be due to reflexion from the sides of the wooden box, by which the
plates were protected from the influence of extraneous rays ; but
they might also owe their origin to reflexion from the side of the
room*.
    The only experiment which could be made with a reflecting
metal ball was not in disagreement with this view ; the cross
 bands were now more distinct and regular.
    If this view is correct, it may be concluded that waves of from
0-6 to 20 centim. are effective.
    The complete description of the mode of experimenting          I will
 defer until 1 communicate further investigations in this direction.
 —Wiener Berichte, October 9, 1890.
    * The
            plates often contained two systems of cross bands.     Theso
 would represent different waves which the vibrator emits in the sense of
 the discovery of Sarasin and De la Rive, and in that of the view stated
 above.

  QUANTITATIVE PHOTOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION               OF   ELECTRICAL
                     OSCILLATIONS.     BY J. MIESLER.
      The object of the present research is to show the agreempnt
  between the times of oscillation of the Leyden Jar as found pho
  tographically, with the times calculated from the measured capa
  cities and the coefficient of self-induction of the jars and the
  circuit ; there being as yet no long comparative series of numbers.
  The photographs were taken by means of a rotating plane mirror
 and an object-glass. The times of rotation were then deduced from
  the dimensions of the photographs.
     The coefficient of self-induction of the wire used in each case
 was determined by a null method by comparison with a condenser
 divided into thousandths of a microfarad.         The capacities of the
 Leyden jars    used  in the separate observations  were compared with
 this condenser by means of an electrometer.         The time of vibra
 tion was determined from these two last series of data by means
 of the formula
                                T^VCX,
 and compared with those deduced from the photographs, and it
 was found that there was a very close agreement.          The thickness
 of the wires was always 0-8 mm., so that the above formula holds
 strictly for thin wires.— Wiener Berichte, July 1890 ; Beiblatter

 ON THE SMALLEST        PERCEPTIBLE VISUAL ANGLE IN THE VARIOUS
             PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM.        BY W. UHTHOFF.
     A spectrum more than 20 cm. in length was projected from
 zirconium light, through a large prism filled with cinnamic ether,
and corresponding lenses, from which in seven places a portion
3 mm. in diameter could be cut off by a sliding metal screen.         If
the eye looked through the aperture of this screen, it saw the
nearest face of the prism illuminated by the corresponding homo
geneous colour.      A wire grating could be moved backwards and
forwards in the path of the rays. The wires were at a distance in
the mean of 0*0926 mm. apart, and the intervals were exactly
equal to the thickness of the wire. From the distance from the
eye at which the grating had to be placed, so that the wires were
just invisible, the sharpness of vision could be deduced for the
various colours.     This was almost the same for all colours ; in the
case of the author the smallest visual angle under which the eye
could distinguish the object (the breadth of a wire and the space
taken together) was 55*2, and for A. Ktinig 65-6 seconds, from
which it is inferred that the diameter of the elements in the retina
concerned in this is 0-002 to 0-004 mm. — Zeitsclirift fur Psychol,

  IX.  The Elementary Treatment of Problems on the Diffrac
         tion of Light. By Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.*
           complete  investigation of problems relating to the
THEdiffraction      of light involves the discussion of certain
definite integrals which often cannot be introduced at the
stage at which students begin to learn the important subject
of Physical Optics. Most of our text-books give therefore
a more elementary treatment of the question in which the
wave-front is broken up into elements or zones, the effects of
which are added up algebraically.       This elementary treatment
suffers from a very serious defect, if anything more than a very
general explanation is aimed at, for the considerable difference
of phase in the resultant effect of the first and subsequent
elements is altogether neglected.      Prof. Mascart, in his excel
lent book on Optics, obtains        numerical   results from such
elementary considerations ; but he takes without justification
the phase of the central element to be the same as that of the
others, and his treatment is therefore open to the objection
which   I  have indicated.   It is true that the intensities of the
diffraction-bands at the edge of shadows, as calculated in
the elementary way, do not differ much from those ob
tained by a more rigorous analysis ; but the position of the
bands is not correctly given, and the question of the resultant
phase is altogether left out of account.       Even to those who
can follow the complete investigation by means of Fresnel's
integrals, the method of breaking up the wave-front into

78            Mr. A. Schuster on tlie Elementary Treatment
separate parts is very instructive ; and   hope therefore that  I
the following way of treating the subject, which seems to me
to be free from objection, and gives numerical results practi
cally identical with those obtained by Fresnel, will be found
to be of use.
   For the sake of subsequent reference it is necessary to say
a few words on the division of a wave-front into circular
zones.        I
            shall only consider plane waves, but the results
may easily be extended to other cases.
   In order to calculate the amplitude produced at a point P
by a plane wave-front at a distance p from    circles are drawn         it,
such that their distance from                  P     is
                                                      p   +             n being an integer.
The plane      thus divided into so-called Huyghens zones,
                    is
the areas of which are equal as long as n\          small com                      is
pared  to p.   The  effect of    single zone  can
                                              a    be  obtained
by subdividing    into  narrower
                          it      rings of equal areas, when                                  it
will be found that the phase of vibration at       due to such                 P
elementary rings will vary uniformly over two right angles.
The phase of the resultant vibration will therefore be halfway
between that due to the extreme portions, and the amplitude
is obtained by reducing, in the ratio of ir       the amplitude         :     2,
calculated on the assumption that the phase due to each part
of the zone      the same (Lord Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. xlvii.
                     is
1874).    This     true also for the first circular area.
                         is                                  The
effect of two successive zones    therefore strictly opposite in
                                                is
direction, and we can calculate the whole effect by means of
    series

The sum of this series,              as   may bo shown,         is                 and the phase
of the resultant vibration will be one right angle behind tliat

is equal to p\, the effect of the first zone, as regards ampli
tude, will bo 2>cp\, and the whole wave-front will cause an
amplitude equal to half this value, which must obviously be
equal to unity, because a plane wave does not alter in am
plitude during its propagation.       It follows that x=l/p\;
and hence that       be    small surface at
                          if   s     a         distance  from       a                   p     a

 central  strip;   so that  PM1= p+}x.          This division differs
 from that usually adopted, and herein consists the great
 advantage of the method of reduction which         I propose.

  the resultant vibration    due to the elementary strips is that

elements down to the first, it must also be true for the first,
because the whole resultant shows a difference of phase cor
responding to that distance.    In the usual way of treating
the subject, PM^ is taken to be                     PO +    5   ;   the result being that
 the first element produces a phase differing considerably from
 that of the succeeding ones : by reducing the width of the
first strip we make the difference of phase nearly equal to that
of the others.
   The following Table shows the phases of the vibration at P
due to successive strips, as calculated by means of Fresnel's
integral, both for the case in which the old division is taken
and the one here suggested.

the division which     suggest, all phases are nearly equal.

second strip shows the greatest difference of phase, but as the
cosine of 7° differs by less than one per cent, from unity the
results of the calculation will be sufficiently accurate.
   We shall apply this new division into strips to calculate
the position and intensity of diffraction-fringes at the edge of
shadows cast by straight boundaries.       It will be necessary in
the first place to calculate the amplitude produced           each                    by
strip separately.     Assuming, as before, that the phase of

    The total effect of all the strips on one side of   0  after the
first will therefore be

The expression in       square brackets converges towards the
limit -5420,     and  hence the effect of a wave of indefinite
extent from M, outwards will be •5420/^=' 1725.
    From this we may calculate the effect of the first strip OM^
for each half of the wave-front on either side of 0 must produce
an amplitude of one half.      As the effect of the second strip
counteracts that of the first, the latter must cause an am
plitude at P, which is numerically represented by "6725,
the amplitude of vibration in the original wave being taken
as unity.     It is now easy to calculate the amplitude of suc
cessive diffraction-bands (fig. 3).     P represents the point at
                                Fig. 3.

removed     further away from 0 it would expose parts of the
wave-front differing in distance by more than half a wave
 length from the latter value, and diminishing therefore the
total intensity.      According to the strict calculation, the
 resultant of OA shows a difference of phase slightly less than
that given here, and therefore the first maximum will be
reached when the 0 is a little nearer to A, but the difference
is negligible.

    The elementary method which has been described gives
 therefore results which for an approximate method are of
 surprising accuracy, if it is considered that no integration
 has been made use of beyond that implied in the statement                    /
 that if a large number n of vibrations of equal amplitudes
 and phases uniformly distributed through two right angles are
added up together, the amplitude of the resultant is 2najir.
    The more general proposition, that if a number of vibra
 tions of equal amplitude have phases uniformly distributed
through an angle 26, the resultant is obtained by reducing
 in the ratio of sin 6 : 9 the value calculated on the supposition
 that they have all the same phase, has many important applica
tions in the theory of diffraction.         Several pages are generally
devoted to the calculation of the position and intensity of
diffraction-fringes produced by a slit on a screen at a great
distance.     The results obtained may be written down at once
from the above proposition, which may be deduced with the
help of a series; so that a satisfactory account of the position
and intensity of diffraction-bands can be obtained without the
help of the integral calculus.

    The last term has been taken as positive for the sake of
simplicity.      It occurs in (4) of course with its proper sign.
    If the series is such that the numerical value of each term
is less than the arithmetical mean of the two terms between
 which it lies, the same conclusion follows in the same way.
    If in the first p terms of the series each term has a greater
value, and in the remaining part a smaller value than the
arithmetical mean of the preceding and following term, we
may break up the series into two, and obtain the sum
                            2-2"1"         2   "t"2*
    It is thus  clear that the expressions (4) will be the correct sum
 mation only, if the series can be broken up into a small number
 of separate series for each of which the value of a term is
 either smaller or greater than the arithmetical mean of the
terms between which it stands, so that the sum of all such
values as mp — mp+i may be neglected.            In other words, if the
 absolute values of the terms are plotted as ordinates to equi
 distant abscissae, the curve must be either wholly convex or
 wholly concave, or the number of times the curve changes
 from concavity to convexity must be negligible compared to
 the whole number of terms in the series.
    A few remarks are suggested by historical considerations.
 I do not know who first made use of the term " Huyghens
 zones," but the expression does not seem to me to be
 altogether appropriate.         Huyghens no doubt first divided a
 wave-front into parts, and considered the effect of the whole
 wave to be the same as that of the sum of its parts ; but the
                                  "                    " lies not in the
 importance of the so-called        Huyghens zone
 possibility of division but in the particular manner of dividing
 into elements, by means of radii vectors differing by half a
 wave-length.        This, as far as   I know, is exclusively due to
 Fresuel, who by its means was enabled to draw important

  86             Problems on   the Diffraction of Light.
  conclusions in a very simple manner.        I  think, therefore, that
  the expression Fresnel zones or Fresnel strips would be more
  appropriate.
     Fresnel himself did not fall into the pitfall which is pointed
  out in this paper.     All his statements are well guarded and
  correct. Lame, in his Text-Book on Physics (1840), con
 siderably extended Fresnel's reasoning, and drew further
  conclusions from the division of a plane wave into strips, but
 he also avoided the algebraic addition of the effects of different
  strips which have not the same phase.
     Verdet was less careful, and through the following passage
  (Legons d'Optique physique, vol. i. p. 181) is responsible for
 the idea that the successive strips divided in Fresnel's manner
 give riso to vibrations of opposite phases irrespective of their
 distance from the central point : —
     " II est facile de voir que deux arcs elementaires eonsecutifs
 envoient au point P des vitesses de signes contraires ; car a
 chaque point pris sur l'un de ces arcs correspond nn point
 situe sur l'arc precedent et dont la distance au point P est
 inferieure d'uno demi longueur d'ondulation k celle du
 premier point au meme point P, d'ou il resulte que ces deux
 points envoient a P des vitesses de signes contraires."
     The reasoning here is obviously wrong.              Consider two
 successive elements sending vibrations to P which range in
phase from 0 to w and from tr to 2w respectively.              It does
not follow that the resultant of one element should have a
phase opposite to that of the other element, quite irrespective
of the law of distribution of the individual vibrations sent out
from different parts of each element.           If the vibrations are
evenly distributed,      Verdet's  conclusions    would be justified,
but the radius vector having a minimum length at the central
spot, alters very little near that point.       The vibrations from
the first element combine at the point P therefore to a
resultant having a difference of phase considerably smaller
than that calculated from the supposition of an uniform
distribution.
    I  cannot help thinking that writers on Physical Optics
have followed too blindty the footsteps of Verdet, whose argu
ments do not seem to me to be always so conclusive as they
are commonly supposed to be.
    1 have avoided in this paper speaking of a
                                                      " linear wave,"
as   I believe more harm is done by the introduction of such
an idea than can be counterbalanced by the slight simplifica
tion of expression.      Students who are taught to live only in
a two-dimensional space will not be able to make much use of
their science in after life.

                              [Plate IV.]
      has long been known that the resolving power of lenses,
IT    however perfect, is limited, and more particularly that
the capability of separating close distant objects, e. g. double
stars, is proportional to aperture.       The ground of the limita
tion lies in the finite magnitude of the wave-length of light
(X), and the consequent diffusion of illumination round the
geometrical image of even an infinitely small radiant point.
It is easy to understand the rationale of this process without
entering upon any calculations. At the focal point itself a'l
the vibrations proceeding from various parts of the aperture
arrive in the same phase.       The illumination is therefore here
a maximum.       But why is it less at neighbouring points in
the focal plane which are all equally exposed to the vibrations
from the aperhire ? The answer can only be that at such
points the vibrations are discrepant.          This discrepance can
only enter by degrees ; so that there must be a small region
round the focus at any point of which the phases are practi
cally in agreement, and the illumination sensibly equal to the
maximum.
    These considerations serve also to fix at least the order of
magnitude of the patch of light.           The discrepancy of phase
is the result of the different distances of the various parts of
the aperture from the eccentric point in question ; and the
greatest discrepancy is that between the waves which come
from the nearest and furthest parts of the aperture. A simple
calculation shows that the greatest difference of distance is
 expressed by 2rx/f, where 2r is the diameter of the aperture,
f  the ibcal length, and x the linear eccentricity of the point
under consideration.       The question under discussion is at
what stage does this difference of path introduce an important
discrepancy of phase ? It is easy to recognize that the illu-
minatioa will not be greatly reduced until the extreme discre
pancy of phase reaches half a wave-length.           In this case
                             2x=f\\2r,
which may be considered to give roughly the diameter of the
patch of light.    If there are two radiant points, the two repre
 sentative patches will seriously overlap, unless the distance of
 their centres exceed 2x.       Supposing it to be equal to 2x,
 which corresponds to an angular interval 2x/f, we see that
                     *  Communicated   by the Author.

  88            Lord Rayleigh on Pin-hole Photography.
  the double radiant cannot be resolved in the image, unless the
  angular interval exceed \/2r.
     Experiment* shows that the value thus roughly estimated
  is very near the truth for a rectangular aperture of width 2>\
  If   the aperture be of circular form, the resolving power is
  somewhat less, in the ratio of about 1*1 : 1.
      It is therefore not going too far to say that there is nothing
  better established in optics than the limit to resolving power
  as proportional to aperture.          On the other hand, the focal
  length   is a matter  of indifference,   if the object-glass be perfect.
      This is one side of the question before us.        We now pass on
  to another, in which the focal length becomes of paramount
  importance.
      " The function of a lens in
                                         forming an image is to com
  pensate by      its variable   thickness     the differences in phase
  which would otherwise exist between secondary waves arri
  ving at the focal point from various parts of tbe aperture. If
  we suppose the diameter of the lens (2r) to be given, and its
  focal length (/) gradually to increase, these differences of
  pbase at tbe image of an infinitely distant luminous point
  diminish without limit. When /attains a certain value, say/!,
  the extreme error of phase to be compensated falls to $\.
              I
  Now, as have shown on a previous occasion |, an extreme
  error of phase amounting to               or less, produces no appre
  ciable deterioration in the definition ; so that from this point
  onwards the lens is useless, as only improving an image already
  sensibly as perfect as the aperture admits of. Throughout
  the operation of increasing the focal length, the resolving
  power of the instrument, which depends only upon the aper
  ture, remains unchanged; and we thus arrive at the rather
  startling conclusion that a telescope of any degree of resolving
  power might be constructed without an object-glass, if onlv
, there were no limit to the admissible focal length. This last
  proviso, however, as we shall see, takes away almost all
  practical importance from the proposition.
      " To get an idea of the magnitudes of the quantities involved,
  let us take the case of an aperture of £ inch, about that of
  the pupil of the eye.      The distance f1} which the actual focal
  length must exceed, is given by

The image of the sun thrown on a screen at a distance
exceeding 66 feet, through a hole £ inch in diameter, is
therefore at least as well defined as that seen direct.      In
practice it would be better defined, as the direct image is far
from perfect. If the image on the screen be regarded from a
distance fx, it will appear of its natural angular magnitude.
Seen from a distance less than A, it will appear magnified.
Inasmuch as the arrangement affords a view of the sun with
full definition [corresponding to aperture] and with an in
creased apparent magnitude, the name of a telescope can
hardly be denied to it.
   " As the minimum focal length increases with the
                                                         square

required to rival the resolving power of a modern telescope.

   A more practical application of these principles is to be
found in landscape photography, where a high degree of
definition is often unnecessary, and where a feeble illumina
tion can be compensated by length of exposure.      In a recent
communication to the British Association f it was pointed out
that a suitable aperture is given by the relation

invoked.       If, on the other hand, the aperture be large, the
lens becomes indispensable.              The size of the aperture should
accordingly      be  increased     up  to  the point at which the lens is
sensibly missed; and this, as we have seen, will occur in the
neighbourhood of the value determined by (1). A more pre
cise calculation can be made only upon the basis of a detailed
knowledge of the distribution of light in the image.
   The question of the best size of aperture for a pin-hole
camera was first considered by Petzval*.                His theory, though
it can hardly be regarded as sound, brings out the failure of
definition when the aperture is either too large or too small,
and, as is very remarkable, gives (1) as the best relation
between r,f, and X.            The argument is as follows : —        If the
hole be very small, the diameter of the patch of light repre
sentative of a luminous point is given by
                                   D=A/r,
the measurement         being made up to the first blackness in the
                             " This formula is
diffraction-pattern.                                 only an approximate
one, applicable when r is very small ; in the case of a larger
aperture, its diameter must be added to the value above given,
that is to say,
                                D=2r+/X/r.
From the last formula we can at once deduce the best value
for r ; in other words, the size of the aperture which corre
sponds to the least possible value of D, and therefore to the
sharpest possible image.             In fact, differentiating the last
expression,     and   setting   in the  ordinary manner, dD/dr = 0, we
find at once
which corresponds to
                               D = 2^(2A)."
The assumption that intermediate cases can be represented by
mere addition of the terms appropriate in the extreme cases
of very large and very small apertures appears to be inad
missible.
   The complete determination of the image of a radiant point
as given by a small aperture is a problem in diffraction, solved
only within the last years by Lommelf.                     In view of the

that it would be interesting to adapt Lommel's results to the

it may be well to state the results somewhat fully.
   In the following formulae a is the distance from the radiant
point to the aperture, b from the aperture to the screen upon
which the image is formed. The circumstances being sym
metrical about a line through the radiant point and the centre
of the circular aperture (radius r), the illumination P will be
the same at all points of the screen equally distant    from the                          f

                            as given, each of these Tables affords
a knowledge of the distribution of illumination as a function
of £ for a certain radius of aperture by means of the two
equations (24).     In each case f is proportional to z ; but in
comparing one case with another we have to bear in mind
that the ratio of £ to z varies.   As our object is to compare
the distributions of illumination when the aperture varies,
we must treat      and not
                       2J,     as the abscissa in our diagrams.
                                              z,
Another question arises as to how the scale of the ordinate                        I2
should be dealt with in the various cases. If we take (23) as
it   stands we shall have curves corresponding to the same
actual intensity of the radiant point. For some purposes this
might be desirable       but in the application to photography
                               ;
the deficiency of illumination when the aperture              much        is
 reduced would always be compensated by increased exposure.
 It will be more practical to vary the scale of ordinates from
 that prescribed in (23), so as to render the illumination cor
 responding to an extended source of light, such as the sky,
 the same in all cases.    We shall effect this by removing from
 the right-hand member of (23)           factor proportional to the
                                                     a
  area of aperture, proportional    that      to    or y.       r2,

  any value of equal to stt, we shall require to plot as ordi
                      y
 nate, not M2 simply, but sM2, and as abscissa, not         simply,       z
  but z/*/s.   The following are at once deduced from Lommel's

 The various curves, or rather the halves of them, are plotted
 in Plate IV., and exhibit to the eye the distribution of light in
 the images corresponding to the different apertures.           It is at
 once evident    that  y=-\ir   is too   small, and  thaty=37ris too
 great. The only question that can arise is between y = ir and
 y=2ir. The latter has decidedly the higher resolving power,
 but the advantage is to some extent paid for in the greater
 diffusion of light outside the image proper. In estimating
 this we must remember that the amount of light is represented,
 not by the areas of the various parts of the diagrams, but by
 the volumes of the solids formed by the revolution of the
 curves round the axis of P.         In virtue of tho method of con
 struction the total volume is the same in all cases. The best
 aperture will thus depend in some degree upon the subject to
 be represented; but there is every reason to think that in
general y= 2ir will prove more advantageous tban y = ir. It
will be convenient to recall that

The curve y=ir thus corresponds to (1) ; and we conclude

This may be regarded          as   defining the maximum separating
power as a function of       \ and /.
    Passing on from the theoretical discussion,               I   will now
describe    certain laboratory observations upon the defining
power of various apertures.         A succession of such, of gradually
increasing magnitude, were perforated in a piece of thin
sheet zinc, and were measured under the microscope.                       The
diameters,   in  fractions   of  an  inch,  are as follows  : — m
      (1)          (2)        (3)          (4)        (5)           (6)
     •0210,     -0240,      -0262,       -0290,      -0326,     -0366.
 The objects, whose images were examined, are (1) a grating
 cut out of sheet zinc, and (2) a pair of equal round noles a
quarter of an inch apart.          The period of the grating is also a
quarter inch,    and   the transparent and opaque parts are equally
 wide. Behind the grating, or double hole, was placed a
 paraffin lamp and a large condensing lens.                The distance a
between the objects and the apertures under test was about
 18 feet.                        1
    The   best image with a given aperture is obtained                     by
 bringing the eye immediately behind, without the use of a
 focusing lens.      But the image formed at a sufficient distance
 beyond,   and   examined      with a focusing glass of low power,
 is nearly as good.          Thus at a sufficient distance (6) the

98            Lord Rayleigh on Pin-hole Photography.
largest aperture gives the best image, but at a given distance
behind the case is otherwise. For example, when the image
was formed at 8 inches distance, (2) and (3) were about equal
as respects the double hole, while (1) was decidedly inferior,
 and that not apparently from want of light.               In the case of
 the grating (3) had perhaps the advantage over (2).
    A photograph of the double hole was now taken under the
 same circumstances with an exposure of 80 minutes.                  Aper
 ture (2) was here decidedly           better    than   (3), and  (1) was
 almost as good as (2).         The (negative) image formed by (5)
 exhibited a pair of white spots near the centre of a patch of
 black, corresponding to the state of things indicated in the
 curve y=4ir.          The difference between the photograph and
 the result obtained by eye observation is readily explained by
 the smaller effective wave-length in the former case.
     The difference just spoken of is intensified when the light
 is white. In one experiment upon cloud-light a = 21 feet,
 6=10 inches.           In the resulting photograph, obtained upon
 an Ilford plate with an exposure of 30 minutes, the image
 from (2) was decidedly the best.
     We may utilize the last result to calculate the relation be
 tween aperture and focus most suitable for out of door photo
 graphy.      We have
                            = 10-5 x 5*99 inches=10-4 x T52 centim.
 Thus, if a =      <x>,  as  may usually be supposed in landscape-
 photography,       the   most favourable diameter of aperture is
 given by
           (2r)8//= 10-5 x 6-0 inches = 10-4 x 1'5 centim.,
 the first number being employed if r and             f  are measured in
 inches, and the latter when the measures are in centimetres *.
 If/=12 inches, 2r=-027 inch.                 If  /=7x 12 = 84 inches,
 2r=-071 inch.
     The experimental determination of the best value of y
 is more easily effected by eye observations. In order to
  render the wave-length more definite an orange-red glass was
  employed.                             J
                 With <t=18 feet, = 8 inches, the image formed
 by aperture (3) was judged to be decidedly the best, (2) was

the mean X there effective.           We have

•07 inch and a focal length of 7 feet.            The aperture was per
forated in sheet zinc, and was placed in the shutter of a room
otherwise completely darkened. The subject was a group of
cedars, and, being somewhat dark in the shadows, required an
exposure of about an hour and a half, even in sunshine. The
resulting 12 x 10-inch photographs fully bear out expectations.
To appear in natural magnitude the pictures would of course
need to be held at 7 feet distance from the eye ; but even at
3 or 4 feet the apparent definition is sufficient.          1 have also
taken panoramic pictures with an aperture of -027 inch and
a focal distance of 12 inches ; but in this case there is nothing
that could not equally well be done with an ordinary portable
camera.

XL     The Prohlem      of  the    Behaviour     of the Magnetic Field about

WHEN        field  (the earth being regarded as a magnet) revolve

    With the view to test this question                  of the behaviour of
the magnetic field about a revolving magnet,                    I have proposed
(communicated in an unpublished letter) the following ex
periment whereby some phenomena are in question which
(without probably involving any novelty in point of theory)
might seem to merit a passing notice.                   I  will briefly indicate
this here.

magnet     be rotated   about     its vertical   axis   below    the circular flat
plate or disk (of metal) p, seen edgeways in the diagram.
    Then under hypothesis (1), that the magnetic field remains
stationary or fixed while the magnet revolves (as Faraday
thoughtf he had proved) , the magnet will revolve through it*
own field, and therefore become charged up at its poles and
equatorial part by electricity of opposite sign, dependent on
the direction of rotation, as fig. 1 indicates.                   This magnetic
field (as it does not rotate) cannot electrodynamically influence

             Magnetic Field about a Revolving Magnet.                  101
charged negatively below and positively above in the present
case (fig. 1).      It remains, then, to investigate the nature of
this charge in order to prove which hypothesis is true — i. e.
in order to show whether the magnetic field rotates with the
magnet or does not do so.
    For it will be perceived that under hypothesis (2), when
the magnetic field {per contra) is assumed to revolve with the
magnet, the field will cut through or intersect the disk p
 (fig. 2) as the magnet revolves ; and so the disk will, accord
ing to known principles, be charged through electrodynamic*
induction with electricity of opposite sign at its centre and
periphery respectively, as fig. 2 shows.
    But it will be observed that the decomposition of the elec
tricity in the disk takes place under hypothesis (2) in a
direction at right angles to that which occurs under hypo
thesis (1).      So that it will be evident that we have a physical
test between the two opposite hypotheses here.                 Under hy
pothesis (1), namely, the disk is polarized by electros£a</c
induction in the direction of its thickness ; and under hypo
thesis (2) the disk is polarized by electro<fyna/m'c induction
in a direction at right angles to the former, viz. transversely,'
or along all its radii, as fig. 2 indicates. These diverse phy
sical effects then, as it appears, are capable of constituting a
test to decide between the two rival hypotheses.
          I
     But am informed by Prof. H. Hertz, of Bonn, to whom
 I  had communicated the above by letter, that with a normally
 sensitive electrometer a considerable velocity of rotation with
 a magnet of large size would be calculably required in order
to produce a distinct deflexion under either hypothesis : and
 facts of this kind discourage from trying the experiment.
     I would therefore venture to ask — in order to facilitate tho
 experiment — whether with the aid of Mr. Vernon Boys's
 discoveries, or those of others, it is not possible to bring
 the electrometer to a much higher degree of sensitiveness ?
 Prof. Hertz lays stress on the great interest attaching to tho
 inquiry, and agrees that the conditions of test as above pro
 posed should t be capable of deciding this question, — presup-
    • This charge will react electrostatically on the magnet, to produce a
 feeble (secondary) charge there, which need not be taken into account,
 as it does not affect our experiment.
    t It may be, of course, that the magnetic field partly partakes of the
 motion of the revolving magnet, or that something between the two
 hypotheses is true.    Then a modified distribution of charge on the disk
 would obviously present itself, consistent with such conditions.  In other
 words, if neither vertical nor horizontal polarization of the disk were
 found to be precise (but a superposition of the one upon the other), then
 this would obviously indicate that the field partly shared the rotation of
 the magnet, so that both magnet and disk were intersected by the field.

102                         Mr.   J.   Swinburne on
posing of course sufficient instrumental means.       It seems
therefore that a specially sensitive electrometer would be
doubly effective here, as eliminating the shock and concussion
inevitably attendant on a high velocity and a large magnet,
which tend to conceal delicate observations.

 XII.    Alternate Current-Condensers.                    By   J.   Swinburne *.
                    condensers         have      been     proposed      for   various
THOUGH
   methods      of distribution of electrical power, schemes
involving the use of them have never developed enough for
alternating current-condensers to be made commercially.              It
is generally assumed that there is no difficulty in making
them ; all that is needed is to separate a number of thin plates
by means of sheets of insulating material.
   The first difficulty is insulation.     If a condenser is to take
2000 effective   volts,  the  insulation  must   be very good.     Too
great thickness of dielectric cannot be allowed, as that would
lessen the capacity, and increase the cost of material.           The
surface of such a condenser for, say, ten amperes is about a
thousand square feet, and the problem of making a thousand
square feet of thin insulating material that will safely stand
2000 volts is not easy.       I have made samples which, though
only a little over a tenth of a millimetre thick, would stand
8000 effective volts for some time before breaking down.
When made up into a large condenser, two or three thousand
volts would generally break it down in a few hours.
   Insulation is not by any means the only difficulty, however ;
there is another, which is probably intimately connected with
it, and that   isabsorption of electric power in the dielectric,
and consequent heating.            It  well known that Leyden jars
                                            is
get hot  if charged and discharged frequently            and also that
                                                                    ;
the phenomenon of electric absorption                     is
                                                 manifested.    When
there   isabsorption,   the   current  out  of the  condenser      not        is
proportional to    the    rate  of  decrease   of  the  electromotive
force, and probably the current into              not proportional to
                                                     it   is
the rate of increase.       This means that the condenser absorbs
energy  and   converts      into heat.
                           it
   Such questions    have    been frequently studied in connexion
with curves of sines,      but    iteasier to show the truth of this
                                       is
generally.    Let    Cbe the current,       the electromotive force,

If   e is the maximum electromotive force, the work done in
charging the condenser is thus
                                 EdE  = £K*2,
the ordinary expression.        On discharging, the work absorbed
is
                         'i *°E<ZE   or   -|Ke2.
It is equally easy to show that no power is absorbed in the
case of an induction-coil with no hysteresis, without assuming
the pressure to vary harmonically.
    If   G does not vary as the rate of increase or decrease of E,
but is greater on charging and less on discharging, power is
 absorbed.      A hysteresis curve, like those we are accustomed
 to in iron, can be plotted in the case of a condenser.       It has
 no very close analogy with the case of iron, however.
     At first it might seem that absorption might be neglected
 as too trifling to matter in commercial work.        This, however,
 is not the ease.    Some condensers about a foot square and an
 inch thick absorbed over half a horse-power, and soon rose
above the temperature of boiling water.
     According to Maxwell's theory, the absorption of power is
just as easily explained as the time-lag in discharge. Suppose
 the dielectric is paper soaked in melted paraffin, and suppose
 the fibres of paper do not insulate and that the paraffin does.
 When the plates are charged, a fibre running part of the way
 across the dielectric finds its ends at different potentials ; so
 a current is set up to equalize them.       This current means loss
 of power by heat. It also increases the capacity of the con
  denser.    An increase of the capacity of the condenser when
  the pressure is increasing, or after it is applied, means in
  creased energy put into the condenser.          If the capacity of
  the   condenser  were    constant, the current into it would be
  proportional to the rate of increase of the electromotive force,
  and no power would be absorbed in a period ; but if the
  capacity is increased as the pressure rises and decreased as it

 104                     Mr.  J. Swinburne on
 falls, there is an extra current produced which is not propor
 tional to the rate of increase of the electromotive force, and
 this supplies the loss in the condenser.       The condenser may
still show perfect insulation under a direct pressure.       Accord
 ing to this theory, absorption is necessarily accompanied by
an increase of capacity.       This is important in connexion with
the electromagnetic theory of light.              Absorption would
always increase the apparent capacity of a condenser, so that
determinations of specific inductive capacity of absorptive
 dielectrics would come out too high. The dielectrics which
 come out too high, such as glass, are just those which heat
most.      The energy absorbed in a given dielectric would be a
 function of the frequency and the resistance of the conducting
parts.     It is thus possible that a dielectric might be opaque
to light, and diathermanous if the resistance is comparatively
low, or transparent to light, but not to dark heat if it is some
what higher.       Similarly a Leyden jar, which absorbs power
when connected to an alternating dynamo, may lose little of
its energy internally when discharged oscillatorily bv a spark.
The case of a fibrous imperfect insulator embedded in a
perfect insulator is not susceptible of mathematical treat
 ment and was not token by Maxwell.               Mica is perhaps a
 better example.      It is a good insulator, but gets very hot.
 If  a thin plate is put between two sheets of tinfoil, heating
 soon shows.     Here we have tinfoil, then a stratum of air, then
 mica, which is itself stratified, then air, then tinfoil again.
The static attraction presses the foil close against the mica,
 still there is air. Unless the mica is very thick, the fall of
 potential between the plates is so rapid that the air breaks
 down and there is a disruptive discharge between the foil and
the mica.      This actually occurs ; there appears to be a lumi
 nous layer of minute blue sparks under the foils, and there is
a strong smell of ozone.        The discharge under the foils, which
is rendered visible by the transparency of the mica, must not
be confused with the brush-discharge round the edges of the
 foil, which differs in appearance.      There is considerable heat
ing even when the foil is affixed with paraffin-wax so that
there is no air.
    Of course mica, being stratified, may consist of alternate
 sheets of some imperfect conductor and an insulator.            It is
 more difficult to find a reason why glass should heat.            At
 high temperatures     it is an  electrolyte, and  it has no  definite
 solidifying-point, so it may be partially electrolytic at ordi
 nary temperatures.         Such an explanation can hardly be
 applied to such a substance as celluloid.        This is a very per
 fect insulator, at least till it breaks down disruptively, and it

                   Alternate Current- Condensers.               105
seems to be homogeneous,      and is not hygroscopic, yet  it heats
considerably.
    For commercial condensers the choice of insulating material
is limited.     Most work has been done on condensers with paper
and hydrocarbon insulation.       It is difficult to know whether
a fault lies in the paper or in the hydrocarbon.       The paper is
baked at a high temperature, and all temperatures and times
of baking have been tried. Paper goes on giving off water
till there is nothing but a charred brittle mass left. Many
hydrocarbons contain enough water to prevent, for instance,
their dissolving rubber. Phosphoric anhydride was used to
dry several samples, but seemed to do little good, in fact the
crude hydrocarbon was often better.          Papers vary astonish
 ingly in their behaviour. Mr. Bourne, who has been working
at these things for some months, has tried almost every con
 ceivable way of making condensers.        We are just beginning
to succeed, but    it is more by chance  than  anything else. We
 see no reason why one particular kind of paper and one
 particular kind of hydrocarbon should be better than the
 others.
     Want of homogeneity in the dielectric of a condenser, or
 of any cable, may lead to disruptive discharges, or break
 downs. For instance, if a dielectric is made up of portions
 with inductive capacities of 3 and 1 respectively, the parts
 with a high inductive capacity may arrange themselves so
            "                       "
 that the electric displacement in the other is so great that
 a disruptive disehnrge ensues.      For instance, if two conduct
 ing plates are 3 millim. apart in air, with enough pressure to
 spark over 2 millim., and if a 2-millim. slab of a dielectric
 with a specific inductive capacity of 3 is put in, the fall of
  potential over the air is nearly doubled, and it breaks down
 and starts a short circuit.
     Loss of power in dielectrics is not confined to condensers ;
  it may be very serious in cables.      A condenser that heated
  excessively was made like   the Deptford mains.     The dielectric
  was very much thinner in proportion to the pressure, and
  allowing the loss per cubic centimetre to vary as the square
  of the pressure on its sides, a Deptford main would have a
  loss of, very roughly, 7000 watts in the dielectric.       It does
  not follow that this is the exact loss in a Deptford main.
  Very small differences in the constitution of the dielectric
  cause large variations in the power wasted.         The loss may
  therefore be very much greaier or very much less.           Taking
  the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric as 2, a seven-
  mile main has a capacity of 2 microfarads.           Wi h 10,000
   volts at a frequency of 80, this takes 10 amperes and 100,000

 106                     Mr.     J.   Swinburne on
 " apparent "  watts  ;   7000 watts is onlv a small percentage            of
 this.
    Another unexpected effect has occurred at Deptford. There
 is an extraordinary rise of pressure.            Xo authoritatively accu
 rate accounts have been published, so it is difficult to say what
 has happened ; but it is said that when the mains are put on
 the pressure rises.     This is generally explained by saying the
 mains have capacity, and there is self-induction in the circuit,
 and the capacity and self-induction have a period which cor
 responds with the frequency of the dynamo, so that the
 system sympathises, or acts as a sort of electric resonator,
 thus giving abnormally high pressure.                A little consideration
 will show that this theory is untenable. With such a capacity
 as that of the Deptford cables the self-induction would have
 to be enormous.
    Let the capacity of the cable be K, and the self-induction
 of the circuit L, in farads and henries or quadrants. Call E
 and C the electromotive force and current respectively. Then

    When a charged condenser is short-circuited through a
circuit with self-induction only, oscillation is produced, the
current and pressure both varying harmonically with a fre
quency of l/2ir V KL.
    In the Deptford case, with a capacity of two microfarads
and a period of 0*0125, the self-induction needed would be half
a henry.      A choking coil with such a coefficient of self-induc
tion wound to carry 250 amperes, which,           I  understand, is the
load   of  one  main,  would   take  64,000  volts  to get the current
through.       A transformer only acts on the circuit as a choking
 coil to the small extent due to the waste induction in it. If
 built on the lines of commercial transformers, this one would
have to be large enough to give an output of hundreds of
 millions of watts to produce a resonator effect.          Moreover, a
 slight alteration in the speed of the dynamo would throw it
 " out of tune " with the resonator, so that the effect would
 disappear.      For instance, a 5 per cent, variation of speed
 would    alter the  pitch of the dynamo nearly a semitone.
    It has been stated that there is a difference of apparent
 ratio in the Deptford transformer when the main is in circuit ;
 that is to say, that though it generally transforms 4 to 1,
 when the main is on it tranforms about 4i or 5 to 1.                  I
 would suggest this is impossible.         There is always a " drop "
 in transformers due to waste field. In a transformer for 10,000
 volts and 250 amperes, if properly designed, it would be well
 under 1 per cent., probably about one tenth per cent.               In
 order that   an oscillatory current  should  be confined to the "line"
 side by the waste induction which causes a drop of 1 per cent,
 and 80 periods per second, the frequency would have to be
 enormous.       Such an oscillatory current would also be ex
 cluded    from   the secondary at the London end.          Any effect
 which does not involve enormous frequencies mustshow on both
 sides of the transformers.       It might be said that the " drop "
 of the transformers in the circuit would give enough self-
 induction to produce a frequency corresponding to an upper
 partial of the note of the dynamo. If the dynamo E.M.F. does
 not vary harmonically, such an effect might be produced, but
 it would show on the voltmeters at both ends.              To give an
 increase of 15 or 20 per cent, effective pressure, with a total
transformer drop of 1 per cent., the frequency would be,

108                    Mr. H. M. Vemon an           the
roughly, 1000, and the effective pressure of the oscillatory
component 6000 volts. This would give 72 amperes, and the
" skin effect" would absorb a great deal of
                                                power.
   There     is,
              however,     simpler explanation. The cables have
                            a
considerable capacity, and take an appreciable current.       This
" leads " relatively to the electromotive force, so the capacity
current passes in the armature-coils when they are just in the
position to magnetize the fields more strongly.         The fields
cannot follow each pulsation of excitation so produced, but are
affected by it.    Their average excitation    increased.
                                                    is       have    I
tried putting   a  condenser on one of the old Gramme alterna
tors, which have rather weak fields, and a large number of
armature ampere turns. The pressure ran up and burned the
voltmeter.    I  have already gone fully into the action of lead
ing  and  lagging currents on dynamo fields elsewhere, so the
subject need not be pursued here.         It would, no doubt, be
possible to make an alternator excite itself like a series
machine by putting        condenser on the terminals instead of
                            a
exciting   the  fields by     direct current machine. Such an
                                 a
arrangement seems scarcely commercial, though interesting.

forthcoming, yet     will
                       it probably  need   much more proof than
has at present been advanced to render the belief in their
existence universal.
   The question now comes, whether these "proofs" of the
existence of meta-elements are in reality proofs, or whether
                   •   Communicated     by   the Author.

                        so-called Meta-Elements.                    109
they merely point to the possible existence of such bodies.
When chemists are called upon to so entirely change their old
views upon the constitution of the elements, surely they have
a right to expect the most unrefutable proofs why they should
do so.
    It is with the purpose of examining these proofs for the
existence of meta-elements, and of seeing whether they are
valid, that this paper has been brought forward.
    What is   it,then, that we are requested to believe    ?   It    is
that oxides of certain metals, notably of certain rare earths,
are capable, by suitable methods of fractionation and differen
tiation, of being split up into several other earths, all of which
differ from each other and from the original earth, and each
of which we are requested to look upon,        ifnot as the oxide of
a different element, at least as something approaching to this.
That   is,   we are required to look upon these fractionated
earths as oxides of bodies which cannot be formed by the
union of other bodies, and which therefore should earn the
title of elements.
     Let us, then, take an instance of the fractionation of a single
earth.
     Crookes started with an earth which a few years ago would
 have been pronounced by every one to be simply yttria, that
 is, the oxide of the element yttrium.     This oxide was dissolved
 in acid, and enough ammonia added in dilute solution to pre
 cipitate only half the base. The precipitate obtained was
 treated in a similar manner, and so on for several times, the
 precipitate being collected, dissolved in acid, half of        pre
                                                               it
 cipitated again, and so on. The filtrate obtained from the
 first precipitation was treated in a similar manner.            The
 filtrates and precipitates between these extreme fractions were
 also made to yield their share to the final products.       In this
 manner, after      very large number of fractional precipitations,
                    a
 a series of earths was obtained which presumably varied gra
  dually in their degree of basicity as they passed from one
 extreme fraction to the other.        In this way Crookes con
  sidered he had separated the original yttria into nine new
  bodies, or oxides of meta-elements, to which he provisionally
 gave the symbols
               Sy, G„, Qft,     G„   G{,   G„ S„ Gf, G„.
 In what way, then, was      proved that these nine earths were
                              it
 different?
     Some, but not all, of the earths of this class, when sealed
 up in tubes in which     high degree of exhaustion has been
                            a
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 31. No. 189. Feb. 1891.        K

no                  Mr. H. M. Vernon on       the
obtained, and when in this condition subjected to the influence
of the induction-discharge, phosphoresce, most of them, it is
true, for but a very short time ; but with the phosphoroscope
contrived by Crookes most of them would phosphoresce long
enough to allow of their being satisfactorily examined by
means of a spectroscope.      Bodies treated in this way are said
to undergo the radiant-matter test.
   When these nine earths, fractionated from yttria, were sealed
up in tubes with a suitable degree of exhaustion, and their
phosphorescent     spectra obtained    in this way, it was found
that the spectra of all of them differed to a certain extent.
The further the earths were removed from each other in
respect of basicity, the more were their phosphorescent
spectra found to differ, those of the extreme fractions showing
considerable differences.
   The differences of phosphorescent spectra appear to be, at
least in the case of the yttria earths, the only grounds on
which Crookes founds his supposition of the fractionation of
this so-called single earth into these nine others.          On the
strength of the fact of these bodies having slightly different
phosphorescent     spectra, both when examined alone and, as
will be mentioned hereafter, when mixed with other earths,
he considers that the earth has been split up into several
others, each of which is to be considered the oxide of a
different element or meta-element.
   The question comes, Do these fractions of the original
earth differ in chemical properties as well as in phosphorescent
spectra ?    The answer  is, No.    The only chemical property
in which they appear to differ      isthat of slight difference of
                                              a
basicity among themselves.         Crookes has not shown that
they possess any other chemical properties whatever which
may serve to differentiate them from each other       ;   indeed,it
appears that he has not yet tried to prepare their salts and
show whether or not they are identical.
   Again, the question comes, If these bodies do not differ in
chemical properties, do they not differ in physical proper
ties other than that of possessing different phosphorescent
spectra? Again the answer           is, No.    Have we not been
taught, as one of the fundamental principles of our science,
that every different form of matter possesses a spectrum
which belongs to   it  and to  italone    ?If, then, these so-called
nieta- elements are different forms of matter, should not they
also be expected to come within the precincts of this universal
rule? Surely yes. On examination, however,             is   this the
case?     Ina   lecture before the Royal Institution (Chemical
News, 1887, p. 87), Crookes brings before the assembly the

                    so-called Meta- Elements.                 Ill
spark-spectrum of the original yttria : he then brings before
them that of the earth G„. Are these spectra different ? No,
absolutely and exactly the same in every particular.      He then
brings before them that of the earth Gj. Surely this will be
different to a certain degree, even though it be slight.      No,
it is exactly the same in every respect with the spectra of
both the original yttria and of the earth G,.
    How, then, does Crookes explain this? He offers the
following alternative suggestions : —
        " Elements are not as simple as we                    Our
   (1)                                           suppose.
notions of a chemical element have expanded.             Hitherto
the molecule has been regarded as an aggregate of two or
more atoms, and no account has been taken of the architec
tural design on which these atoms have been joined.           We
may consider that the structure of a chemical element is more
complicated than has hitherto been supposed.        Between the
molecules we are accustomed to deal with in chemical reac
tions and ultimate atoms as first created come smaller mole
cules or aggregates of physical atoms : these submolecules differ
one from the other according to the position they occupied in
the yttrium edifice.     We may consider them similar to the
carbon atoms in the benzene ring which have the impress of
their position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 stamped on them."        That is to
say, these fractionated earths are to be considered as isomor-
phous bodies composed of the same atoms arranged in different
ways within the molecule. Why, then, call them meta-
elements, thereby implying that they contain totally different
forms of matter, when in reality they all contain the same ?
        " These nine earths are chemical elements
   (2)                                               differing in
basic powers and several other chemical and physical pro
perties, but not sufficiently to enable us to effect any but a
partial separation.     Thus Gj, for instance, gives a certain
spectrum under the influence of the electric spark : the other
earths, Gt, G,, &c, are contaminated with a certain quantity
of this Gj ; and so the spectra of these other earths, G„ G„
&c, is that of Gj and Gj only, they themselves presumably
not having any spectra at all, or what they do have is masked
by the greater intensity of that of Gj."
   Can this suggestion hold ? Is it probable that not the
slightest trace of any other lines but those due to an impurity
would be observed in the spectrum of a body containing only
a small quantity of this other body as an impurity, and not a
single one would be observed due to the earth under exami
nation ? Surely not.
   Again we ask, Do the atomic weights of these fractionated
earths differ ? Again we must answer in the negative. No
                               K  2

112                 Mr. H. M. Vernon on    the
perceptible differences of atomic weight were found between
even the extreme members of the fractions.
   We therefore come to the conclusion that the entire grounds
upon which the fractionation of yttria into several new earths
depends is that of the difference of their phosphorescent
spectra.
   Now it may be asked, Is this radiant-matter test to be
absolutely relied upon in every respect with regard to its
power of distinguishing between different forms of matter?
Does it always give totally different spectra for each form
of matter or element as known to us, and does a mixture or
compound of two or more elements give the phosphorescent
spectrum of each of these elements, or a spectrum different
from either?
   It appears  that Crookes was the first to use, or at any rate
to bring into at all general use, this method of obtaining the
phosphorescent spectra of bodies when subjected to an induc
tion discharge in an exceedingly rarefied atmosphere.         To
him therefore we must look for our knowledge of the relia
bility of this method of examination. He states that the
more he makes use of it the more reliable it appears.        Do,
however,   his experiments justify this assumption ?   The  only
bodies which he appears to have examined at all completely
by this method are these rare earths, and a few other earths
of a similar nature, as alumina. Do, then, the results obtained
with these bodies justify this method being used to verify
such a gigantic innovation as that of the fractionation of the
oxide of what was supposed to be a single element into oxides
of several other totally new elements ? Would the following
experiment made by Crookes himself seem to justify it ?
   In Phil. Trans. 1885, p. 721, Crookes finds that when
varying proportions of samaria and yttria are mixed and
ignited with sulphuric acid, and tested by the radiunt-matter
spectroscopic method, a bright orange-line, 2693, is observed,
which does not occur in either of their separate spectra, and
which disappears as the proportions in which the earths have
been mixed approach either to pure samaria or to pure j'ttria.
When, however, yttria and samaria are mechanically mixed
and are not treated with sulphuric acid and ignited, only their
superposed spectra, without the orange-line, are obtained.
   Is not the fact of the bright orange-line being present
when the earths are ignited with sulphuric acid, and not being
present when they are merely mixed, due to the formation of
a compound between the two earths in the first case ?      It is
well known that the spectra of salts which are not decom
posed into their constituent elements by the action of heat are

                    so-called Meta-Elements.                   113
very often quite different from the spectra of the elements
composing them.      It may be thought that two earths of such
similar nature as yttria and samaria are scarcely likely to
form a compound together ; but yet how else can it be ex
plained ?   I think if we examine the facts of the case more
closely, we shall see that it is not improbable that yttria and
samaria should form a compound together.         It is well known
with what ease the earths of the aluminium group form com
plex compounds with silica and lime, and may not part at any
rate of the minerals, as samarskite and gadolinite, from which
these rare earths are obtained, be considered to be in a similar
manner complex compounds of the earths ?
   Crookes has therefore shown that it is possible, by combining
two earths together, to obtain a spectrum with a bright line in
it which exists in neither of the spectra of the two earths in
question : this line has in fact been artificially produced.
This being the case, why should it not be possible to manu
facture, if we may use the term, other lines and other spectra
by the combination of various earths together in varying pro
portions ? Is it not possible that the various spectra of the
earths G„, Gj, G„ &c. are nothing more than would be pro
duced if we combined together in various proportions the two,'
or at most three, earths of which these bodies might be sup
posed to be really constituted ?     Do not the experiments of
 Crookes support this supposition ? Thus, about the only pro
perty in which these new earths, G„, Gi, &c, were found to
differ, except as regards their radiant-matter spectra, was that
when they were ignited with sulphuric acid and varying pro
portions of other earths, as lime and barium oxide, they gave
phosphorescent spectra in this case also, differing according
to the nature and quantity of the base used.
   Does not this serve to prove still further the unreliability
of the radiant-matter test? If spectra are formed by the
union of one of these new earths with lime, say, which differ
materially from the spectra of either the earths or the lime,
does not this show that no reliance at all can be placed in such
spectra, especially with regard to proving that these supposed
new earths are really the oxides of new elements.         For just
as a rare earth mixed with lime gives a spectrum different
from that either of the earth or of the lime, so it is just as
probable that the earth samaria combined with the earth
yttria should give a spectrum different from that either of
 samaria or of yttria, and also that the spectrum should vary
 according to the proportions of these two earths present ; and
it must be remembered that the earth yttria, which has been
fractionated into these new earths, always contains a small

114                 Mr. H. M. Vernon on       the
quantity of samaria as an impurity, most of this being found
in the fraction Sy : also it is quite possible that a very small
quantity of some other earth may be present, and that it may
be to the presence of this that the variations in the spectra of
the new earths are due.      Crookes has shown that the merest
trace of a certain earth, unable to be detected by chemical
means, can cause great variations in the spectrum of another
earth.     Perhaps another experiment of Crookes (Chem. News,
 1887, p. 87) will serve to still further confirm the point at
issue, namely, the unreliability of the radiant^matter test.
     Marignac presented Crookes with what was supposed to be
a pure specimen of a new earth, to which he had provisionally
 given the symbol Ya. This earth was found to possess a
 radiant-matter spectrum almost identical with that given by
 a mixture of 61 parts of yttria and 39 parts of samaria, which
 had been ignited with sulphuric acid.         The only difference
 was that in the yttria-samaria spectrum there is present a
 citron band which is absent from the Ya-spectrum.           " Hence
 the earth Ya is shown to consist of samaria with the greenish
 blue of yttria, and some of the other yttria bands added to it.
 It proves further that the citron band, which was hitherto
 regarded as one of the essential bands of the yttria spectrum,
 can be entirely removed, whilst another characteristic yttrium
 group, the double green band, can remain with heightened
 brilliancy.    If, now, it were possible to remove the citron-
 band-forming body from this mixture, the earth Ya would be
 left behind ; in fact, the earth Ya would have been recom-
 posed from its elements."        This, Crookes says, he has no
 doubt he will ultimately accomplish.
     Now the earth Ya must either be identical with the yttria-
 samaria earth, or it must be distinct from it.     Ifit is identical,
 then the radiant-matter test is not reliable, as the same bodies
 have been found to give spectra which do not coincide in all
 their lines. If it is distinct from    it,then the radiant-matter
 test is  equally unreliable, as different bodies have been found
 to give spectra the larger portions of which are absolutely
 identical.
     It has thus been shown how very little reliance can be
 placed in this new physical method of differentiating bodies.
 Time alone will show the degree of reliance that should be
 placed in it.      Even Crookes himself seems to feel this in
 some parts of his papers, though in others he states that the
 further he goes the more reliable he finds          it  to become.
  In Phil. Trans. 1885, p. 722, he says :— " One important
  lesson taught by the many anomalies           unearthed in these

                     so-called Meta-Elements.                  115
researches is that inferences drawn from spectrum analysis
per   se are liable to grave doubt, unless at every step the
spectroscopist goes hand in hand with the chemist.        Spectro
scopy may give valuable indications, but ( /hemistry must after
all be the final court of appeal."
    I think it has been shown that, at least in the case of the
yttria earths, Chemistry has not been made the final court of
appeal, or if it has it has signally failed to prove its case.
    The existence of meta-elements       has been sought to be
established indirectly in ways other than that of the frac
tionation of the rare earths.        Thus A. E. Nordenskiold
(Comptes Rendus, November 2nd, 1886) finds that the earth
gadolinia, which consists of a mixture of yttria, erbia, and
ytterbia, has, though palpably a compound body, a constant
atomic weight whatever be the mineral from which it has
been   extracted. " Therefore," says he, " oxide of gadolinium,
though it is not the oxide of a simple body but a mixture of
three isomorphous oxides (even when it is derived from totally
different minerals found in localities far apart from each
other), possesses a constant atomic weight.       We are then in
the presence of a fact altogether new in Chemistry ; for the
first time we are confronted with the fact that three isomor
phous substances, of a kind that chemists are still compelled
to regard as elements, occur in nature not only always
together but in the same proportions."
    This may be explained by saying that these three earths
form a compound together, just as we form compounds             of
alumina with silica and lime or magnesia in the form of com
plicated silicates, which, being chemical compounds, Lave a
constant composition whatever be the locality from which
they are obtained.      Surely Nordenskiold does not mean to
state that none of the earths yttria, erbia, or ytterbia ever
occur except together, and that too in perfectly constant pro
portions?     Has not Crookes quite recently shown that
yttrium is one of the most widely distributed of elements ?
He does not mention that erbia and ytterbia also always
occur together with this yttria, and that too always in the
same proportions.      Also, do not minerals as samarskite con
tain many other earths besides the three in question ?
    It has thus been shown that the resolution of yttria into
several other new earths has by no means been proved. May
we not reasonably expect that as further investigation is made
in the subject it will be found that these different radiant-
matter spectra are only due to the combinations of two or
perhaps three earths already known and recognized as oxides of

116                 Mr. H. M. Vernon on      the
distinct elements, and that all that fractionation actually does
accomplish is to partially separate these two or three earths,
which very much resemble each other in most of their
properties, and which are therefore confounded together.
   But, it may be said, even if this be found to be the case,
will not the number of distinct earths be so large that it will
not be possible to find places for them in the table of elements,
arranged according to the Periodic Law, and even then is it
possible to explain why such a large number of elements
should exist, apparently differing in very little besides their
atomic weights and basicity ?
   On examination,    I think it will be found that not only is
there a place in the table of elements arranged according to
the Periodic Law for all of the rare earths at present dis
covered, but for several more besides ; and also that a
reasonable explanation can be offered why so many of these
elements, so similar in almost every property, should exist.
   The members of these rare earths which have been dis
covered during the last few years are as follows : —
   Lanthanum            138          Terbium     .      124-7
   Cerium               140-2        Erbium             166
   Didymium .           142-3        Ytterbium          173-7
   Samarium .           150          Thulium .         169-5
   Mosandrium           153-6        Scandium    .       44-1
   Holmium      .       162          Yttrium     .       89-1
   Several other new elements of this class, besides those
mentioned here, have been claimed to have been discovered,
but their existence is so exceedingly doubtful that they have
not been introduced in this list. Also two or three of those
here mentioned have but a very doubtful existence.            The
numbers attached to these elements are their atomic weights,
calculated on the assumption that the earths analysed had a
composition expressed by the formula lts03.
   The two constituents neodymium and praseodymium into
which Dr. Auer von Welsbach has separated didymium into
are not mentioned in this list, as it was thought better to wait
for confirmation of this remarkable result by other chemists.
   Let us now take each of these elements separately and see
if there is a place for it in the table of elements.
   In this table two series of elements have been introduced
between the series commencing with caesium and that com
mencing with gold, as suggested by Brauner (Chem. Soc.
Journ. 1882, p. 78).

  118                 Mr. H. M. Vernon    on the
     The reason of this is that the extra elements in the eighth
 group are only found attached to the even series 4 and 6 ;
 if only one series were introduced between those commencing
 with caesium and gold, then the extra elements osmium,
 iridium, and platinum in the eighth group would come in an
 uneven series.      Also, if only one series were introduced,
 the difference between the atomic weights of caesium and
 gold would be 63-3, which is not nearly so similar to the
 difference between the atomic weights of caesium and rubi
 dium, which is 47'7, as that between caesium and copper,
 which is 69-7.      Also still further reasons will be shown to
 exist why this extra series should be introduced.
     Of the elements in the list, lanthanum, cerium, and didy-
 mium without doubt take their places in the eighth series in
 the third, fourth, and fifth groups respectively.      The next
 two elements in order of atomic weight are samarium (150)
 and mosandritvm (153-6) : Where must these two elements be
 placed ?    Their atomic weights compel them to be placed in
 this series, and they evidently cannot be placed in the sixth
 and seventh groups.      They must therefore find their place in
 the eighth or extra group. There seems to be no reason why
they should not ; for the elements iron, nickel, and cobalt
 form compounds of the form E903, and indeed the stablest
 compounds of iron are grouped under this formula. Also
the elements composing these minor groups in the eighth
group resemble each other very greatly in almost all their
properties ; in the same way does samarium resemble mos-
andrium in its properties ; and when another element of the
atomic weight 151 is discovered to fill up the gap between
these two elements, as will very probably be the case, there
is every reason to expect that it will show very great
analogies to the other two elements in the same minor group
as itself.   If these elements, samarium and mosandrium, had
not been discovered, their existence might readily have been
predicted, as a minor group of elements in this eighth group
belonging to the eighth series is so evidently needed to bring
this series into harmony with the fourth, sixth, and tenth.
We see in this also additional evidence for the introduction
of two series between these commencing with cajsium and
gold.
    The next element on the list is holmium, the place for
which in the table is evidently the third group in the ninth
series.
    Next comes the element terbium, the atomic weight of
which was found to be 124-7 on the supposition of its oxide
having the formula Tb203.       We see that there is no place for

                             so-called Meta-Element s.            119
this element in the table if its atomic weight be taken as this
number. If, however, it be considered a tetravalent element,
its atomic weight becomes 165, and it fits in well in the
fourth group of the ninth series.       It is very probable that
terbium should be a tetravalent element forming salts of the
formula Tb2X4 ; for cerium, the commonly occurring oxide of
which is Ce203, is well known to form these salts, and terbium
is very similar in properties to this element.
    The next element, erbium (166), finds its place in the fifth
group of this series, whilst the next, ytterbium (173*7 J, is
placed beneath lanthanum and holmium in the third group
of the tenth series. The only element in the list for which
a vacant placo does not appear is thulium (170" 7) ; very little
if anything is known of the properties of this element, and so
it is scarcely possible to say which group it had better be
placed in : it does not appear as if it would fit any of the
places in the table at present empty, and so, if further re
search tends to confirm its being a trivalent element with
this atomic weight, it will certainly constitute a difficulty not
to be lightly got over.
    We have thus found, with perhaps one doubtful exception,
 that there are places in the table of elements for all the rare
 earths discovered up to the present time, and, moreover, that
 these places agree well with such properties of these elements
 as are at present known.       It may also be noticed that there
 are several empty places ready to receive any more newly-
 discovered elements.
     The conclusion which may be drawn from the results
 arrived at in this paper are, that it would seem quite un
 necessary to suppose the actual decomposition of what was
 previously supposed to be an element takes place when an
 earth is fractionated in some suitable manner as by partial
 precipitation.    If such a decomposition is possible for one or
 two elements, we may reasonably expect it for all. Why,
 then, is it not attempted to fractionally separate an element
 which can be obtained in a pure state to start with ? In the
 fractionation of these earths, it is almost if not quite im
 possible to obtain the earth in a pure state in the first
 instance ; that       to obtain an earth which
                     a is,
                                                    known not to
                                                         is
  contain at least     small quantity of some other earth totally
  foreign to    it  (disregarding   the several   so-called  meta-
  elements into which           to be separated).
                               it   is               The difficulty
is    also enormously complicated      by the fact of the earths
  which are attempted to be fractionally separated having
  almost exactly the same properties as at least half        dozen
                                                              a
other earths.

120                Dr. S. P. Thompson on      the Use  of
    If it is .in earth which is required, why not endeavour to
fractionate alumina, an earth which, though resembling other
earths of its class, to a certain extent is yet in many of its
properties totally distinct from them ? Again, if it is thought
possible, were suitable means known to fractionate any ele
ment, why not endeavour to do so in the case of iodine?
This element, being situated at the extreme end of its series,
differs as much as it could possibly do from ciesium, the
element next to it in order of atomic weights.            If, therefore,
it were possible to separate iodine into bodies with atomic
weights approaching gradually to that of caesium, might it
not be thought that a very slight difference of atomic weight
would correspond to a very much larger variation in chemical
properties ?
    The actual fact of there being such a largo number of
these rare earths so very similar in properties is to be partly
explained by the fact that not only these elements, but also
the other members composing the table, show extreme varia
tions among themselves to a smaller and smaller extent as
their atomic weights get larger and larger.             Also all these
elements, except samarium and mosandrium, find their places
in the third, fourth, and fifth groups, and are on this account
naturally to a certain extent similar in properties.
    It is hoped that in this paper the views and actual results
of any chemist have not been misinterpreted. It has been
endeavoured as far as possible to be correct, but if any slight
errors have been committed, it is hoped that they will be
recognized as being unintentional.

    XIV.    On the Use     of Fluor-Spar in Optical Instruments.

 CONSIDERING
        fluor-spar, it is   remarkable that hitherto so little use has
been made of it in the optical industries.          Its low refractive
power,    and  its still lower  relative dispersion, make it remark
able amongst transparent media ;           the  only substances com
parable with it in these respects being rock-salt and rock-
alum, both of which being soluble in water are for that reason

the British Association at Leeds.

                 Fluor-Spar in Optical Instruments.              121
unfitted for use in optical instruments.            Like these sub
stances also, fluor-spar is optically isotropic, belonging to the
cubic system of crystals.
    The crystals of fluor-spar most usually occurrent in this
country are by no means colourless, being generally purplish
in tint, and exhibiting at the surface nearest to the light a
fine fluorescence.      Another variety, known as chlorophane, is
of a pale green tint. Pure colourless crystals have also been
found in Cornwall and in Switzerland ; but these are now
rather rare.
     Lenses and prisms of fluor-spar have been from time to
time used, instead of those made of rock-salt, for experiments
on radiant heat ; and, indeed, until recently this was the only
 optical application of this material.
     Becently, however, fresh attention has been drawn to the
 subject by the announcement from the pen of Prof. Abbe, of
Jena, that it is by the use of fluor-spar in combination with
 various sorts of glass that the well-known firm of Zeiss have
 been enabled to construct the remarkable microscope-objectives
 known as " apochromatic
                                 " lenses. These lenses were for
 long supposed — in spite of much scepticism on the part of
 opticians — to owe their excellent resolving power to the use
 of the new kinds of optical glass produced in Jena by Dr
 Schott.     The secret, which whs remarkably well kept for
 several years, is now revealed.        Triplet lenses, somewhat like
 a Steinheil lens, with a fluor cemented between two outer
 lenses of glass, are used to correct the aberrations of the front
 lenses of glass.      The peculiar value of the fluor lens for this
           lies in its possession, alluded to above, of a singularly
 [•urpose
   ow dispersive power.         According to Abbe the refractive
 index of the colourless fluor for sodium light is 1*4338, and
  for the hydrogen lines C and F the respective indices differ
 only by 0*00455.         For the sake of comparison with other
 materials, it is convenient (following Abbe) to consider the
 quantity

  as a measure    of the specific power of any material to produce
  dispersion.    Now, for ordinary crown-glasses, this quantity
  is about   0-01b'6  ; for dense flint as much as 0*019 ; for the
  special phosphate crown-glasses made at Jena it is as low as
  0*0143 ; while for fluor-spar it is only 0*0104.          As Abbe
  points out, the possession of this property enables the instru
  ment-maker, by substituting fluor for crown-glass, to produce

an achromatic lens, consisting of flint glass and fluor-spar,
having faces of lesser curvature than would be requisite for a
lens made of crown-glass with the same sort of flint.             This is
obviously   a  great advantage,      as both  the  spherical  aberration
and the chromatic differences of the spherical aberration are
reduced when the curvatures are lessened.             Hence the use of
fluor-spar for the construction of the improved achromatic
lenses may be regarded as an application of this material of
considerable importance.
    1 have now the honour of announcing a third application
of fluor-spar; namely to the construction of direct-vision
prisms for spectroscopic purposes.              The very same con
siderations which render fluor superior to crown-glass for
achromatizing lenses render                 it,    by
                                               an inverse use of the
material, superior to crown-glass for the purpose of procuring,
along with prisms of dense flint,          wide dispersion. A direct-
                                             a
vision prism made of one wide-angled prism of dense flint-
glass between two prisms of fluor has as great a dispersion-
power as an ordinary five-prism combination of alternate
crowns and flints.       Such a prism, constructed for me by Mr.
C. D. Ahrens,           few months ago, shows extremely good
                       is a
definition.   It      of course shorter than an ordinary crown-
flint  combination   of  equal power, and requires fewer surfaces
to be worked optically true.
    When talking over this prism with Mr. Ahrens, he made
the remark that       would now be possible to construct a direct-
                       it
vision prism wholly without glass.           This suggestion has since
borne fruit and enables me to present to the Section
              ;                                                     small

                                                  is
namely    a   spectroscope which also polarizes the light.                It
consists simply of three prisms cemented together, like an
ordinary direct-vision prism           the two end prisms being of
                                        ;
fluor-spar, and the middle prism of Iceland spar.             The latter
is  cut (as in the improved Nicol prisms which              have on two

former occasions described at meetings of the British Asso
ciation) so that the crj stallographic axis of the spar lies at
right angles to the line of vision. The combination, which
was constructed by Mr. Ahrens, acts therefore both as             a Nicol
prism and as       a  direct-vision prism. It           intended to be
                                                        is
employed in spectrophotometric measurements.
    For the purpose of direct-vision prisms the fluor-spar
employed must be of the colourless kind, as                 considerable
                                                             a
thickness of      it   necessarily interposed in the path of the
                       is
light.   That which Mr. Ahrens has cut for me                     almost
                                                                 is
colourless, having       feeble
                            a   green tinge.      The  combined    prism

         Alternating Electric Arc    between a  Ball  and Point.      123
 of fluor and Iceland spar is far less absorbent than the direct-
 vision prisms ordinarily made with dense flint glass of a strong
 yellow tinge.        For the purpose of achromatizing lenses the
 presence of a greenish or purplish tinge is of less importance,
 as a smaller thickness is used : and the purple fluorescence,
 which is objectionable in some ways, will not trouble the
performance of the lens for any but photographic service.
    It is of importance to note that the tint, whether purplish
or greenish, of fluor-spar may be greatly reduced or nearly
removed by simply heating the spar to a temperature a little
above that at which it emits light in a darkened room.               Care
is necessary, however, that the crystals should not be heated
either so suddenly or to so high a temperature as to cause
decrepitation.        Another point of even greater importance in
the optical applications of fluor-spar is the selection of crystals
which are not macled.           Macled crystals of fluor seldom fail
to show, when cut, some trace of double refraction which
would unfit them for optical purposes.
    The refractive index of the pale green variety seems to be
a little higher than that of the colourless spar.          I find 1"435
as    the   sodium-light    index   of  refraction,  as against 1*4338
found by Dr. Abbe.

             phenomenon      which forms the subject of this paper
THEwas          first brought to my notice by Mr. E. G. Acheson,
 the result of whose unpublished observation may be briefly
stated as follows : —
    Two wires, which formed the terminals of the secondary
 coil of an alternating-current transformer, were brought nearly
into contact.        One wire was armed with a ball, the other with
 a point.      When the distance was such as to admit of a dis
 charge between the two, it was found that a galvanometer in
 shunt around the ball and point indicated a considerable flow
 of continuous current.

  124             Mr. E. L. Nichols on      the  Alternating
  tion by Messrs. Archbold and Teeple.                 Their experiments,
  from which in great measure the data used in the first part of
  this paper have been taken, are described at length in their
  Thesis in Electrical Engineering, which is now in the library
  of Cornell University*.
     The apparatus used in the verification of Mr. Acheson's
  observation consisted of a Ruhmkorff-coil of moderate size,
 the interrupter and condenser of which had been thrown out
  of circuit.     The primary coil, as in all instruments of that
  type, consisted of a few turns of heavy wire surrounding a
  core of iron wires.       When this coil was supplied with current
  from a small alternating-current dynamo, making 14,000
  reversals a minute, and the terminals of the secondary coil
  were brought into position, a discharge of considerable bril
  liancy took place between them.               To the unaided eye the
 discharge appeared to be perfectly continuous ; but the fact
 that it was really of an intermittent and periodic character
  was indicated by the emission of a well-denned musical note,
 which corresponded in frequency with the period of alter
 nation of the dynamo.
     The terminals of the secondary coil were subsequently con
  nected with a brass ball about one centimetre in diameter,
 and with a point consisting of a steel sewing-needle.              These
 were mounted horizontally in well-insulated bearings, the
  centre of the ball in line with the axis of the needle.             The
  distance between the ball and the point of the needle was
  capable of adjustment by means of a micrometer-screw.                 A
 mirror-galvanometer of two thousand ohms, having in its
 outer circuit about one hundred thousand ohms, was shunted
 around the ball and point (in parallel circuit with the air
 space between them).           When the induction-coil was put into
  operation, the ball and point being too far apart to admit of a
 visible discharge, the galvanometer-needle remained at zero,
 but when they were brought within striking distance a large
  and constant deflexion was produced.                When the ball and
  point were interchanged        the  deflexion   was reversed, its direc
 tion always being that which would have resulted from a
  current flowing from the ball to the point.            Under the influ
  ence of the discharge, which was intensely luminous, the
  steel needle was fused at the point and rapidly wasted by
  oxidation, so that it became necessary to find some more

platinum wire, which, although rendered highly incandescent,
withstood the temperature of the arc much better than steel
had done.
    The following quotation will serve to indicate the conclu
sions reached by the observers in the course of their prelimi
nary experiments with the platinum point : —
    " The behaviour of the arc as its length is increased is very
curious.      As the point is withdrawn the arc forms and sings
with an even tone, the pitch corresponding to the number of
alternations.      The point becomes of a dull red colour, while
the galvanometer gives a small but quite steady deflexion.
As the arc is drawn out it sings louder and more harshly, the
point becomes redder, while the galvanometer deflexion in
creases and becomes very unsteady.                 At a certain critical
length the following phenomena suddenly occur : — the tone
becomes smooth and even, the point brightens almost to a
white heat, the intensity depending upon the strength of the
 current, while the galvanometer deflexion becomes much
greater and very steady.             The explanation suggested, and
which subsequent experiments seem to confirm, is as follows: —
At first the arc forms both ways, the rapid succession giving
the tone.      As the arc lengthens the arc still forms from ball
 to point, but is only intermittent (occasional) from point to
 ball, giving the unsteady tone and deflexion. Finally, the dis
tance becomes too great for the arc to form from the point to
 the ball, while it still passes freely the other way, and the tone
 and deflexion become steady
                                      "

     It was to the conditions existing in the circuit when the
 critical length of the arc, above mentioned, had been reached,
 that Messrs. Archbold and Teeple chiefly devoted themselves.
 The limits between which it was necessary to maintain the arc
 were exceedingly narrow, a very slight extension of the striking
 distance beyond the critical point resulting in total extinction
 of the discharge.        Small changes in the speed of the machine
    * The attempt to use carbon terminals led to the following observa
 tion: — "A carbon pencil substituted for the point gave the same effect,
 but upon putting the carbon in place of the ball it still acted as a ' point.'
  If two carbons were used the more pointed one acted as a 'point.' (It
 was observed that the end of the needle was fused into a ball by the heat
  of the arc, and would then act as a ' ball ' to the smaller particles of
  carbon projecting from the end of the pencil.)     Two brass balls brought
  together caused a drifting of the galvanometer-needle from one side to the
  other, according, it is to be presumed, as the discharge changed the nature
  of the two surfaces, so that minute points formed on one or the other.''

 12G            Mr. E. L. Nichols on   t he  Alternating
 were sufficient to throw the apparatus out of adjustment, and
 the arc, once ruptured, would not reappear spontaneously. It
 could be re-established, however, by the momentary introduc
 tion of a bit of metal between the ball and point, or even by
  the interposition of a candle-flame.     The complete stability of
 the discharge was finally secured by driving the dynamo by
 means of a motor, the latter being supplied from a storage
 battery.
     The main portion of the investigation consisted in the deter
 mination of the periodic changes of electromotive force and
 current during a complete cycle, when no arc existed, and of
 the modifications introduced into the curves of potential and
 current by the discharge between ball and point. Throughout
 the entire series of measurements, the striking-distance was
 greater than the critical values already defined, a condition the
 maintenance of which was secured by watching the indications
 of the galvanometer.
    The instrument used in the measurement of electromotive
 force was a Thomson mirror-galvanometer of ten thousand
 ohms resistance.     The galvanometer line was carried to the
 dynamo, where, by means of an instantaneous contact device,
 the circuit was closed during an interval of exceedingly short
 duration, once in every revolution.       The device consisted of a
 wooden disk, mounted upon the shaft of the machine.                 A
 single bar of brass, on the periphery of the disk, passed under
 a brush at every turn.     This bar was connected metallically
 with a brass collar on the shaft, and a second brush bearing
upon the collar completed the circuit.           By thus closing the
line through    the galvanometer,  for an   instant, once in a revolu
tion, the electromotive force of the second circuit, at that
particular point of the cycle for which the contacts were made,
could be measured; and since the brush was adjustable through
considerable range, the entire cycle could be explored.
    The arrangement of the entire apparatus is shown in fig. 1.

 galvanometer, during this part of the investigation, consisted
in showing, by the size and direction of its deflexion, whether
the discharge between the ball and point continued to main
tain its proper character.
   The result of measurements throughout a complete cycle,
both when the arc was formed and when it was extinguished,
is shown in curves B and A (fig. 2). Curve A is with close
approximation a curve of sines, and it indicates the usual
fluctuations of current to be looked for in the secondary circuit
of an alternating system.     Curve B shows the current through
out the cycle when the arc was playing.          Abscissa? represent
portions   of a  complete cycle,    the   period being divided into
twenty equal parts, ordinates the relative amounts of current
through the resistance R, or the total current in the secondary
circuit.    Deflexions, when the current flows from ball to point,
are plotted above the base line.           As may be seen from the
curve B, the current flowing in the positive direction during
each cycle was greatly in excess of that flowing in the nega
tive direction, when the discharge was taking place between
ball and point, whereas when no arc was formed (curve A) the
areas inclosed by the positive and negative branches of the
curve were equal.      Now there were two paths offered to the
current, that through the galvanometer g and the resistance r,
which consisted of a column of copper-sulphate solution

128           Mr. E. L. Nichols on     the Alternating

one hand, and the parallel circuit between the ball and point
on the other.    The resistance of the latter path was infinite
                               Fig. 2.
whenever the arc was interrupted, falling to finite values
during each discharge.        Increase of current through 11
indicates, therefore, the formation of the arc.       Such increase
is found to exist during the second half of each cycle, that is
to say, during that interval in which the ball is positive ; and
it might be inferred from these curves alone that the dis
charge was an intermittent one taking place always from ball
to point.    Other curves, taken simultaneously with A and B,
the Thomson galvanometer being shunted around the indicator
galvanometer, lead to the same conclusion.              The curves
marked C and D (fig. 2) show the results obtained.           It was
thought that they would give the fluctuations in electromotive
force between ball and point, corresponding in time to the
current fluctuations in the resistance R.           The indicating
galvanometer, however, owing to the very rapid alternations
to which the circuit was subjected, was found to possess such
high self-induction as to materially influence the result.
Strictly speaking, the curves C and D, therefore, give the
periodic changes of electromotive force at the terminals of the
indicator and not those occurring at the ball and point.
  These curves are nevertheless of considerable interest. The

             Electric Arc between a    Ball and Point.          129
curve C shows the character of the cycle when no arc was
formed, and D, when the arc was in operation ; 0, like A, is
approximately a curve of sines.        The irregularity at its posi
tive crest, which also appears in D, is probably due to the
imperfect performance of the contact brush, and, having no
bearing upon the phenomena which the curves are intended
to elucidate, may be disregarded. Since no current was pass
ing between the ball and point when A and C were taken,
they represent the fluctuations in successive portions of the
same circuit.   The lag, due to self-induction, however, is very
marked, amounting to almost 90° of phase.         Curve D, which
shows the influence of the arc, is especially instructive.      The
potential rises during the first part of the cycle (ball positive) ;
then follows a very sharp oscillation, occupying about one
twentieth of the entire period or 1/4600 of a second of time.
The potential then reaches a small positive value, which it
maintains without fluctuation for at least four tenths of a com
plete cycle, when it suddenly becomes strongly negative.
                               Fig. 3.
   To obtain curves of electromotive force between ball and
point directly, a non-inductive resistance was substituted for
the indicating galvanometer, and the measurements from which
curves C and D had been drawn were repeated.            Of the two
curves thus determined, the one taken when the arc was not
playing (E, fig. 3) is a sine curve closely coinciding in phase

130            Mr. E. L. Nichols on   the Alternating
with the simultaneous curve of current (A, fig. 2).            The
corresponding curve F, which was taken while the discharge
was passing between the ball and point, is in its essential
features of the same character as curve D (fig. 2).            The
interval of uniform positive potential is of the same length, and
it is coincident with the interval of excess of current which
shows itself in the positive branch of curve B.         It is note
worthy    that  this interval of uniform   potential  which  marks
the duration of the arc, occupies in both cases the same portion
of the cycle (between scale-divisions 10 and 19, approxi
mately), although there is otherwise a difference of phase,
due to self-induction, amounting to at least four scale-divisions.
 Curve C, for instance, reaches its maximum in the neighbour
hood of scale-division 8, curve E at scale-division 12.         The
 exclusion of the coils of the indicating galvanometer from the
 circuit reduced this difference of pbase to a small quantity,
 and it suppressed altogether the remarkable oscillation of
electromotive force (see curve D) which in all preceding
 experiments had introduced the formation of the arc.
    The results exhibited graphically in these six curves afford
 abundant verification of the theory of the ball and point phe
 nomenon, given in a previous paragraph ; and they establish
 the fact that in the secondary circuit of a transformer, such as
 that made use of in these experiments, the striking-distance
 from ball to point exceeds that from point to ball. It follows
 that whenever tbe space between the ball and point is less
 than the former and greater than the latter distance, discharge
 will occur only during that portion of each alternation for
 which the ball is positive, and that under such circumstances
 a galvanometer placed in the circuit will show a constant
 deflexion.
    Complete corroboration of the foregoing conclusion was
 obtained by studying the image of the arc in a revolving
 mirror.    With an arc of less than the critical length tbe
 discharge was seen to consist of two distinct sets of sparks, all
 of the same duration but differing in colour. Each alternate
 discharge was purple, the intermediate ones being of a green
 ish cast. The spark-images were everywhere equidistant,
 and their duration was about four times as great as the inter
 vening intervals of darkness.     The extension of the sparking-
 distance beyond the critical point resulted in the complete
 suppression of the series of purple images, the intermediate
 ones remaining undisturbed in position, duration, and appear
 ance.    The intervals of darkness were then estimated to occupy
 six tenths of each cycle, the discharges four tenths ; a ratio
 which corresponds with that of the duration of positive poten

 tial of the ball (as shown in the curve) to the total length of
a complete    cycle.
    The ball-and-point phenomenon       is unquestionably very
closely related to a class of effects with which students of
static electricity have long been acquainted.    One recalls, to
begin with, Faraday's experiments with the Leyden jar ; in
which, of two paths, the spark invariably followed that involv
ing passage from a positive ball to a negative point, in pre
ference to another, through equal air-space between a negative
ball and a positive point*. Wiedemann and Riihlmann have
since shown that, between spherical electrodes which differ in
diameter, the quantity of electricity necessary to produce a
discharge is less when the larger ball is positive than when it
is negative f ; and Macfarlane has measured the electro
motive force which will produce a spark between a point and
plate, and has found it to be greater when the point is positive
than when it is negative |.
    In view of the experiments described in the present paper,
it appears that what is true, in this particular, of the spark
from the Leyden jar and the discharge of the Holtz machine,
is true also of the alternating-current arc.

   After the completion of the experiments of Messrs. Arch-

well ; the chief purpose of the investigation being to test the
applicability of the effect to alternate current measurement       ||.
   Irregularities of action due to rapid changes in the surfaces
of the point and ball, by corrosion and disintegration under
the arc, finally caused the attempt to be abandoned for the
time being, but Mr. Caldwell in the course of his work made
a large number of observations of the discharge under various
conditions.    Many of these are of interest in this connexion
on account of the light which they throw upon the original
experiments, and because of the lines of further research
which they suggest.

132           Mr. E. L. Nichols   on the Alternating
   Mr. Caldwell's first step, after having repeated the prelimi
nary experiments of Archbold and Teeple, and verified their
statements, was to substitute a ball with a surface of platinum
for the brass ball used by them.      The new ball withstood the
action of the arc no better than the old one had done.         It
soon became covered with a black deposit, the growth of which
modified and vitiated the action of the apparatus.     In experi
menting with such a ball, the surface of which was still bright
and new, and with a point of the same metal, it was noticed
that within the critical distance, while the spark was passing
in both directions, there appeared to be two distinct paths
along which the discharge was taking place.      One of these was
nearly in the line from the point to the ball, normal to the
surface of the latter, the other from the point in a direction
approximately at 45° with the common axis of the pointed rod
and ball.    Upon increasing the distance until the discharge
entered the " one way
                         "
                           stage, the longer and oblique path of
flow vanished.     In the revolving mirror the two classes of
sparks were easily identified.      They were found to occur in
alternation with each other, the spark which followed the nor
mal path being that which passed from ball to point, the other
that from point to ball. The images of the discharge from
the point disappeared as soon as the critical distance was
reached.    In order to place the matter beyond all doubt, the
times of the discharge which followed the normal path were
determined by an ingenious method, quite independent of
that used by the first observers, and it was found that the
spark occurred always in that part of the cycle during which
the ball was positive.
   Mr. Caldwell's method of fixing the time of the discharge,
briefly stated, was as follows.    An adjustable contact device,
similar to that used by Archbold and Teeble, was attached to
the shaft of the dynamo.       A wire from one pole of a large
Holtz machine, driven by power, was carried to the neighbour
hood of the ball and point, where two platinum terminals,
 1 millim. apart, were set up.     The wire was connected with
one of these, and a line was carried from the other to the con
tact device.   A wire from the latter to the remaining terminal
of the Holtz machine completed the circuit.         Whenever the
brush made contact, a spark leaped between the platinum
terminals just described.      By adjustment of the brush, the
spark could be    made  to  appear at any desired instant in the
cycle of alternations of the dynamo. The platinum terminals
were placed so that the image of the spark in the revolving
mirror was seen side by side with that of the discharge

              Electric Arc   between a Ball and Point.         133
between the bull and point, and the precise position in the
cycle occupied by the latter was thus readily determined.
    Closer study of the two paths of discharge showed that the
oblique arc left the very apex, of the point, swinging out
laterally into its path ; also that the normal arc, on approach
ing the point, avoided the apex and entered the wire from the
side, never passing in at the point itself.
    From these observations it appears : —
    1. That the discharge from the ball (positive) leaves the
latter in a direction normal to the surface, but that it enters
the other terminal at some distance from the apex.
    2. That the discharge from the point (positive) leaves the
very apex of the latter, but is deflected into a course nearly
45° from the axis and reaches the ball obliquely at some point
on its side.
    Taking these observations into consideration, the explana
tion of the cessation of the discharge from the point at the
critical distance and of the establishment of the " one way
                                                                  "
arc, follows at once.        The two paths of discharge differ in
length,   and    for a   given electromotive force the maximum
striking   distance  is  sooner reached in the case of the oblique
than of the normal arc, so that the latter continues to pass
at greater distances (of ball and point) than the former.
    Further inspection of the images of the two arcs in the
revolving mirror revealed another curious fact. The mirror
was set up with its axis of revolution parallel to the common
axis of the ball and point.        The image of an instantaneous
spark following the line of the normal arc would therefore be
a line parallel to the axis of the mirror.    Since the duration of
the discharge was nearly '001 second, this linear image was
expanded into a broad rectangular band.         The image of any
oblique discharge would in general be an oblique parallelogram.
The image of the discharge from point to ball, however, was
not of that form.       It appeared rather as a warped surface the
form of   which    could  be explained only by supposing that the
discharge at first followed the normal path to the ball, and was
gradually displaced as the cycle progressed, until it reached
its extreme position at 45° to the axis, just before the rupture
of the arc.
    Definite results were obtained only while the platinum sur
face was new and bright.         The region where the normal arc
left the ball soon became tarnished and corroded and there
was an increasing tendency on the part of the oblique arc to
 leave its own path and join the other.
    When the ball was supplanted by a platinum wire, 1 millim.

134     Alternating Electric Arc   between a Ball and  Point.
in diameter, with rounded tip, the object being to force the
two discharges into a common path, it was found that the arc
from the point (positive) avoided the end of the wire alto
gether, and struck in upon the cylindrical surface beyond.
When the end of this wire was surrounded by an insulated
platinum ring which was connected with the terminal of the
induction-coil by a separate wire — the intention being if
possible to separate the two phases of current and conduct
them over different wires — it was found that the arc from
the point (positive) always entered the centre wire, never
 being diverted to the ring, although the intervening air-space
was less than a millimetre.         The returning arc, however,
 would sometimes leave the ring and sometimes the wire, and
a galvanometer placed in the circuit between the ring and the
induction-coil showed a large deflexion, such as would be
 caused by a flow of current towards the ring.         This result
 seems to be in accordance with the conclusion reached from
 the inspection of the images in the revolving mirror ; namely
that the arc from the point always formed first along the
 shortest path.    Deflexion from that path in the case of the
wire and ring would probably be hindered by the insulating
 medium which intervened.        When, finally, a cluster of points
 were opposed to the single point, it was found that the dis
 charge from the latter was always along a single path, whereas
 the return arc from the cluster (positive) often followed several
 paths.
    It had been noted by Messrs. Archbold and Teeple, that the
 platinum point used in their experiments, which was red-hot
 while the arc was passing in both directions, became white-hot
 during the "one way" stage.           The heating-effects at the
 surface of the brass ball were not discernible, but when Mr.
 Caldwell substituted a thin sheet of platinum for the ball, this
 became incandescent under the action of the ans.         The spot
 where the oblique arc (point positive) impinged upon the foil
  became white-hot, while that at which the normal arc (ball
 positive) left the foil was barely red-hot. In this respect, then,
 the discharges act like the ordinary sparks of the influence-
 machine or induction-coil, which, as has been shown by
  Despretz, Poggendorf, Naccari, and other observers, heat the
 negative electrode to a higher degree than the positive one.
  This action is in marked contradistinction to that of the con
 tinuous current arc, the positive terminal of which takes the
 higher temperature.
    In this brief account of Mr. Caldwell's experiments, I have
  omitted to mention many of the observations recorded by him.
  He had occasion in the course of his investigation to study

     Prof.      J. J. Thomson        on Conductivity    of Hot Gate*.              135
the discharge under a variety of conditions, and found that
when liquid surfaces (mercury or water) were used in place
of the ball, also that when hydrogen, carbon-dioxide or
 illuminating-gas were substituted for air, as a dielectric, the
ball-and-point effect, more or less modified, could still be
obtained. The investigation of these points, although it has
already led to some results of significance, is as yet very
incomplete.

     To   the   Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,                                  Cambridge,   January   19, 1891.
       the January number of Wiedemann's Annalen Dr.
IN    Arrhenius publishes an account of some experiments on
the conductivity of hot vapours. His results differ from those
obtained by me (Phil. Mag. April and May 185)0) in the
cases of the vapours of hydrochloric acid, hydriodic acid, and
ammonium chloride.        According to his experiments these
vapours do not conduct appreciably better than air at the
same temperature, while                  I
                                 found that their conductivities
were very greatly in excess of that of air. The difference
between these results              is,
                             think, easily explained on the view
                                    I
given in my paper, that the conduction of electricity through
hot gases      due to dissociation.
                    is                  The method employed                          by
 Dr. Arrhenius was to inject these substances into            flame      a           ;
thus the hydrochloric-acid gas, for example, would be sur
 rounded by       multitude of other gases, and especially
                         a                                                           by
hydrogen.      The presence of large excess of hydrogen would
                                             a
 retard the dissociation of gas such as hydrochloric acid, of
                                         a
which hydrogen        one of the products of dissociation
                             is                                  for          ;      it
is  a well-recognized principle in the theory of dissociation,
 that     it retarded by the presence in excess of one of the
               is
 products of dissociation. This has been verified by Wurtz,
 who found that an excess of PCI3 stopped the dissociation of
 PC18.    In Dr. Arrhenius's experiments the dissociation of the
 hydrochloric acid would thus be very much less than               was        it
 in mine, when the gas was heated                     by
                                              itself, and when the
 dissociation was large enough to be detected by chemical
 means.    This, on the view that the conductivity            due to     is
 dissociation,  would  be sufficient  to  explain  the difference    in
 the results.      have found myself that the conductivity of
                         I
 HCI     very much reduced
          is                                 by
                                    dilution with hydrogen, more

136             Mr. S. Bidwell  on the  Effect of Heat
so than   when dilated with C02. The difference between the
results for HI may be explained in the same way ; and the
case of ammonium chloride is practically the same as HC1, as it
dissociates into NH3 and HC1, and the NH3 does not conduct.
    I may say that it was the fear of the true conductivity of
the hot gases being masked by secondary effects of this kind,
combined with the high conductivity of the flame itself, which
made me reject the use of flames in my experiments.               In a
flame the chemical conditions are so complex that it is almost
impossible to obtain results whose interpretation is free from
ambiguity.
    Some other remarks of Dr. Arrhenius are due to a mis
interpretation of my meaning.        I never stated that if we had
the same number of molecules per unit volume of HI and
I, the HI would conduct better than the I. On the contrary,
I  regard the conductivity of both HC1 and HI as due to some
of tbe chlorine and iodine remaining dissociated after the
molecules of the gas have been split up.          Dr. Arrhenius also
explains the small conductivity of a dissociated gas, such as
iodine, when compared with the conductivity of an electro
lyte, by asking, Who can tell how many of the atoms of the
dissociated gas are uncharged '? but if the atoms of the gas
can be without charge why cannot those of a salt in solution '(
and if we admit the existence of uncharged, that is electrically
inactive atoms, why should thero be any connexion between
electric conductivity and osmotic pressure ?
                      I remain, Gentlemen,
                                    Yours very truly,

 XVII.     A Lecture Experiment illustrating       the Effect of Heat
    upon the Magnetic Susceptibility    of Nickel.     By IShklford
    Bidwell, M.A., F.R.S*
       is well known that iron when made red-hot loses its sus
 IT ceptibility   and practically becomes a non-magnetic metal.
 Nickel becomes non-magnetizable at a much lower tempera
 ture, perhaps at about 300°.      The following is a description
 of a simple piece of apparatus by means of which this effect
 may be shown as a lecture experiment.
    A copper disk, to which a thin projecting tongue of nickel
 is soldered, hangs like the bob of a pendulum from a double
 thread.    This bob is held on one side by a horizontally-fixed
 bar- magnet, which attracts and holds fast the nickel tongue
 when brought into contact with it. A spirit-lamp is placed
      * Communicated by tbe Pbysical Society : read April 13, 1889.

           upon the Magnetic Susceptibility of Nickel.      137
beneath   the  tongue, and in a few seconds the heat of the
flame temporarily destroys the magnetic quality of the nickel,
so that the magnet can no longer hold it.       The bob accord
ingly falls back and performs an oscillation. In the course
of its excursion, however, the metal becomes cooler, and
when it returns to the neighbourhood of the magnet the
tongue is once more attracted. But after a momentary contact
it is again liberated, and the process is repeated. If the
position of the magnet and the size of the flame are properly
adjusted, and care is taken to shield the apparatus from
currents of air, the bob may be kept swinging for an in
definite period like the pendulum of a clock.
   The apparatus is shown in the annexed figure, and its
dimensions are as follows : — Diameter of the copper bob
5 centim., thickness O08 centim.     Length of the projecting

 138                  Notices respecting New Boohs.
 portion of the nickel tongue 1*5 centim., width 0"8 centim.,
 thickness O08 centim. The end of the nickel is filed to a blunt
 point (about 135°).            A stout copper wire (0-14 centim. in
 diameter), to which the suspending thread is attached, passes
 through a hole drilled near the upper edge of the disk and is
 fixed by solder.        The copper wire is bent in such a manner
as to make the nickel tongue hang horizontally.              The copper
disk and the nickel tongue, except the extreme point of the
 latter, are coated with a mixture of lampblack and gold size
 to facilitate cooling by radiation.          The length of the pendu
lum from the suspending beam to the centre of the bob is
 85 centim.        In order to prevent accidents by burning, the
 lower part of the suspension for a length of about 10 centim.
 is made of fine wire ; the remainder consists of ordinary
 sewing-silk.       The round bar-magnet is about 13 centim. long
 and 1'2 centim. in diameter ; it slides stiffly through a hori
 zontal hole in an upright post, and its best position must be
 found by trial.        A sheet of white cardboard is fixed behind
 the bob, so that the effect may be well s 'en at a distance.
     The above dimensions might no doubt be varied con
siderably without detriment ; but if they are followed good
 results may be certainly obtained without waste of time in
experiment.

An Elementary        Treatise on Hydrodytiamict and Sound.      By A. B.
    Basset, M.A., F.SJS., Trinity College, Cambridge. Cambridge :
    Deighton, Bell, and Co. London: George Bell and Sons. 1890.
rPHIS      is  a   " middle " treatise on the mathematical theory of
 -*¦
       Liquid-Dynamics, forming Part I., and Aero-Dynamics, to
which Part II. is devoted, as far as needful for the elementary
treatment of Sound.          It is chiefly designed for students reading
for Part    I.  of  the  Cambridge Tripos, or other Examinations, in
                                                                         "
which    an  elementary knowledge of its subjects is required ; "but
the Author also trusts (to alter slightly his phraseology)       " that it
will not only be of service to those who have neither the time nor
the inclination to become conversant with the intricacies of the
higher mathematics, but will also prepare the way" for those
intending to proceed to the higher parts of these subjects.
    Some years back Lord Bayleigh, while filling the post of Caven
dish Professor, threw out a suggestion that the instruction in
Pure Mathematics of students who proposed to devote themselves
mainly to Physics should be limited, as far as possible, to those
parts which are indispensable to this object — a remark particularly
                                            "       "
applicable to the training of such a middle class of students as
those for whom chiefly Mr. Basset writes, his present treatise
                               " a knowledge of the elements of Differen
rt'quirinR no more than

 tial and Integral Calculus and the fundamental parts of Dynamics."
 The endeavour has been " to solve the various problems which
 present themselves with the aid of the Principles of Energy or
 Momentum," fixed axes only being used in all but a few cases —
which might be passed over by those whom the employment of
 moving axes would puzzle. Accordingly in Chap. I., on
                                                                " Kine
matic Theorems," in the few lines given to the Lagrangian       Method
the fact that the axes are considered fixed is emphasized; but there
seems no reason why historical order should not be adhered to and
the Eulerian given the priority to the Lagrangian method. What
ever room allows to be done in directing the student's attention to
the history of the progress of his subject is valuable.    So, later on,
under " Dynamical Theorems — as in the Author's excellent larger
                                 "
treatise — it is barely remarked that the principle involved in equa
tion (30) is Bernoulli"s Theorem ; but to which of the gifted family
it is due the student is left uninformed, as also of the work in
which it was originally given — Bernoulli's Hydrodynamica,            or
John, his father's Hydraulica, 1738. In the case of living writers
the references are more fully given.      Dr. Glaisher, in his Address
to Section A, British Association, Leeds Meeting of last year,
made a valuable recommendation that in all Mathematical Treatises
references should be given to the original memoirs &c. in which the
results noticed first appeared.     The late Mr. Gregory, following
the precedent set by Dean Peacock, made such references (even
if at second hand) a feature in his well-known ' Examples,'
aDd Mr. Walton in his, on Dynamics and Hydrostatics, adhered
to the precedent, thereby giving a rough skeleton-history of the
subjects. It is, however, of more importance that condensation
to save space should not be carried to the point of merely writing
down a result without proof in cases where one of the classes of
students for whom the treatise is intended could not fairly be
considered competent — if willing to pause, in " getting up " the
book, and make the effort — to supply the details of proof.      This is
the case when the equation [(7) Chap.      I.]of continuity for liquids
in Polar Coordinates    is    merely set down    ;while in the larger
treatise the details of the proof are given, though not with the
fulness which would be adequate to the wants of the reader of
the present " Elementary
                              " one. Besides those alluded to, sub
jects dealt with in this preliminary chapter are

   Chapters n. and in. deal with some of the simpler eases of motion
of solids in liquids.       Chapter iv. is occupied with the important
subjects    of   "Wave      Motion,"    and "Stability of Fluid Motion."
" Rectilinear Vortex Motion " forms the subject of Chapter v.,
ending the first part of the treatise, which occupies about five
eighths of the whole book.            The remaining chapters — vi., Intro
ductory,    on  Sound    ; vri„  on  the   " Vibrations of Strings and Mem
branes   ;"  viii.,  on the  " Flexions     of Bars ; and IX., on the " Equa
tions of Motion of a Perfect Gas," — are mainly the more elementary
portions of vol. i. of Lord Rayleigh's great treatise.              With this
might    still  advantageously      be  read    (if yet procurable) Sir G. B.
          '
Airy's      Lectures     on  Sound,'    compiled for the use of students
of the same mathematical status as those for whom Mr. Basset
 writes, at a time when their wants were wholly unprovided for.
 This manual, published in 1868, was the realization of a wish
 expressed to the author by the late Dean Peacock thirty years
 previous to its appearance. In fact at that time there was no
 separate treatise accessible to the English student but Sir J. F. W.
 Herschel's article (1830) on Sound, in the Encyclopaedia Hetropo-
Utana.
    To those acquainted with Mr. Basset's larger work it will be
 needless to dilate on the completeness with which he handles the
 subjects of the Elementary treatise as far as pursued — an article
 by Lord Rayleigh on Bells, as recent as January 1890, being
 drawn upon; and in clearness and vigour of style little remains to
 be desired.        It might be suggested, perhaps, that the frequent
 use of the editorial
                           " we," and its cases, would be advantageously
 replaced by other phrases, more in accordance with modern habit,
 in the second edition, to which the book is likely ere long to run.
 It was with a view to such an opportunity of revision and cor
 rection that the remarks in the earlier parts of this notice were
 directed.     Otherwise it would have been more grateful to dwell
 on the numerous excellences of the work, which was perhaps
 rather hurried through the press to fill up, as soon as possible, the
 want it was the Author's object to meet.

 This   is a work composed on the usual lines, the text of which is
  very correctly printed ; there are of course slips here and there,
 but we need not specify them for our readers. The compiler's
 object has been to write a book for those students who have not
 the advantage of a " coach," and for such we consider he has made
 a capital selection, and we think he has treated his subject in a
 manner suitable for such readers. There is a large collection of
 examples taken from University and Civil Service Examination
 Papers.       Two or three of the figures are incorrectly drawn.
 Answers to the Exercises accompany the work.

The Scientific Papers   of James Clebk Maxwell. Edited by W. D.
    Niven,    M.A., F.E.S.     Two Vols., 4to : Cambridge, at the
    University  Press.
At length this Iong-looked-for memorial work     has appeared, in two
 substantial volumes, and will be welcomed by the many students
 of Maxwell, both in England and on the Continent, to whom the
earlier papers were rather inaccessible.
    There are some odd omissions ; for instance, there is nothing
about the determination of the B.A. standard of resistance.          It
may be regretted also, perhaps, that a few more of his less labo
rious contributions to science are not included in the collection, for
all that he threw off was brilliant and suggestive, and one had
hoped for something like a complete series of notes of his Lectures
at Cambridge, but we must be thankful for such of the lighter pro
ductions as it has been decided to include.    It is a great pity when
in these collected works nothing but the solid memoirs are inserted.
These of course must appear, but they are necessarily more or less
known, and will naturally be hunted up by students of the par
ticular branch ; but the multifarious contributions to periodical
literature of a great man are usually of far more than ephemeral
interest, and though not of course ranking along with his serious
productions, yet are very helpful and suggesthe, aud are extremely
likely to get overlooked and forgotten.
    A real memorial volume should, we think, include almost all
that a man has thought it worth while to print, unless of obviously
only temporary interest ; but it is difficult to say what will not be
 interesting to posterity.    Even a selection from correspondence
might be judiciously included.     How grateful we are now for mere
scraps of private letters from Newton.       Look at the little scrap
thrown off to his friend Dr. Law, accidentally preserved, and
             '
printed in Nature,' May 12, 1881: to the eye of reverence and
affection a personal glimpse like that is full of interest.       It is
hard for contemporaries to realize the view that posterity will take
of the relative moment of the works of a man of genius.          Some
times a few brilliant flashes, now not quite intelligible, will, in
the light of subsequently acquired knowledge, be even more highly
appreciated than solid work that has become a semi-commonplace
of science.    It is for posterity that memorial volumes are largely
intended, and from its point of view should they be regarded by
its Editor.
    A very interesting biographical preface by the Editor opens the
first volume, which contains the boyish paper on Ovals, some
Optics, the theory of Colour Perception, the paper on Lines of
Force, and the great memoirs on Saturn's Rings and the Dyna
 mical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field.
    The second volume contains the papers on Viscosity and general
 Kinetic Theory of Gases, the determination of " v,'' the work on
Grapliical Statics, other matter more or less incorporated in the

in all cases been affixed to the different memoirs, but they seem
arranged in fairly chronological order.

THE     1.  "On Nepheline llocks in Brazil — II. The Tingua Mass."
By 0. A. Derby, Esq., F.G.S.
     In  a former paper the general distribution of the nepheline rocks,
  so  far as known, was given with a particular description of a single
  one, the Serra do Pocos de Caldas.       The present paper treats of a
 second mass, the Serra de Tingua, a high peak of the Serra do Mar,
 some forty miles from Rio de Janeiro.
     The peak is essentially a mass of foyaito rising to an elevation of
  1600 metres, on the crest and close to the extremity of a narrow
 gneiss ridge of a very uniform elevation of about SOU metres.        As
 seen from a distance, the conical outline and a crater-like valley on
 one side arc very suggestive of volcanic topography.       In the struc
 ture of tho mass both massivo and fragmcntal eruptives are found,
 the former greatly predominating.
     The predominant rock is a coarse-grained foyaite which is found
  everywhere in loose blocks about the margins of the mass, but not
 extending beyond it.       In the numerous cuttings in tho immediate
 vicinity, dykes of phonolite and basic eruptives (angitite) are ex
  ceedingly abundant, foyaite never appearing in a dyke form. There
 is, however, abundant evidence that foyaite and phonolite are but
  different phases of the same magma.
     Aside from the dyke phonolites, true effusive phonolites associated
  with frngmental eruptives (tuffa) were found high up in the crater-
 like valley, proving that the mass was a volcanic centre in the most
  restricted sense of the word.
     This conclusion affords an explanation of some of the peculiarities

 mingled with those of the deep-seated ones (Teifengesteine).           These
 have, aside from the porphyritic structure, a schlieren structure re
 vealed by a peculiar fluted weathering (illustrated by a photograph)
 and the presence of pseudo-crystals in the form of leucite.
    Stratigraphically the Tingua foyaites lie in sheet-liko masses like
 lava-flows, extending from the higher to the lower portions of the
mountain, the underlying gneiss being revealed at nearly all levels,
wherever the mass has been scored by streams.              The general frag
 mentary character of the rock seems to be due to the undermining
of  these sheets.
    Specimens      and photographs illustrating       the peculiar pseudo-
crystals   in  the   form  of  leucite that  occur in  both the foyaites and
phonolites of Tingua (although no leucite has been detected in the
rock) were exhibited and discussed.
    2. " The Variolitic    Diabase of the Fichtelgebirge."     By J. Walter
Gregory, F.G.S., of the British Museum (Natural History).
    The author has examined the variolitic diabases in the neigh
bourhood of Borneck, and adduces evidence of their having been
intruded into the Devonian rocks before the latter were affected by
the great earth-movements which have folded the paheozoic rocks of
the district.     He finds that the variolitic structure occurs in two
different arrangements : (a) on the surfaces of spheroidal masses of
compact diabase, which are comparable with those of Mt. Genevre :
(b) as a truo contact-product on the selvage of the diabase, the latter
being comparatively rare, and the varioles less perfectly developed.
    He gives proofs that the varioles are true spherulites, and not
fragments of Devonian rocks, as supposed by von Giimbel.                   He
argues that though they are the product of rapid cooling, too sudden
a solidification of the diabase may prevent their formation, and that
for a similar reason the amygdaloidal is less variolitic than the com
pact diabase, the loss of tho water that occupied the vesicles having
diminished the fluidity of the rock. Finally, he maintains that the
"                        "
                            are rifts and fissures due to contraction, and
   pseudo-crystallites
that the remarkable optical properties described by Michel-Levy are
due to the filling-up of cracks by felspathic matter deposited in optical
continuity with the crystalline fibres on each side.

    1. " On the North-west Region of Charnwood Forest, with other
 Notes.". By the Rev. E. Hill, M.A., F.G.8., and Prof.T. G. Bonney,
D.Sc, LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    The paper contains the results of a re-examination of the North
west Region, when the authors had the advantage of using the six-
inch Ordnance-map, published since the completion of their former
work.     In this they had expressed the opinion that tho rock of
 Peldar Tor and that of High Sharpley were somewhat altered pyro-
clasties, being much influenced by the non-igneous origin asserted
                                                                              f

for the “porphyroids” of the Ardennes.      But in 1882 one of them
had visited this region, and was then convinced that the porphyroids,
which closely resembled the rock of Sharpley, were felstones which
had been rendered schistose by subsequent pressure. The result of
their subsequent work in Charnwood has convinced the authors that
the rocks of Sharpley and of Peldar Tor are in the main of a like
origin and history. The mass of Bardon Hill, where the quarries
have been much enlarged, has also been studied, and some details in
the section formerly published have been corrected. The schistose
bands, on which the authors relied as marking horizons for strati
graphical purposes, prove to be zones of exceptional crush. The
occurrence of a rock exactly resembling that of Peldar Tor is fully
established. It is extremely difficult to decide upon the true nature
of the rocks which are chiefly worked in the pit, but the authors
remain of opinion that for most of them a pyroclastic origin is the
more probable.
   Some notes are added upon the relations of the holocrystalline
igneous and the sedimentary rocks of the Forest, upon the Black
brook group, and upon the fragments and pebbles in certain of the
coarser ashy deposits.    Some remarks are made upon the glacial
phenomena exhibited in the Forest-region; these indicate that
this cannot have been overridden by a great northern ice-sheet,
and it does not afford the usual signs of the action of local glaciers.
At the same time it has been a centre of dispersion for erratics,
especially towards the south and south-west, these being found
sometimes more than 20 miles away.        Hence, in the opinion of the
authors, the erratics have been distributed by floating ice during an
epoch of general submergence.      Some minor “corrigenda” in the
earlier papers are noted, with certain changes in the names of
localities, bringing them into harmony with the six-inch map.
   2. “Note on a Contact-Structure in the Syenite of Bradgate
Park.” By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
   The author described a specimen, obtained at Bradgate Park,
showing a junction of the syenite and slaty rock of Charnwood.
The latter rock is very slightly altered; the former exhibits a
number of grains of felspar and quartz set in a matrix which has
now a “trachytic,” now a devitrified structure.      He traced the
former into the “micrographic” structure observed generally in
these syenites, and discussed     its
                                  significance.  His study    these of
structures  inthis and many  other instances led him     infer that
                                                               to
they generally indicated that the rock,       at   a late stage, had con
sisted of   a  mixture  of    previously formed crystalline grains and
a viscous magma, that the temperature        of  the mass had been com
paratively low, that   it    had cooled rather gradually, and that the
condition   of  the magma—i.e. one      of   very imperfect fluidity—had
not  permitted    offree molecular movements among       its constituents.
Thus this   structure,  together with certain others mentioned, might
 be regarded     as
                  indicative of  “crystallization under constraint.”

   I.  Review of   the Evidence   for tlit respective Ages of   the Uriconian
                            and Malvernian Rocks.
    The author criticises the conclusions arrived at by Prof. Blake
(Q.   J. G. S. 1890, p. 386), and adduces evidence to show :—
    (1) That the felsites regarded by himself as Archaean have not
been shown to be intrusive in Longmynd Rocks.
    (2) That it has not been proved that the Longmynd Series is
divisible into two groups, separated by an unconformity ; and that,
therefore, the evidence from included fragments remains unaffected.
    (3) That the conglomerates         and grits associated with the Uri
conian are an integral part of that s3-stem, and are not of Cambrian
age ; and that the granitic and metamorphic land-masses                   from
which so mauy of the fragments in the conglomerates are derived
are consequently of pre-Uriconian age.
    (4) That the granitic rocks of Shropshire are not intrusive in the
Uriconian.
     II.  The Relation between the Uriconian and         the. Longmyndian.
    Pending the publication of Prof. Lapworth's researches upon tho
fauna of the Hollybush Sandstone, the author regards it as hardly
wise to assign positively a pre-Cambrian age to tho Longmyndian
system.
    In favour of an      actual break between      the Uriconian and Long
myndian rocks, he gives details showing           the  general discordance of
strike between the two groups ; the locally concordant strikes are
seen along a line of fault.         Furthermore, as the junction between
the    two   groups   is faulted,  this,  whilst of course not proving an
unconformity, renders incredible tho hypothesis of conformity and
igneous intrusion along tho lino of junction.           Again, tho conditions
of deposit were different: the Uriconian is essentially a volcanic
formation, whilst the Longmyndian rocks are characterized by their
even sedimentation, and the author maintains that such a change of
conditions must indicate a break in time, though the unconformity
need not necessarily be very great.
    Lastly, the occurrence of* fragments of Malvernian granites and
schists (formed at great depths) in the Uriconian Conglomerates
indicates the existence of an unconformity between the holocrystal-
line and volcanic systems.

      CHANGES OF VOLUMES OF DIELECTRICS.               BY D. BOS.
         first of the three chapters into which the work is
THEtreats      of the expansion observed by Duter, which
                                                                  divided
                                                                   hollow
glass tubes and bulbs show when they are charged as Leyden jars.
  The explanation of this phenomenon is sought for by Korteweg
in the electrical pressure upon the sides of the flask. The author
finds a sufficiently close agreement between the measurements
made by Quincke and the calculations of Korteweg, if the magni
tudes occurring in the formula—the dielectric constant, the differ
ence of potential of the coatings, the coefficient of elasticity, and the
thickness of the glass—are determined with sufficient accuracy.
   The experiments of Julius and Korteweg with caoutchouc tubes,
which show the influence of the coefficient of elasticity by a far
greater expansion than glass tubes of the same thickness, are given
as a strong reason for the opinion that the electrical pressure is the
chief cause of the expansion.
   A small part is ascribed to the heating of the dielectric.
   In the second chapter the forces which occur during a charge of
the dielectric are calculated.     It is presupposed that with a relative
contraction    (g)  of the dielectric in the direction of the lines of
force, the dielectric constant k changes into k(1+4ag), and when
the contraction is at right angles to the lines of force, into
k(1+439).
   If F is the electromotive force at work in the dielectric, we get
in the direction of the lines of force a tension (k/ST + a<U+017F> 2)F on the
unit of surface, and at right angles to the lines of force a pressure
(k/82  – 32)F".
   The author gives the developments of these expressions given by
 Helmholtz and by Lorberg, and compares the results with the ex
 periments of Quincke on the attraction in the direction of the lines
 of force, the repulsion at right angles thereto, and the change of
 the dielectric constant with the magnitude of the electric forces.
    It is laid down that the measurements have not yet attained
 such great occuracy as will permit of a and B being determined.
    The third chapter discusses Quincke's observations of the ex
 pansions and contractions of dielectric liquids contained in a kind
 of voltameter whose plates are connected with the poles of a
charged Leyden jar.
    In agreement with Röntgen the author ascribes these changes of
 volume to a heating of the liquid, and the extremely small con
 traction of water at 0° to the very small negative coefficients of
 expansion, and to the great specific heat of water.
    With an apparatus founded on Quincke's the author finds an
 expansion with rape oil, and also with almond oil, where Quincke
 found a contraction.       By means of a thermometer it was further
 shown that on     charging  heat is produced between the plates which

             Intelligence     and Miscellaneous            Articles.                    147
follows the same course as the expansion, and is of the same order
as is required by the expansion.
   The changes of volume of gases are treated in conclusion, which
Quincke could not observe, even with very accurate instruments,
or only in one case with carbonic acid. The author doubts the
validity of the calculation made by Lippmann (Mascart and Joubert's
'
  Electricity,' translated by Atkinson, vol. i. p. 632) on the basis of
the principle of the conservation of electricity, which gives for
carbonic acid 40 times as great a contraction as that found by
Quincke, and also for other gase3 contractions which Quincke
could not have overlooked.
    From the same principle the author deduces that ideal gases
could not show any change of volume. — Inaugural Dissertation,

   The values deduced from the experiments show that incandescent
lamps exhibit somewhat different deportment as regards con
ductivity.   While the Swan lamp with a brightness of 20 candles
gives an optical useful effect of 5 per cent., Edison and 3ernstein
lamps give for the same luminosity an effect of 7 per cent.
   The optical useful effect of all the lamps increases with the
temperature.    With the highest temperature of incandescence,
this can be raised to 10 per cent. With the normal temperature

   ON THE CONDUCTIVITY                   OF SNOW.       BY    S.   A. HJELTSTROJI.
  From       the great importance in nature of the thermal deportment
of the      snow layer, the author made experiments on the daily
variations of the temperature at different depths in the snow, in
order to calculate therefrom the thermal conductivity of snow.
The bulb3 of the thermometers were at depth of          a  11, 21, and        1,
31 centim. below the surface of the snow. The snow near the
thermometers was protected against the direct rays of the sun by
a bank of snow on the south.     The weather unfortunately did not
allow of series of observations being carried on for long time.           a
   Taking the specific heat of snow as equal to that of ice, 0-50, and
for its density the value determined on the spot           the author,        by
0-183, the absolute couducting-power may be determined from
Angstrom's formula to be
                0-0269,         0-0343,      0-0302,    Mean 0-0304,
the units being C.G.S. The conductivity of snow          accordingly          is
about one seventh that of moist clav (0-226). — (Efvers. Act. Stock

     HAVE       attempted     in the following pages to develop
      a method of expressing the various processes which
 occur in the electric field in terms of changes in the form or
position of tubes of electrostatic induction which are assumed
to be distributed throughout the field, in the hope that it may
help the student to obtain a physical interpretation of results
which are perhaps too frequently regarded as entirely ex
pressed by equations.        Methods such as this, of materializing,
as it were, mathematical conceptions, seem to have a use even
where, as in the case of Electricity, the analytical theory is
well established ; for any method which enables us to form a
mental picture of what goes on in the electric field has a
freshness and a power of rapidly giving the main features of
a phenomenon, as distinct from the details, which few can
hope to derive from purely analytical methods.           Experience
has,  I  think,   shown    that  Maxwell's    conception  of electric
displacement is    of  somewhat    too  general a  character to lend
itself easily to the formation of a conception of a mechanism
which would illustrate by its working the processes going on
in the electric field.       For this purpose the conception of
tubes  of electrostatic  induction    introduced by Faraday seems
to possess many advantages.            If we regard these tubes as
                                                   I
having a real physical existence, we may, as shall endeavour

 150                 Prof. J. J. Thomson on   the
to show, explain the various electrical processes, —such as the
passage of electricity through metals, liquids, or gases, the
 production of a current, magnetic force, the induction of
 currents, and so on, — as arising from the contraction or elonga
 tion of such tubes and their motion through the electric
 field.
    We might, as we shall see, have taken the tubes of mag
 netic force as the quantity by which to express all the changes
 in the electric field ; the reason   I  have chosen the tubes of
 electrostatic induction is that the intimate relation between
 electrical charges and atomic structure seems to point to the
 conclusion that it is the tubes of electrostatic induction which
 are most directly involved in the many cases in which
 electrical charges are accompanied by chemical ones.
    We may regard the method from one, point of view as
 being a kind of molecular theory of electricity, the properties
 of the electric field being explained as the effects produced
 by the motion of multitudes of tubes of electrostatic induc
 tion ; just as in the molecular theory of gases the properties
 of the gas are explained as the result of the motion of its
 molecules.
    As the principal reason for expressing the effects in terms
 of the tubes of electrostatic induction is the close connexion
 between electrical and chemical properties, we shall begin by
 considering at some length the connexion between these
 tubes of electrostatic induction and the atoms of bodies.
    We assume, then, that the electric field is full of tubes of
 electrostatic induction, that these are all of the same strength,
 and that this strength is such that when a tube falls on a
 conductor it corresponds to a negative charge on the con
 ductor equal in amount to the charge which in electrolysis
 we find associated with an atom of a univalent element.
    These tubes must either form closed circuits or they must
 end on atoms, any unclosed tube being a tube connecting two
 atoms. In this respect the tubes resemble lines of vorticity in
 hydrodynamics, as these lines must either be closed, or have
 their extremities on a boundary of the fluid.
    We may suppose that associated with these tubes of electro
 static induction there is a distribution of velocity, both in
 themselves and in the surrounding aether, and that the energy
due to this motion of the medium constitutes the energy
 which is distributed throughout the electric field. In addi
tion to there being this energy in the medium, the incidence
of a tube of force on an atom may modify the internal motion
of the atom, and thus alter its energy, so that, in addition to
the energy in the field, there may be a certain amount of

                   Properties of the Electric Field.             151
 energy due to the alteration in the motion of the atoms : this
 may be represented by the addition to the ordinary expres
 sion for the energy of a term w for each atom on which a
 unit tube falls, — w for each atom which a tube leaves ; we shall
 suppose that w depends on the nature of the atom, that it is
 not the same for zinc as for copper and so on.      The existence
 of this energy will produce the same effect as if the atoms of
 different substances attracted electricity with different degrees
 of intensity : this is the assumption made hy von Helmholtz,
and it has been shown by him to be sufficient to account for
contact electricity.
    The ends of an unclosed tube of induction are places where
 electrification exists, and therefore are always situated on
 matter. According to our view, the ends of a tube of finite
length are on free atoms as distinct from molecules, the
atoms in the molecule being connected by a short tube whose
length is of the order of the molecular distance.          On this
view, therefore, the existence of free electricity, whether on
a metal, an electrolyte, or a gas, always denotes the existence
of free atoms.        The production of electrification must be
accompanied by chemical dissociation, the disappearance of it
by chemical combination ; changes in electrification are on
this view always accompanied by chemical changes. This was
long thought to be a peculiarity of the passage of electricity
through electrolytes, but recent experiments seem to show that
it is also the case when electricity passes through gases.
Thus, for example, those gases which conduct readily when
hot are those which dissociate when heated, and are thus
undergoing chemical changes when the electricity passes
through them.       Again, it is known that the passage of elec
tricity through many gases causes chemical changes to take
place — the production of ozone is the most familiar instance
of this, but there are a multitude of others.        Lastly, R. v.
Helmholtz      and   Richarz  have  found   that  when  electricity
passes through a gas, a steam-jet in the neighbourhood is
influenced in the same way as it is when free atoms are pro
duced by chemical changes.        All these results seem to point
to the conclusion that the passage of electricity through gases
is accompanied by changes in the pairing of the atoms of the
gas.    Althongh we have no such direct evidence of the same
effect when electricity passes through metals, it must be
borne in mind that direct evidence in tins case is very much
more difficult to obtain, and there are many reasons for taking
the view that the passage of electricity through metals is
performed in much the same way as it is through electrolytes
and gases.

152                     Prof.     J. J. Thomson       on the
   We will begin by considering how metallic conduction
differs from electrolytic. In the first place, as the tempera
ture increases the conductivity of electrolytes, as a general
rule, increases, while that of metals diminishes.              This rule
is not, however, without exceptions : there are cases in which,
though the conduction is not usually supposed to be electro
lytic, the conductivity increases as the temperature increases.
   'arbon is a striking instance of this, and quite lately Feussner
has prepared alloys of manganese and copper whose con
ductivities show the same peculiarity.           These exceptions are
 sufficient to show that increase of     conductivity     with the tem
 perature is not a sufficient test to separate electrolytic from
 metallic conduction.
    If  we regard the passage of electricity through a body as
 essentially bound up with chemical changes, it does not seem
 surprising that an increase in temperature may produce
 opposite effects on the conductivities of two substances, even
 though in both cases the conduction was effected by changes
 in the pairings of the atoms.         For the action of an increase
 of temperature has a two-fold effect on the processes which,
 on this view, accompany electric conduction.               In the first
 place, it may promote the splitting up of the molecules into
 atoms which, on this theory, forms one part of the process of
 conduction ; but, on the other hand, after the molecules are
 split up it retards their reunion, which forms another part of
 the process.       And, again, an increase in the temperature
 increases the distance between the molecules, and this will
 also retard the rate at which chemical interchange takes
 place. The fact that the metals are solids is no reason why
 the conductivity through them should not be electrolytic in
 its  nature, for there are many instances           solid electrolytes;
                                                        of
 thus Lehmann has shown that electrolysis takes place through
a    crystal  of  silver iodide placed between silver electrodes
 without   any   change    being perceptible       the shape
                                                       in          sizeor        of
 the   crystal,  though      itwas watched     through       microscope

                                          the  elementary   metals;    the
  case   of alloys seems more hopeful           but Professor Roberts
                                                 ;
 Austen has examined several alloys through which               powerful
                                                                   a
 current had been      passed    without   detecting  any   difference           in
 the composition        ofthe alloy      at
                                         the terminals.      This result
 does not, however, seem            to
                                    me    toprove that the conduction
 was not electrolytic        ;for some alloys are little more than
  mixtures, whilst others behave         as
                                          ifthey were solutions        one  of

metal in another; and in neither of these cases could we
expect to get any change in the composition of the alloy at
the electrodes.     w.   could only expect to find this when we
 used an alloy in which the connexion between the constituents
could be regarded as of such a definite character that in the
molecule of the alloy one metal could be regarded as the
    sitive, the other as the negative element.        The alloys used
  y Prof. Roberts Austen do not seem to have been of this
character. The reasons which account for the absence of
change in the constitution of the alloy at the electrodes will
also account for the absence of polarization.
   Though the electrical conductivities of the metals are enor
mously greater than those of electrolytes, there does not seem
to be any abrupt change from the conductivity in cases where
it is manifestly electrolytic, such as fused lead chloride, to
those in which it is not recognized as being of that nature, as
in carbon. The following table, giving the electric conduc
tivity of some substances, will show this:—
               Silver .   .    .   .   .  .  .  .   .  63

   There is a greater disproportion between the thermal con
ductivities of silver and cement than there is between the
electrical conductivities of mercury and fused lead chloride;
but no one argues that, on this account, the method by which
heat is propagated in silver is essentially different from that
 by which it is propagated in cement.
   It is also suggestive that the substances which are inter
mediate in their chemical properties between the metals and
the non-metals, such as phosphorus, selenium, and tellurium,
possess properties with regard to metallic conduction inter
mediate between those of metals and electrolytes, thus, as
shown by W. Siemens, the resistance of some of the modifi
cations of selenium increases with the temperature, while that
of other modifications diminishes, and that some of the modi
fications seem to show polar effects,        thus, when one electrode
is large    and the other    small,  the current is greater when the
large electrode is negative than when it is positive. The
changes in the chemical properties of the substance seem to
 proceed step by step with the changes in their behaviour with
 regard to electrical conduction.
     f we accept the electromagnetic theory of light, we have

154                      Prof.   J. J.   Thomson on   the
an additional reason for supposing that the processes con
cerned in metallic conduction are the same as those in electro
lytic.   For the opacity of thin metal films is enormously less
than that theory would indicate, if the conductivity of the film
for the very rapid electrical vibrations which constitute light
were the same as for steady currents.          In this respect the
metals behave very much like electrolytes, for these act as
dielectrics to the light vibrations and as conductors for steady
or oscillating currents, provided the period of vibration is very
much greater than that of the light-vibrations.        On the view
we have taken of metallic conduction, since the process of disso
ciation and recombination takes a finite time, if the polarization
is reversed in less than this time, the old polarization will not
have had time to disappear before the new is superposed, and
 the metal will, under these circumstances, behave more like
 an insulator than a conductor.
    We can easily find an expression for the time T taken by a
 tube of electrostatic induction to disappear (that     to contract
                                                                 is,
 to a length comparable with that between the atoms of                         a

least trace        of conductivity, such as water or alcohol, have
  specific    inductive     capacities ranging from 70 to 100, it is
  probable that for good conductors K is exceedingly large.
 Jf,   however, its value for metals were no greater than that for
  distilled water, the time required for the disappearance of                     a
  tube of force would be comparable with the time of vibration
  of a    light-wave  ;   so that the conductivity would be much
  smaller for these wave3 than for steady currents.
     We may picture to ourselves the tubes of electrostatic
  induction shortening in        a    conductor in some such way as the
  following   :  —  Let  us  take  the    case of    acondenser discharging
 through the gas separating its plates. Then, before discharge,
  we have a tube stretching from an atom                     on the positive

 of the field increases the tube in the molecule AB will
 lengthen and bend towards the tube OP, until when the field
is    sufficiently strong the molecular tube runs up into the
tube OP.          Trie tubes then break up into two tubes OA and
 PB, and the tube OA shortens to molecular dimensions.
The result of this operation         is    that the tube PO has shortened
to PB, and the atoms        0     andA       have formed     molecule.

process   is    then  continued     from     molecule to molecule until the
tube PO has contracted to molecular dimensions.                    Instead of
the tube PO jumping from molecule to molecule, several
 molecules may form         a   chain and be affected at once in this   ;
case the tube would shorten by the length of the chain in the
same time as on the previous hypothesis                    shortened
                                                          it                by

distance between two molecules.
     The remarkable agreement between the values of the
velocity of the ions as calculated by Hittorf and Kohlrausch
and those found        by   Prof. Lodge in the experiments described
in the British Association Report, 1887, makes                     itessential
that any theory of conduction through electrolytes should lead
to the same expressions for the ionic velocities. According to
the preceding theory of conduction,                  ifthe molecules of the
electrolyte form chains between the electrodes, the sum of the

which is the same as the expression for the sum of the
velocities given by Kohlrausch.         The ratio of the velocities
will follow exactly the same way from the migration-data
whichever theory we adopt ; so that there is nothing in
 Prof. Lodge's confirmation of Kohlrausch's expressions for
the velocity of the ions inconsistent with the theory of con
duction we are describing.
   We will now leave the consideration of the behaviour of
these tubes in conductors, and proceed to discuss their pro
perties when moving through the dielectric.
   Let /, g, h denote the number of unit tubes parallel to the
axes of x, y, z respectively — in other words, the components
of the electric displacement ; and let us suppose that these
tubes are moving with the velocity u, v, w parallel to the
axes of coordinates.
   Let us consider the increase in the number of tubes parallel
to x which occurs in a time St in an element of volume
dx, dy, dz.
   The increase due to the passage of the tubes across the
faces of the element is
   The increase   due to the deformation       of the tubes inside
the element is

In other words,        a       moving tube              of electrostatic induction

multiplied by its velocity at right angles to its direction.
The direction of the force is such that the magnetic force
and rotation from the direction of motion to that of the tube
are related like translation and rotation in a right-angled
screw.
  Let us first consider the case where all the tubes are moving
with the same velocity in a field whose magnetic permeability
is unity.

taken round a closed circuit is equal to
  tf{'(£-2MS-2)~<£-f)}*.
taken over any surface entirely surrounded hy the circuit, if
I, m, n are the direction-cosines of the normal to the surface,
we see by (4) that the line-integral of the electromotive force
taken round a closed circuit is equal to the rate of diminution
of the number of lines of magnetic force passing through the
circuit.
    Collecting these results, we see that a tube of electrostatic
 induction when in motion produces (I) a magnetic force at
right angles to the tube and the direction of motion, (2) a
 momentum at right angles to the tube and the magnetic force
 produced by         (3) an electromotive intensity at right angles
                     it,
 to the direction of motion of the tube and the magnetic force
  produced      by
                 it.
    The momentum and the electromotive intensity are thus
 both in the plane containing the direction of the tube and its
 velocity   ;the first of these is at right angles to the tube, the
  second  to the  velocity.
     We have hitherto only considered the case of one tube, or
  rather of set of tubes, moving with
            a                                common velocity. We  a
  can, however, without difficulty extend these results to the

where a bar placed over any quantity indicates that the
mean value of the quantity is to be taken.
     Thus, when a system of tubes of electrostatic induction is
in motion, the electromotive intensity is at right angles both
to the resultant magnetic force and the mean velocity, and
is equal to the product of these two quantities into the sine of
 the angle between them.
     From the preceding equations, we see that if we have a great
 number of positive and negative tubes moving about, if
 the positive tubes move in one direction and the negative
 ones in the opposite, there will be a resultant magnetic force,
  but if there are as many positive as negative tubes in each
  unit of volume, there will De no resultant momentum ; and if
  there are as many moving in one direction as the opposite,
  there will be no resultant electromotive intensity, due to the
  motion of these tubes.             We see then that when the electro
  magnetic     field   is  in a  steady     state, the motion of the tubes of
  electrostatic    induction     in  the   field   will be a kind of shearing
  of the positive past the negative tubes, the positive tubes
   moving at one direction, and the negative at an equal rate in
  the opposite.        When, however, the field is not in a steady
  state,  this  ceases    to be the case, and then the electromotive
   forces due to     induction     are developed.

   When the tabes of electrostatic induction enter a conductor,
their ends, as we have seen, get attached to atoms of the con
ductor, and the momentum of the tube gets transferred to the
conductor.    Let us consider a small portion of a conductor
conveying a current, the area of the portion being so small
that we may consider the magnetic force over it to be con
stant.  The momentum parallel to x of a tube entering it is
                                          gy-kp         ;

have come from the right if B had been absent will be absorbed

then, in consequence of this external magnetic force, the
closed tubes of electrostatic induction will be moving about
in the field, the positive tubes going one way and the nega

one of these tubes gons through the sphere.          ySj and     are     If        /83

because on one side of the sphere the magnetic force due to
the motion of the sphere acts in the same direction as the
external magnetic force, but on the other side of the sphere
it acts in the opposite direction.    Thus the momentum of the
tube parallel to x      not the same when
                               is               leaves the sphere it
as before     entered, so that the space inside the sphere must
                 it
have gained or lost momentum.

portion of this circuit, which we may consider straight, the
tubes of electrostatic  induction will be parallel to the circuit
and moving radially, the positive tubes (i.e. those parallel to
the direction of the current) moving inwards, the negative
ones outwards      the positive tubes move in to the conductor

       In those parts of the field where there is no resultant
    electromotive     intensity there will be as many positive as
    negative tubes in the field, and when the field is steady the
    positive ones will flow as fast in one direction as the negative
    ones in the opposite.         Lot us consider a region close to the
    circuit which we may hero consider straight ; let h be the
    sum of the strengths of the positive tubes in a unit of the
   area at right angles to the current, u their radial velocity, h'
   the sum of the strengths of the negative tubes, u' their radial
   velocity.      Then in unit time the number of positive tubes
   flowing    in plus the number of negative ones flowing out of any
   cylinder coaxial with the wire, must equal i the intensity of
   the current.      If r is the radius of such a cylinder, the number
   of positive tubes flowing in in unit time is Am x 2irr, the
   number of negative ones flowing out h'u' x 2nr ; hence we
   have

   if $   is the magnetic force at the surface of the cylinder; as
   this is at right angles both to the direction of the tubes and
  also to their velocity, it will be tangential to the cylinder

ones; in this case S«=0, and there is no electromotive force
due to the motion of the tube.             When the current is first
started the positive tubes move in before the negative ones
begin to move out, so that in this case 2u is positive, and
 hence the electromotive force is negative, i. e. in the opposite
direction to the current. When the current is suddenly
 stopped, the inward flow of tubes is stopped, but the out
 ward one continues for some time ; in this case 2u is negative
 and the electromotive force is therefore positive, i. e. in the
 direction of the original current.

 experiments such as those made by Rowland on the magnetic
 effects produced by the rotation of electrified disks.       Let us
 consider a parallel plate-condenser        rotating with an angulnr

 Let h be the electric displacement parallel to z; then the com
 ponents of the magnetic force due to the motion of the tubes
 whose ends are on the plates of the condenser are given by
                               /3=4"7rcoyh,

 These values do not satisfy the solenoidal condition
                           dx     dy    dz
 So that inside the condenser we must have, in addition to the
 motion of those tubes which end on the plates of the con
 denser, a system of closed tubes in motion such that, while
 they do not alter the electric displacement, they alter the
 magnetic force.       Thus we must have positive tubes moving
 in one direction and an equal number of negative ones
 moving in the opposite.         If  the motion of these tubes were
 confined    to  the  inside  of  the  condenser there would be no
  magnetic force outside the condenser, as the tubes of electro
  static induction outside are then all at rest, and it would follow
  that in this case there would be no magnetic force outside or
  inside. As this is not consistent with the results of Rowland's
  experiments, we shall suppose that these closed tubes pass
  right through the condenser, their motion being continuous
  from the inside to the out.         The magnetic force due to the
  motion of these tubes will therefore be continuous as we cross
  the plates of the condenser.        In consequence, however, of the

condenser, they are derived from         potential, that they every

that each moving charge          of electricity produced the same

                                                r     is
from the axis of rotation.
    Hitherto we have only considered non-magnetic substances.
We shall now proceed to discuss the differences which occur
when the tubes of electrostatic induction are moving through
iron or some other magnetic substance.
    If a,   b,
            c   are the components     of the magnetic induction,
a,      7   those of the magnetic force,       the energy in unit

and   if
       the magnetism      entirely

                                                                        is    the mag
netic permeability, this equals
   From this expression for the kinetic energy we can deduce
the components of momentum and electromotive intensity due
toa  moving tube of electrostatic induction in the same way
as we deduced equations (2) and (3).    Doing so, we find for
U,    W, the components cf momentum, the expressions
      V,
                         U=/*Oy—               A/3)   =gc—hb,

                         W=n(fp-g*)=fb-9a.
And for     X, Y,      Z,    the components            of the electromotive force
                         X=     (J,   (wj8 —   vy) =       wb — vc,
                         Y=/jL(uy—wa) = itc— Tea,
                         Z    = fi{vu—uP)             =va—Tib.
Thus when        a    tube   of electrostatic induction               is   moving with

170                        Prof.   J. J. Thomson   on the
the same velocity through places of given magnetic force,
the momentum     it possesses and the electromotive force it
produces are proportional to the magnetic permeability of the
substance through which it is moving.     Hence the expres
sions for the mechanical force on a conductor conveying a
current, and the electromotive force arising from electro
magnetic induction, which we have deduced for non-magnetic
substances, will be true for magnetic ones if we replace the
magnetic force by the magnetic induction.
   When the tubes are moving through a field partly occupied
by iron, since the inertia of the tubes on the iron is very
much greater than in the air, the flow of the tubes through
the field will be affected by the iron in much the same way
as the flow of a current of electricity would be affected if
the air were replaced by a good conductor of electricity and
the iron by a bad one.
   We shall now consider some problems in which iron is in
the field, selecting two-dimensional ones, as in these we avoid
as much as possible purely mathematical difficulties.
   Let us first take the case when an infinitely long cylinder
whose axis is at right angles to the plane of the paper is
introduced into a uniform magnetic field, the lines of force
being parallel to the plane of the paper and horizontal.     The
tubes of electrostatic induction which are perpendicular to
the plane of the paper were before the introduction of the
iron moving vertically.     When the bar is introduced they
will avoid      and will spread out so that their paths are like
                it,
the lines of equipotential surfaces which are given for this
case in plate xv. of Maxwell's 'Electricity and Magnetism;'
the lines of magnetic force which are at right angles to the
lines of flow of the tubes will therefore be the lines of force
given in that figure.
   Let us now consider the conditions which must be fulfilled
at the surface separating iron from air in the general case
when the field       not assumed to be uniform.
                       is                              It   Iftheis

 S/jR must be continuous as we cross the surface, otherwise
there would be an accumulation or the reverse of tubes at
the surface.    Now 47r2/tR      the tangential magnetic force;
                                         is
thus the tangential magnetic force must be continuous as we
cross the surface.      Again, the momentum parallel to the
surface   of  will not be altered as
               a    tube               crosses the surface.

                                  p= Wi
 lli  other words, the normal induction is constant.               Hence
 we have arrived at the usual boundary conditions                 for  the
 lines of magnetic force.
     The intensity of magnetization at the surface is
                       (p-p1)/4>ir=llh(t-tl),
 where t and f, are the tangential velocities of the tubes in
 air and iron respectively.
     That, from this point of view, magnetization corresponds
 to a discontinuity in the tangential velocity of the tubes of
 electrostatic induction.
     We can easily prove from this consideration that if the
lines of flow of the tubes coincide both inside and outside the
cylinder with those due to a solid cylinder moving vertically
through an incompressible fluid, the distribution of magnetic
force will be that produced by the cylinder, if uniformly mag
netized in the horizontal direction.
    W e have not hitherto determined the volocity with which
the tubes of electrostatic induction are moving.               Wo may,
however, easily     do  this   when   the   electromotive    intensity   is
entirely due to the motion of       the  tubes.    For,  in this case  X,
the x component of the electromotivo intensity, is given by
the equation
                 = iTTfi\w(w/—uh) — v{ug—vh)          \,
                 = 4tt/x j (ms + + to2)/- u («/+     vg  + wh) \ ,
with similarly expressions      for Y   and Z.
Since
we see
                                          I
                       u2  + v2 + vr'=~,     ,
and                    uf+ vg + wh = 0.
Hence, in this case, the tubes are moving through the medium
at right angles to themselves with the velocity of light.

XXII.            On   the Measurement     of Dielectric Constants by means
                 of Hertz Oscillations.       By Ernst Lecher*.
           can be no doubt that tbe agreement demanded by
THERE
   Maxwell's     theory between the dielectric constant and
the square of the refractive index does not hold good in the
majority of cases ; and therefore, if we still wish to regard
Maxwell's theory as true, disturbing secondary phenomena
arise which alter the value of the dielectric constant as or
dinarily determined.       In the case of perfect insulators —
whose number         however, very small — satisfactory agree
                         is,                              a
ment has already been found      but with less perfect insulators
                                         ;
the discrepancies are very considerable.     Now Schiller has            f
shown that for some substances the dielectric constants,
measured with       very short time of charge, fulfil Maxwell's
                         a
condition more nearly than in experiments with statical
electricity.   Moreover, the experiments and theoretical con
siderations of Cohn and Arons seem to point to an increase
                                          J
of dielectric constants with time of charge. The idea there
fore suggests itself that the agreement with Maxwell's theory
only holds for tbe case of an extremely short time of charge.
    Starting with similar ideas,              J. J.
                                        Thomson    has measured     §
some dielectric constants                by
                                  the aid of Hertz oscillations.
More recently, without any knowledge of Thomson's work,
I  have carried out almost identical experiments.       As, how
ever, my results differ from those of Thomson,        venture to     I
communicate them.
I     found, to wit, that in the case of four substances which
I  investigated, the dielectric constant calculated from the
capacity in the simple manner about to be described not only
did not sink, but actually became greater, when Hertz
oscillations were used.
    Although have used the term " dielectric constant," this
                   I
is really not quite accurate.      have only compared capacities
                                         I
with each other, in which either air or the substance to be
investigated was placed between the plates.        Consequently
in my results, in addition to dielectric action, we have con
duction, residual charge, and other unknown errors creeping

into the calculation.      It might have been expected that these
secondary effects, conduction, &c. would be entirely eliminated
by the rapidly alternating charges of a Hertz oscillation ; it
appears, however, that even with such extremely short times
of charge the secondary effects still increase the value of the
dielectric constant, and indeed in a greater degree than before ;
             of course, that we assume the truth of Maxwell's

     I have investigated two solid bodies, ebonite and glass, and
 two liquids, petroleum oil and water, by means of three dif
 ferent methods.      The times of charge were 05, 5 x 10~*, and
 3 x 10~8 seconds respectively.
                Experiments with Hertz Oscillations.
     In a previously published paper on the study of phenomena
 of electric resonance *, I have already given a full investi
 gation of all the conditions necessary in measurements by this
 method.       In the present experiments exactly the same
 apparatus was used. In two parallel wires (fig. 1) st and s't',
 31 centim. apart, and each of length 1122 centim. (represented
 in the figure by broken lines), electric oscillations are excited

  each of length 69*7 centim., lead to two circular condenser-
  plates, each of radius R=9-68 centim.: these latter can be
  moved parallel to each other by the aid of a micrometer-
  screw. On bridging over the leading wires at certain places
  with a metal slider, the vacuum-tube gg' begins to glow.
   Every alteration of the capacity at the end of the wires dis
  places the ventral segment of the oscillation, and the slider
  must therefore be brought to a new position in order to make
  the tube glow once more.
      I next measured very exactly the wave-length of a few
  oscillations with air alone between the condenser-plates.    After
   this, the condenser-disks were screwed apart, and the sub
   stance to be investigated placed between them.         By a few

 174             Ernst Lecher on    the Measurement    of
 rough preliminary experiments the approximate relation be
 tween the position of the ventral segment and the distance
 apart of the plates was found, and then the position of the
 ventral segment was determined as accurately as possible for
 one or two of the distances found above.        Thus, finally, in the
 two cases which    I  compared together, the fundamental oscil
 lation was the same ; the slider was in exactly the same
 position, only the distance apart of the condenser-plates at the
 ends of the wires was different, according as air or the sub
stance experimented upon happened to be between them.
 Since in the two cases everything remained absolutely the
 same down to the capacities at the ends,      I  inferred that these
capacities were also equal to each other, and thus the dielectric
constant of the substance under examination (or rather the
quantity to which this name is often erroneously given) could
be determined in a simple manner.
    If the space between the condenser-plates was filled with
air we had, corresponding to distances apart of the plates,
     0-791, 0-830, 0-870,    ....    1-146, 1-186, 1-227, 1-266,
                        1-324, 1-360 centim.,
the following numbers as the mean distances            of the ventral
segment a from the end s of the wire,
     641-48, 633-68, 629-18,     ....   592-74, 586-72, 583-84,
                 580-35, 573 65, 570-54 centiin. ;
and further, corresponding to an air-condenser with plates,
                1-146, 1-186, 1-227, 1-266 centim.
apart, the mean distances of the ventral segment          c  from the
end s of the wire were respectively
           1045-74,  1043-70,    1041-73, 1038-64 centim.
   The meaning of a and c is the same as in the paper on
electric resonance previously referred to. The wave-lengths in
the two cases are in the proportion of 1 to 2.              For each
distance apart of the condenser-plates,     ten adjustments of the
slider were made.        After every measurement the slider was
displaced by    an assistant  to such a distance that the vacuum-
tube became quite dark, so that each new adjustment was
found by drawing the slider along the wires with extremely
great care.    In spite of this, the greatest deviations amounted
to 5-6 centim., but usually they were smaller than this.           In

       Dielectric Constants by means of Hertz Oscillations.                    175
1800    adjustments    which     I   have       made   altogether,            there
occurred on three occasions      only a deviation from the mean
value amounting to 5 centim.*
                           I
    From these numbers drew three curves, and endeavoured
to bring the new ventral segment after the insertion of the
substance under investigation within the limits just found,
this being easily accomplished by suitably altering the dis
tance between the condenser-plates.
   Ebonite.—If a plate of ebonite, 0.7164 centim. thick, was
                                            I
placed between the condenser-plates, obtained, correspondin
to distances between the condenser-plates of 1266 and 1.701
centim. respectively, for the ventral segment a the values
641-63 and 585.46 centim.; and for the ventral segment c
corresponding to 1701 centim. distance between plates,                            I
obtained 1040-92 centim.
    The thickness of the ebonite plate was measured by means
 of a micrometer-screw specially constructed for the purpose,
and fixed in a brass frame. This brass frame was so large that
the screw could be brought to any point on the dielectric.
That portion of the ebonite plate which lay between the con
denser-plates was divided up into squares, and the thickness
of the ebonite was measured at the corners of these squares.
The value given above is the mean of measurements taken at
twenty different places; and Boltzmann f has shown that this
 mathematical mean is to be taken, within the limits of error,
as the true thickness of the dielectric.
    The first of the ventral segments just found, 641-63 centim.,
 corresponds on the curve mentioned above to a separation of
 the condenser-plates of 0-791 centim., when air alone is be
 tween them.      Therefore the capacity of the condenser, with
 plates. 0.791 centim. apart and air only between them, is the
 same as that of the condenser with plates 1266 centim. apart
and the ebonite disk between them. The difference, 0.475
centim., represents the increase of thickness of the condenser
in consequence of the insertion of the ebonite plate.
    For the position of the second ventral segment, 585.46
 centim., we had in the air-condenser a thickness of 1206
 centim., and after inserting the ebonite it became 1701 centim.
 The difference is 0.495 centim.

  176               Ernst Lecher on    the Measurement      of
  really be equal.        Since the discrepancy follows no sort of
 role either here or in later cases, and since the values are
  sometimes too great and sometimes too small, both for the
  ventral segment a and the ventral segment c, the latter of
 which corresponds to a vibration twice as rapid as the former,
 and finally seeing that there appears to be no definite relation
  between the discrepancies and the distance apart of the con
 denser-plates, we must attribute them to errors in the measure
 ments, and most of all to the difficulty of moving the plates
 parallel to each other. The above agreement of the results
 with each other would, however, be fairly satisfactory; but it
 obviously becomes worse when we pass to the actual calcula
 tion of the dielectric constant ; the deviation then becomes
 greater as the dielectric constant itself increases.           In this and
 all other cases     I take the mean of these differences and make
 use of it in determining the dielectric constant.
     The mean of the three measurements given above is 0"479
 centim.       The value so calculated is subtracted from the
 thickness of the dielectric (0'716) ; this thickness, divided by
 the difference (0 237), gives the dielectric constant*.                For
 ebonite,    I thus obtain 3'01 as the value of the dielectric con
 stant for such short times of charge as are measured by
 hundred millionths of a second.
     The half wave-length of the shorter oscillation c was about
1000 centim.
    * Note
            by Translator: — Perhaps the following will make the process of
calculation more clear: —
    Let C be the capacity of the condenser in each case, A the area of each
of its plates. For the condenser with air alone let f , be the thickness of
air (i. e. the distance between the plates).   Finally, for the ebonite con
denser of total thickness lv let there be a thickness f , — e of air, and a
thickness e of ebonite whose specific inductive capacity is k.

  Glass-If      a glass plate 0-8797 centim. thick was placed
between the    condenser-plates   I obtained, corresponding to
distances between the plates of 1:582 and 1954 centim., for a,
the positions 634.57 and 587-54 centim.; and corresponding to
                 I
1954 centim., found for c the position 1042-74 centim.
   These numbers were used in the same manner as the
previous ones. The distance apart of the condenser-disks
differs, according as the glass is inserted or not, by 0-758,
0.767, and 0.753 centim. The value of the dielectric con
stant is found to be 7-31.
   Petroleum.—In order to bring a layer of liquid between
the condenser-plates,      I
                           took a wooden ring whose internal
diameter was 14 centim.       On each face was fastened a thin
glass plate, and thus a disk-shaped space was formed for the
reception of the liquid.    The thickness of the whole system
was measured in thirty places, the liquid having been first
inserted, in order to take account of the bulging produced
by the pressure of the liquid against the sides of the vessel.
The thickness of the two glass plates had also been previously
measured in thirty places before cementing them on the ring.
From these data the thickness of the liquid film could be
calculated exactly.
  If   the two glass plates 0.4338 centim. thick were inserted
between the condenser-plates, separated 1-590 centim., the
ventral segment a was situated 583-93 centim. from the end
of the wire; the same ventral segment corresponds to an air
condenser of 1223 centim. thickness.         The difference was
0.367. We obtain thus for the dielectric constant of the
 glass used (“Solinglas.”) 6:50, which number, however, may
 be less accurate than the others given in this paper, because
 the glass plates were too thin.
    In order to obtain the dielectric constant of petroleum,    I
 next found 571-93 for the ventral segment when petroleum
 and two glass disks were between the condenser-plates, these
 latter being separated by a distance of 2-848 centim.       For
 the same ventral segment an air-condenser of thickness 1-348
 centim. was required. The difference of these numbers 1:500
 must be reduced by 0:367, which number, as shown above,
 expresses the effect of the two glass disks. After taking away
 the layer of petroleum alone, whose thickness was 19272
 centim. (the glass disk still remaining in position), I had to
 diminish the distance apart of the condenser-plates by 1-133
 centim. to make     itscapacity the same   asbefore; and thus I
 obtain the value 2.42 as the dielectric constant of petroleum.
  The petroleum used was the common commercial liquid           as
used for burning, and contained some water.

  178             Ernst Lecher on         the Measurement       of
      Water. — If   I  poured into the wooden ring distilled water
 (the   thickness    of   the water alone being 1*9342 centim.), I
  found, with condenser-plates 3"160 centim. apart, a ventral
  segment a at 635*47 centim.
     The difference calculated as in the case of petroleum gives
 in this case 1953 centim. for a thickness l-934 centim. of the
 dielectric.    The error of experiment is therefore now too
 great,   and  if  I   wished to calculate the dielectric constant
 from these data as before, its value would be infinite.
              Experiments with Ruhmhorf Oscillations.
     In the determination        of the dielectric constant by means of
 Ruhmkorff oscillations,          I  have adopted a method which is
 very convenient and simple and permits very exact measure
 ments to be made.           This method is in many respects similar
 to that used by Gordon *, but is much simpler.                    One pole of
 a small induction apparatus R (fig. 2) is put to earth; from
 the second pole one connexion is made to the condenser C
 and a second one to the comparison condenser E.                      The other
 two plates of these condensers,             C   and E', are connected to
 the two quadrants q and q' of an
 electrometer by means of two
 parallel wires.        The needle I of
 the electrometer is put to earth.
The action of this arrangement is
immediately seen.           If the two con
densers are equal, both quadrants
are alternately charged and dis
charged in the same manner, and
the needle remains at rest.            If   the
one condenser      is stronger,     the   elec
trometer-needle          is    momentarily
deflected towards the correspond
ing quadrant.
     The plate to be experimented on,
xa/, was then placed between the
disks of the condenser CO, and the
other one EE' (an ordinary Kohl-
rausch plate-condenser) was roughly adjusted.                        The final
adjustment was        made     by   the   micrometer-screw        of   the con-

been communicated      to the Vienna Academy (16th May, 1890), the con
temporary work of Donle was published (VVied. Ann. xl p. 307, 1890).
Our methods are almost identical, except that       I use in place of an electro-
dynamometor an electrometer, which         I consider in several respects more
simple and advantageous.

          previous experiments. The electrometer-deflexions were read
          bythe aid of a telescope.
           This method is surprisingly sensitive ; the adjustments are
         very easily made, and moreover transient disturbances are
         easily recognized by the suddenness with which the effect
         appears ; the raising of a hand, or a person passing, causes a
         momentary deflexion of the electrometer-needle *.
            After the adjustment had been made with the plate xx* be-
         the condenser-disks, xx1 was removed and then, without any
         alteration whatever in EE', the plates CC were made to
         approach each other, until the electrometer-needle returned
         to zero.

         collected together. The numbers give the distance apart of

previous section, except that a small influence-machine is
used in place of the in                Its terminals were only
separated by 0:05 centim., so that the sparks which passed and
the potential differences were quite small. The one terminal
was put to earth, and the other was connected for about 0:5
second with the point r.    The adjustment and comparison of
the two condensers took place exactly as before.
   For water and petroleum no measurements could be ob
tained by this method, because in this case wai' acted as an
earth-connected screen.    In order to bring the needle to zero,
I had to remove E' to an infinite distance from E, so great
was the conduction due to the small amount of water which
the petroleum contained.

    The dielectric constant, if we reckon it simply from the
capacity as in this paper and as                  J.   J. Thomson has done, is
for quick oscillations not only not smaller, but, on the contrary,
much larger. In all the substances investigated we have found
the same phenomenon, and the differences found are too great
for us to assume that they arise from secondary sources
of error.       I  am therefore of opinion, contrary to                J. J.   Thom
son, that in general we shall not be able to arrive at the truo
dielectric constant even by the aid of Hertz oscillations.
    For the time of oscillation, neglecting certain terms which
need not here be considered, we have
                                T2=LS(\2         + tts),
where L is the self-induction, S the capacity, and X the
coefficient of damping.             This damping (A.) increases as the
oscillations      become     more    rapid, and it is probable that in our
Hertz oscillation the lag produced in this swing by damping
is the chief cause of the increase which we have found in the
dielectric constant.            The phenomena taking place in the
dielectric with such rapid oscillations are, however, in any case
of too complicated a nature for me to advance this theory as
an explanation of the increase of the dielectric constant with
rapidity of oscillation *.
   »  That the phenomena are not so simple, and that in many cases,
among which J. J. Thomson's experiments may also he counted, a decrease
of the dielectric constant occurs with Hertz oscillations, is shown by the
following experiments : —
   The condenser-plates are separated by about 28 centim., and a trough
of water 27 centim. long is placed between them. The capacity of this
condenser, measured by my method with Ruhmkorfi oscillations, is just
the same whether the vessel contains distilled water, or water to which

me that in experimenting with slow swings there is more
chance of success, since in that case, proceeding as Schiller or
Cohn and Arons have done, the causes of error can be more
easily eliminated from the experiments or allowed for in the
observations.

       XXIII.      On   the    Flexure of a Flat Elastic Spring.
                 By Horace Lamb, M.A., F.R.S.*
      is a well-known consequence of the ordinary theory of
IT    flexure that when a bar of (say) rectangular section is
slightly bent by opposing couples in a plane parallel to one
pair of faces, so as to form a circular arc of radius p, the
remaining faces take an anticlastic curvature a/p, where
a is " Poisson's ratio ;
                         "
                            and this fact has been made the
basis of ingenious experimental methods of determining «r,
by Cornut and MalloekJ.          It appears to have been first
remarked by Thomson and Tait (' Natural Philosophy,' § 717)
that this tendency to anticlastic curvature imposes in certain
cases a limit to the degree of flexure, beyond which the
theory in question will not apply.
                                       " For unless the breadth
of the bar (or diameter perpendicular to the plane of flexure)
be very small in comparison with the mean proportional
between the radius [p/cr] and the thickness, the distances
 [in any cross section] from [a line through the axis per
pendicular to the plane of flexure] to [one pair of corners]
 would fall short of the half-thickness, and the distances to
 [the other pair] would exceed it by differences comparable
with its own amount.     This would give rise to sensibly less
10 per cent, of sulphuric acid has been added.         With Hertz oscillations
on the other hand, the distilled water, used in the same trough, behaved
as if it had a dielectric constant of about 300.   If   a few drops of sulphuric
acid were then added to       it,
                               the oscillations either entirely ceased or at any
rate were no longer visible by my method.         The insertion of such thick
layers would be of advantage, insomuch as one could compare the large
dielectric constants not with air, but with   a   dielectric constant oo . This
mode of procedure cannot unfortunately be directly applied to Herti
oscillations, since the insertion of     aconductor 27 centim. long alters the
length of the path of the oscillations by too great an amount.

and greater shortenings and stretchings in the filaments
towards the corners than those expressed in our formula),
and so vitiate the solution.        Unhappily, mathematicians have
not hitherto succeeded in solving, possibly not even tried to
solve, the beautiful problem thus presented by the flexure of
a broad very thin band (such as a watch-spring) into a circle
of radius comparable with a third proportional to its thick
ness   and its breadth."
    The difficulty thus arising in the case of a straight hand,
when the flexure exceeds             a certain amount, makes         its
appearance ab initio, even for infinitely small changes of
curvature, in the case of a hand originally curved, and is in
this way closely connected with the circumstance, first pointed
out by Mr. Love*, that it is in general impossible to satisfy
the boundary conditions for a curved plate or shell by a
deformation such that the middle surface is absolutely un-
extended.                                               I
                In considering this latter question had occasion,
recently f, to work out trie uniform flexure of a cylindrical
plate, but    I did not notice at the time that the same analysis,
with the proper change of meaning of a coefficient, gives
the solution of the problem proposed by Thomson and T;iit.
As the matter is of independent interest, and as so much
importance has been attached to it by these writers,             I take
the liberty of reproducing the investigation (as suitably
modified) in a separate form. The main results are such as
might be anticipated from the above quotation. The ex
tensions and contractions of the middle surface of the band,
which are called into play by the tendency to the contrary
curvature in the direction of the breadth, keep this curvature
 in check, so that the strained form never deviates appreciably
from that of a cylinder.         When the radius p is large com
pared with the third proportional aforesaid, the couple re
quired to maintain the flexure has the value given by the
ordinary theory ; whilst in the opposite extreme it tends to the
 value appropriate to a plate. For intermediate cases we must
have recourse to the general formula (18) given below.
     Considering, then, a straight flat spring whose breadth
 2b is large compared        with the thickness 2/t, let us in the
 first instance suppose that by a proper application of force
 to the two ends (to be afterwards determined) it is bent so
 that the strained form is one of revolution.              As regards
 the amount of the bending, we shall suppose only that p
 the radius of curvature of the medial line or axis, is large

 XXIV.       Specific   Inductive Capacity of Electrolytes.          By
    Edward B. Rosa, Fellow of the Johns Hopkins University *.
                                [Plate VI.]
 I. TITHE study of the specific inductive capacity of             water
     JL     and other conducting liquids was suggested           to me
about a year ago by Professor Rowland.                Cobn and Arons
 and others had recently found values of K for water, ranging
 from 75 to 85 and for alcohol from 25 to 30 ; these exceeded
 so many times the value of K for most non-conductors that it
 seemed possible that there might be a relation between the
 conductivity and inductivity t ; that these high values were
 directly due either to comparatively large conductivity, or
   * Communicated by the Author. An abstract of this paper was read
before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Indian
apolis, August, 1890.
   t This seems to be a somewhat prevalent opinion. Thus, Andrew
Gray ('Absolute Measurements in Electricity and Magnetism,' p. 491)
says, referring to Cohn and Arons' determination of K for water and
alcohol : " These substances have, however, considerable conductivity,
which would tend, of course, to give an apparently high specific induc
tive capacity.''

              Inductive Capacity of Electrolytes.                      189
else both conductivity and inductive capacity were due to
some common property of these liquids.              In short, that the
measured specific inductive capacities of conducting liquids
were not genuine specific inductive capacities, the square
roots of which, according to the electro-magnetic theory of
light, should equal the corresponding indices of refraction, for
waves of periods equal to those employed in measuring K.
As will appear from the following pages, this anticipation has
not been realized, the experiments indicating that these large
values are true inductivities.
    II. The method adopted for studying the question was to
measure the force exerted between a fixed and a movable
electrode in an electrolytic cell, varying the difference of
potential of the electrodes, their distance apart, the periods of
the alternating potentials employed, the temperature of the
electrolyte, and its conductivity (the latter by varying the
quantity of dissolved salts or other impurities).           Water and
alcohol are the electrolytes studied, and their behaviour has
been compared with that of air, turpentine, and other di
electrics.
                               Apparatus.
    The apparatus containing the electrolytic cell is shown
 in Plate    VI. fig. 1. The movable electrode is suspended
 by a fine silver wire ('009 centim. in diameter) which
conducts the current* to the electrode and whose torsion
 measures the force of attraction in question.        The silver wire is
 attached above to the torsion-head a, and below at the mirror
 c to a thick wire which passes down into the liquid (contained
 in the glass dish d) ; then, bending at right angles, it forms an
 arm about 4 centim. long, at the end of which is attached
 the movable electrode, hereafter called the needle.             Several
 forms of needle were used, but in order to secure a quick,
 nearly dead-beat motion, it was usually constructed of from
 two to five narrow plates above one another in horizontal
 planes, held together by vertical wires.          The fixed electrode
 consists of a vertical plate of platinum, 3^ X 5 centim.             It is
 attached to a brass piece which slides in a slot in the ebonite
 plate e, and a graduated scale ¦» permits the plate to be set at
 any desired point. All parts dipping into the liquid are made
 of platinum. A scale at a distance of three metres is seen by
   * The current traversing this wire in the experiments was not sufficient
 to change its temperature as much as the ordinary fluctuations in the
 temperature of the room.

190                Mr. E. B. Rosa on ilie Specific
reflexion at the mirror c through a large reading-telescope.
By means of a long wooden lever, attached to the torsion-
head a and within reach of the observer at the telescope, the
needle was always brought nearly to the same standard scale-
reading when the force was acting upon it. This insured a
constant distance between the needle and plate, and the
amount of the deflexion was determined by taking the
difference between this (nearly constant) deflected reading
and the reading when the needle and plate are brought to the
same potential.       The distance (three metres) between the
mirror and scale is sufficiently great so that the force may
safely be taken as proportional to the scale-readings.
   The disposition of the apparatus is shown in Plate VI.
fig. 2. The difference of potential required is furnished by a
gravity-battery,     any desired value less than the whole
potential being     obtained by suitably manipulating the plugs
of the resistance-box. The rotating-commutator is run by an
electric motor. The commutator has two ebonite wheels, 10
centim. in diameter, mounted on a steel axle and carrying 2
and 26 segments of brass, respectively, with brass contact-
brushes.      Either wheel may be used and the speed varied
through wide limits, so that the rate of alternation may have
any desired value from a hundred to a hundred thousand per
minate.       Generally, however, the two-segment wheel was
used, and the current reversed from 2000 to 4000 times per
minute. A disk having 100 teeth, and gearing into the axle,
served as a counter, and struck a bell every 100 revolutions.
The potential was measured by a Weston voltmeter, inserted,
as shown, between the resistance-box and commutator.           It
was carefully calibrated and, excepting an index error of 0*2
volt, was found correct as graduated.            With respect to
constancy and sensibility, this instrument has performed
beautifully.
   As soon as the brushes of the commutator came upon the
insulating segments the electrodes would be discharged,
 wholly or in part, according to the conductivity of the medium.
 The electrodes were, therefore, short-circuited by a resistance
 (B', fig. 2) of about 16,000 ohms, and this insured a complete,
instantaneous discharge for insulating as well as for con
ducting media.       Thus the force acted on the needle for the
 same relative time in all cases, the circuit being broken for
about 2V °f *ne whole time when using the two-segment
wheel.
   III.   With this apparatus, during the months of May, June,

and July, a series of measurements of the force on the ueedle
in different liquids was made, in which the following circum
stances were varied in turn : —
       1. Difference of potentials between the electrodes.
       2. Distance between the electrodes.
       3. Bate of alternations of the current.
       4. Conductivity of the liquids.
       5. Temperature.
    1. Variation of Potential: Turpentine, Water, and Alcohol. —
In the following tables the numbers in the third column are
proportional to the squares of the potentials given in the
first column, and the quotients of the deflexions by these
squares (column 4) are constant within the limits of experi
mental errors. These nearly constant quotients are, however,
slightly smaller in all cases for low potentials.                     This is
doubtless      due  to the   index  error  of  0*2  volt, which   would     be
appreciable only in the case of the lower potentials.

   From these measurements it will appear that the force is
accurately proportional to the square of the potential for these
electrolytes as well as for dielectrics.
   Low Potentials. — With the more sensitive instrument
described below, measures of the force for lower potentials
were made.          By bringing the needle quite close to the plates
(fig. 4) deflexions equal to those shown by the other instru
ment were obtained by forces 50 times smaller. Two causes
tend to make the readings less accurate than before.                      First,
since the electrodes are nearer, small inequalities in their
distance produce a relatively greater effect.                   Second, the
force is found to vary much more for low potentials with
inequalities in the rate of alternation of the current.                     The
following       table shows, however,      that   the force  is still   propor

   The plate cannot be set with anything like the accuracy
with which the distance between needle and plate can be
maintained constant, since the motion of the needle is
magnified by the telescope and scale over a hundred times.
Consequently the above measurements for variation of dis
tance at constant potential are not as accurate as those pre
viously given for variation of potential at constant distance.
   If  these measurements     be plotted out with distances and
deflexions as abscissºe and ordinates respectively, we get two
curves resembling equilateral hyberbolas ; and if the ordinates
of the alcohol curve be shortened eight times, the two curves
will be almost indistinguishable.      In other words, the rate of
variation of the force with the distance between the electrodes
is the same for turpentine as for alcohol (and water), and in
general is probably the same for dielectrics and electrolytes.
    3. Variation of Rate of Alternation of Potentials.-The
effect of change of speed of the commutator is generally small
and often inappreciable. With water the deflexion is greater
at higher speeds, although for quite pure distilled water the
difference is extremely small.         For less pure water it is
larger, although not often more than 2 or 3 per cent., and is
probably due to polarization at the slower speeds.        Not the
slightest trace of bubbles appears on the electrodes when
using moderately pure water, but with ordinary hydrant water
at rather high potentials bubbles appear at          speeds.   The          all

            is    steady       very  low  speeds,
                                           at      and when the
commutator stops the deflexion changes considerably and                                          is
uncertain       amount except for very low potentials.

 194                 Mr. E. B. Rosa on tlie Specific
    4.  Variation of Conductivity. — The resistance of different
 samples of distilled water is very different, and yet the
 difference   noted      in the force of attraction between the
 electrodes was relatively small.           A single drop of a dilute
 solution of copper sulphate was added to a half litre of
distilled water ; the conductivity was increased about ten
times while the force of attraction diminished about 15 per
cent.      Hydrant water, of comparatively large conductivity,
showed a force 10 per cent, to 40 per cent, less than distilled,
according to the potential, the effect of polarization being
relatively greater at low potentials.
    Thus, as far as the force of attraction depends upon the
conductivity, it seems to be less as the conductivity is greater,
and that because of polarization.                  Could the latter be
eliminated in the case of these impure waters, the force would
probably be practicably independent of the conductivity.
Polarization reduces the force of attraction, as it reduces tne
current, in two distinct ways.          First, by the counter-electro
motive force excited which diminishes the effective fall of
potential, and, second, by increasing the resistance at the
electrodes.     This decreases the current by increasing the
total resistance ; but it decreases the force not at all because
of an increase in the total resistance, but because the addi
tional resistance is introduced at one or two places and not
uniformly throughout the liquid.              The result is that the fall
of potential is less in the liquid near the needle than before,
and therefore the force on the needle is less.
    The effect of introducing between the electrodes a stratum
having a high resistance is strikingly shown in the following
experiments : —
    A. — A plate of mica (m, fig. 3, which is a horizontal
section of the electrolytic cell) was inserted between the needle
n and the plate p, and parallel to the latter.               The following
observations were made, the plate being set at distances from
the needle given in column 3, the mica being in each case
about 1*5 millim. from the platinum plate : —

                 Inductive Capacity           of Electrolytes.                 195
   In numbers 1 and 2 the distance and potential are alike,
but the force is eighteen times greater without the plate than
with it. This cannot be explained by the simple fact that the
specific inductive capacity of mica is perhaps a dozen times
less than that of water, for that renders the equivalent thick
ness of water but a few millimetres greater, and so reduces
the force by less than one half.   On account of its compara
tively large conductivity, however, the water on opposite sides
of the mica quickly becomes charged as shown * (fig. 3) , and
the entire fall of potential just between the electrodes occurs
in the mica. There is then no force on the needle in the
                     dY
direction of x,                being zero.        Around the edges of the
                     —j-
mica plate, however, there is           a   fall of potential, and therefore
           dV
a force,               in different directions at different points on
          -j^, acting
the needle.     In (2) Table VII. the resultant of these separate
forces is expressed by a deflexion of 0'84 centim. toward the
plate. In (3) the resultant toward the plate is zero, while in
(4), the plate being much nearer the needle, and therefore the
lines of force curved backward to a greater degree, the force
is apparently repulsive ; that         the resultant
                                            is,          in the direc

 force on the   needle  for  the same difference of potential and
 rate of alternation used before.        The 26-part wheel of the
 rotating commutator was substituted and the speed increased
 to 3000 per minute       this gave 78,000 reversals per minute.
                               ;
 The potential    was   increased   to 75 and 90 volts, and       new     a
 apparatus arranged with two fixed electrodes and a larger
 double needle, as shown in section in fig. 4. The sensibility
 of this instrument was many times greater than the other, and
 enabled me to observe the very small force exerted on the
 needle, which       had been seen must exist when using in
                    it
 sulated fixed electrodes and alternating potentials. For, just
 after each reversal there          fall of potential in the water
                                   is   a

cated in the figure are reversed perhaps fifty times per second.

 196                Mr. E. B. Rosa on   the Specific
 of a second.      During the remainder of the interval before
 the next reversal there is no force on the needle.
    With 90 volts the deflexion was only a few millimetres,
 but the needle was perfectly steady, and readings were made
 to a tenth of a millimetre.       For steady or slowly reversed
 potentials there was no perceptible deflexion, but above
 10,000 reversals per minute the deflexion was perceptible,
and increased to a maximum of 4'5 millim. at 78,000 per
 minute, the deflexions being sensibly proportional to the speed,
 as would be expected.      This is therefore a very different case
 from that of uninsulated electrodes, where the force is many
thousand times greater and practically independent of the
speed.
    C. — The secondary of a Ituhmkorff coil was substituted for
the battery and commutator, and an alternating current sent
through the primary.        Comparatively large deflexions were
observed with the same arrangement of insulated fixed elec
trodes.     This was due to the much higher potentials, only an
approximate estimate of whose value could be obtained.
Owing to the nearly instantaneous character of the current
1'rom the Rubmkortf coil, a far larger proportion of the effect
observed with uninsulated electrodes would be observed with
insulated.
    D. -— Since the small force on the needle observed with an
insulated fixed electrode is due to the conductivity of the
liquid, the same effect must occur, but in less degree, with
liquids of less conductivity.     To show this, two fixed elec
trodes, T and T', were fastened, one to the inside and the other
to the outside surface of the glass dish (fig. 5), and the latter
filled with turpentine.     The fixed electrodes are thus at nearly
equal distances from the needle, and with rapidly alternating
potentials the attraction was practically the same whichever
was used.      But for very slow alternations the force diminishes
slightly,   and  for steady potentials falls to zero, when using
the outer electrode, remaining practically constant for the
inner electrode.      In other words, when using the outer elec
trode and steady potential, the turpentine comes to a uniform
potential by conduction, and the 95 volts fall of potential
occurs entirely in the glass.
    5. Variation in Temperature. — In order to determine the
variation of the force with temperature, the apparatus (fig. 1)
was set into a large glass jar, which was then filled with water
up to the ebonite cover, e, or about a centimetre above the
level of the liquid in the glass dish.     The mirror remained in
view above the top of the jar. Using hot water and ice as
needed, the temperature of the water-bath was varied between

3° and 33°        C,   in a few     being carried up to 45°.
                                  cases                            As
soon, however, as the temperature rose much above that of the
surrounding air, vapour condensed on the mirror and window
before      it,
             and thus rendered observations difficult or impos
sible. In every case, time was allowed for the temperature
of the liquid (water or alcohol) to become nearly stationary
before observations      were made       otherwise convection-cur
                                          ;
rents made the needle unsteady.        However,     was not possible
                                                   it
to keep the temperature perfectly steady, and the measure
ments, which are plotted out in Plate VI., figs.         6and 7,  are
not so accurate and consistent as though made at one tem
perature. In the case of alcohol the needle was very unsteady
above about 26°, and several rough measurements (Nos.            3,   4,
and    9) made at higher temperatures are omitted from the
diagram      ;but none are omitted below 26°, although Nos.           5
and    6  were somewhat unsteady.         Ordinates represent tem
peratures, and abscissa? represent the excess of deflexions
above 4"4 centim. in case of alcohol, and 8-0 centim. in case
of water. The observations were made in groups in the order
of the numbers on the diagram, and extended in the case of
alcohol through        period of twelve hours. It will be noticed
                        a
that the alcohol was carried several times throngh the given
range of temperature observations Nos.
                             ;                     2,10, and 16 fall
closely together near 25°, but between Nos.              and 10 the
                                                         2
alcohol was cooled to 7°, and between Nos. 10 and 16 to 3°
 (see fig. 6).   The observations fall upon        astraight line as
nearly    as could  be  expected  from    the circumstances    of the
case.     They indicate      rather large temperature-coefficient,
                             a
the force falling off about 10 per cent, between 3° (5"20) and
26° (4*70).       The conductivity, on the other hand, rapidly
increases with the temperature, although no attempt was made
to determine value for its temperature-coefficient. Accord
                   a
ing to Foussereau, the conductivity of alcohol increases nearly
30 per cent, between 3° and 26°.
    In the case of water the observations do not Ho as clearly
upon one straight line, but the later observations are nearer
 toa   second straight line nearly parallel to the first.     This    is
believed to be due to polarization effects, which increased
during the course of the day, the observations having extended
over   a  period of 14 hours. However, the difference between
the   first and last measurements       scarcely more than one per
                                          is
cent., and the temperature-coefficient obtained from either or
 both combined will differ but little.      The force falls off about
 10 per cent, between 3° and 31°,          somewhat smaller change
                                               a
 than with alcohol.

     IV.  The value of K for any liquid may be determined be
taking the ratio of the force on the needle at a given distance
 from the fixed electrode for a given potential, the medium
being the given liquid, to the force on the needle for the same
distance and potential, the medium being air.                 Since the
 needle lies wholly upon one side of the axis of suspension, the
 latter is slightly displaced when the needle is immersed in a
 liquid, owing to the buoyancy of the liquid.             This displace
 ment is in a vertical plane passing through the centre of
 gravity of the whole suspended mass and the centre of
 gravity of the displaced liquid ; and if this plane is not
 parallel to the plate, the distance between needle and plate
 will be thereby slightly altered.        To avoid any error due to
 such a cause the needle was placed between two similar plates
  15 millimetres apart, and the double deflexions noted as the
 needle was alternately joined to either plate, the other being
  at a different potential.    The double deflexion was found to be
  constant for any position of the needle near the centre, so
  that no error could arise from small displacements due to the
  above cause.    The results showed a slightly different value
 for the ratio sought than that found with a single plate, but the
  difference was so small that no appreciable error is believed
  to occur in comparisons of liquids, due to different specific
 gravities.
      The needle was so constructed that in water, alcohol, or
  light oils it was nearly dead-beat while yet moving quickly.
  A brass weight attached just below the mirror rendered the
  suspension very stable, and when air-currents were excluded,
  the needle would take up a perfectly definite zero-position, to
  which it would usually return without a deviation of a
  thousandth of a millimetre.        To render the needle equally
  stable and dead-beat in the air, a special damper (a vane of
  platinum hanging in oil) was attached in the axis of rotation.

                  Inductive Capacity   of Electrolytes.         201
                                Summary.
   V. (a) The      expression for the force between two electrodes
having a homogeneous medium between them, thus forming a
condenser, is of the form
                               F=AKVS.
For   a given liquid and given electrodes at a constant distance
F  is proportional to V4.       This is found to hold for electro
lytes  as  well  as dielectrics  through the wide range of poten
tials employed.
   (b) When the potentials and medium are constant and the
distance between the electrodes varied, the value of F in the
above equation varies in a manner sensibly independent of
the nature of the medium, depending only on the capacity of
the condenser.
   (c) When the speed of the commutator changes, the force
is but slightly altered, unless the electrolyte is a fairly good
conductor.      In the latter case the force is diminished as the
speed    is reduced, owing to polarization.        There is a small
change in the force with turpentine due to variation of speed,
although none in the case of air. With turpentine, as with
pure water and alcohol, the change is very small, the force
being greater in every case with higher speeds.
    (d) When the conductivity of distilled water is increased
by adding hydrant water or minute quantities of acid or
copper sulphate, the force is not greatly altered, although the
current increases many times. The force, however, decreases,
which is believed to be due to polarization. Were the latter
wholly eliminated, the force would probably remain unaltered ;
at most it could differ but little.
   (e) When the temperature rises, other circumstances re
maining unaltered, the conductivity increases while the force
decreases, the rate being constant or nearly so within the
range of experiment. This decrease in the force, however,
cannot be accounted for by polarization, for the increase of
conductivity is not sufficient to make an appreciable difference
in polarization effects. This is further proved by the fact that
the force is immediately increased by a small decrease in the
temperature, the curve returning upon itself, while if it were
a case of polarization, the curve would more resemble the
hysteresis-curve of magnetization.
   VI. The almost complete agreement between the behaviour
of the given electrolytes and that of dielectrics seems to show
that the force acting on the needle is wholly independent of
the quantity of current and of the conductivity of the medium,
and it is difficult to conceive how the force and conductivity

202                Mr. E. B. Rosa on     the Specific
can be due to   a  common cause or property of the liquid when
their variations are so discordant in sign as well as in magni
tude.    This may be better seen perhaps by putting the expres
sion for the force into mathematical            form, and noting the
consequences of the assumption that the force depends in some
way upon the quantity of current.
    Let us then assume that the large force of attraction ob
served in the cases of water and alcohol is the resultant of
two effects, due respectively to the induction (which is propor
tional to the true specific inductive capacity) and the conduc
tion or quantity of current passing ; and that the second effect
is large in proportion to the first. We may then write,
                 F=AKV*+oc,                                           (1)
where   F = the  resultant force on the movable plate of the con
              denser,
        V = the  difference of potential between the plates,
        K = the   true specific inductive capacity,
         A= a  constant depending on the geometry of the con
              denser,
          c=the current,
         o = an undetermined coefficient.
We may write equation (1) as follows          : —
               F=AKV8+£V,
                                      or^a=AK+|.
                                                                        F
    Now experiment shows               Tables    II., III., IV.) that
                                (see
                                                                       ^
 is constant for    a given liquid, and hence /8 is either zero or
 proportional to    V.    Suppose it is not zero.        Then
                 F=AKV* + AV2,                                         (2}

 Thus the   second term, if it is not     zero, is proportional to the
 square of the current ; Oj being an undetermined coefficient.

    Thus the conditions which the function ax must fulfil are
 not only what we should not expect, but are actually incon

 fi is zero (and therefore a and at are zero), we have the force
 expressed by F = AKV8, an expression which applies equally
 to dielectrics and electrolytes.          In both cases K is independent
 of A and V, as we have seen. It changes little if any with a
 variable conductivity, butchanges notably with the temperature.
 The only other determinations of temperature-coefficients
 which    I  have seen are those of W. Cassie *, made at the
 Cavendish Laboratory.             He worked with a number of solid
 and liquid dielectrics, for the most part between about 15°

    We notice that the solids and paraffin oil have positive
coefficients, while all the other              liquids have negative co

temperature-coefficients for water and alcohol are not only of
                              -             -
the same order of magnitude as those for the given liquid
dielectrics, but both ( "0038 and              -0046) fall within the limits
of the series, water having a value less than carbon bisulphide
and glycerine and greater than turpentine, benzoline, benzine,
and olive oil.
    VII. It is very convenient to think of the force acting on
the needle as due to a given charge tending to flow down a
                                               dV
given slope of potential.           Letting -3- represent the resultant
slope   of potential, the displacement over the surface                      of the
                      dV
needle    is  AjK^-,         A! being a constant depending on the
needle, and      K    a constant depending on the medium.                       One
can just as readily imagine this displacement occurring                         in a
conducting      as  in a   non-conducting medium.           Indeed, Maxwell
   * Proc. Roy.    Soc. vol. xlvi. (1889), p. 357, and  Phil. Trans. 1889.

                   Inductive Capacity     of Electrolyte*.              205
       * that
says              this inductive capacity probably exists in all
bodies t.       The capacity of a condenser consisting of two
electrodes immersed in a conducting medium cannot be mea
sured by discharging its accumulated charge through a
galvanometer, and noting the deflexion of a magnetic needle.
But it is as directly measured by noting the force which this
constant (but continually renewed) charge exerts as it tends
to flow down a given slope of potential. The conductivity of
water depends mainly, if not wholly, upon its impurities, which
form in the case of distilled water an indefinitely small part of
its bulk.      The inductivity, on the other hand, is a property of
the water itself, and hence ought not to be appreciably modified
by small quantities of foreign substances, though it might be
greatly different if they constituted a large part of its bulk.
 We may thus think of conduction and induction producing
their separate effects side by side, the former not affecting the
latter.     Conduction may, however, affect the force          AjK I
                    dV
by modifying             through polarization, not by changing          K.
                    ^—
    That Maxwell's criterion of the equality of the specific
 inductive capacity to the square of the index of refraction is
so far from being fulfilled in the case of water and alcohol, is
 not a serious objection to the notion that electrolytes possess
 a real specific inductive capacity.             For comparatively few
 substances is K = na within the limits of experimental error.
 Glass among solid and castor oil and ether among liquid
 dielectrics are notable exceptions.         These are usually explained
 by supposing        that  the  electrical  displacements     in these di
 electrics are much greater in a second or even a millionth of
 a second than they would be in periods of 10-16 sec, a
 thousand million times shorter, such as the period of light.
 J. J.    Thomson     J   has recently shown that for periods of
 4 x 10-8 sec. the value of K for glass is very much nearer to
 n* than for longer periods, and there is good reason for
 believing that K for periods equal to those of light-waves
    * Electricity  and Magnetism, vol. i. p. 53.
    t It is scarcely necessary to point out tliat the habit of reckoning the
 specific inductive capacity of metals as infinite when calculating the
 " reduced thickness " of the stratum between the plates of a condenser
 does not at all imply that if metals have a specific inductive capacity
 it must be infinite or even large. Because of their conductivity there is
 an instantaneous distribution of electricity such that there is no fall of
            in passing through the plate of metal ; and this is what would
   appen if the metal had an infinite specific inductive capacity and zero
 Eotential
 conductivity.

would equal n1. The electrical behaviour of glass has been
compared with the mechanical behaviour of pitch, which is
elastic to forces acting through short periods such as those of
sound, but viscous to forces of long periods.           we accept If
this very reasonable explanation for glass, we at once extend
it to the large class of liquids of various degrees of insulating
power called dielectrics, and for which K is greater than ns,
and also to that group of alcohols and their derivatives which
Tereschin* has investigated, and for which the values of K
vary from 2 to 32.        It is but another step to water with
a value of K in the neighbourhood of 75.           One can easily
imagine    that  for  electrical  stresses of a period 10-16 sec.
K can equal «*; that         be less than
                              is,            and possess a tempe

rature-coefficient equal to that of n8.
   That a  thing     conceivable and that
                      is                         demonstrated are
                                                     it      is
not equivalent.     Nevertheless the behaviour of water, alcohol,
and other conducting liquids, as cited in the foregoing pages
and as given by other observers, seems to me to afford very
strong reasons for attributing to these electrolytes a genuine
specific inductive capacity.
   This investigation was carried on under the general direction
of Prof. A. L. Kimball, of the Johns Hopkins University.

University of Wisconsin      and    ;take pleasure in acknow

     Experiments upon which        I  have been engaged since the
 above paper has been in type fully confirm these expectations.
 Preliminary measurements show that the force with which
 the glass suspended in water tends to move toward the weaker
 parts of the field is several times greater than that with which
 it tends to move toward the stronger parts of the field in air,
 and that, other things being the same, this force is propor
 tional to the square of the electric force.
    A conductor, on the contrary, tends to move toward the
 stronger parts of the field for all media, with a force many
 times greater in water than in air or oil. Increasing the
 conductivity of the water does not appreciably alter the
 force.
    A new piece of apparatus is being constructed, and when
 finished accurate measurements will be made of the force on
 the suspended body in these several cases. The preliminary
results are of interest, however, as confirming the conclusions
of the foregoing paper that water and other conducting
liquids have a true specific inductive capacity. — E. B. R.
XXV.       Experiments in Photoelectricity.           By George M.
     Minchin, M.A., Professor of Mathematics in the Royal
    Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill*.
              the beginning of the year 1877       I commenced     a long
 NEAR    series  of investigations in Photoelectricity, and I was
 not then aware that M. Becquerel had previously worked at
 this subject and had obtained some results which             I also ob
 tained independently.                                 I
                             In the spring of 1 880 made a verbal
 communication to this Society, illustrated by experiments, on
 the generation of electric currents by the action of light on
 silver plates which were coated with collodion and gelatine
 emulsions of bromide, chloride, iodide, and other salts of silver,
 as well as with eosine, fluorescine, and various aniline dyes.
 A short summary of these results appears in the Report of the
 meeting of the British Association that year at Swansea.
 The chief object which     I had then in view in prosecuting such
 experiments was the solution of the problem of producing a
 photographic imago of an object at a distance by means of an
 instrument which is still imaginary and which           I  proposed to
 call a telephotograph.
    As these experiments have never been published in ade
 quate detail,   I propose to begin this paper with an account of
 them.

well in a test-tube containing collodion, the emulsion being,
of course, screened from light by a covering of black paper
on the test-tube; pour a thin coating of the emulsion over
both silver plates in the dark; and when the films have set,
immerse both plates in a glass vessel containing distilled
water with a few grains of common salt; screen one plate
completely ; and then connect the plates with the terminals
of a Thomson galvanometer. A disturbing current will, of
course, be produced; but if the plates are very nearly alike,
this current will be small and will soon almost disappear.
    Now, on exposing the unscreened plate to light, a current
will be produced, and the exposed plate is negative to the un
exposed (i.e., as copper to zinc).
    The direction of the disturbing current is not in any way
related to the direction of the current produced by light—as
is,  indeed, priori evident.

    Plwtographic Effect of the Current. — A fact of very great
importance in this subject is that which relates to the action
of an electric current which passes through a photographic
layer on a plate.
    Two silver plates, each coated with a film of Liverpool
emulsion (bromide of silver), were immersed in a tumbler
containing distilled water and a few grains of bromide of
potassium. One of these plates was connected with the zinc
and the other with the carbon pole of a bichromate cell. The
current was allowed to pass through the plates for a few
seconds, with the following results : —
    (1) The plate connected with the carbon pole was, without
the employment of any developer, visibly blackened in its
immersed part.
    (2) No visible change took place on the other plate ; but
when the plate was developed, by pouring over it the usual
pyrogallic acid developer, its immersed        portion was also
blackened.
    The photographic result was also obtained when the bichro
mate cell, which originated the current, was replaced by a
photoelectric cell exposed to light.    A vessel containing dis
tilled  water  and a small quantity of bromide  of potassium was
placed in a dark room ; in this vessel were immersed (or
 partially immersed) two silver plates S', V, the first coated
with a film of Liverpool emulsion, the second uncoated. These
plates were connected by insulated wires with the plates, S, V,
of a glass cell containing water and a small quantity of
common salt, the plate S being coated with a layer of a
chloride of silver emulsion, and the plate V being uncoated.
 Magnesium light was then allowed to fall on the plate S of
this latter cell for a few minutes. Now, whether S' was
connected with S or with V, the plate S' when taken out of
the vessel and developed was very sensibly blacker on its
immersed portion than on the unimmersed. The action on
the plate S' was assisted by exposing it for about ten seconds
to gaslight before the photoelectric current of the exposed
cell was passed through it. The effect is undoubtedly clue to
the action of the current, because when the plate S' was left
immersed in its cell for twenty hours and then developed, no
blackening effect was produced.
    Not only is this photographic effect of the current impor
tant, but it is also important to prove that the effect on a
sensitized plate is strictly confined to those portions of it

light was observed in a cell containing eosine in solution       ;
and as the same effect     was occasionally observed in cells of
other kinds employed in experiments made long afterwards,
I   shall draw attention to the phenomenon here.
     Two clean silver plates were immersed in a glass cell con
taining distilled water and a very small quantity of eosine.
One of these plates was screened and the other exposed to
light, both being connected with the galvanometer. Imme
diately on exposure of the plate to light, there was generated
a current in which the exposed plate was positive to the other.
This current, however, lasted for only a second, and it was
then (the exposure continuing) succeeded by a steady and much
 stronger current in the opposite direction, this latter being
 the current which would exist if the plate had been coated
 with an eosine-gelatine film in the usual way, any variation
 in the intensity of the light being answered by a corresponding
 variation in the strength of the photoelectric current. Now
 when the light was suddenly shut oft' from the plate, the
 instantaneous effect was to increase the existing current — the
 effect being merely impulsive — after which (trie plate being
  screened) the current gradually disappeared.         This result
  was again and again reproduced, and exactly the same result
 was found if the water in the cell contained a small quantity
  of fluorescine instead of eosine, except that the initial and
  final impulsive currents were much smaller with fluorescine
  than with eosine.
      The plates of this cell having been left in the liquid and
  kept in the dark for a fortnight, the action of light was again
  tried ; and it was then found that, while the inverse currents
  were produced as before, the initial current on exposure was
  enormously increased both in magnitude and in duration.       It
  now disappeared gradually, and was succeeded by a current
  in the reverse direction.
      When one of these plates was removed from the cell and
  immersed in water in presence of a clean silver plate, it was
  at once, on exposure to light, negative, like a silver plate
  coated in the ordinary way with an emulsion of eosine.
      M. Becquerel, in the course of his experiments on the
   electric action of light on plates coated with salts of silver,
   made the observation that in the case of silver plates coated
   with bromide, chloride, and iodide of silver, the nature of the
   exposed plate (whether positive or negative) depends on the
   thickness of the layer deposited on the surface of the plate.
   Thus, he says (La Lumiere, vol. ii. p. 129): — " By depositing
   on one of these plates a thin layer of iodide, obtained by the
   action of the vapour of iodine at the ordinary temperature,

212     Prof. Minchin's Experiments in Photoelectricity.
and then exposing this plate           to light, it was found that it
took positive electricity from the liquid                    With a thick
 layer of iodide on the surface of the silver, there                is,
                                                                     on the
contrary,   a current   the  inverse     of  the   preceding    that
                                                                ;         to
                                                                          is
say, the plate exposed     to  light   took   negative electricity.     This
result shows that, in this case, iodine acts on silver under the
influence of light.1'       He then gives       a     table of deflexions
obtained when various coloured glasses were placed in front
of a silver plate coated with a thick layer of iodide, the
greatest effect being produced        by    violet rays, and the least by
red, the former being 22 times the latter.
    M. Becquerel continues — " Thus, whilst with chloride and
                                :
bromide of silver precipitated, placed on plates of platinum,
there  is  always produced      a    current of the same sense, the
exposed plate being positive, with         a   layer deposited on silver,
there  is an effect depending on the thickness of this layer.
These two inverse effects indicate that there should be neces
sarily a thickness for which the electric effect                     almost
                                                                    is
nothing."
    These observations of M. Becquerel may possibly explain
the above inverse effects in the eosine-silver cell         ;  but his last
conjecture would not be practically verifiable, unless, when
the critical thickness was reached, the state           of   the sensitive
surface was one of stability. One result, however, would pretty
evidently follow, viz., that    if    on the same plate a portion of
the layer was below the critical thickness, while the remain
der was above      it, the plate, on exposure, might be, on the
whole, positive, negative, or inert.             In the case of photo
electric cells to be subsequently described,          it   is possible that
the observed results are due to this cause.
    Certain mordants were tried for the purpose of preventing
the eosine from leaving the film.             The sensitized plate was
washed with a solution          of  borax, which had the effect of
keeping the film on the plate, but almost completely de
stroyed its sensitiveness to light.           A similar effect followed
from the employment of          asolution of chloride of aluminium.
The best effect was produced when          a     silver plate coated with
an emulsion of eosine and photographic gelatine was immersed
for few minutes in         strong solution of alum.
                          a a
   a
    Naphthalene red,        substance soluble in alcohol and only
slightly  soluble  in  water,  was also used in place of eosine.               A
little of this was dissolved in alcohol and then emulsified with
gelatine. It was then poured on a silver plate, and the film
was allowed to set thoroughly.              The photoelectric currents
produced     were   not  quite    so   strong as those obtained with
eosine.    The  effect    much
                         is         greater in the blue than in any

 other part of the spectrum, the exposed plate being positive ;
 and, apparently, with strong red rays, there is a reversal of
 the sign of the E.M.F.
    Various other substances were used, among which             I may
 mention iodine green, which gives rather strong currents
 with daylight, the exposed plate Deing negative.
    In all these cells the E.M.F. is feeble compared with the
 electromotive forces which      I have obtained by other means,
 to be presently described ; but in the case of silver plates
 coated with iodine green, an E.M.F. of about -^g volt can be
 observed with sunlight.
    Fluorescine used like eosine on silver or platinum plates
 gives poor results.
    A few experiments with a solution of sulphate of quinine
and some other fluorescent liquids were made with a view to
connecting fluorescence with electric effect ; but the observed
results were comparatively small, and the subject has been
left for further trial.
                             Other Metals.
    Many experiments were made with other metals, but the
currents produced by most of them were smaller than those
given by silver plates.     Thus, I have on record an experiment
 in which bismuth was melted into thin plates which were
 fixed on glass, and then immersed in a cell containing water.
When light fell on one of these plates, a considerable current
 was generated, the exposed plate being positive ; but on
adding a solution of chloride of bismuth to the water, the
current generated by light was reversed.            On taking them
out   of the cell and   washing    them   with  distilled  water, and
then immersing them again in a water-cell, when the plate
was exposed to light, there was an impulsive current corre
 sponding to a negative nature of the plate, but this was
promptly succeeded by a very large current in the opposite
 direction — just as in the cases previously mentioned.
    Copper, antimony, and other metals were also tried, but
the results are not of sufficient importance to demand any
detailed record. In particular, iron plates coated with the

    A glass cell containing a solution of fluorescine in distilled
water, in which two silver plates had been immersed, was
taken for trial with other than silver plates.            Almost the
first metal that  I  used  in  this  cell was  tin.    Two  plates of
tin foil whose surface had not been in any way prepared,

but which was in the state in which it was obtained from
the manufacturers, were fixed on plates of glass and placed
in the cell. One of them being screened from light and the
          lº
other exposed, a very strong current was the result. When
the tin         were replaced by copper, a current, but of less
strength, was also produced. Gold plates gave no current
at all.     It was found, however, that the fluorescine was
unnecessary, and that when common tap-water was used in
the cell, the currents produced by light seemed to be no
 weaker than before. If the hand or any other screen were
moved rapidly in front of the exposed plate, the spot on the
galvanometer-scale moved correspondingly.          A telephone
 was  put  into the circuit with a view to the    production  of
 sound by variations in the incident light, but the alterations
 were not sufficiently rapid to produce this result. A battery
 of three cells in series was then formed, but no sound was
 produced in the        telephone, and, moreover, the current
 indicated   by the  galvanometer   was no greater than when
 only one cell was used. This latter fact seemed most extra
 ordinary ; but, on examining the cells separately,       found  I
 that one of the cells was producing a current in a sense
 opposed to that of the current given by the other two.       Of
                                 -
 this more presently.
    When the liquid in the cell was distilled water, currents
  º
 were still produced by the action of light on the tin. When
 al
Ceas
         of sulphuric acid was added to the water, the currents
                                    I
   In nearly every cell that used with tin plates—whose
surfaces, as stated above, had not been treated in any way—
the exposed plate was positive to the unexposed ; but, after a
time varying from a few minutes to a few hours, it was
º
found that this positive current died out and was replaced
by an apparently stronger current, in which the exposed
      was negative. Thus there was a change in the sign of
the E.M.F. produced by the continuous action of light.
This again reminds us of M. Becquerel's observation about
                                 i.
the thickness of sensitive layers. There seemed to be almost
 no exception to the rule    the exposed plate begins by
 being positive and ends by being negative, the negative
 regime lasting for many days of prolonged exposure to
 light.
  Fº   was also found that when the chloride of any substance
 was dissolved in the distilled water of the cell,        photo all
                                                                           or by

the plate becomes completely insensitive to light.  Thus the
photoelectric result is obviously due  to some  layer on the
surface.
    In connexion with tho change of sign of the E.M.F. pro
duced by continuous exposure,                 the following          remarkable
experiment      was  made.      Round       the    outside   of  a    cylindrical
porous pot was fixed a coating of tin foil ; inside the pot was
placed a strip of tin foil, these two strips being the exposed
and unexposed plates of the cell respectively. The porous
pot was filled with water and immersed in a glass heaker also
containing water, the diameter of tho beaker being very
slightly greater than that of the porous pot. The strip of
foil inside the pot was completely covered from light and
connected with one terminal of a galvanometer ; the foil out
side the pot being connected with the other terminal.                         Out
side the glass beaker, and fitting round it very closely, was a
cylinder of black paper with a vertical slit cut in                       it,   the
breadth of the slit being about half an inch, while the diameter
of the cylinder was about           3   inches.       Thus,   by   rotating the
black paper cylinder round the beaker, different strips of the
tin foil on the outer surface of the porous pot could bo
successively exposed to light.
    The slit in the paper occupying           a   given position, the corre
sponding portion      of  the tin  foil  was    exposed to sunlight.           The
current indicated that the plate was positive, and                 the  exposure
 was continued until the current changed its direction,                 i.  e., the
plate became negative. The slit was then moved opposite
another and distant portion of the tin foil, which,                by   the same
process,    was   finally   rendered      negative;      and    so    on   all the
way round. Thus the surface of tho tin foil was divided into
a number of strips, which were alternately negative and
positive in their electromotive forces when exposed to light                      ;
and by rotating the black paper continuously round the
 beaker, a series of currents in contrary directions were
obtained from the action of light on one and the same metallic
 plate — result which, at first sight, sounds very strange.
          a
 It  is   easily understood, however, when we remember tho
 different conditions into which tho various strips of tho
surface of the plate — e., some very thin stratum on the tin —
                             »'.
 were put in the preliminary process                 ;and, moreover,     it    pre
 pares   us  for cases   in  which   different       portions   of a    tin   plate
 which has been sensitized              by   a   special process give, on
 exposure, electromotive forces          of  different   signs.
 I      have not yet spoken of any process for producing                          a
 sensitive layer on the surface, and             a long time elapsed before
I    discovered    one.    The   tin   foil   hitherto     spokon of     is   pure

expected, not only were some pieces on exposure to light

observed to be at once negative while others (the great
majority) were              but there were various degrees of
sensitiveness.    Occasionally, also, the curious jerks imme
diately on exposure and immediately on screening, which
were observed in the case of silver and eosine, were observed
with these plates.
   Then succeeded a series of experiments in which a quad
rant electrometer was used instead of the galvanometer, i.e.,
the E.M.F.. and not the current, was measured.
   A curious result was very soon observed with the thin
tin foil which is wrapped inside small packages of tobacco.
The two sides of this foil are notably different in appearance,
one being somewhat dull, while the other has a bright silvery
aspect.    Two           of this were cemented on opposite sides
of a small   glass  plate,"...
                            the dull surface of one and the bright
surface of the other     being    fixed to the glass.     This plate was
immersed in a      glass cell   containing   absolute  alcohol,  the two
pieces of tinfoil being connected with the poles of the electro
meter. When the bright surface was exposed to daylight, a
small deflexion was obtained which showed the plate to be
negative ; when the dull surface was exposed, the deflexion
was more than doubled, the plate being, like the other, also
negative, and the magnitude of                             its

          Prof. Minchin's Experiments in Photoelectricity.          217
 plates are used.     Large electromotive forces have been
 obtained  with all of them : but they are not all of quite
 equal value.   As has been already stated, if any substance
 containing chlorine is put into the liquid, the E.M.F. of light
   completely ceases.
     If  a small quantity of nitrate of potassium is dissolved in
   the alcohol, a Thomson high-resistance galvanometer will be
   very easily and strongly affected by the photoelectric currents
   of these cells.
      Among liquids an aqueous solution of pyrogallic acid is
   one which presents itself as worthy of trial, since pyrogallic
  acid is a greedy absorber of oxygen ; and     I    have on record a
  striking result of its employment. A small plate of tin foil,
  the surface of which had been cleaned, was covered over with
  a thin layer of water, with which a drop of nitric acid had
  been mixed ; the foil was placed on a glass plate, under
  which was applied a gas-flame until the liquid had quite
  evaporated, and the tin foil remained coated with some salt of
  tin. Whatever this salt was, when this plate was immersed
  in a cell containing absolute alcohol in presence of a cleaned
  tin-foil plate, the first was, on exposure to light, strongly
  negative to the second.      The sensitive plate was then taken
  out of this cell and immersed in another containing a clear
  aqueous solution of pyrogallic acid.        It was now absolutely
  insensitive to light.    Taken out of this cell, and dried with
  blotting-paper, it was again put into the alcohol ; and now,
  on exposure to light, it was found to be strongly positive.
  Here, then, is a case of complete reversal.       This change was
 accompanied by      a slight jerk  or kick  in the  E.M.F., such as
 has been already described in connexion with silver and
 eosine ; that is,  on exposing the plate for the second time in
 alcohol, the initial indication of the electrometer was        very
                                                                a
 slight kick indicating   by     negative E.M.F., but this was
                             a
 immediately followed     a        large deflexion in the opposite
direction.     This  result was repeated many times the plate
                                                        ;
was taken out of the alcohol and dried in the dark for about
two hours, and when replaced in the alcohol cell the jerk and
large contrary' deflexion were obtained.
     A similar experiment has been recently tried with tin-foil
                                                            a
plate sensitized by the process which  I      now adopt, and which
will be presently described, and the result obtained was not
the same as the above.     In the new process the plate appears
to be coated with the white oxide of tin, Sn03     but whether

half as sensitive, and of the same sign (positive) as in the
methyl alcohol; and on replacing it in the alcohol cell,                                                      its

    Dispersion of the Residual Effect. — On the withdrawal of the
 light, the fall of E.M.F. in the cell is usually much slower
 than the rise of E.M.F. on exposure ; and this fact would
 constitute a grave inconvenience if there were no speedy
 remedy. The effect of the light can, however, be quickly and
 satisfactorily overcome by connecting the exposed plate with
 the copper, and the unexposed with the zinc pole of a Daniell
 cell for a few seconds — the time of connexion being longer as
 the time of exposure of the plate to light was longer.      In fact,
 a series of three or four impulsive      contacts with the poles of
 the Daniell, followed by a few seconds' short-circuiting, will
 suffice to remove the residual effect of light, and to leave the
 spot on the electrometer-scale        at the point from which it
 started.
    This result is important, because when feeble light, such as
that of a candle, falls on the cell, the maximum E.M.F. takes
 some minutes to develop, and the return of the spot on the
scale would occupy a long time.
     Variation of the Effect with t/ie Distance of the Source of
Light. — Six cells connected in series were placed on circles of
varying radius, and a candle was in each case placed at the
centre of the circle. The E.M.F. developed by the light of the
candle was, with fair accuracy, found to be inversely propor
tional to the distance of the candle from the cells. As the
intensity of the light varies inversely as the square of the
distance, it follows that the square of the electromotive fore
is proportional to the intensity of the light.
     Curve of Rise of E.M.F.— The law of increase of E.M.F.
                                                            " candle
during exposure was studied by placing a " standard
at a distance of 6 inches from 6 cells connected in series, the
poles of the series being connected with a Thomson quadrant-
electrometer. The deflexions on the scale were noted every
quarter minute, and a curve was traced having the deflexions
for ordinates and the times for abscissas.            The maximum
E.M.F. attained was '566 of that of a Minotto cell, giving for
each cell "094 of this amount.
    If we denote by A the maximum E.M.F. developed, and by
v/ the E.M.F. at any time t, it would appear to be legitimate
to assume the equation

      1 believe the sensitive and insensitive states to be due to
 some molecular alteration, either in the sensitive surface or
  in the liquid, or in their layer of contact — sort of polarity

  by any actual chemical combination.
      A most remarkable instance of these impulsion-effects may
  be cited to show that they are not due to any defective
  contact. Referring to fig.          which represents the sensitive

that on exposing the upper portion, CP, of the plate and
screening the lower, a negative deflaxion ou the scale was
observed — that          a deflexion which indicated that the
                       is,

                                            the upper portion was
screened and the lower exposed,        positive deflexion resulted.

deflexion was observed       ;and on exposing the lower portion
alone, a  positive E.M.F. resulted, as before.     Thus the effect
of the vibration was to alter the nature of the upper portion
 while leaving the lower unaltered.

                                 I
 sensitive plate was completely immersed, and there was, as in
 the last case,   a certain portion, CP, at the upper end which
 was rendered alternately positive and negative by vibrations,
 while the lower portion remained unaltered.           These facts
 seem to be quite inconsistent with       want-of-contact theory.

 from the insensitive.
     While investigating the effect of static charges communi

 found that   if  aVoss machine, not in any way connected with
 the cell or the electrometer, was worked in the room while
 the cell was in the insensitive state, the moment a spark
passed between the poles         of
                              the Voss, the insensitive state was
altered to the sensitive, whether the cell was connected with
the electrometer or not.     The same effect was produced at               a
much greater distance from the cell by the inductive action
of the spark passing between the two poles of the secondary
coil of an induction-coil, as in Hertz oscillator arrangement.

    Impulsion-cells differ much from each other in the readi

 the opposite    but the most obstinate can be thrown from

tioned, to show that in neither state of an impulsion-cell is
there a want of contact, is as follows : — An impulsion-cell
in which both plates hang from the top of the cell, and in
which the liquid did not rise nearly to the level of the junc
tion of either platinum wire with the plate, was made part of
the circuit of a galvanometer and a Daniell cell by means of
a key ; its poles were connected with the electrometer, and
before pressing down the key which put the cell into the
galvanometer circuit, it was made insensitive by an impulse.
On pressing down the key, the needle of the galvanometer
was deflected, and this could not have happened .if either
contact were broken.         In fact, the indication of the gal
vanometer was the same whether the cell was in the sensitive
or in the insensitive state.
    In two or three cells in which the alcohol had partially
evaporated, leaving a portion of the sensitive plate above the
liquid, it was found that, the whole plate having been
originally positive, the portion in the vapour gave a negative
E.M.F., while the lower portion continued positive.
    Among the numerous liquids tried in these cells was
butyric acid, which is efficacious ; but after a few days it
acts on the tin plate and tends to destroy the sensitive
surface.     A plate which had been kept in a cell containing
butyric   acid  for some days was removed into one containing
 propylic alcohol. The effect was that the upper portion
 of the plate exhibited impulsion-effects — being alternately
positive and negative with impulses — while the lower portion
 remained positive.
    In acetone, nitrate of amyl, and glycerine these plates are
 also sensitive — as indeed in water also ; but the E.M.F. in
 these liquids is less than in methyl alcohol.
    It was found also that if the cell contained only the vapour
 of alcohol, an E.M.F. was generated by light, but less than
 that in the liquid.    In aldehyde no E.M.F. due to light was
 observed.
    Hydroxyl has the effect, after about twenty-four hours, of
 giving to the plate a yellowish colour, and also of changing
 the sign of the E.M.F. which exists in the dark.
    It has been found many times that one effect of removing a
 sensitive plate from an alcohol cell to a cell filled with hydroxyl
 or other liquids and then replacing it in the alcohol, was to
 develop impulsion results ; and this fact shows that these
 results cannot be due to any induced electrification on the
 glass of the cell and an action of light on this electrification

            I    am right in supposing that the development of
electrical charges on these sensitive plates          in some way
                                                               is
connected with molecular disturbances produced by electro
magnetic induction or mechanical vibration,                 must be it
admitted that the result          possibly

   The microradiometer of Prof. Boys works wonders in the
measurement of very minute changes of temperature.                                 If,

If    after this we reverse the connexions, t. e. connect the Zn
  pole with the sensitive plate, and allow the spot to settle to
  its position of rest in the dark, and then let the light fall on
  the cell, the deflexion produced          light         by
                                                      very much smaller is
  than before. To quote          particular case — when the Cu pole
                                        a
  was connected with the sensitive plate and the spot came to
  rest, the spot was deflected from this point through 260
  divisions on the scale            and when the connexions were
                                            ;
   reversed and the spot again allowed to come to rest,                was                  it
   deflected from the point of rest through only 50 divisions.

 the E.M.F. due to light, on the supposition that       con                            R    is
 stant, so that the observed deflexion on the scale from the
 point of rest due to the Daniell                     is
                              .   /.             R   \             8     .

 and  if X were the same in the second mode of connexion, the
 deflexion would be also of this value ; but since the deflexion
 is very notably less in the second case, it is almost certain
 that X is also less.
    Observe that in the first mode of connexion the action, or
 possibly only the tendency, of the Daniell is to deposit a
 layer of oxygen on the sensitive plate ; and if light tends to
 reduce oxygen at the surface, its action would be increased
owing to the additional layer due to the Daniell ; while with
the reverse connexions, the reducing action of light would
obviously be lessened.
    The electrolytic action of a Daniell battery on one of these
cells is not permanent ; it disappears rapidly, and, indeed, it
is not certain that anything more than a strain tending to
electrolysis is produced.
    The current of a Daniell cell, or any battery, if passed
through an impulsion-cell, does not influence the state of the
cell — t. e., this current does not alter the sensitive to the
insensitive state, or vice versa.
    Supposing S, and therefore A, to be such that when (in
the first case) light falls on the cell, the spot on the scale is
brought back just to the zero from which it started, if the
Daniell is suddenly removed the light will then cause a
further deflexion — which is the normal amount due to the
light.    This fact agrees perfectly with the theory of a reducing
action, because, in the position of equilibrium of the spot
when both light and the opposing Daniell act, the rate at
which light tends to reduce is equal to that at which the
Daniell tends to deposit oxygen ; and therefore in this
particular case the plate is really in its normal state, so that
when the Daniell is removed, light finds the plate in the
condition in which it would be if no Daniell cell were con
nected with the photoelectric cell.
    Action of Different Colours. — In a sensitive tin-foil cell, the
action of the blue part of the spectrum is very much greater
than that of any other part ; but measurable results can be
obtained all through, as will be seen by the diagram exhibited
to the Society.      The spectrum was that of lime-light passed
through a prism of bisulphide of carbon, a single cell being
used in the experiment.        This cell has been, from time to
time, under experiment for more than four years, and its
action is now exhibited to the Society.        It has not appre
ciably deteriorated, but the time of any one exposure has
never been more than a few minutes.

    In the year 1880 Mr. A. Graham Bell utilized the property
of conductivity possessed by a modification of selenium which
had been previously found to be a conductor, and also the
property of variable conductivity when light of variable
intensity falls upon it. These properties, as is well known,
were utilized in the reproduction of sound by means of a
telephone and a battery in the external circuit of which was
placed a sensitive          selenium conductor.             This selenium
arrangement is usually called a
                                               "  selenium     cell," but a
selenium conductor or a selenium resistance is a much more
appropriate term.
    When the photophone was announced, selenium resistances
were made in this country first,                       I
                                               believe, by Mr. Shelford
Bidwell, who showed some of them at the last meeting of this
Society, and by means of them produced two results of
striking beauty, which                     I
                                 shall presently endeavour to repro
duce by different means.
    Last year 1 set about constructing selenium cells, pro
perly so called— that           cells in which electromotive force
                                   is,                                                is
produced     bythe    action   of  light.     The method adopted was
to take two small clean plates of any metal, to spread a thin
layer of the already recognized sensitive selenium on the
surface of one of them, and, connecting each with                        finea
platinum    wire,  to  immerse     them    in  presence    of  each  other  in
a small glass cell containing           liquid.    a Thus     largo anumber
of metols and a large number of liquids had to be tried for
the best result.      Plates of platinum, silver, tin, copper, zinc,
bismuth, mica, glass, and other substances were tried with
various liquids.      With copper the E.M.F. produced by light
was almost,   if  not quite, zero.       All the others gave consider
able results   ; but much the best result was obtained with
plates of aluminium          and for some time the liquid used was
                             ;
one   of the alcohols    —  preferably methylic.          In the course of
a few days, however, the aluminium plates in alcohol were
found to be covered with            kind of gelatinous deposit, which,
                                               a
I  ana told, is an aluminate of alcohol.            This liquid was, there
 fore, abandoned    ;   and   the  best   result   of  all was found to be
produced with acetone.

rapidly smeared over the aluminium pkte.                  This selenium
layer should be of     uniform     thickness, and the thickness must
be neither very great nor very small.                When the layer is
deposited, the aluminium             plate is quickly removed from
tho porcelain plate by the forceps                 and rapidly moved
up    and    down    in   the    air   for   a  few  seconds, the gas-
flame being, at the same time, removed from under the
porcelain plate.       Both plates having now become slightly
cooler, the aluminium plate is replaced on a comparatively
cool part of the porcelain plate, and any tendency of the
selenium to become liquid is checked by blowing over its
surface.      Working the gas-flame now rapidly backwards
and forwards under the porcelain plate and occasionally
blowing over the selenium surface, a series of changes — very
much resembling those presented in the preparation of a
sensitive tin surface — are observed.            The appearances are as
follows : —
    1. The originally jet-black            selenium   surface gradually
assumes a bluish-white appearance.
    2. As the process is continued, this latter surface becomes
a grey which may be of several shades.                It may be a light
 grey,  or   a  grey  with     a violet   tinge,  or a  grey with some
glossy spots or streaks.          None of these surfaces is to be
accepted.       They are the final forms which most readily pre
 sent themselves ; and when they do, the selenium must be
 melted afresh and again spread over the aluminium plate —
the whole process being repeated with ite gradual heatings
and coolings, until finally —
    3. The surface of the selenium assumes a very dark brown
 colour.
    This is tho most sensitive surface that can be obtained.
 At first, accepting too literally the statement that " the grey
 modification of selenium is the sensitive one,"              I accepted
 every plate which finally assumed a grey appearance, and
 constructed a large number of cells for a battery.                   By
 accident, however, a plate with the brownish colour was
 formed, and it proved to be so much superior to the others,
 that they were all rejected.
    The glossy spots and streaks which sometimes exist on the
 grey surfaces are,     I think, due to an indefinitely thin layer of
 the black selenium which has escaped the necessary transform
 ation ; and to observe them, it is well to look at the plate
 almost in the plane of its surface.          The dark brown surface is
 devoid   of  them,  and   is in appearance quite homogeneous.
    When the plate has assumed this appearance, it may be
 screened from light and left on the porcelain plate to get

cool, for which about ten minutes will suffice.        When the
plate has cooled, it can, apparently, be kept in the dark, un-
immersed in any liquid, for any length of time before being
put into the acetone cell. A plate was thus kept for sixteen
days, and then, on being placed in the acetone cell, it was as
sensitive as if it had been immersed immediately after forma
tion.    It is a marked peculiarity of the seleno-aluminium cell
that, immediately after it has been set up, it is wonderfully
rapid in its response to light, and that on the withdrawal of
the light the E.M.F. at once disappears ; but after a few
days it is much slower in both respects — particularly the
latter — while its sensitiveness as regards the magnitude of the
E.M.F.     developed is unimpaired.
   The dispersion of the residual effect is produced by the
means before described for the tin cells, viz., connexion with
a Daniell cell, the sensitive plate being now, of course, con
nected with the Zn pole of the Daniell.
    No sensitive and insensitive states due to vibrations,
mechanical or electromagnetic, have, so far, been observed in

described, the sensitive plate in a seleno-aluminium cell is
strongly negative towards the insensitive plate when the cell
is exposed to light.

in their great sensitiveness to all parts of the spectrum, the
maximum effect being produced in the yellow near the
borders of the green.
    No very accurate experiment has yet been made on this
subject, because the Thomson quadrant-electrometer at my
disposal happens to be out of order ; but with Clifton's form
of the instrument, in which great sensitiveness has been
aimed at rather than accuracy or constancy, the following
numbers represent the relative electromotive forces produced
by the spectrum of an albocarbon light formed by a bisulphide-

course, the number 101, corresponding to the border of green
and blue, is less than it should oe.
    All other photoelectric cells may almost be said to be
sensitive to the blue alone.
    Effect of Continuous Exposure       to Light. — The effect of
exposing a seleno-aluminium cell continuously to daylight
depends on whether the cell is left on open or on closed
circuit.    A cell left on open circuit for many hours, and then
kept   in the dark until its E.M.F. settles down, will be found
to have fallen to one fifth of its original value ; but if
then kept during the night and observed in the morning,
the E.M.F. produced by exposure to light will have quite
recovered its first magnitude.      Not so with the cell on closed
circuit ; its E.M.F., on fresh exposure, will be reduced to
nearly one half its original value.
    A cell which had been exposed to daylight for five days
 (with, of course, the advantage of each night's resuscitation)
is now shown to the Society, and its action can be compared
with that of a fresh cell.
    Connexion    with a Daniell during Exposure. — When a
Daniell with a very great resistance interposed, as described
in connexion with the tin cells, is connected with a seleno-
aluminium cell, so that the Zn pole is first connected with
the sensitive plate, and then with the insensitive, the E.M.F.
developed by light is much greater in the first case than in
the second — a result which is the same as before, since the
seleno-aluminium plate is the negative one in the cell, and
therefore the effect of this connexion with the Daniell is to
develop between the poles of the photo cell a difference of
potential opposed in sign to that winch light produces.
    Mechanical Effects. — The E.M.F. generated by light in a
photoelectric battery can be utilized for ringing electric bells,
 lighting or extinguishing electric lamps, and possibly other
 things, although the materials of the battery are never used
 up in producing currents.      The method which      I  have em
 ployed consists in utilizing the motions of an electrometer
 needle (due to the E.M.F. of the photoelectric battery) for
 making a contact and completing the circuit of an ordinary
 voltaic battery, whose current, thus completed, rings a bell,
 lights a lamp, &c.
    The first arrangement which     I employed for this purpose
 was as follows : — At the middle of the aluminium needle of a
 quadrant-electrometer, and at right angles to the length of
 the needle, is fixed a very fine glass tube about         lj inch
 long ; a platinum wire traverses the interior of this glass

          Prof. Minchin's Experiments in Photoelectricity.   233
 tube and, coming out at its ends, this wire terminates in two
 little spheres of platinum. Over the quadrants were fixed two
small mercury-cups which were completely insulated from the
quadrants and which were permanently connected               with
 the poles of an external battery which had an electric bell in
 its circuit.    "When light shone on the photoelectric battery
 (whose    poles  were connected with those of the electrometer),
 the needle was deflected and, carrying the little glass tube
 with    it,brought the platinum points into contact with the
 mercury in the cups    ;  thus the circuit of the voltaic battery
was completed, and the bell rung. This arrangement was
 unsatisfactory, owing to the difficulty with which the plati
num points separated from the mercury, and           it  has been
 replaced      by   much more satisfactory plan devised by Mr.
                    a
Appleyard, to whom      I     beg to express my thanks for the
untiring perseverance which he devoted to the perfecting of
the apparatus.
     The improved arrangement     is as follows —
                                               :

 the long diameter, N N, of the needle, and terminating in a
 sphere, p ; the portion m r of the wire dips into a shallow
dish, d, of mercury which is supported below the quadrants
by an arm not represented ; a platinum wire, t, dips into the
 dish d, and, passing outside the case of the electrometer, is
connected with one end of the coil of a small electromagnet, e,
 whose armature is a ; the other end of this coil is connected
 with one pole of a weak voltaic cell, b, whose other pole is
 connected with a small platinum plate, «, through a sup
 port, A, which is fixed inside the case of the electrometer, and,
 of course, insulated from the needle and the quadrants ; the
 platinum plate s is fixed tolerably close to the position of rest
 of the platinum point p ; and when the needle is deflected by
 the E.M.F. of a photoelectric battery, P, connected with the
poles, C, D, of the electrometer, the point p comes into contact
 with the plate s and completes the circuit of the voltaic
 cell b, and thus brings the armature a into contact Avith the
 magnet of the coil e : this connexion completes the circuit of
a voltaic battery, B, in whose circuit is an incandescent
lamp, L, or an electric bell, which is then set in action.
The needle is connected with the sulphuric acid jar,         J, by
means of a fine platinum wire, w, bent into a semicircular
form so as to avoid contact with the dish d when the needle
moves, the wire w terminating in a vertical length exactly
under the centre of the needle ; thus, since the wires r and v
are in the vertical axis of rotation of the needle, no appreci
able friction hinders the motion of the needle.
    The needle is suspended by two fine silk fibres,/,/, from a
support A inside the case of the electrometer.         Instead of
the two external voltaic batteries, B, b, one would theoreti
cally suffice ; but it is found that, to prevent sparking and
" stiction " between p and « when the current is made, it is
preferable to have a very weak current traversing this portion
of the arrangement — one which is just sufficient to work the
electromagnet e.
    In this way, by means of a few seleno-aluminium cells, P,
I  have found no difficulty in ringing a boll by the light of a
taper or that of a match held at a distance of a few feet from
the battery P.     Observe that by this method we never draw-
on the    materials  of the photo-battery, because no current
ever passes through it ; it is simply connected with the poles
of the electrometer, and its E.M.F. alone is employed.
                 The Problems of Photoelectricity.
   Three prominent problems in this subject deserve to be
signalized.    The first, and least pretentious, is the construe

         Prof. Minchin's Eatperimenis in Photoelectricity.      235
tion   of a really scientific photometer.    It cannot be said that
the comparison of two lights by means of a spot of grease is
a very satisfactory procedure ; but in the seleno-aluminiuin
cell we have, on account of its great sensitiveness and range
in the spectrum, an approximation to the possibility of an
elect rophotometer — at least so far as the comparison of lights
is concerned. For, assuming that, by means of such a cell,
we take, as it were, each light to pieces, and note the inten
sities of the different colours — which are directly proportional
to the squares of the corresponding electromotive forces —
we could then apply the principle of Newton's chromatic
circle to determine the value of the resultant light.           The
second problem — and that which in 1877 induced me to
work at this subject — is the electrical transmission of an
image to any distance ; in other words, the construction of a
telephotograph. The problem seems to be one of exceedingly
great difficulty — much more difficult than the problem of the
telephone— because the parts of an image are simultaneous
and not, like the sounds of the voice, successive ; and, indeed,
we have also to deal with a quick succession if we are to
transmit a living moving image, such as Homer depicted on
the shield of Achilles.      The early attempt which    I made con
sisted in the construction of a cable, somewhat on the model
of the optic nerve. The optic nerve consists of a bundle of
fibres, each a conductor of electricity and each separated
from its neighbour by being surrounded by a medium. One
 set of ends of this nerve abuts on the retina, which is its
sensitized plate, and the other in the brain.      It is well known
that light incident on the eye causes a photographic decom
 position on the retina ; and        I  believe that images have
 been seen on the retina of a rabbit winch was immediately
 killed after a strong light had been presented to its eye.
The images, then, of external objects are transmitted along
the optic-nerve cable to the brain, where by some means
 or other they result in a process of thought.              Possibly
 thought is an equivalent of at least a part of the originally
 incident energy.      No satisfactory solution of this problem
 will be attained by any slow and painful mechanical pro
 cess of tracing out in succession the various portions of a
 picture ; and it does not now seem that we are near any
 true solution of the problem, whatever startling stories the
 newspapers may from time to time report.
     The third problem is the direct transformation of the
 radiant energy of the sun into work useful to us, without the
 consumption (at least on any large scale) of materials on the
 earth — in other words to get rid of that terrible waster of

energy, the steam-engine.               I
                                    usually find two objections
made against any investigation in this direction.         The first
 is,that the attempt    contrary
                        is        to  the  principle of the conser
vation of energy. The objection, however, does not seem to
be well founded     ;because       itconceivable that
                                        is                   photo a
electric battery may yet be found which will simply act as                       a
transformer of the energy which            receives from the sun,
                                                 it
while its own materials, being merely the implements used
in the process, may be almost wholly unmodified. The
energy thus taken out of the sun may finally be radiated
out into space from the earth in the form of heat,            iftrue
                                                                   it   is
that all forms of energy must ultimately pass into this form
— proposition which, being
     a                                 very wide generalization
                                            a
from our experience on the earth,            may be permitted to
                                                  it
doubt in the universal necessity claimed for it.
   The second objection     that there
                             is             not energy enough in
                                                  is
the solar ravs at the distance of the earth to supply the work
desired.    This objection     founded on the experiments of
                                  is
Pouillet, Violle, and others, who have estimated the solar
energy incident per square foot per second on the surface of
the earth.    Let us see how much energy, according to the
assumptions based on these experiments,          at our disposal.
                                                       is
   The quantity of solar energy, assumed to be measured                          in
metric thermal units, which            incident, normally, every
                                            is

                                   A
                                 a',
where, according to Pouillet, A (the solar constant)                             is
 T7633 calories, a (the atmospheric constant)       somethingis
between -7244 and -7888   — let us say  that a=-75    and         ;          e   is
the ratio of the thickness of atmosphere traversed to the
normal thickness of the atmosphere measured from the place
of observation. M. Violle employs        formula of this form,
                                                  a
but, according  to him, involves

A = 2*54 calories.   At the superior limit of the atmosphere

according to Violle.    Converting these into foot-pounds'
weight per square foot per second, we have
63*42 foot-pounds' weight per sq. foot per second                      (Pouillet),

    The quantity      of solar energy existing at any instant in
one cubic foot of space at the surface of the earth      of course,   is,
obtained by dividing these numbers            the velocity of the
                                                       by
radiations in feet per second (roughly 10      and this quantity
                                                       ),                       is
infinitesimally small.   Perhaps       the infinitesimal value of
                                             it   is
the energy in    acubic foot which impresses people so strongly
with the insufficiency of the solar radiation for doing work                     ;
but is it  obvious that with this quantity we are not concerned.
It      the amount which
       is                       contained at any instant in the

    The number assumed by Clerk Maxwell           Electricity and

                                            is        very nearlyis
what Pouillet's becomes at the superior limit of the atmo
sphere.
   Thus we see that the amount of power at our disposal                         is
small — yet, perhaps, not hopelessly small.
   But  is   necessary to accept this deduction from Pouillet's
            it

                              I                       not by any
                                                            it   is
means certain that        blackened surface, such as that in
                              a
Pouillet's pyrheliometer, catches up and transforms into heat
every form of energy in the solar beam.             There may be
forms of energy which take no notice of blackened surfaces
and which refuse to be converted into heat               means of     by
them. Perhaps the proper receptive surfaces for them remain
to be discovered     and
                      ;         this consideration chiefly which
                                  it   is
gives hope    to  the  experimenter in Photoelectricity.      The
dissipation of every form    of energy  in the  Universe into the
final form of heat of uniform temperature                   is
                                                       dogma and a
nothing else — and, moreover,         dogma which leads to the
                                             a

the case of energy incident on the retina, telephotographically
transmitted to the brain, and converted into — or, at any rate,
productive of — thought      and can they show that after this
                                  ;
process nothing   but  heat remains              ?
   It not to the pxirpose to say that, " so far as we know,"
      is
all forms of energy must run into heat finally, and be diffused
throughout the Universe, because we may even still imagine
that there are many very astonishing physical facts beyond
what we know,        indeed, even in the unspeakably dismal

           object of the present paper (which may be considered
THE     as a continuation of that published in the American
Journal of Science for June 1889) will be: —
    1st. To describe the reactions of gold-coloured allotropic
silver.
    2nd. To show that there exists a well-characterized form of
silver intermediate between the allotropic silver previously
described and ordinary silver, differing in a marked way from
both.
   3rd. To prove that all the forms of energy act upon
allotropic silver, converting it either into ordinary silver
or into the intermediate form.               Mechanical force (shearing
stress)   and   high-tension     electricity    convert it directly into
ordinary silver.       Heat   and     chemical     action convert it first
into the intermediate form, then into ordinary silver.                    The
action of light is to produce the intermediate form only, and
even the most prolonged action at ordinary temperatures doe?
not carry it beyond this.
   4th. 7o show that there exists a remarkable parallelism
between the action of these forms of force on allotropic silver
and their action on the silver haloids, indicating that it is
not improbable that in these haloids silver may exist in the
allotropic condition.
                               Reactions.
   The most characteristic reactions of gold-coloured allotropic
silver are those with the strong acids.            When normal silver re
duced with milk sugar and alkaliue hydroxide is left in contact
with strong hydrochloric acid even for several hours, there is no

action, and the silver after thorough washing dissolves in
warm dilute nitric acid without residue.               With allotropic
silver similarly treated,       chloride   is  always formed.       But
strong hydrochloric         acid instantly converts allotropic to
ordinary silver, and consequently only a trace of chloride is
produced. By largely diluting the acid the conversion is
retarded and the proportion of chloride is greatly increased.
Thus, for example, when ordinary hydrochloric acid is diluted
with fifty times its volume of water and is made to act on
allotropic silver, about one third of the latter is converted to
chloride.     Probably the whole would be but for the simul
taneous conversion to normal silver.            This double action is
very curious, and strongly differentiates allotropic from
ordinary silver. Even with the same acid diluted with a
hundred times its volume of water, there is a gradual but
complete conversion to white silver accompanied by the pro
duction of a not inconsiderable quantity of silver chloride.
    Neutral chlorides also act strongly upon allotropic silver,
even when much diluted.           So sensitive is this form of silver
to the action    of chlorides   that  if in washing it on the filter
river-water containing a mere trace of chlorides is by an
oversight used instead of distilled water, a grey film of
normal silver will form on the surface.
    The reactions above described were obtained with the moist
precipitate freshly prepared.       By standing for some time, even
 if kept moist, it appears to undergo a change. When freshly
prepared, it is slightly soluble in acetic acid, but after standing
 for a week or two ceases to be so.
    Sulphuric acid diluted with fifty times its volume of water
has no action upon normal silver. When made to act upon
allotropic silver, it instantly converts it to normal but at the
 same time dissolves a little of it.
    It is rather curious that the dry film of gold-coloured
 allotropic silver seems to be more easily acted upon by some
 reagents than the moist precipitate.              I  have noticed, for
 example,   that  oxalic, citric,  and  tartaric  acids  do not convert
 the moist precipitate to normal silver, but films on pure
 paper are gradually whitened by these acids.               It is not a
 question    of  strength    of  solution,  for  the  moist  precipitate
 remained unchanged for twenty-four hours under the same
 solution which whitened the same material as a dry film.
    Ammonia seems to be without converting action, but dis
 solves a trace.     It will be shown in a future paper that there
 exists   a   form   of allotropic silver abundantly soluble in
 ammonia.

cates some remarkable molecular change.              It will be noticed
that the anomaly lies in this, that pressure instantly effects the
complete change from the original form to normal silver, heat
effects the same change but with an intermediate stage, at
which stage pressure no longer produces a ny action.
   The intermediate form is distinguished from normal silver
almost solely by its bright yellow colour and its higher lustre.
This last difference is very striking when a film on glass is
heated in the manner above described.              The central parts, in
changing     to white   silver,  become    wholly lustreless ; whilst the
                               "
circle of " intermediate          retains all its original lustre. Its
continuity is still complete, so that if viewed through the
glass it still acts as a mirror.
    This change may be either molecular or depend on
dehydration.
    The latter seems doubtful, for the change cannot be brought
about by desiccation.           Films on paper, on glass, and also
solid material were kept over sulphuric aciu in vacuo for
twelve days* without bringing about this modification. (They
were of course thoroughly protected from light.)
    Light is also capable of effecting to some extent this
change, as will be described further on.
               Copper-coloured           Allotropic Silver.
    The colour of allotropic silver depends to a remarkable
 extent on the amount of washing which the freshly prepared
 material receives.
     With a short washing the material dries to a bright yellow-
 gold colour ; with more washing to a reddish colour ; with
 still more, the colour is a deep rich copper shade.
     The washing, when conducted in the ordinary manner, is
 exceedingly troublesome ; the material soon begins to run
 through the filter, and blocks it up.
     This trouble may be completely avoided by washing with a
 2-per-cent. solution of Hochelle salt instead of pure water,

   Substances of a character nearly related to those that                    I
have described in this and the previous paper, are obtained
by acting on silver tartrate with stannous nitrate.                       The
method is more troublesome and gives inferior results, the
 gold-coloured product is less pure.              A beautiful steel-blue
substance obtained in this way was found to contain a con
siderable quantity of tin, probably present as stannic oxide ;
 10"87 per cent, of tin corresponding to 13'80 Sn03 was
found by analysis. Another analysis gave 10'66 per cent.,
corresponding to 13"G1 Sn03. In the first case, the quantity
of silver found was 83-61, in the second 84-12 per cent.
These results do not lead to any satisfactory formula.                    The
tin is no doubt present as an impurity, and as the iron pro
cess gave far better results, the examination was not carried
further.     Silver citrate gives similar results.

                         1.  Action of Electricity.
    High-tension electricity instantly converts gold-coloured
silver to the ordinary form. When paper covered with a
film of gold-coloured silver is held between the conductors of
a Topler-Holtz machine,            each spark forms a grey dot of
ordinary silver. A powerful discharge is not necessary ; an
inch spark from a small machine is effectual, even when the
condensers are cut off. •There is also a lateral action, which
is best seen when several slips of such paper are held loosely
together and placed between the conductors.                      When the
slips are opened a little, the lateral branches are beautifully
seen, playing through the silver.             Their fine emerald-green
colour contrasts with the purplish shade of the spark.
    When several pieces are in this way held between the
conductors together, there is a transfer of silver from one
   In another  vessel are placed : —

   (The substances must be added in the order above given, and be mixed
immediately before using.     It is scarcely necessary to say that distilled
water must be used exclusively.)     As soon as the mixtures are made the
iron solution is to be poured into the silver and vigorously stirred for some
time.   The white silver tartrate becomes almost immediately bright red,
then deepens in colour, and finally becomes black.

 piece to the other, so that the back     of each piece of paper is
 blackened by silver carried over from the one behind it.
    That the branching grey spots in this way formed arc
 normal silver, is easily proved by immersing the piece in a
 dilute solution of potassium ferricyanide.          The part acted
 upon by electricity   is  not affected  by the reagent, whilst the
 rest of the film shows the coloration characteristic of allo
 tropic silver.    In Plate I. the upper figure shows a slip of
 paper, at one end of which electricity has been transmitted ;
 and the figure below, a similar slip that has been subjected
 to the action of the ferricyanide, showing that where elec
 tricity has passed the silver has become normal and is not
 affected by the reagent.
                          2. Action  of Heat.
    Allotropic silver is converted by heat to normal silver in
either the wet or the dry state.
    Dry Heat. — When films of allotropic silver on glass arc
placed in a water desiccator, and are kept at 100° C. for eight
 or nine hours, the central portions are converted into the
intermediate form, whilst at the edges there is a border of
 greyish-white ordinary silver.        In fact the change to white
silver at the edge commences before the central part is fully
converted to the intermediate form.
    At higher temperatures the change is much more rapid
and better marked. At 180° 0. the first effect is to darken a
little (this is usually the first effect of heat) : this continues
about five minutes. Continuing the heat for ten minutes
more, the slight darkening disappears and the film has a
bright pure gold colour, sometimes with a slight salmon
tinge.    The change to the intermediate form is now complete,
the film burnishes yellow, and does not react with potassium
ferricyanide.      It is of interest to remark that the colour
reaction persists as long as there is a trace of unconverted
material, so that a film may burnish yellow and yet show a well-
marked colour reaction.       This is because most, but not all of
the material has undergone conversion.
    At 200° O. the film hegins in about 10 minutes to show a
white border, and in half an hour or thereabouts it whitens
completely.
    Allotropic silver in the solid form heated to 1803 or 190°
for about 15 minutes undergoes a similar change : where
as before it was easily pulverized, it is now almost impossible
to reduce it to powder, and the powder is yellow instead of
being greyish black.

244                       Mr. M. Carey Lea on
   Moist Heat. — A film spread on pure paper and placed in
distilled water maintained at 99° or 100° without actually
boiling, at the end of half an hour is converted almost wholly
to the intermediate form.    It burnishes pure yellow, but still
shows traces of the colour reaction.
   A better plan of operating is to immerse a film spread on
glass in distilled water, and to place it in a desiccator with a
water-jacket.     After keeping for twenty-four hours close to
100° 0., the film has become pure white.       It is not disinte
grated by the change, but may be detached from the glass in
films exactly resembling ordinary silver leaf.
   The effects of heat are shown in Plate           I.,

figures.
       3.   Action   of   Mechanical Force (Shearing Stress).
     The slightest application of force suffices to instantly con
 vert gold-coloured allotropic silver to normal silver.       A   glass
rod with     a   rounded end drawn lightly over the surface of
a    film on paper, leaves       awhite trace behind it. The force
sufficient to cause this change       is so slight, that one might
doubt its reality were      itnot for the decisive proof immediately
at hand.      First, there   isthe characteristic change of colour   :
the film      as yellow and as brilliant as gold leaf         the line
         by is
                                                          ;
drawn        the glass rod    is of pure white silver.     Immersing
 the film in     a solution of potassium ferricyanide, the white
 lines simply change to gold colour, whilst the film surface on
 which they are drawn passes through        a  brilliant succession of
 colours.    (These effects are represented in Plate II., the
 uppermost      figures.)    For this use, freshly made material
 should be employed, and the film itself should have been
 freshly spread on pure paper or card and used within           a   few
 hours after drying.       This because of its easy partial passage,
 especially in thin films, to the intermediate state, in which      it
gives a     yellow streak.     (See also remarks as to partial con
 version, ante.)
     When the experiment         performed under proper conditions,
                                 is
 the effect  is  very striking by reason of the instant conversion
 of the pure, deep yellow metal to perfect whiteness without
a   trace of colour.
      In an earlier communication to the American Journal of
                                            '
 Science,'  it  was mentioned that, having taken with me on          a
journey several small vials containing gold-coloured silver,
they were found at the end of the journey to be all converted
into white silver without having undergone any disaggrega
 tion, and retaining the original shape of the fragments. The

                  Gold-coloured AUotropic Silver.              245
  white silver formed had the fine frosted white colour of pure
  silver.  This change was attributed to the friction of the frag
  ments against each other, occasioned by the motion during
  the journey; a conclusion that was confirmed by finding
  that when cotton-wool was forced into the empty part of the
 vial in such a way as to prevent all internal movement, the
 substance could be sent over a four-fold distance without
 alteration.
     It was also observed (and this is a matter of special
 interest) that when a partial change had been effected by
 friction, this alteration went on, although the substance was
 left perfectly at rest, until it became complete.    With time,
 all solid specimens of allotropic silver undergo this sponta
 neous change to bright white silver, apparently normal silver,
 even when thoroughly protected from light.          Out of over
 twenty specimens in tightly corked tubes, packed in a box
 and left in a dark closet for a year, not one escaped conver
 sion. Spread on paper or on glass and duly protected, the
 change is slower.
                     4. Action  of Strong Acids.
     The action of acids upon allotropic silver has been already
 described ; it remains only to add here that the conversion to
 normal silver is entirely unaccompanied by the escape of
gaseous matter ; not a bubble can be detected by the closest
 observation.
     By acting on dry films with dilute sulphuric acid it is easy
to make the conversion gradual, and so to trace its passage
 through the intermediate form.
     With sulphuric acid diluted with four times its bulk of
water and allowed to cool, an immersion of one or two seconds
converts a film on glass or on pure paper wholly to the
intermediate form. It is then bright gold yellow, but shows
 no colour with the ferricyanide reagent.
     With sulphuric acid diluted with twice its bulk of water
and used whilst still hot, the action is instantaneous, and the
allotropic silver is converted into light grey, normal silver.
The silver obtained in this way is very indifferent and gives
no reaction with potassium ferricyanide, whereas even ordinary
silver leaf gives a pale-coloured reaction. (See Plate II., lower
pair of figures.)
    The same acid after cooling acts more slowly ; the product
is more yellowish, owing to the presence of a certain quantity
of the intermediate form.

246                     Mr. M. Carey Lea on
                         5. Action  of Light.
     When allotropic silver is spread as a thin film on glass or
on pure paper, it may be preserved           for a length of time
apparently unchanged. This appearance is deceptive. From
the moment that the film is formed, a slow but steady change
commences, which can be best explained by supposing that a
gradual polymerization takes place.         Even after eight or ten
hours1 exposure to ordinary diffuse light, a distinct loss of
activity can be detected by careful testing with potassium
ferricyanide.     The change which occurs is in the nature of a
tendency to a very gradual passage into what          I have called
the intermediate form, in which the gold-yellow colour
remains unchanged whilst the chemical activity is lost or
much diminished.        Although a commencement of this change
can be detected in a few hours, it goes on very slowly.          Bv
exposure to one or two days of summer sunshine (a much
longer time is required in winter) , the change is nearly com
plete.     The exposed portions are lighter and brighter, and in
solution of ferricyanide they colour very slowly.
     The question naturally arose whether light, by a sufficiently
 long continued exposure, could complete the change and
 convert allotropic to ordinary white silver.          To obtain a
 decisive answer the following experiment was made : —
     At a window having a south-eastern exposure and un
 obstructed light, there were placed films on glass and on pure
paper.      Some of these were placed in a printing-frame under
 an opaque design ; the others stood side by side with the first,
 but uncovered. The exposure was continued for four montlis,
 from the end of January to the end of May.          At the expira
 tion of this time the uncovered paper and glass films were
 still bright yellow.     But of those in the printing-frame the
 exposed portions had become nearly white, whilst the pro
 tected parts retained their full deep gold colour.       It may at
  first seem strange that the uncovered pieces were less affected
  than those exposed in the frame. But this difference was
  always observed, namely, that if two films were exposed side
  by side, the one in a printing-frame under glass, the other
  simply fastened to a board, the last mentioned was always
  the less affected.   The explanation of this seeming anomaly
  lies in the fact that allotropic silver is always much more
  easily affected by heat than by light.          The glass in the
  printing-frame,    by  exposure  to sunlight,  becomes  hot to the
  touch,  and  thus  the film  under  it is kept  at a  temperature
  many degrees higher than that of the other film that is freely

                    Gold-coloui'ed    Allotropic Silver.                  247
exposed to the air ; the higher          temperature aids the effect of
the light       \
         It
      appears, therefore, that the agency of light is somewhat
similar to that of the other forms of energy, but very much
slower.     Experiments made for the purpose demonstrated
that it is the more refrangible rays that effect the change.
   With light, the production of the intermediate form is
never very satisfactory.     LoDg exposures are needed, and
before the change to the intermediate form is complete, the
further alteration to white seems to commence.        With heat
the changes are much better marked.
   When a film on pure paper has received an exposure of one
or two days of summer sunshine under an opaque design, the
exposed portions are sufficiently changed to have lost much of
their chemical activity, so that when the film is plunged into
a bath of potassium ferricyanide, the effect given in the lower
figure of Plate      III.
                      is obtained ; the colour represented is
one of an immense variety of tints produced by this reagent
on the unaltered or active form.   The upper figure of the same
Plate gives the effect of a very protracted exposure (as above
described) on pure paper (or glass) under glass.          With
some kinds of sized paper, this effect is produced by a much
shorter exposure, apparently owing to the presence of traces
of a hyposulphite    which appears to aid the action of light.
                         -f,
   These seem to be not merely new facts, bat to belong to                  a
ne >v class of facts. No instance has been hitherto known of an
element existing in so great a variety of forms, and passing
so readily under the influence of any form of energy from
one to another of them.
      Since this was written      find that both Herschel and Hunt noticed
     *
                               I
au analogous fact    in the case of silver chloride, viz. that paper prepared
with      darkens more rapidly under glass than when freely exposed
          it                                                                ;
without, however, suggesting* the cause, which     is  the same in both cases.
I  have observed that silver chloride darkens more rapidly when exposed
under warm water than under cold to the same light in vessels side by
side.
 t    The behaviour of these varieties of paper led me to make inquiries
 of an intelligent paper-manufacturer,     from whom    I  learned that every
sort of paper pulp  is   now treated with chlorine.     As any portion of the
bleaching material left in the paper would eventually destroy its strength,
it becomes necessary to add hyposulphite in excess to remove it. Accord
ingly every specimen of sized paper that       I    have examined contained
hyposulphite,    even  the purest photographic  papers  were not free from it
though containing greatly less than most others.        Apparently, the only
difference     that, with photographic paper more care
               is                                           is taken to avoid
any considerable excess of hyposulphite.

248                   Mr. M. Carey Leu     on
   It is evident that a connexion must almost certainly exist
between these varied transformations and the changes which
many silver salts undergo through the action of light and
other forces.   This connexion will form the subject of the
second part of this paper.  The present part will be concluded
by a somewhat fuller description of the colour reaction which
is especially characteristic of allotropic silver.
                    The Colour Reaction.
   When allotropic silver is immersed in a solution of a sub
stance  readily parting with oxygen or sulphur, or with a
halogen, a film is formed which exhibits the colours of thin
plates.  Such phenomena are familiar, and are seen in the
bluing or yellowing of steel in tempering, and the colouring
of other metals when covered with films of oxide or sulphide.
With allotropic silver the colours are very brilliant, probably
because silver is the best of all reflectors for rays havinga nearly
perpendicular incidence, sending back about 90 per cent, of
such.    Light gold-coloured silver gives the most brilliant
effects.
   The substances which produce these reactions are potassium
ferricyanide and permanganate, ferric and mercuric chlorides,
alkaline hypochlorites and sulphides, mixtures of potassium
bichromate with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, solution
of iodine, &c.
   Potassium ferricyanide in a five or ten per cent, solution
is the best of these reagents, because its action is more dis-
stinctive.   In particular, the blues which it gives are of great
purity   and   the purples very rich.      Ferric chloride gives
beautiful tints, especially a peculiar glittering rose-colour.
It must be very much diluted, until the solution loses its
yellow colour and takes a straw shade.       It often happens that
 the characteristic colour does not appear whilst the film is
in the solution, but a bronze shade only, the permanent colour
appearing only after the film has been dipped into water and
blotted off.     Potassium permanganate also gives rise to a
 beautiful succession of colours on allotropic silver, but is
somewhat uncertain in its action.
    A ferricyanide is therefore the best reagent. As to the
substance constituting the film which is formed, it is difficult
to say whether it is silver suboxide or ferrocyanide.       When
potassium ferricyanide is allowed to act on moist allotropic
silver suspended in   it, and the action of the ferricyanide      is
carried to its limit, the silver   is entirely converted into     a

                  Gold-coloured Allotropic Silver.           249
 yellowish-white powder, consisting almost wholly of silver
 ferrocyanide mixed with a little silver ferricyanide.
     Of the many varieties of ordinary silver which exist, allo
 tropic silver is convertible into two only. The high-tension
 spark, heat, and acids convert it to dull grey silver ; on this
 variety potassium ferricyanide has no action whatever, as will
 be seen by an inspection of the Plates.     Light (under glass)
and pressure each convert allotropic to bright white silver,
and on this form potassium ferricyanide acts slightly, con
 verting the silver colour to gold. It is needless to say that
this gold colour has nothing to do with allotropic silver ; it
 seems to be produced in the following way : —
    When potassium ferricyanide acts on films of allotropic
silver, its first effect is to deepen the gold colour to a gold
brown, passing rapidly on to other shades.         The action on
the bright white silver is very slight and apparently just
reaches    this gold stage, which corresponds to an air-film
having a thickness of from 0"000150 mm. to 0*000160 mm.
    The succession of colours obtained on allotropic silver with
potassium ferricyanide is as follows : —
                              First Order.
            Russet-brown.
            Brown-red.
                         Second Order.
            Rich and deep purple.
            Dark blue.
            Bright blue.
            Pale blue.
            Green russet.
            Red.
                             Third Order.
            Reddish purple.
            Bluish purple.
            Rich green.
    The fourth order is not reached, for after this the colours
become much mixed, probably the action is no longer suffi
ciently uniform. The other differences, besides the absence
of the fourth order, as will have been observed, are that, in
place of the yellow of the second order corresponding to a
thickness of air of 0"000432 mm., there is a green though
of a more russet shade than that of the third order.
    In the third order there is at no time a pure blue
corresponding to 0'000602, but only a succession of beautiful
red and blue purples, gradually passing into green.

250                      Mr. S. Bidwell on     some
   There aro few more beautiful experiments than to watch
these changes.        Purity of colour, however, depends much on
the purity of the paper employed.            Want of this purity will
often cut short      the   changes   at the   pale blue of the second
order.
   I   have endeavoured to give some idea of these colours in
the Plates which accompany this paper, but it has proved to
be a most difficult task.         The colours represented are —
    Plate I., purple and blue of the second order.
   Plate II., purple of the second order and green of the third
order.
   Plate    III., brown-red of the first order.
   It has not, however, been found possible to correctly re
produce the brilliancy and depth of colour of the originals.
                       Explanation of    the  Plates.
   In   each pair of figures the upper one represents the effect
of exposing allotropic silver to some form of energy. The
 changes are in all cases the same ; the gold-coloured silver is
 converted by all forms of energy to ordinary silver.
    In the lower of each pair of figures the effect is repre
 sented which would be produced by immersing the upper one
in a solution of potassium ferricyanide.               This affords proof
 of the completeness of the change by showing that gold-
 coloured silver in passing into the ordinary form has lost its
 power of reacting with a ferricyanide.             In these lower figures
 an attempt has been made to show some of the colours pro
 duced in this way.         But they fall short of the originals in
 brilliancy    and intensity.      These last are so remarkable that
 the lithographer who        executed   the work remarked that even
 an artist with a brush and palette of colours could not imitate
 them, and that, therefore, it was hopeless to expect to repro
 duce them by lithography.              In other respects the Plates
 represent fairly     well  the  changes that take place.

         is well known that selenium, like sulphur, which it

 of existing in several distinct forms, differing greatly in
 appearance.       The modifications most commonly met with are

 80° to 100°, becomes transformed into the ordinary dark-
coloured vitreous form. Crystalline selenium                   obtained by
                                                                        is

gradually converted into a hard slate-coloured solid. This
form of selenium melts at 217°                    resembles a metal in
                                                  :   it

other hand,       is,
                    according to the books,              good conductor.

In comparison with true metals, however, conducts rather           it
badly.  I    found some time ago that the specific resistance
of a plate of crystalline selenium, which had been annealed
for several hours in         glass mould, out of contact with any
                                  a
metal,   was   2500   megohms, while that of another specimen
annealed in contact with copper electrodes was 0*9 megohm,
the lower resistance in the latter case being due, as                    then    I
suggested and still think probable, to the formation of copper
selenide during the heating.
    A very remarkable fact, first published                        by
                                                          Mr. Willoughby
Smith in 1873,         that the resistance of crystalline selenium
                        is
appears to be temporarily diminished by the action of light.
This effect   is  easily shown, by means of                small piece of
                                                                   a
crystalline  selenium    fitted  with   wire   electrodes   and joined up
in circuit with    a battery and       reflecting-galvanometer.

illuminated.
    In order that the resistance of so-called " selenium cell "
                                                 a
may be kept as low as possible, and the light made to produce
a maximum effect, three conditions have to be aimed at.
The electrodes       should be large            they should be near
                                                  ;
together;     and   the   selenium,     in  order     to expose        large     a
surface relatively to its volume, should consist of tlun film.               a
Several contrivances have been proposed with the view of
fulfilling these requirements.                   A

 effective  one     is that which       I    suggested   ten years ago
 ('Nature/     vol.  xxiii. p. 58).    A   fine  copper   wire is wound
upon an oblong strip of mica from end to end, the number
of turns being about 20 to the inch : a second wire is then
wound on, parallel to the first, the turns of the second wire
alternating with those of the first ; great care is taken that
the two wires do not touch each other anywhere.                    A thin
layer   of melted     selenium    is spread    over  one   surface of the
mica, filling the spaces between the wires. The film is
first quickly cooled by placing the mica upon any con
venient cold surface, then it is crystallized by heating at a
temperature      of about 200°, and, lastly, it is annealed by
gradually lowering the temperature               for several hours. A
cell made in this manner, with a surface of about 10 sq. cm.,
is generally found to have a resistance in the dark of from
50,000 to 100,000 ohms.            As a rule, those cells which have
an unusually low resistance are less sensitive to light than
others.    In a cell of average quality the resistance is reduced
about 50 per cent, by the light of an ordinary gas-flame at
the distance of one foot.
    I made a number of cells on this plan in the years 1880
and 1881.        Up to the end of 1882 they were frequently
used, and no material falling off in their sensitiveness was
noticed. Thirteen of these cells were laid aside until 1885.
They had then for the most part deteriorated more or less,
one or two of them being quite useless.                They were again
put away until the present year, 1890, when it was found
that only one of the thirteen retained its original sensitive
ness and resistance unimpaired.*                A second one worked
fairly well    with   a feeble current, its resistance with a single
Leclanche cell being in the dark 14,000 ohms, and when
illuminated by a gas-flame at 12 inches, 8000 ohms ; but
with a battery of six cells the resistance became variable and
unsteady, as if there were a loose contact somewhere, and a
continuous boiling noise was heard in a telephone introduced
into the circuit.        The resistance of the remaining eleven
cells had fallen enormously, in some cases to less than 10 ohms,
and they were quite insensitive to the action of light.               An
attempt was made to restore most of them by melting down
the selenium and recrystallizing and annealing ; but though
the resistance could in this manner be brought up again to a
high point, the sensitiveness of the renovated cells was in all
cases found to be very poor.
    Prof. Adams states (Phil. Trans, vol. clxvii. p. 348) that
   * This cell had the unusually high resistance of 400,000 ohms, reduced
by the light of a gas-jet at one foot to 100,000 ohms.

                  Experiments with Selenium Cells.                   253
in the course of a year the resistance of most of the pieces of
selenium with which he performed his well-known experi
ments fell very considerably, and it would be of great interest
to know what is the cause of this curious phenomenon.                  In
the case of my own cells, I satisfied myself that it certainly
was not due to any short-circuiting of the wires by contact ;
and  I  suggest that it may be owing to the presence of an
excessive amount of conducting selenide formed by the union
of the selenium with the metal of the electrodes.             Each wiro
is covered with    a  layer   of selenide,   which  gradually increases
in thickness at the expense of the free, badly-conducting
selenium, and thus the resistance of the cell slowly falls. At
length the layers of selenide become so thick that the coatings
upon the two wires actually meet and touch each other.
Thereupon the cell is short-circuited ; its resistance no longer
depends upon the selenium but upon the metallic selenide,
which is a good conductor.
   I have in a former paper (Proc. Phys. Soc. vol. vii. p. 129 ;
Phil. Mag. Aug. 1885, p. 178) given reasons for believing
that the presence of      a certain amount of metallic selenide is
essential  to the sensitiveness of a cell, and        I  have stated my
opinion   that   the   true    function    of  the  prolonged heating,
                      "
generally termed annealing," is the formation of this neces
sary selenide, which, when a current passes through the cell,
is electrolysed, selenium being deposited upon the anode wire.
With the weak currents generally used, the quantity of
deposited selenium would be very small, and would at once
unite with the metal of the electrode.             But if a sufficiently
strong current were passed, it is conceivable that the
selenium might be separated in quantities too great to be
disposed of in this manner.           Then the free selenium around
the electrode ought to be visible.           This view is confirmed by
a recent experiment.         A cell was made last October with new
selenium and the usual copper-wire electrodes.              It was well
annealed,   and   its   resistance    was   about  50,000 ohms.      The
cell was connected to a 26-volt battery, and left for two days.
At the end of that time the cell presented a remarkable
appearance,    those portions of the anode wire where                 the
selenium coating happened          to  be  thin being  covered  with red
feathery tufts, some of which had dropped off and fallen
upon the paper on which the cell was lying. Ordinary tests
showed that the red stuff consisted, mainly at all events, of
red amorphous selenium.              But it was clearly moist. All
very fine powders seem to attract moisture from the atmo
sphere ; but in the present case tho moisture appeared to be
greater than could be thus accouuted for.               An examination

254                   Mr. S. Bidwell on     some
under the microscope disclosed the presence of a number of
minute lumps of a white substance, intermixed with the red
                                             º
stuff. The lumps had the appearance of pieces of calcium
chloride which had been exposed to the air, and they were
clearly the origin of the moisture. They consisted, no doubt,
of selenium oxide or hydroxide, which is probably a deliques
cent substance.”        This oxide might               be formed by
the direct combination of some of the               freshly separated
selenium with the oxygen of the air, or with that resulting
from the electrolysis of traces of water existing in the cell.
   In the discussion which followed the reading of my former
                         J.
paper, the late Mr.           W. Clark took exception to a
pothesis therein put forward as to the probable action of the         ".
selenides formed in selenium cells, on the ground that selenide
of copper conducted metallically and not electrolytically.
This he stated to have been experimentally proved by Hittorf
(Pogg. Ann. vol. lxxxiv. 1857, quoted by           J.W. Clark, Proc.
Phys. Soc. vol. vii. pp. 119, 120 t. Phil. Mag. July 1885,
pp. 38, 39).     But if the amorphous selenium surrounding the
anode in  my    recent experiment was formed otherwise than by
electrolysis, it is difficult to imagine why it should be confined
to the anode, as was seen to be the fact, and not extend also to
the kathode and other portions of the cell. The inference seems
to be that copper selenide does conduct electrolytically f.
   When the resistance of this cell was tested with the Wheat
stone's bridge, it was found to have diminished enormously.
It was also not sensibly affected by illumination, but, on the
other hand, it appeared to be dependent in a curious way on
the direction of the current used in testing.               With one
Ieclanché cell and equal proportional coils of 100 ohms
each, the resistance with a current from anode § to kathode
was 4500 ohms, and with a current in the opposite direction
only 2900 ohms. The change occurred with great regularity
as often as the current was reversed.
   The cell was then connected directly to the galvanometer
without any battery, and a very small polarization current
from kathode to anode through the cell was indicated. While
thus connected, a piece of magnesium ribbon was burnt near
the cell. Instantly the spot of light was deflected off the

me that the oxides of selenium are deliquescent.

to kathode internally), returning to its former position as soon
as the magnesium was extinguished.            This was not thermo          a
electric effect, for   the   approach of      hot brass rod caused
                                                  a                                 a
smaller current from kathode to anode, which subsided slowly
and not suddenly when the rod was withdrawn.
    Photoelectric currents of this character had been previously
observed by Prof. Adams and by Mr. Fritts of New York,
but no explanation of their origin has been attempted.
Perhaps the behaviour of my cell may suggest tho direction
in which the source of such currents should be looked for, but
I  have not yet followed up the inquiry.
    In the illustration of lectures         often desirable to be able

   a telescope        is less than that subtended by a light

double star, the appearance in the telescope is nearly the
same.

angular magnitude of the source in the direction perpendicular
to the length of the slits, and a0, the " limit of resolution."
The period of this function, and thence                  —   ,   may be found with
great accuracy so that by annulling the greater portion
                          ;                                                          of
the objective the accuracy of measurement of the angular
magnitude of small or distant source may be increased from
                      a
ten to fifty times. As ordinarily understood, this increase
"           " would be at the cost of " definition "                                 in of
  accuracy                                           (which
this     sense   is    practically but    by    definition

the measurement    of its diameter.     But in many cases the

        far   as I am  aware, no problems     in thermal distribution
 SO     involving an internal        generation    of heat — such, for
 instance, as takes place in the passage of an electric current
 through a conductor — have hitherto been discussed.           Fourier,
 the founder of the mathematical theory of thermal conduction,
 takes no account of possible internal sources of heat in forming
 his equations, and considers only problems in which the sources
 are superficial.      The same may be said of Poisson, Lamd,
 Riemann, and others who have since applied and extended
  Fourier's methods.        Thomson, in his synopsis of the mathe
 matical theory f, has expounded Fourier's diffusion-analysis
 in a form directly applicable to cases where there are internal

260              Mr.  J. McCowan on      the  Heating  of
sources of heat; but he omits the consideration of such sources
in forming the differential equations of the motion.
    In the case of heating by an electric current there is not
 only the thermal problem of finding the temperature at any
point, but also the farther electrical problem of determining
the effect of the heating in changing the distribution of
electric potential by the alteration which it produces in the
conductivity.      I  am not aware that any solution of a problem
of this latter class has hitherto been given.
    In   the following    paper   I  have sought to discuss these
 problems more or         less fully.    The steady state which in
general ultimately supervenes is considered in greater detail,
not only because the mathematical treatment is much simpler,
 but also because it is of greater importance than the inter
mediate varying state ; and for like reasons attention is chiefly
given to the case of homogeneous isotropic conductors, but            I
have shown that many of the general results for these may be
 at once extended to heterogeneous a;olotropic conductors.
    It will be seen that the more general of the results at which
I  have arrived depend on and, in fact, are an almost immediate
 outcome of a remarkable transformation of which the thermal
equation is susceptible even in its most general case, and by
which the problem of electrical heating is immediately reduced
 to the ordinary case where there is no such heating.
    It has been my object to develop the general theory rather
 than to seek results specially suitable to practical applications ;
but it will be seen that many of the results suggest electrical
methods of experimentally examining the thermal character
istics of substances, and that the maximum theorems may be
a useful guide where it is desired to produce high temperatures
 by electric means.
      1.  Formation    of the General Equations for the case   of
                 Heterogeneous Isotropic Conductors.
    Let V denote the electric potential and c the conductivity
at time t at a point x, y, z in a heterogeneous isotropic con
ductor, then, there being no internal electrification, and for
brevity using the notation
                    Vs—"   ^c^ + ^c^ + ^c^

   The equations (A) and (B) — which it will be noted must be
solved simultaneously in the general case, c being a function
of 5, — in conjunction with the initial and boundary conditions,
fully determine V and 3. As the initial and boundary con
ditions which may be imposed are almost entirely arbitrary,
they need not be specially formulated here ; but it is to be
noted that if ultimately they do not vary with the time, the
thermal and electrical distributions will tend to stationary
values, and ultimately the equation (B) to be satisfied by 5
may be replaced by

262              Mr. J.  McCowan on       the    Heating of
considerable importance. Saint- Venant obtained many in
teresting and practically important solutions of problems on
the torsion of elastic prisms in this way, and his results have
been adapted by Thomson and Tait and others to problems in
fluid motion in two dimensions. In what immediately follows
I have applied this method to an interesting set of heating-
problems, and have shown how the method can be considerably
extended.
   a. To find the steady distribution of temperature           in a long
cylindric    bar carrying   a  current    of   strength q per  unit area,
its surface being maintained at a constant temperature, taken
for convenience as the zero.
    It is evidently only necessary to consider equation (E),
which in this case reduces to
                        *?   +  *?+#          = o
                        da?     dy3      ck
and therefore we may take
                        a =   «r-i(o*»+V),
where    a is any solution of
                                +            U'
                           da?      dtf
and (a + b) =jqilck ; and thus we shall have the solution for
a bar whose surface is given by the equation
                           2<r  = aa? +    by"1.
    One or two examples only need be given : —
    (i) Let the cross section be an ellipse, equation
                          &V + ay = aV.
   Then clearly
                         tf     a'b>   (       a?   y»l
                         2cka? + b1\           a1
and we see that the isothermal surfaces are similar concentric
elliptic cylinders.
   In   the case of circular cross section this reduces to
                      $=jq*\a'-a?-!/'\/4ck.
   Again, when b is infinite, it reduces to the case of             a flat
plate of thickness 2a, and
                        $=jq3\a*-a?\l-2ck.
    (ii) Let the cross section be an equilateral triangle, and let
a be the radius of the inscribed circle and «,            y. the perpen

diculars from a point on the three sides, then the solution may
be written in the form
                                 d = j<j2u0y/3cka.
      is interesting to extend two of these results — that for the
     It
bar or wire of circular cross section and that for the plate or
approximately for any long flat strip — to suit the case where
the surfaces having an emissivity e are exposed in air at tem
perature zero, instead of being maintained at that temperature.
It is only necessary to raise the temperature by such an amount
that the loss by emission will be equal to the rate of generation
of heat by the current ; and therefore for the circular wire
the solution will be
                   &   =   jq3{a'-x'-t/t                + 2ak/e}/4:ck,

In  both these cases the ratio of the maximum temperature to
the surface-temperature is l+ae/2A.
       To find the steady distribution of temperature in an
annular conductor in which a current circulates, the surface
being maintained at temperature zero.
   Taking semipolar coordinates nr,         the equation (D)    <j>,   z,

3.    Transformation of the Equations and General Method of
        Solution for the case of Homogeneous Conductors with
        Unvarying Condurtirities Sfc.
     For brevity, put
                            U =   ijcV + k$,
then since identically

                            a^y=*V2U,                         (F)
and the general problem is thus reduced to the solution of
(D) and (F) subject to the boundary conditions. These equa
tions are of the same form as those for the steady and varying
motion of heat in the ordinary case of no internal heating which
have been very fully discussed ; it follows, therefore, that the
more general problem of electrical heating is thus reduced to
the same state of completeness as the more particular one.
Thus, for example, if we can write down for a conductor of
specified form an expression for the temperature at any point
and time when every point of the surface is maintained at an
arbitrary temperature, then we can also write it down when
every point of the surface is maintained at an arbitrary tem
perature and potential ; and if there were no flux of heat over
a specified portion of the surface, this would afford the solution
for the case of no flux of heat or electricity over the same
portion in the more general case.
   General solutions may thus be obtained for the cuboid
(Fourier), the sphere (Poisson), the circular cylinder (Ma-
thieu), and in the case of steady motion for the ellipsoid
(Lame), various surfaces of revolution and cylindric surfaces.
We may take for example, as the results can be written in
very brief form, the
       General Case of Steady Distribution in a Sphere.

and since       (D)   is   an equation           of the same form,                 it   follows that

so that the final state will be given by U = 0. U will still be

   As an example, take the case of a cylindric bar of length

electrode at potential Vs and the surface of maximum tem
perature, and the lower sign from the latter surface to the
other electrode.
   By means of (6), (A) reduces to
                                           V2F(3)«0.
Now     V0 denote the potential at any point of the same con

for c and k are constant since the tempernture is uniform.
Thus F(S) = A + BV0, where A and B have to be determined
to suit the boundary conditions.           Now F(S) is by (6) a known
function of 3, since k and            are known functions of        except
as regards an arbitrary constant.              It is here convenient to
take this such that F(3') = 0, and to denote by —\ and p
respectively the values of F(S) at the two electrodes, which
are maintained finally' at the temperatures               and 32.   Hence,
determining      A and   B,  we  have   finally
             (V,-V1)F(*)=(X+M)V0-{XV,+MV1).                          . (7)
Thus the final temperature 3, and therefore also by (2) the
final potential, is determined in terms of the initial potential
in the same conductor uniformly heated, which may be found
by the ordinary methods.
    In the case $3 = $!, which is really the fundamental one,
and from which the more general case could have been
derived, we see by (6) that       \   will be equal to fi, and therefore
(7) will become
                (VS-V1)F(S) = 2X{V0-KV1                + VJ)}.    . .
                                                                       (7')
Thus, comparing (7') and (4'), we see that the surface of
maximum temperature has initially and finally the same
potential, the mean of that of the electrodes, and being, there
 fore, independent of k and c, its form and position will be the
 same for all homogeneous          isotropic conductors which have
the same form of boundary and electrodes.
    In the general case, we see that surfaces which are ei|ui-
 potential initially are also so finally, but the values of their
 potentials are in general different.            It is not, however, to be
 supposed  that   equi potentials   remain    so  during the intermediate
 state ; in fact, it is easy to     show   that    they do not, except in
 the particular cases where they are a set of planes, spheres, or
 circular cylinders.      It is also obvious that the initial and final
 coincidence of equipotentials would in general be destroyed
 by any emission from the bounding surfiice, the equipotentials
 then also ceasing to he isothermal.
             7.  Special Results for Cylindric Surfaces.
    The methods of Sections 4 to 6 may be slightly modified to
 give in the case of cylindric surfaces a new set of theorems
 analogous to those of these sections, but in which current takes
 the place of potential, and resistance of conductivity.

cylindric sheet when unlimited, and a cylindric strip when it
is limited by two planes (its sides) cutting it orthogonally.
If the cylindric sheets are given by the values Qs and Q, of
the current function, then the w hole current per unit breadth
between tbem, Qs — Qi, may be denoted by C, and the parts
flowing on each side of a point on the sheet Q, viz., Q2— Q
and Q — Qi by Cs and Cl respectively.

the current-sheets will be isothermal, and the temperature at

 and the temperature will have      maximum value 3' given by

Thus the final temperature, and therefore also by (1) the final

which completes the solution, and leads to results similar to
those of the latter portion of Section 6, e. g., that surfaces
equipotential initially are also so finally, and the surface of
maximum temperature has the same potential, the mean of
the electrodes, initially and finally.
    Similarly we may extend the corresponding results of
Section 7.
    From the maximum theorems which have been obtained, a
general result as to the superior limit of the temperature in
any part of a conductor is easily derived. It is only necessary
to notice that any further escape of heat than is allowed for in
these theorems cannot raise the temperature at any point, but
must, on the contrary, lower it more or less ; hence : —
     Ifin any conductor heated by a current a closed surface,
or two surfaces which, by cutting through the boundary,
 enclose a portion of the body between them, be taken, then the
highest temperature in the enclosed portion cannot be greater
 than the highest temperature on the closed surface or on the
 cross-sectional surfaces — provided, in this latter case, no heat
 flows into the enclosed portion through the remainder of the
 boundary — by more than, though it may be as much as, the
 value S, which is given by f(S')=jE''/8, where E is the
 greatest difference of potential between any two points of the
 closed surface or pair of surfaces, and f'($) is the ratio of the
 thermal and electric conductivities.

Maxwell had some private information from Joule, in which
unpublished experiments on the bending of magnetic needles
were referred to.
   At any rate the question seems worthy of consideration,
because for a number of years the Greenwich Observatory has
published observations made with needles 9, 6, and 3 inches
long, which show a systematic difference in the observed dip
amounting to more than a minute of arc between the longest
and shortest needles.
   It is clear that the mere displacement of the ends of the
needle by the bending is eliminated by the method of observa
tion which is uniformly adopted, but in addition there is
the effect alluded to by Maxwell, which is not so easily dis
posed      of.

and we may confine ourselves to the case of the pointed
 needles, for which the calculation is very simple.
    We take a pointed needle of unit thickness and half length
 /, and find in the first place the equation of its axis when it
is in a horizontal position and subject to its own gravity alone.
Let the axis of x be horizontal, and that of y downwards.
 If  a cross section of the needle is taken at a point P, the
bending-couple at the section is that of the weight of the
pointed end multiplied by the distance of the centre of gravity
 of the end from the cross section, or

Hence for pointed needles of cross section a the displacement
of the centre of gravity is smaller in the ratio of 18 to 5 as
compared with needles having an uniform cross section a

                       is    difficult to form an estimate of the
magnetic moment per unit volume or M/V. Kohlrausch, in
 his
       '
        Physical    Measurements,' states that with thin long
 needles values as high as 785 may be obtained, but that such
magnets as are used in Physical Laboratories seldom show a
 greater magnetic moment than 312 C.G.S. per unit volume.
The shape of dipping-needles and the method of magnetiza

the needle will add more to the weight than to the magnetic
moment.      If, therefore, we make M/V = 320, this will pro
bably be above the correct value.

have to acknowledge the kindness of the Astronomer Royal
in giving me detailed information on the dimensions and
shape of the needles used at the Royal Observatory.              The

         Bending    of Magnetic     Needles on the Magnetic     Dip.      279
 following Table embodies the results of the calculation.
 Columns I. and II. give the length and width of the needles
 in inches.      Column       III. gives the diminution of dip due to
 bending    of    needles, having a greatest width equal to that of
 the Greenwich needles, but tapering uniformly towards the
end, as shown in fig. 1.           Column IV. shows what the diminu
tion in dip would be if the needles had everywhere the same
 width a. It is reasonable to suppose that needles of the shape
actually used would give values for S intermediate between
those of columns      III.   and IV.       Column V. gives the difference
in dip between the two longer needles and the one having a
length of only three inches, the bending of which may be neg
lected. To obtain this difference              I have taken the mean dip
of the three sets of needles for the six years 1882 to 1887,
as published in the Annual Reports of the Greenwich Obser
vatory ; its value is entered into column VI.

    Considering that we have throughout underrated the effect of
 bending, especially by assuming a value for the magnetic
 moments which is in all probability too high, the figures leave
 no doubt that the difference in the dip shown by needles of
 different lengths can bo accounted for by their bending. The
 calculated value for pointed needles is about three times too
 small ; that for needles of uniform cross section gives results
 closely agreeing with the observed differences in the dip ;
 while the actual shape of the needles agrees more closely with
 that of uniform bars than w ith that of pointed needles.
     The results of calculation quite justify Joule's remark as to
 the importance of using short needles to avoid the introduction
  of appreciable errors ; and the question arises whether long
  needles are entirely to be rejected, as is done in most Observa
  tories, or whether a correction should be made for the
 diminution of the dip. The difficulty in measuring angles to
 a sufficient accuracy is increased if the needles are as short
 as the shortest Greenwich needles, and hence there is some

280       Influence of Bending  Needles on Magnetic     Dip.
advantage in retaining the longer ones. The bending might
be diminished to an almost inappreciable amount by having
the needles about three times as wide, but it would then
 become more difficult to magnetize them strongly.            If  the
 magnetic moments of the needles were measured before every
 observation, the error due to bending could be calculated to a
 sufficient degree of accuracy, as Young's modulus will not
 differ much in different specimens of steel used for magnets.
 This course would, however, entail a good deal of trouble,
 and it almost seems to me as if an empirical correction would
                                                 <U+017F>º
 answer the purpose almost equally well.            We might, for
 instance, determine the correction to be applied in any par
 ticular year with sufficient accuracy by                  the mean
 difference of dip shown by the needles in a certain number,
 say five, of preceding years. As the influence of bending
 for the three-inch needles is negligible, and as the magnetic
 properties of the needles, which are always magnetized in the
 same way, will probably not alter during a course of five
 years, a fairly accurate correction may be deduced. Thus, for
 instance, during the five years 1882–86 the mean dip of the
                        º
 needles in the order of their length was 67° 30' 30" ;
 67° 30' 00"; 67° 29' 35". We deduce a correction of 55"
 for the longest needles, and one of 30" for the intermediate
 ones.    The observed dip in 1887 was 67° 27'13" ; 67° 26'20";
  67°  25'45";    and,           the correction, we find for the
 three needles the now closely-agreeing values of 67° 27'13",
  67° 26' 50", 67° 26' 40". The mean of these three values,
  viz, 67° 26' 54", will probably be as near the truth as the
 errors of observation will allow.
     I have not brought this matter forward in any spirit of
 criticism towards the Greenwich observations.         The fact that
  the small effect of  bending shows itself  persistently  from year
  to  year  to a  nearly equal degree,  is in itself a  proof  of the
  excellency of the observations.      The manner in which the
  magnetic records are reduced, and the form in which they are
  published by the Greenwich authorities, may well serve as a
  model to other Observatories.      But as there seems no doubt
  that the accuracy which is aimed at in the dip-observation is
  appreciably affected by the cause of error which Joule has
  pointed out, it seems to me advisable to eliminate that error.
  The exact way in which the correction is carried out may well
  be left to the proper authorities.

 XXXI.            The Solution of a Geometrical Problem in Magnetism.
                        By T. H. Blakesley, M.A*
            points in the field of a magnet usually chosen for
 THE    quantitative experiments, such as the determination of
  H, or the control of a galvanometer-needle, lie either in the
  axis of the magnet produced, or the equatorial plane.         This
 arises from the very simple expressions for the field in terms
 of the moment of the magnet, and its distance from the point
 considered, in these two cases. But in either of these cases
 the exact value depends not merely upon these facts, but also
 upon the distance between the poles ; and this latter can
 rarely, if ever, be taken to be the entire length of the magnet.
 Either some such rule as the lopping-off, in imagination, of a
 fraction of the length, is applied, or the virtual distance
 between the poles is expressed as an unknown quantity to be
 determined by additional experiment.
    It is easy also to calculate the direction and magnitude of
 the field at a point whose position relatively to the two poles
 is given.    But the following proposition        at first sight, of   is,
a  more difficult order.
    " Given the two poles of magnet, and a   a  straight line inter
 secting at right angles its axis produced at        given point, to      a
 determine at what point this line      parallel to the field."

 interest because

                            if
 determine the length between the virtual poles.            But the

   These two poles produce a field at P parallel to D C, and
in the negative direction.
      If
      the point is in the neighbourhood of 0, the two inner
poles will be dominant and the field negative ; but if P is very
remote from 0, the poles A and B will be dominant, and the
field positive. There must therefore be some position where
the field vanishes, and the two rods A C, D B would produce
no deviation on a compass at that point, in whatever direction
the head of the ship carrying the system pointed.
    Such permanent magnets would produce what is called
 semicircular deviation on a compass situated at any distance
but this critical one from 0; that         is,
                                         through one semicircle
 the deviation would l)e easterly, and through the remaining
semicircle westerly; but these semicircles would each have
 the deviation produced in       changed in sign

that the direction of the deviation changes sign after every
quadrant, each pair of opposite quadrants having one kind of
deviation, easterly or westerly; and in this case the actual
sign for each pair of opposite quadrants depends upon the
 position of the compass relative to this critical position.
    This application may serve to excuse me for bringing
 forward an easv method of practically finding this point.

  By means, therefore, of the table of hyperbolic sines and
cosines which this Society has recently published, we can
easily determine d.
    We can deduce the distance of the poles apart, by applying
this proposition inversely.
    It is of course very easy to arrive at this state of things
practically with a magnet.
     Suppose we arrange a small magnetometer-needle in the
meridian, and notice the position of the light-beam on a scale
in an ordinary way.
    Find the direction of the axis of the needle by the condi
tion that a long magnet laid in that line will not affect the
 position of the spot of light ; then place that magnet, or any
other, at right angles to this position and move it in the
direction of its length until again the spot of light is at its
 old place.    No torsion affects these observations ; indeed, the
 real meridian need not have been the direction found.

'T'HE      following communication was read : —
 ¦*¦    " On the Age, Formation, and       Successive Drift Stages of the
Valley of the Darent ; with Remarks on the Palaeolithic Implement*
of the District, and on the Origin of the Chalk Escarpment."            By
Professor Joseph Prestwich, D.C.L., F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
    i. General Character and Age of the Darent Valley. — The river
is formed hy the union of two streams, the main one flowing east
from near Limpsfield, the other west from near Ightham, parallel
with the ranges of Lower Greensand and Chalk, and flows north
ward into the Thames. The first indent of the valley was subsequent
to the deposition of the Lenham Sands, and indeed to the Red Clay
 with flints and the old implement-bearing drift with which this is
 associated ; and the same remark applies to a system of smaller
 valleys starting near the crest of the escarpment and running into
 the Thames.
    ii. The Chalk Plateau Drifts and associated Flint Implements. —
 Since the publication of the author's Ightham paper, Mr. Harrison
 and Mr. De B. Crawshay have found implements mostly of rude type
 (though a few are as well finished as those of Abbeville) in numerous
 localities on the plateau, where, owing to the gradients, the differ
 ence of level between plateau and valley-bottom is much greater
 than at Currie Farm.         Evidence derived from the character and
 conditions    of preservation of these implements is adduced in favour
 of their great antiquity.
     iii. The Initial Stages of the Darent Valley. — The author has pre
  viously shown that in early Pliocene times a plain of marine denudation
  extended over the present Vale of Holmesdale, and that in pre-glacial
  times the plain was scored by streams flowing from the high central
  Wealden ranges. These streams centred in the Darent, and the ex
  cavation of the present valley then commenced.       There is a gap in the

sequence            between the pre-glacial drifts and the earliest post-glacial
drifts of the valley, which is probably covered by the extreme glacial
epoch.     It was a time of erosion, rather than of deposition in this
area. Of the earliest drift of the Darent valley, little has escaped later
denudation.     The bank of coarse gravel on the hill on the west side of
the valley between Eynsford                              and Farningham,                 certain flint—drifts
in the upper part of the valley, and a breccia of chalk-fragments                                            on
the hill west of Shoreham, may be referred to this period.
     iv.The High-Level         Limpsfield Gravel Stage.—The gravel
                                         or                                                                  at
Limpsfield occurs              on
                        the watershed between the Darent valley and
the Oxsted stream, but the author agrees with Mr. Topley that the
gravel belongs      the Darent system, and Westheath Hill may
                         to                                                                                  be
part     the original ridge separating the two valleys. This gravel
          of
is post-glacial, and the denudation                         of
                                            the area had made considerable
progress        at
              the time     its formation, for the Chalk escarpment rises
                                    of
200–300 feet, and the Lower Greensand 100–200 feet above the
gravel-bed.      The author traces outliers          this gravel down the   of
valley      lower and lower points
               at                          the Thames valleyto      Dartford,                    at

author, after discussing and dismissing the view^that the escarpment
was formed by marine denudation, criticizos the theory that it was
due to ordinary subaerial denudation, and lays stress on the irregular
distribution and diversity of the drift-beds in the Darent area ; these
do not possess the characters which we should expect if they were
formed by tho material left during the recession of the Chalk escarp
ment owing to subaerial action ; and he believes that glacial agency
was the great motor in developing the valleys and, as a consequence,
the escarpment, and that the denudation was afterwards further
carried on in the same lines by strong river-action and weathering,
though supplemented          at times by ronewed ice-action.        By such
 agencies, aided by the influence of rainfall and the issue of powerful
springs, he considers that the escarpment was gradually pared back
and brought into its present prominent relief.

        " The Geology of Barbados       and the West Indies.   — Parti. The
 Coral Kocks."      By A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., F.G.8., and Professor
 J. B. Harrisor, M.A., F.G.8.
     The authors first     discuss the reef growing round Barbados and
 describe  a  submarine    reef, the origin of which is considered ; and it
 is pointed   out that  there  is no sign of any subsidence having taken
 place, but every sign of very recent elevation.          They theu describe
 the raised reefs of the island, extending to a height of nearly 1100
 feet above sea-level in a series of terraces.          The thickness of the
 coral-rock in these is seldom above 200 feet, and the rock does not
 always consist of coral-debris.        At the base of the reefs there is
 generally   a  certain  thickness  of detrital  rock in which perfect reef-
 corals never occur.
     The collections of fossils made by the authors have been
 examined by Messrs. E. A. Smith and J. W. Gregory.                   Of the
 corals, 5 out of 10 species identified still live in the Caribbean Sea,
 and 1 is closely allied to a known species, whilst the other 4 are
 only known from Prof. Duncan's descriptions of fossil Antiguan
  corals.    The authors are of opinion that the whole of the terraces
 of Barbados, the so-called " marl
                                        " of
                                              Antigua, and the fossiliferous
 rocks of Barbuda are of Pleistocene age.
     They proceed to notice the formations in othor West Indian

islands which appear to be raised reefs comparable with those of
Barbados, and show that these reefs occur through the whole length
of the Antillean Chain, and indicate a recent elevation of at least
1300 feet, and in all probability of nearly 2000 feet.         It appears
improbablo that each island was a region of separate uplift, and as a
plateau of recent marine limestone also occurs in Yucatan, thiB
carries the region of elevation into Central America, and it is
reported that there are raised reefs in Colombia.. The authors
conclude that there has been contemporaneous       elevation of the whole
Andean Chain from Cape Horn to Tehuantepec and of the Antillean
Chain from Cuba to Barbados. Before this there must have been
free communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which
 is confirmed by the large number of Pacific forms in the Caribbean
Sea.      Under such geographical conditions the great equatorial
current would pass into the Pacific, and there would be no Gulf
Stream in the North Atlantic.
    2. "The Shap Granite, and the Associated Igneous and Meta-
morphic Eocks." By Alfred Harker, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., and J. E.
Marr, Esq., M.A., Sec. G. S.
    The authors describe the normal granite of the intrusion, and
discuss the characters of certain variations from the usual type.
    The dykes and sills of the neighbourhood are also considered ;
the similarity of some of these to certain inclusions in the granite is
 noticed ; and reasons are given for supposing that many of the
 felsites and mica-traps of this region are connected with a magma
which was intruded amongst the Lower Pateozoic rocks in pre-
Carboniferous times, and with which the Shap granite is itself
connected.
    The metamorphic effects of the granite upon the surrounding
 rocks are then described.      A remarkable set of changes produced in
 a series of andesites and another of rhyolites, with their respective
 pyroclastic rocks, is considered in detail, and the results of the
 metamorphism of the Coniston Limestone series and the Coniston
 Flags and Grits are given and compared with those obtained by other
 workers in Norway, the Harz Mountains, and elsewhere.

translation in the direction of the discharge, we beg to make the
following historical observations : —
   1. When von Zahn investigated the spectral lines of a discharge-
tube, in one case in a direction at right angles to the axis, and then
in the direction of the axis iteelf, the lines were not displaced,
although he was able to distinguish even the           of the distance of
                                                                    Tlff
 the D lines. This displacement         would   have  corresponded to                          a
 velocity of one geographical   mile in  the direction  of the axis                      *.
    2. Preliminary experiments of Tait, in which the spectra of a
tube containing bromide of carbon were found to be the same both
 when parallel and at right angles to the discharge-tube, showed
 that the velocity must be far greater, about 90 geographical miles
in   a    second.
     3.But that    can neither attain the value obtained by von
                          it
Zahn, still less  higher one, follows from the experiments of E.
                          a
Wiedemann and H. Ebert         which were obtained both

method of Fraunhofer's minima of the second class, as well as                                  by
the method of high interferences.
      The method employed by Prof. Trowbridge, as he himself
     4.
states, shows changes in the wave-length of 1/4000   that used by               ;
Wiedemann and Ebert, of which, as well as of the other methods
mentioned above, Professor Trowbridge makes no mention, shows
a change of 1/834,000 of the value. The latter     therefore about         is
200 times as sensitive as the former.

     ON THE CONDUCTION OF        ELECTRICITY BY THE VAPOURS         OF
              HEATED SALTS.        BY SVANTE ARRHENIUS.
    The author gives a long and important paper on this subject ;
the method of experimenting was to produce the vapour in the
 flame of a Bunsen-burner, and to measure the conductivity between
two platinum wires placed at a given distance from each other.
The various experimental precautions are fully described and dis
cussed ; the experiments extended to various classes of salts, and
the author sums up his conclusions as follows.
     The extremely fruitful hypothesis of van't Hoff, that matter in
the form of gas and in that of dilute solution has perfectly ana
 logous properties, has so far been established in the most brilliant
 manner; and with the aid of the laws of gases a light has been
 thrown on the nature of solutions, hitherto undreamed of. In
the present paper      I  have followed the reverse way, and with a
 knowledge of the electrolytic properties of dilute solutions the same
 properties which have hitherto been unknown have been demon-
 st rated in gases.    Hence there is a complete analogy in this respect
between the two conditions of matter. — "Wiedemann's Annalen,

    The author    describes   a new method of studying      Hertz's  phe
nomena.      Instead of a     resonator of the type employed by the
latter, a Geissler tube       is used.  Two parallel wires of known
self-induction terminate     at one end in condenser-plates, which are
charged in an oscillatory     manner by a large Euhmkorf coil excited
by storage-cells.      Upon  the other ends of the parallel wires rests

wires couuecting them across like a bridge between two parallel
wires on a sonometer. At certain definite points the Geissler
tube glows, and the wave-lengths of the electrical oscillations can
thus be measured.       Lecher finds that the velocity of electricity in
metallic wires is the same as that of light.             He points out a
slight inaccuracy in Hertz's work. — American Journal of Science,

        ON THE HEAT OK EVAPORATION           OF LIQUEFIED    GASES.
                              BY E. MATHIAS.
     The author uses a calorimetrical method of constant temperature ;
 the heat withdrawn from the water-calorimeter by the evaporation
 of the gas is each moment restored by bringing strong sulphuric
 acid into the water of the calorimeter.      It was therefore necessary
 to determine the heat of dilution of the sulphuric acid required for
 the measurements. With this view small glass flasks containing
 sulphuric acid were broken under water.         A copper cylinder 3 cm.
 in diameter and 9 cm. in height was used as evaporator ; this is
 connected at the top to a serpentine tube which was coiled several
 times round the cylinder, and on its emergence from the Berthelot's
 calorimeter it was insulated thermally from the rest of the tube by
  a connector of celluloid.
     In the latter were two taps, a manometer, and finally a flask of
  special construction containing glycerine, in order accurately to con
  trol and regulate the rapidity of the evaporation. The introduction
  of the sulphuric acid was effected by an apparatus of the nature of a
  wash-bottle.    Those parts of the metal which came in contact with
 the acid were thickly gilded      The author worked with sulphurous
  acid, nitrous oxide, and especially with carbonic acid with a range
  of temperature of 0° to 31°.     At the high temperatures the whole
  room was heated to the corresponding temperature.
     In this way even the worst determinations did not differ by more
  than 2 per cent, from the mean.       The results of experiments with
  SOa   and COa  agree  very well with  those deduced from Clapeyron's
  equations.    The differences with nitrous oxide arise from the gas
  being impure from the presence of nitrogen.        With all three bodies
  the heat of evaporation decreases with increase of temperature
  within the interval in question. For sulphurous acid this is the
  linear equation,
                             A=91-87-0-384      t.
     For carbonic acid and nitrous oxide, whose critical temperatures
  are between 31° and 36c,4, the decrease is very steep and can be
  well expressed by a function of the temperature of the second
             For carbonic acid,

   At the critical point the heat of evaporation is exactly null, as the
tangent to the curve X =/(<) is here at right angles to the abscissa-
axis. The author concludes from the preceding that for carbonic
acid and nitrous oxide at any rate the specific heat of saturated
vapour near the critical point is negative, and increases without
limit with the absolute value. The observation on the specific heat
of saturated vapour is further made, that this function is a maximum,
and has possibly two points of inversion. — Beiblatter der Physik,

     ON THE THERMAL       EXPANSION    OF SOME AMALGAMS IN THE
                     LIQUID STATE.    BY 0. OATTENEO.
     The object of  these researches has been to investigate certain
amalgams,    so as to ascertain whether in the case of perfect lique
faction the approximate law is verified   that the metals retain their
respective coefficients of expansion,  and  if,
                                              on the other hand, their
formation was accompanied by on appreciable change of volume.
Also to study these various amalgams of zinc, so as to calculate
the density and the coefficient of expansion of this metal in the liquid
state.
   From his experiments the author thinks he can deduce the
following conclusions —  :
      When the quantity of tin, of lead, or of zinc eutering into
     1.
the composition of an amalgam       small, the expansion of the
                                      is
amalgam    isnot equal to the sum of the expansion of the metals
which form it.
   2. When, on the contrary, the amalgam          dry, the comparison
                                                  is
of the coefficients of expansion calculated from those given by
experiment, show that with     asufficient approximation the metals
may be regarded as retaining respectively their coefficients of
expansion.
   The amalgams in question have exhibited         contraction.
                                                   a                 This
 contraction     however, very feeble in the case of very concen
                is
trated amalgams.
   The values found for the densities of tin, of lead, and of zinc in
the liquid state at their respective temperatures of fusion, and for
their coefficients of expansion in this same state, are sufficiently
accordant with those given     byVicentini and Omodei from which
                                                              ;
it may be concluded that, like that of alloys, the investigation of the
thermal dilatation of amalgams, provided they are sufficiently
concentrated, may serve to determine directly with             sufficient
                                                                   a

XXXIV.          On Kerr's Magneto-optic          Phenomenon in the case
    of  Equatorial     Magnetization    of  Iron.    By R. Sissingh*.
1.     TT'ERRf        found in the years 1877 and 1878 that, on
       JL\_     the reflexion from magnetized iron of light
polarized in a plane parallel or perpendicular to the plane
of incidence, there arises in the reflected ray, in addition
to the component furnished by the metallic reflexion, another
component polarized in a plane at right angles to this one.
An exact explanation of this phenomenon requires the deter
mination of the amplitude and phase of the magneto-optic
component and its relation to the angle of incidence. This
determination, in the case of iron magnetized parallel to the
plane of incidence and to the reflecting surface, is the object
of the present investigation, in which the results obtained are
compared with the theory of H. A. LorentzJ.                    This theory
permits of a more simple explanation of the phenomenon § .

 always retardations, reckoned with reference to the reflected
 wave polarized parallel to the plane of incidence.
    In accordance with the convention adopted by all previous
observers, I have called the magnetization positive if the
north poles of the magnetic molecules are directed towards
that side of the normal to the mirror on which the polarizer
lies.
    3. We can now deduce the formulaa which serve to de
termine the amplitude y, and the phase m of the magnetic
component of the light, in the case of a bundle of incident
rays polarized parallel to the plane of incidence. In these
formulae     f  and h are the amplitudes of the reflected light
polarized parallel and perpendicularly to the plane of incidence
respectively, when the incident ray has amplitude equal to
unity and is polarized in the same plane.                    is the relative
difference of phase of these two waves in the case of metallic
reflexion.
    Let the polarizer be set parallel to the plane of incidence ;
and let the amplitude of the light incident on the mirror bo
unity.      Now turn the polarizer through a small angle, cf>jp.
The rays falling on the mirror are then: —
      A  ray polarized parallel to the plane         of incidence, ampli
            tude 1   ;
      A  ray polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence,
            amplitude <f>^.
 By reflexion,     we obtain   : —
      A  ray polarized parallel to the plane of incidence, ampli
            tude f, retardation of phase zero ;
      A  ray polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence,
            amplitude h<f>Sp, retardation of phase <I> ; and
      A ray polarized perpendicularly          to the plane    of incidence,
            amplitude        retardation of phase m*.
     If now   the analyser be turned through a small angle $<o
out of the position in which the reflected light was quenched
before the polarizer was turned and the mirror magnetized, the
analyser transmits a bundle of rays with
               amplitude —/<£,„, retardation of phase 0,

   The polarizer can be moved along a groove at right angles
to this, and is inserted on a pillar provided with sights.            This
apparatus permits the polarizer to be rotated about a vertical
or horizontal axis, and to move in a vertical direction.                In
this way we are able to bring the axis of the polarizer into
the same line as the collimator axis, and to put the spec
trometer with its axis perpendicular to this line. The rings
containing the mirrors are, on account of their weight, not
placed      on the spectrometer table, but rest on a bridge
above it.       The rings can thus be rotated about a vertical axis
and displaced in a horizontal direction, by means of two mov
able sledges at right angles to each other.               This allows the
centre of the mirror to be placed in the axis of the incident
ray, and also permits of an exact adjustment of the mirror for
all angles of incidence. For angles of incidence smaller than
24°, the analyser is also separated from the spectrometer and
placed on a cross-piece which can be moved relatively to the
circular platform, just as in the case of the polarizer. As the
rotations to be measured only amount to a few minutes of
angle, it is absolutely necessary that the different parts should
be accurately adjusted and securely fastened in their proper
places.
    8. In order to measure accurately the small rotations, the
Nicol prisms are placed in a parallel beam of light *. The
collimator slit is focused by a telescope situated behind the
analyser. At each point of the image of this slit we receive
in this manner only those rays which pass in the same direc
tion through the Nicol prisms, and which have therefore in
 these prisms the same plane of polarization.           When the prisms
are crossed, a dark band is observed which is displaced parallel
to itself along the image of the slit on moving the polarizer or
 analyser.       If the axes of the collimator and Nicol prisms are
 parallel to each other, the band occupies the centre of the
image of the slit when the Nicols are crossed.              All the rota
tions of the plane of polarization are referred to this position
 of the dark band.          In this way we have only to adjust the
 position of a dark band, instead of, as in the older method,
 estimating when the intensity of the light is a minimum.
 For convenience of adjustment the centre of the slit has a line
 thread stretched across it.         The band is sharply defined if the
 intensity of the light is not too small.           Further, the axes of
the Nicol prisms must coincide as nearly as possible.                  The
polarizer is a Lippich prism with plane faces which are in-

clined to each other at a small angle, viz. about 1 minute *.
The tube in which the prism is fixed is attached by means
of three pressure- and three tension-screws to the rim of
a second tube, which is placed at the centre of the graduated
circle.
     Following Gauss' method, and observing the images of the
telescope spider-lines reflected from the faces of the prism,
the axis of the latter can be set parallel to the collimator axis.
 The error of this setting was less than 1' of angle. The posi
 tion of the polarizer is such that its axis coincides with that
 of the incident ray of light. The axis of the incident ray is
 found by means of a cap with a fine hole through its centre
 which fits over the collimator lens.
     The analyser is a Nicol prism with its faces inclined to each
 other.      The dark band was most clearly seen with such a
 prism.      The condition for the proper position of the analyser
 was that the ray of light reflected from the face of the Nicol
 should describe a circle round the axis of the incident ray
 when the prism was rotated.               The axis of rotation of the
 analyser was also made to coincide with that of the ray
 falling upon it.
     This care in the adjustment of the Nicol prisms is abso
 lutely necessary, in order to observe the dark band at every
 angle of incidence, and especially so if the angle of incidence
 is small.      The new method of observation puts us in a posi
 tion to determine small rotations with a degree of accuracy
 hitherto unattainable f.
      9. As the zero- and minimum-rotations only amount to a few
  minutes of angle in the case of magnetic equatorial reflexion,
  and the small circles of the Nicol prisms are divided in
  degrees and have no vernier, these rotations were measured
  by a mirror and scale method.             At a distance of 2-5 metres
  from the polarizer were placed a telescope and scale, the
  former receiving the image of the scale from mirrors attached
  to the polarizer.        These mirrors were placed on the faces
  of a four-sided hollow prism surrounding the polarizer-

  zation by magnetic reflexion.      In this manner the principal positions
  are determined with a far greater accuracy than in the indirect method
  hitherto almost universally adopted. Of. Sissingh, Dissertation, p. 28;

tube.    The normals of the mirrors were nearly in the same
plane, and made angles of nearly 90° with each other*.
The polarizer was rotated by means of a long arm. In the
analyser a similar arm is fixed to a ring surrounding the
analyser-circle and capable of being clamped by a screw.
This ring carries the mirror used in reading the rotations.
Since only one scale and two telescopes, placed near together,
were used for those measurements, there was added, in case
the angle of incidence was not too great or too small, an
auxiliary mirror, in order to permit of the analyser-rotations
being measured in this manner.             The scales were divided in
millimetres, and 1 minute of angle corresponded to 1*4 to l"8

reading was also very satisfactory : it has been used since 1880.

used.     The latter was furnished by a Siemens lamp which

 netization stopping       at  2'3   amperes    the minimum       rotations of
 the polarizer on account of permanent magnetism were — 2'3
 and -f-2'45, of the analyser +3,b", — 3"9 ; or, expressed in
 minutes, — 1'"5 and V'6, +2'-2 and — 2'-3.
     These observations were made with an angle of incidence
 of 51° 22', because at this angle the minimum rotations can
 be observed with greater accuracy (<•/. § 4), while the influence
 of permanent magnetism is not too small, its effect being a
 maximum for an angle of incidence of between 60° and 70°
  (see § 16).
      12. A second proof of the full demagnetization of the
 mirror is furnished by the agreement between the principal
  positions of the Nicol prisms obtained with the demagnetized
 mirror and with a silver mirror respectively. The two obser
  vations must be made immediately following each other. The
  table of the spectrometer carrying the silver mirror comes in
  the place of the bridge above the spectrometer and carrying
  the iron mirror.         However great bo the care taken in this
  operation to keep       the   mirror in the proper position, the ad
  justment and centering of the mirror have always to be tested,
  and if necessary a new adjustment must be made.                      In place

the deviation of the light, although very small (1'), hinders
 the proper centering and adjustment of the mirror.                       It is
 not easy in these operations to avoid every alteration of the

    Since in these observations 1J=1"33, la'=l-23, we may,
taking into consideration the difficulties in the experiment,
conclude that the principal positions of the Nicol prisms are
the same for the silver mirror and the demagnetized iron
mirror.
    13. Now that we have established that the demagnetization
is complete, we may proceed to show that the amplitude fi of
the magnetic component changes its sign with the direction
of magnetization, but that the phase m is not changed by this
means.       From formula? (1) and (2), § 3, and (4), § 5, it is
shown that this is the case if the minimum- and zero-rotations
for positive and negative magnetization differ from each other
only in their sign and not in absolute value.
    For an angle of incidence of 51° 22' the minimum rotations
were determined both for positive and negative magnetization
— that is to say, after each series of observations with any
given direction of magnetization a demagnetization of the
mirror took place. An exact determination of the minimum

in order to again obtain a minimum intensity of light in the
centre of the field of the analyser (that           is,
                                              the centre of the
image of the slit), after magnetizing the mirror, that the
greatest minimum was not in the centre of the field but
somewhat above or below this position.      This minimum ren
dered an exact adjustment, so that the intensity of light was
least in the centre of the field, almost impossible  and there   ;
fore  by means of the cross slit only the centre of the colli-
mator-slit was left.
   The minimum rotations <£™ and <f>™ were determined for the
two positions in which the polarizer was parallel and perpen
dicular respectively to the plane of incidence and for each  ;
position of the polarizer the analyser was read in two positions

               parallel and perpendicular respectively to the plane of incidence
               has about the same value.    As already previously indicated in
               § 8, this direct method of determining the principal positions
               gives far more accurate results than the indirect methods
               usually employed hitherto.
                   14. Since we may obtain the amplitude fi and the phase m
               of the magneto-optic component both from the minimum-
               rotations and the zero-rotations, we must now show that the
               results agree.   For this purpose the zero-rotations were also
               determined for an angle of incidence of 51° 22', because with
               large and small angles of incidence the accuracy of the
               observations   is considerably decreased, and the minimum-
               rotations, which are then capable of being determined with
               the greatest approach to accuracy, are still sufficiently well
               defined.    As we have already shown that only the amplitude (i
               and not the phase m of the magnetic component of the light
                changes its sign with the direction of magnetization, we onh'

  In  order to determine the influence of a small alteration in
the observed quantities upon the calculated numbers, the values
of a and m were reckoned for the rotations denoted by an
asterisk and chosen at random.     From the observations and
the calculated values, we may  conclude that
                                      ‘ble   =    'bia,       $h,   =    },

   Two of the zero-rotations, º, and dº, are nearly equal to
zero for this angle of incidence. The light reflected from the
magnetized mirror can therefore be extinguished by a rotation
of one of the two Nicol prisms. The influence of the mag
netization is at this angle of incidence almost equivalent to a
rotation of the plane of polarization.         The other two zero
                      #7,
rotations,      and 5%, must therefore differ but slightly from
the corresponding minimum-rotations, which              the case.                     is
  It   isclear from the tabulated observations that, within the

    17. Prof. H. A. Lorentz has shown how the Hall pheno
menon leads to an explanation of magnetic reflexion, if we
assume that every movement of electricity in a magnetic field
is accompanied by a transverse electromotive force.         In this
theory it is assumed that the constant of magnetic polarization
is the same for air and iron ; that is to say, the magnetic iron
molecules cannot direct themselves in accordance with the
rapidly alternating magnetic forces of visible electric vibrations
(light).      Ihave put forward an experimental proof of this,
inasmuch as it has been shown that reflexion from iron does
not differ in the least from reflexion at the surface of a
non-magnetic metal*.          The theory further considers the
behaviour of ordinary electric currents and of visible electric
vibrations to be the same. This, however, has not yet been
experimentally proved. But                   I
                                    have not been able to detect
any   difference  in the constants of reflexion of iron at 120° C,
and at ordinary temperatures,       although the fairly largo in
fluence of temperaturo on electrical resistance would lead us
to expect such a result according to this theory f.
   It   is,however, very important to compare the results of
observation with theory.      In this way we obtain experimental
indications of the behaviour of visible electric vibrations in
metals  J.
  If   we have regard to the difference between the positive
direction of vibration, which we have assumed in order to
completely specify the phase-differences,       and that which                                   is
derived from theoretical investigations, we find from the
electromagnetic theory of magnetic reflexion         that                       §

314      R. Sissingh on Kerr's Magneto-optic Phenomenon.
Perhaps this difference of nearly 90° points to a difference in
the behaviour of ordinary electric currents and the periodic
motions of the electric theory of light. As we have already
seen, this can be shown by other methods “.
     18. Kerr, who discovered the influence of magnetization on
reflexion at the surface of iron, gives only the sign, and not
the magnitude, of minimum-rotations.               His results agree with
my observations. In his case, too, there was a change of
sign at an angle slightly greater than the principal angle of
incidence. Kerr found a maximum of the minimum-rotation in
the neighbourhood of 60°. In my observations the maximum
amplitude of the magnetic component of the light was reached
between 60° and 70°, but the maxima of rotation and ampli
tude do not coincide.          It is worthy of note that Kerr has also
used the motion of the dark band in the field of the analyser
as the most accurate means of adjustment.                 With respect to
the    phase   of the    magneto-optic      component,     Kerr mentions
 that it approximates more nearly to zero than to 90° in the
 case of angles of incidence less than the principal angle.
According to my observations, this is the case for every angle
 of incidence for which the phase can be accurately determined.
     The signs and magnitudes of the minimum-rotations of the
 analyser given by Kundt f agree with mine, with the excep
 tion of some slight differences of magnitude.
     Righi’s investigation f appeared in the year 1887, after               I
 had commenced these measurements.                  I  have calculated the
 amplitudes and phases of the magnetic component of the
 light from the numerous angles of incidence given by Righi
  (Table opposite).         The principal angle of incidence and
 azimuth were assumed the same as that for my mirror No. II.
     Where two values of u and m are given for the same angle
 of incidence, the first values are calculated from the minimum
 and the second from the zero-rotations.             We cannot conclude
 from these observations that the observed and calculated
 amplitudes are proportional to each other, much less that the
 difference between the calculated and observed phases is
  constant.     The rotations must be measured with greater
  accuracy before we can draw the conclusion. To reach this
  degree of accuracy it is absolutely necessary to test the
  method of observation.          The influence of errors of observa
  tion masks these relations. Since Righi did not calculate any
      * Although the theory of magnetic reflexion which Fitzgerald has
  given really applies only to transparent media, yet the amplitudes reckoned
  from it are also proportional to the observed values.

gold-coloured.      The blue form in its soluble and insoluble
varieties will be more particularly described in future paper.    a

silver as     exists in its compounds and more especially in the
                it
silver haloids.
     It   is   a   well established law that when   a   substance          is   capable
of existing in two forms, of which one           polymer of the

be verified.      I have   shown elsewhere       that gold-coloured silver
has a specific      gravity of     8*5,  whilst  that of normal silver is
10-5 to 10-6.         The greater chemical activity of the gold-
coloured form is demonstrated               by its greater affinity for
oxygen, sulphur, and the halogens.                 Also it is conspicuous
by    the  remarkable    facility   with   which   it passes from the one
state to the other.       Spring,    in the  examinations     fibove referred
to, used pressures of many thousands of atmospheres.                     Allo
tropic silver is changed readily to normal bv the mere pressure
of the finger or by a temperature of 100° C.
     One form of allotropic silver has the property of solubility
in water.      The solution of a solid in a liquid is often accom
 panied by change to a more simple molecular structure.
 Hitherto the only solvent known for a metal has been another
 metal, and the behaviour of metals when so dissolved has been
 the subject of late years of very interesting examinations by
 several chemists.         Ramsay* examined the lowering of the
 vapour-pressure of mercury by other metals dissolved in it.
 Heycock and Neville examined the fall in the freezing-point
 of metals, more especially of tin, caused by the solution in it
 of other metals f. Both of these investigations led directly to
 the conclusion that in the case of a dilute solution of one metal
 in another, the dissolved metal existed in the atomic form. (In
 each case a few metals gave exceptional results, but silver was
 not amongst these.) Tainmann's investigations on the alloys
 of mercury led to precisely similar general deductions. Great
 weight attaches to conclusions supported in these several ways.
     The fact that a metal in dissolving in another metal appears
  to assume the atomic form affords no positive proof that it does
  the same in dissolving in water.              In fact the solution of a
  metal in water     is something      so new   that  we have little ground
  for argument by comparison. So far, however, as the above
  mentioned analogy may be considered to go, it rather tends to
  the view that the solubility of silver may be due to its having
  assumed a very simplo and perhaps an atomic form.                    It may
 be said therefore that all considerations tend to show that the
  allotropic forms of silver taken as a whole have a more simple
  molecular nature than what I have described as the inter
  mediate form, and that this again is more simply constituted
   than ordinary silver.
      In the present case we have to consider three distinct forms,
   (1) allotropic, (2) intermediate, (3) ordinary silver. We notice
   that (1) can with the utmost facility and in several ways                   be

converted into    (2) and (3) and that (2) can always be converted
 into (3),   but  that these transformations can by no possibility
 be reversed.    To convert ordinary silver into allotropic we
 must as a first step dissolve it in an acid : that     is, convert     it
from    a  polymerized    to  an  atomic  form,  and only  from   this
 atomic form can allotropic silver be obtained.
    Bearing this capital fact in mind and considering the respec
 tive properties exhibited                  by
                                   the three forms of silver, it may
 be allowable to adopt iis        working hypothesis the view that
                                            a
 they may represent the three possible molecular forms of
 silver, viz. atomic, molecular, and polymerized.
    As silver in its compounds and in its saline solutions exists
 in the atomic form,           easily conceivable that when
                                  it   is                     itsepa
 rates from such solutions by reduction, the atoms may or may
 not unite to molecules.      Usually elementary atoms do so unite,
 but  the  phenomena of nascent action indicate that this union
 does not take place at the instant of separation, and        it    at
                                                                   is
 least conceivable that under particular circumstances this union
may be prevented.        In some cases no such union takes place.
 At least four metals exist in the form of vapour in the atomic
 state.   Whether this state continues after condensation we do
 not know, but there         no impossibility but what such may be
                                  is
 the case.    Similarly allotropic silver may represent an atomic
form      : this were so,
              if               should exhibit more active affinities
                                       it
 for oxygen and the halogens than the ordinary form. Also
it   should readily pass into the ordinary form. And these
properties are undoubtedly exhibited by allotropic silver.
     There         is    of chemical statics in which our know
                        no branch
ledge         is   so defective in relation to the molecular con
                                  as   it   is
stitution of solids and more especially of the metals.   All that
can be sitid    that in metals, as we ordinarily know them, this
constitution            is is
               probably very complex, the molecules containing
many atoms. When substances assume variety of forms dif
                                                  a
fering from each so much as do the forms of silver, we must
either adopt    theory of the character now suggested or else
                         a
we must suppose that the different forms are differently poly
merized. To decide which      most probable of these two views,
                                            is
it   best to examine as to whether an analogy can be traced
     is
between these allotropic forms of silver and silver where          it   is
known to exist in an atomic form, namely, in the compounds.
For this comparison the silver haloids (and chiefly silver
chloride) will be taken.

                          Allotropic Silver.                     323
Action of Forms of Energy on Silver Haloids.           Parallelism
                       with Allotropic Silver.
    It  is a familiar fact that certain forms of energy, light
especially, affect the silver haloids. In view of what has been
already said as to the action of all forms of energy on allotropic
silver, it seemed desirable to make a general examination as to
their action on the silver haloids and thus to determine how
far a parallelism could be traced.
     It is to be observed that the action of different forms of
energy on the silver haloids is apt to be partial : the influence
seems to be antagonized by opposing and almost equally
matched forces.      Thus in the case of light, its tendency to
condense the atoms of silver to molecules is largely counter
 acted by the strong affinity of chlorine for atomic silver. The
 action of high-tension electricity, as will presently be seen, is
 similar to that of light in that it produces a visible effect.    In
 the case of heat and of contact action on these silver haloids, it
 will be shown that there is at first a mere indication of effect,
 invisible to the eye, but readily brought out by the action of a
 reducing agent, as described below.        The action of each form
 of energy seoms to be almost counteracted by opposing affi
 nities. But in every case action does take place and always in
 a direction corresponding to the action of that form of energy
 upon allotropic silver.
     High-tension electricity, it is well known, impresses sensitive
 films of silver haloids, which on development exhibit remark
 able ramifications.    When electric sparks are passed through
 paper on which a coating of silver chloride has been made,
 the point of passage of each spark is marked by a minute circle
 of violet colour indicating a visible change, probably to a sub-
 chloride.
     Mechanical force. — More than twenty years ago        I noticed
 that by a slight pressure, an invisible effect, capable of
 development,     could be impressed on silver iodide.          Lines
 drawn with a glass rod or any other hard, neutral substance
 were reproduced. An embossed card pressed gently on the
 film, gave an image of all its details on development.         These
  experiments were extensively repeated by others with con
  cordant results.
      I have recently repeated them with silver bromide with
  similar effect.
      Heat. — To determine the effect of heat on silver bromide,
  pieces of bromide paper were placed in a desiccator (of course
  using inactive light) and heated to the extent indicated. For
  each piece so heated, a corresponding piece cut from beside

324                    Mr. M. Carey Lea on
it in the same sheet was preserved, and these two pieces, that
heated (after complete cooling) and that not heated, wero
placed side by side in an oxalate developer.           Comparison
between these developments        indicated the effect of the heat.
The following results were obtained : —
    A piece kept for 3 minutes at 145 C. was strongly affected
and blackened quickly in the developer, the companion piece
remaining white.
    A piece kept for 15 minutes at a temperature commencing
at 131° C. and ending at 136° was still more thoroughly
affected than the foregoing, the longer exposure more than
making up for the lower temperature.             Companion piece
remained white.
    A piece kept for 8 minutes at a temperature 107° to 108°
was distinctly but not strongly affected.        Companion piece
as before.
    A piece kept for 17 minutes at a temperature of 100° to
102° was almost unaffected.       A long and careful development
brought out a faint difference between the piece so heated
and its companion piece.
    It was found that to obtain accuracy in determinations
such as these, the paper must rest on a glass, and not a metal,
shelf in the desiccator, as the metal shelf is always hotter than
the air by which the thermometer is affected.           In using a
 metal shelf, if the paper curled by reason of the heat, the part
that rested on the shelf developed darker than that which was
 simply acted on by the air. By substituting a glass shelf
 this difference of effect disappeared.
    The result of the foregoing and other experiments was that
 the effect of heat on AgBr commences at about 100° C, that
 up to 108° it is still slight and acts slowly, but that at 120°
 to 126° a strong action commences, which further increases
 as the temperature     is raised.    The analogy with allotropic
 silver is well marked.
     It may at first seem strange that a temperature of 100° C.
 should produce a permanent change in a substance which will
 bear a high heat without decomposition, but the explanation
 lies in the presence of water in the former case.     When silver
 bromide is formed in paper and dried in the air, it still retains
 moisture. Even at 100° C. this moisture is not driven off.
 A silver haloid requires to be heated to a temperature between
 130° and 140° for several hours before it ceases to lose
weight.      Therefore in all the foregoing cases moisture must
 have been present.
    It remains to be shown that by a sufficiently long exposure
 to a moderate heat in the presence of moisture, a visible
decomposition results.

                          Allotropic Silver.                   325
    For this purpose silver chloride was precipitated with an
excess of hydrochloric acid, after thorough washing was
placed in a glass tube of about a centimetre in internal
diameter and half a metre long, and was sealed up with a
blast lamp.      During all these operations the chloride was
thoroughly protected from light. Five of six centimetres
cube of pure water was first added to the chloride.        It was
intended to exclude completely or almost completely the
effect of pressure and to act on the chloride as far as possible
by heat only, and for this reason a longer tube was used and
one end only was immersed in the chloride-of-calcium bath,
the other end remained cold throughout the operation.
    The silver chloride formed itself into a compact plug and
was forced by the steam which generated below it up to
the middle of the tube. This effect, though not intended,
answered very well, as the chloride was kept constantly under
the influence of steam at about 100°.          It soon began to
 darken and at the end of three or four hours all the lower
 part was violet-brown, the upper part grey, the change taking
 place entirely through the mass.       Some thin smears of silver
chloride on the lower inside part of the tube were completely
 blackened.
     On opening the tube next day there was no escape of gas.
 The water sealed up with the silver chloride had acquired a
 faint but distinct alkaline reaction, showing that enough alkali
 had been dissolved from the glass to overcome any acidity
  arising from decomposition of the chloride. The water con
 tained traces of alkaline chloride.
     A similar examination was made with silver bromide pre
 cipitated with excess of hydrobromic acid and thoroughly
 washed with distilled water. The action of diffuse light on
 silver bromide is very different from that on silver chloride.
 A portion of that prepared as above mentioned changed
 in diffuse light very quickly from yellow to greenish yellow,
 but after that first change the alteration was extremely slow
 and in an hour had only reached to a dirty greenish grey.
 The action of direct sunlight was quite different : fifteen
 minutes' exposure changed the greenish grey to dark chocolate-
  brown.
     In the tube the silver bromide did not form a plug like the
 chloride, but separated into balls which remained in the bottom
 of the tube. By keeping the chloride-of-calcium bath con
 siderably above 100° C, the water in the tube was kept
 actively boiling : it condensed in the upper part of the tube
 and returned.    Six hours of this treatment only brought the
 bromide to the same greenish colour which it would have
 acquired by a few minutes' exposure to diffuse light.

   The conclusion to be drawn as respects both the silver
haloids is that they undergo actual decomposition by the
action of moist heat, but that this effect is much more marked
in the case of chloride than that of bromide *.
    Chemical action. — Dilute sulphuric acid quickly changes
allotropic silver to normal, and therefore if the parallelism
which       I
          have indicated really exists, marks made on bromide
paper with dilute sulphuric acid should be capable of develop
ment.
   The experiment was made by drawing characters on silver
bromide with a glass rod dipped into sulphuric acid diluted
with twice its bulk of water.          After allowing the acid to
remain in contact for two or three minutes, the paper was
immersed in running water and was washed for an hour or
two.
   On applying the oxalate developer nothing appeared.
Feeling confident that some effect must be produced, the experi
ment was repeated several times and the results were closely
examined.     On one specimen it was found that the characters
had appeared, but reversed — tliat          is,
                                          lighter than the ground,
which had darkened by      the  development being pushed.       This
at once gave     cluea   : showed that traces of the acid adhered
                             it
too strongly to be removed          by washing, and by locally
checking    the   development     interfered    with the reaction.
Accordingly,    next time,  after   very
                                    a     short  washing, the paper
was immersed in water to which         trace of ammonia had been
                                        a
added, and after ten or fifteen minutes' action the ammonia
was thoroughly washed out.        The result was striking    as soon
                                                                   :
as the developer was applied, the characters which had been
traced with acid came out strongly as brown marks on           white   a
 surface.
   Cold sulphuric acid, even undiluted,        gonerally held to

     Light. — The silver haloids in their        sonsitiveness        to light
show an important relationship to that of allotropic silver.
When, for example, silver chloride precipitated with an excess
of hydrochloric acid is exposed to light, the darkened product
contains apparently no metallic silver*       probable that the
                                                 (it    is
trace of silver given up to nitric acid may arise from the de
composition of a very small quantity of subchloride). How
ever this may be, the subchloride, and not metallic silver, the         is
essential product.
   This has always seemed        a  very enigmatical result.      Two
combinations of silver and chlorine exist — the one very stable,
capable of fusion without decomposition        the other so unstable
                                                 ;
that   it  can hardly exist isolated, and yet the stable compound
is rapidly broken up by light, even            byweak diffuse light,
                                                    a
whilst the unstable compound resists many days' exposure to
the strongest sunlight.
    In examining the action of light upon allotropic silver (see
Part I.), an equally remarkable effect was described. Although
all the other forms of energy applied readily and quickly con
vert allotropic to ordinary silver, light (at ordinary tempera
tures) fails to effect this change even        by
                                               exposures lasting for
several months. If we conceive that the atomic form of silver
which exists in AgOl corresponds to the allotropic form, and
that the more condensed form of subchloride corresponds to
the " intermediate form," we shall obtain         reasonable expla
                                                     a
nation of the action of light.
    The inability of light to carry the change which             it
                                                            produces
in   allotropic  silver beyond    the " intermediate  form"   exactly
 corresponds to its inability to carry the decomposition of silver
 chloride further than to subchloride or rather to photochloride.
 (It understood that the silver chloride here spoken of that
      is                                                               is
 which       formed
            is       by precipitation with excess of hydrochloric

 and at the same time establishes      aperfect parallelism between
 that action and the action of light on allotropic silver.

much interest in relation to the haloids themselves and place
their nature in a somewhat new light.     For it is shown that
these haloids, though substances in some respects of very great
stability, have their equilibrium so balanced as to respond to
the slightest influence, not merely of light, but of any form
of energy, not receiving a momentary but a permanent im
pression which, though so slight as to be invisible, still greatly
increases the tendency of the molecule to fall to pieces under
the action of a reducing agent.     Further, four of these forms
of energy, light, heat, electricity, and chemical action, when
more strongly applied, totally disrupt the molecule. One form
of energy, mechanical force, though capable of producing the
invisible effect, makes an apparent exception in respect of this
ability to disrupt. This matter is now under examination, and
it will probably be shown hereafter that the analogies are
complete and without exception.
   The same completeness holds with regard to the analogies
which form a principal subject of this paper, namely, those
existing between allotropic silver and the metal as it exists in
the salts of silver.  No other salts but those of silver show
this wonderfully balanced equilibrium, sensitive to all forms of
energy.    But allotropic silver also shows an almost exactly
similar capacity to respond to the influence of energy in all
its manfestations by undergoing changes of a like character.
    The inferences to be drawn from the foregoing seem to be
 as follows.  That silver may exist in three forms : 1st. Allo
tropic silver which is protean in its nature ; may be soluble or
insoluble in water, may be yellow, red, blue, or green, or may
have almost any colour, but in all its insoluble varieties always
exhibits plasticity, thatis,if brushed in  a   pasty state upon a
 smooth surface its particles dry in optical contact and with
brilliant metallic lustre. It    ischemically active.    2nd. The
intermediate form, which may be yellow or green, always
shows metallic lustre, but     isnever plastic and  is  almost as
indifferent chemically as white silver. 3rd. Ordinary silver. .
                                                              .
                                                              .
 Further, that allotropic silver can always be converted, either
into the intermediate form, or directly into ordinary silver    ;
that the intermediate form can always be converted into
ordinary silver, but that these processes can never be reversed,
so that to pass from ordinary silver to allotropic  it  must first
be rendered atomic by combination, and then be brought back
to the metallic form under conditions which check the atoms
in uniting.    That allotropic silver isaffected by all forms  of
energy, and that this effect    always in one direction, namely,
                               is

towards condensation. That the silver haloids are similarly
affected by the same agencies.        That a remarkable parallelism
is noticeable between the two actions, especially if we take
into account that in the haloids the influence of energy is to
some extent restrained by the strong affinity which the
halogens show for atomic silver. There is therefore reason
able ground to suppose that in the silver haloids silver may
exist in the allotropic form.

      J-    self-induction of a coil is somewhat similar to that of
Maxwell ('Electricity and Magnetism,' vol. ii. art. 778), in
asmuch as a condenser is employed.              But it is not a null
method ; and, although not absolutely necessary for rough
determinations, it is desirable to use a ballistic galvanometer
on account of the ease with which the throws of the needle
can be observed, and because less adjustments and observa
tions have to be made.

   The following determination of the self-induction of coil             a
may be given as an example.    The coil was     circular coil of

breadth 1*894 centim. and depth 1*116 centim., and having
278 turns.     The galvanometer was an ordinary reflecting
galvanometer with a resistance of 164*8 ohms, the controlling
magnet being placed so as to make tho sensibility as great,
and the time of swing as long, as possible.   An inductionless
resistance of 100 ohms was put in series with the coil, and the
resistances of the branches AB and AD were each 10 ohms.
A balance was roughly obtained                 by
                                    making the branch CD
150 ohms, and, in the absence of better means, an almost
perfect balance by adding to CD       wire whose resistance
                                                   a
was subsequently found to be *51 ohm.  The resistance of the
branch CD or CB was therefore 150*51 ohms. The following
numbers are the means of several readings which agreed
very well together    —

    The following method, which is but a slight modification of
 Maxwell's, does away with mnch of its impracticability.
    In Maxwell's method the armatures of the condenser are
connected to A and B (fig. 3), and S is the coil whose coeffi
cient of self-induction is to be found. The only difference in
                                F,g. 3.

the method now given is that an adjustable resistance r is
placed between B and N.           Suppose a balance has been ob
tained so that no permanent current flows through the galva
nometer.      This balance will not be disturbed by changing r.
Let x be the wholo quantity of electricity which has passed
through AB at the time t, z the whole quantity which has
passed through AM, and y that through AD.          Then, if K be
the capacity of the condenser, and if we suppose the potential
of N to be always equal to that of D, we have

The first is the condition for no permanent current; and
the second, which is the condition for no instantaneous
current, gives the formula
                       L = K{r(R+S)          +    RQ}.
    Ifwe make r=0, we get Maxwell's formula. The practical
method immediately suggested by the above expression for L
is to obtain a permanent balance in the ordinary way, and
then to adjust r and, if possible, K till there is no motion of
the galvanometer-needle.      Or     as in Maxwell's method,
                                            if,

small throw of the needle when the battery-circuit       made or   is

made by introducing an adjustable resistance        and in doing

   Howover, we may make the rough adjustment, having first

adjust this till there     no kick of the galvanometer-needle
                             is
or no sound in the telephone.
   In order to find the relative values of the various resist
ances which will make the sensitiveness of the final adjust

breaking the battery -circuit after the adjustment for no
permanent current has been made.

  It  seem? therefore advantageous      to make R anil P both
large, and Q and r both .small.     Hence the very easy practical
method suggested by the formula might not be so sensitive as
to obtain first an approximate adjustment, and then to make
the final adjustment by varying r.
   The following example of the measurement of the coeffi
cient of self-induction of a coil by this method may be given.
The resistance Q being 10 ohms, and P 100 ohms, there was a
permanent balance when R was made 1577 ohms, so that S,
the resistance of the coil, was 157*7 ohms.      A condenser of
1 microfarad capacity was then placed between A and N and
the resistance r adjusted till there was no kick of the galva
nometer-needle.      This value of r was found to be 59 ohms,
though   the sensitiveness was, doubtless, not as great as might
have been obtained.      Substituting these values, we have
            L = 103 x (15770 + 59 x        1734-7) centim.
              = ¦118 henry.
   The same method was also employed to find the coefficient
of self-induction of the coil described in (1) of resistance
59*51 ohms.     P was made 1000 and Q 10 ohms ; and when
R was 5051 an almost perfect balance was obtained.   Both a
telephone and a galvanometer  were used in the final adjust
ment of r, and the value thus found was 3'b*5 ohms.      The
coefficient of self-induction    is,
                              therefore,
             103   x (50510+3-65 x 5101-51) centim.
                           = •0691 henry,
which does not differ greatly from the previous result.

                      " Measurement by Light-Waves " t it was
       a paper on
IN shown      that by substituting a refractometer for a micro
scope or telescope or spectroscope, the accuracy of measure
ment may be increased to a remarkable degree, but at, the
cost of resolution and definition.       When the object viewed is
smaller than the limit of resolution, however, then, even in
the ordinary sense, these instruments possess scarcely any
                            "                   '
advantage ; but if by         defining-power      is meant not the
actual resemblance of the image to the object, but the ac
curacy with which the form or the distribution of light may
be inferred, then the refractometer has remarkable advantages
in both defining-power and accuracy.
   This has been pointed out in the preceding paper (supra,
p. 256) in the case of telescopic observations.         It was shown
that by a proj>er interpretation of the " visibility-curve
                                                                  " the
form and the distribution of light might be correctly inferred,
even when the object is beyond the resolving-power of the
telescope.
   In the present     paper it is proposed to show that the same
principle holds in spectroscopic observations, and even with
greater force.
   In fact, a spectral line might be viewed by a telescope con
verted into a refractometer, and the
                                           " line ' could bo
                                                                studied
in precisely the same way as a nebulous star.          Such a method,
however, would multiply the necessary imperfections of lenses
and prisms or gratings.-
   Fortunately both spectroscope and telescope may be dis
pensed with, by substituting the refractometer in any form
which allows a considerable and steady alteration in the dif
ference in path between the two interfering streams of light
from any approximately homogeneous source.
   One of the first applications of this method         J  showed that
the red hydrogen-line is a very close double ; and the same is
also true for the green thallium-line.          Another instance of
the class of problems which the method may help to solve is
the effect of the velocity of the vibrating molecule in the line
of sight in broadening the spectral lines.

   This question has been discussed by Ebert*, who concludes
that the width of the spectral lines due to this cause is not
consistent with the results obtained by interference.

XXXIX.         Further Contribution* to Dynamometry, or the Mea
    surement    of Power. By T. H. Blakeslky, M.A., M.Inst.
    C.E.*
             that the advantage of using the split dynamometer
 NOWto       measure power, as first proposed by me more than
half a decade since, seems to be at length receiving some
 attention through the generalization of the method when
 applied to transformers, discovered independently by Prof. W.
E. Ayrton and myself, it may be well to point out clearly the
 principles upon which such an instrument must be inserted
 into an electrical system to effect the measurement of a phy
 sical quantity, and the nature of the quantities which admit of
 such measurement.
    In the first place,     an exact idea must be formed          of the
   *  Communicated    by the Physical Society : read February 27, 1801.

                   Contributions to Dymamometry.               347
nature of the physical quantity indicated by the reading of a
dynamometer, or the angle through which the torsion-head is
turned to bring the coils into a standard relative position,
which is usually, but not necessarily, one in which the coils
are at right angles one to the other.       That position has the
advantage of introducing no mutual induction in the instru
ment itself.
   Expressed mathematically, the reading measures the quantity
                            1 PT
where Cx and C2 are the currents at a moment through the
two coils, those currents being periodic or constant (one may
be constant, the other periodic), and T being an interval of
time at least equal to the least common measure of the periods,
and so small that the index is not able to move appreciably
in the interval T. The larger the moment of inertia of the
moving coil, the greater the limit which may be allowed to T.
                               I
    In the year 1885, when first suggested sending different
                                                          I
currents through the two coils of such an instrument, called
a reading taken under such circumstances the " force-reading,"
to distinguish it from an ordinary dynamometer-reading in
the usual case of the currents being identical in the two coils.
That name was suggested by the fact that (current)8 has for
its structural formula in the electromagnetic system the same
dimensions as force, omitting the dimension of permeability.
This fact is shown in Sir W . Thomson's so-called current-
balances, where (current)2 is made to produce equilibrium
with a force.
    But (current)2 has another more important meaning. When
multiplied by resistance, it means power, and therefore by
itself it means power per unit of resistance ; and this is its
true meaning independently of permeability.         The dynamo
meter-reading is the mean power per unit of resistance.
    If, therefore, we know the proper resistance to multiply
the dynamometer-reading by, we shall be in possession of the
value of the power ; and it follows that appropriate dynamo
meter-readings must be of extreme value in measuring power.
    It will thus be seen that if the physical quantity Z can be
expressed for its momentary value in terms quadratic in the
instantaneous     currents, these terms will point out to us the
appropriate places for dynamometers whose readings, being
filled in in the places of those quadratic expressions, will give
us the mean value of (Z) .     To make this perfectly clear : —

348                 Mr. T. H. Blakesley's Further
    Suppose
                         Z=A.c1?+Bc1cs + CcsJ
at any instant; then the mean value of Z will be
                         A.jDi + BxDj + CgDj,
 where ,DS is the reading of a dynamometer one of whose coils
 carries Ci and the other c2.
    If  Z is power, A, B, C are of the order resistance.               If  Z
 is loo"?,     A, B, C are of the order (resistance)2. It is neces
 sary  that A,  B, C should not be functions of the time. Hence
 power and E.M.F.2, the latter being merely power per unit of
 conductivity, are very appropriate quantities for the method.

where et and e2 are the total E.M.F. s of the generators in the
two loops 1 and 2 (including all induction); cx, ca, and c3 are
the three instantaneous currents, the two former positive
towards the same point of junction, the latter positive towards
the other, so that ci + cs=c3 always ; and
difference at the points where the circuits join.

we have power       of 1st generator

              = r2jD3 + r33D3, or j\j + r3SD2 + r31Ds,
where    D refers to a dynamometer-reading.
    Here we appear to require four dynamometers ; but the
expression for the instantaneous power may be written in the
2nd form given, which necessitates only three dynamometers.
Either generator here becomes a motor if the second term as

value than the first term, which is necessarily positive.
    The expressions for determining the mean E.M.F. of the

thus   : —

in which expressions              there are only three dynamometer-
readings, and these the same three as for giving the two
powers.
    It is clear that —r3c3ct is the power doing work upon the
second circuit ; for it is equal to — fc2 at any moment ;
.•. — r32D3 is the mean power expended in the second circuit.
    This is quite independent of the nature of the apparatus
in the second circuit, which may contain any or all of the
following     : —
                A  perfect or absorbent condenser,
                An electromagnet,

                A  tuning-fork,       or other make and break.
    Should the apparatus render it undesirablo to have the
current cs passed through the dynamometer, we may write
                  — r3c3c2= — r3c3(c3— C;)         =,W3—       »V32,

    It was by this means that suggested to Mr. Swinburne he
might measure the dielectric hysteresis of his condensers.                       It
 would only take two dynamometers, as is seen.

measured by means of three dynamometers judiciously applied
to the main current and those in a single branch.
    This, of course, can be applied to measure the power at
 work in a system of parallel transformers by means of a home
transformer, whose resistances may be kept fixed or at least
 accurately determined.
    It may also be used to measure the electric power of a
 welding transformer, into whose secondary it is inexpedient,
 if not impossible, to introduce any extra resistance.

indicates the power employed in heating a secondary and a
 core corresponding with it.         Both in this case and in the case
of parallel transformers it appears that the power heating the
 core and its secondary is indicated by one dynamometer-reading
alone, one coil being in the primary and the other in the
 secondary; the reading requiring multiplication by the ratio
 of the coil-turns in the primary to those in the secondary, and
 by the secondary resistance ; i. e. this power
     Does not this indicate the direction which efforts should take
 to effect a really fair mode of measuring Electrical Energy
 supplied   ?
     In some cases a single instrument might be used, even if the
 formula indicated two terms, to obtain the required measure
 ment. Suppose, for instance, that the formula had two terms
  (C]2— CiC2).   This may be written Ci(cj — c3); and it is clear
 that if we had two fixed similar coils both in one plane, and
  made to carry cx and r2 reversed, respectively, and if the movable
  coil were made to carry cv then the indications of the instru
  ment would give the required measurement.                It might be
  possible to multiply such coils, and vary their turns and posi
  tion so as to meet any case, if desirable.           The method is
  merety   indicated   here.

   From what have said, it will not surprise those who have
followed me that in questions of power             I recommend that
quotations should be made of mean current?, as indicated by
dynamometers, and that attempts at giving mean cur
rent in amperes, with reversing currents, should be given
up.    What a quantity of pains has been taken to make volt
meters give indications proportional to volts ! The merit of
a difference of potential is as its square, and that of cells as
the square of their E.M.F.        Give me twice the E.M.F., you
quadruple my power       of  doing work by its means.        To reduce
readings to give the square root of mean square is doubly
wrong.     It is a ridiculous attempt to reach a useless quantity,
and, further, gives one the trouble of squaring back again.

             1888        Blakesley   described  before   this Society
         very interesting method       of testing the power given
to the primary coil of a transformer based on the employ
ment of three dynamometers. The method, however, really only
requires two alternate current ammeters and one dynamo
meter with two coils.        The ammeters are placed respectively
in the primary and secondary circuits of the transformer,
while the two coils of the dynamometer are electrically
separated from one another, one being placed in the primary
and the other in the secondary circuit of the transformer,
as shown in the figure.

           Proof of the Generality of  certain Formula.       355
stants had to be employed in each case to reduce the arbitrary
scale-readings to absolute measure.     We will, on the contrary,
suppose the instruments to be graduated as they ought to be,
so that if Dp, Ds, and Dpj be the readings of the three instru
ments, they are equal respectively to the square root of the
mean square of the primary current, the square root of the
mean square of the secondary current, and the mean product
of the two currents.
    With this definition Mr. Blakesley proved geometrically
that the watts given to the primary coil of the transformer
 were equal to
                                   p
                            pl>l + g sDp,   ;
 where p and s are the resistances, in ohms, of the primary coil
 and the whole secondary circuit respectively, and P and 13
 are the numbers of windings in the primary and secondary
 coils of the transformer.
    The formula is a simple one, and the values of the ex
 pressions in it are fairly easy to obtain experimentally.     The
 proof of the formula, however, as given by Mr. Blakesley, was
 based on the following assumptions : —
     1. The variations of the primary and secondary currents
 are harmonic.
     2. The variation of the magnetism of the core is harmonic.
     3. The magnetic stresses produced in the iron core by the
 currents in the primary and secondary coils are directly pro
 portional to the ampere-turns in these two coils.
    4. Each turn in each coil embraces at any moment the same
 number of lines of force.
     5. The secondary circuit outside the transformer is non-
 inductive.
                                 n.
     In the spring of last year, 1890, Mr. Wightman, one of the
  third-year students of the Central Institution, showed that an
  analytical method for measuring the efficiency of a transformer,
  which had been described in one of the lectures at the college,
  could by a slight transformation be employed to prove the
  generality of Mr. Blakesley's formula given above.
     The proof is quite simple, and shows that the formula in
  question is true whatever function the currents or the mag
  netism be of the time, and whatever amount of hysteresis or
  magnetic lag may exist.      In fact the proof is independent of
  Mr. Blakesley's assumptions Nos. 1> 2, and 3, mentioned
  above.

    We have delayed the publication of this proof until we
 had used the method for a lengthy series of experiments on a
 transformer kindly lent, us by Mr. Mordey, and which has
 occupied the students for many months. But, in order that
 others like ourselves should be able to use Mr. Blakesley's
formula with confidence, and without having any longer the
 fear that if the sine law were not true, or if much hysteresis
 existed, their calculations made by means of this formula
 from experimental results might be very wrong, we commu
 nicated nearly a year ago the general character of the proofs
that we had arrived at to Mr. Blakesley and to others in
terested in the matter.

    Let At be the secondary current, in amperes, at the same

of the dynamometer having one coil in the primary and the
other coil in the secondary circuit.
   The following is another general proof of the same for
mula : —
   The watts given to the primary coil of a transformer are
spent partly in heating the primary coil, and partly in doing
work against the back electromotive force set up by the
varying magnetism of the core.
   The watts spent in healing the primary coil are of course
pjyp ; while the watts spent in doing work against the back
electromotive force are at any moment A x the back B.M.F.
   The E.M.F. generated in the secondary circuit by the
same variation of magnetism of iron is at anv moment sA ;
therefore the back E.M.F. in the primary coil at the same

written as follows : —

and since   pDl + sT>' are the watts employed in heating the
primary   coil and the whole of the secondary circuit, it follows
that

of the transformer is

   Using the various assumptions already referred to, Mr.
Blakesley arrived, by means of a geometrical proof,at a formula
for measuring the mean square of the P.D. at the terminals
of the primary coil bv means of the two ammeters and the
dynamometer.
   The following general proof of this formula is very much
simpler than the proof for only a special case which Mr.
Blakesley gives, and furnishes a very good example of the
fact that sometimes it is more easy to give an analytical proof
which is true independently of any assumptions about the
harmonic law, &c. than to give a geometrical proof which is
only true when these suppositions hold.

true irrespectively of any assumptions as to the functions the
E.M.F.s, the currents, or the magnetic flux are of the time as
well as of any assumptions as to the presence or absence of
hysteresis or magnetic lag.

      a
            1890 (vol. xxx. p. 33), by Mr.      J.   S. Ames, “On
Relations between the Lines of various Spectra, with special
Reference to those of Cadmium and Zinc, and a Redetermi
nation of their Wave-lengths,” the author refers to two of my
papers, the titles of which follow : —“Notes on certain Photo
graphs of the Ultra-violet Spectra of Elementary Bodies,”         J.
Chem. Soc. vol. xli. p. 84, 1882; and “On Homologous
Spectra,” loc. cit. vol. xliii. p. 390, 1883.      The substance of
these papers may be stated in a few words.
   I observed a remarkable likeness between the individual
lines in the spectra of different elements belonging to the
same group, but striking differences between the characters:
of the lines belonging to elements of different groups. The
spectra of the alkali metals were quite different from those of
the magnesium group.        These latter differed from the iron
group.     The  aluminium,    indium, thallium spectra differed
from   any  of the others. The metalloids tellurium, arsenic,
and antimony had distinct characters in common. The dif
ferences in the lines of various spectra observed were, first
in intensity of chemical action, secondly in length, thirdly
in extension above and below the points of the electrodes, and
fourthly in breadth or shape, as, for instance, with or without
a nimbus.     These physical characters were first described by
me in the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society,
vol. i. p. 231, 1881. So important were they considered,
that a large amount of labour was incurred in giving a minute
description to each line in the tables of wave-length measure
ments made by Mr. Adeney and myself (Phil. Trans. vol.
clxxv. p. 63, 1884). Only two other observers have given

A community of characteristics in spectra was recognized
as being due to a similarity in the properties of elements be-,
longing to the same group when classified according to the
Periodic Law. Elements with properties in common likewise
exhibit spectra with similar groupings of lines; but the dis
persion of the lines and the refrangibility of the strong lines in
each group vary with the atomic mass of the elements.           The

360                Prof. W. N. Hartley on Relations
communications in which these matters were dealt with were
illustrated by photographs of spectra enlarged to 36 x 28
inches.     In the group of metals comprising magnesium, zinc,
cadmium, each spectrum consists of (1) single lines, (2) pairs
of lines, (3) a series of triplets, (4) a quadruple group, and
(5) a quintuple group.      When oscillation-frequencies are cal
culated from the     wave-lengths  of the lines in each spectrum,
the differences between the       oscillation-frequencies   in each
triplet in any one series is a constant quantity; the law
applies also to the series of doublets. The differences between
the oscillation-frequencies of individual rays in the series of
triplets increases with the atomic mass of the elements to
which the triplets belong.
    A survey of the facts led me to the conclusion that these
elements are composed of the same kind of matter in different
states of condensation, the molecules having similar modes,
but different rates of vibration.        This law of homology in
spectra has been elaborately studied by       J.  R. Rydberg, who
it appears recognized it independently in 1885 *.
    The spectra studied by me were spark-spectra, and con
cerning this point Mr. Ames writes:–“But it is hardly safe
to draw inferences from spark-spectra ; for, although they are
undoubtedly characteristic, yet the state of affairs in the spark
discharge is so unnatural, if I may use the term, that similar
 molecules could not be expected to act alike.” There are, of
course, good reasons for studying both arc- and spark-spectra
and there are certain features in the latter which render them
 of particular interest; for instance, their physical characters
 are more strongly marked than those of arc-spectra, their
 lines are sharper and very seldom diffuse as in the arc, and
 the same element frequently gives lines common to both arc
 and spark.      The disadvantage is that they are more compli
 cated.    But there does not appear to be any definite reason
 for   rejecting  observations made upon spark-spectra, or re
 garding the inferences drawn therefrom as unsatisfactory.
 The conditions which are not specified, but which are referred
 to as influencing the mode of vibration of the molecules in
 vapours resulting from the spark-discharge, have never varied
 the spectrum of any of the metals which have come under
  my observation. The only element which has exhibited vari
  ations in  itsspectrum within my experience,      is carbon    in
                                                                  the

3590, 3585, 3583-5, 2746-6, and 2640        are absent without any
apparent reason.    The first five of        these lines are much
lengthened and strengthened when            carbon dioxide is the
atmosphere surrounding the electrodes       and are unquestionably
carbon lines (Phil. Trans, vol. clxxv. p. 49, 1884). The
spectra of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium have been photo
graphed repeatedly, and that of cadmium has been observed
by me many thousands of times during the last twelve years,
yet not only have the spectra been always characteristic, but
they have never varied in any single particular.
    I should infer from this that molecules of the same metal I
always act alike under the influence of a properly regulated \
spark-discharge, in spite of the fact that the motion of the

spark is oscillatory. Mr. Ames further remarks : — It is to be
 regretted, too, that in general so little attention has been paid
to the physical properties of the lines, when homologous
groups or series were selected.                 I
                                      It is only, think, by means
of the physical similarities that correct inferences can be
made.     For these two reasons a great many of the relations
given by Professor Hartley are inaccurate."
    Nothing but the physical similarities of the lines, and their
evident arrangement in pairs and triplets in the three spectra
above mentioned, led to my calculations and the discovery of
those relations in spark-spectra which have been recently
observed by Mr. Ames in the arc-spectra of zinc and cad
mium. It was therefore at least seven years prior to the
publication of his paper that the importance of taking into
account the physical similarities of lines and groups of Hues
was fully recognized.
    Mr. Ames at another point in his communication makes
                                "
the following statement : — The resemblance of the spectrum
of magnesium to those of zinc and cadmium is much less
marked than the one just noted.                 I
                                         In fact, think nearly all
the points   of similarity given by  Professor   Hartley are wrong.
Magnesium has, it is true, the groups of triplets ; but their
physical properties bear no apparent relation to those of the
zinc and cadmium triplets. The beautiful series of five lines
at wave-length 2779-9 in the magnesium spectrum surely has
no companions in the zinc and cadmium spectra.             There
                                                                   is is is,
however, one striking feature common to all three.           This
the presence of one broad reversed line.         In magnesium it
at wave-length 2852-2      ;  in zinc, at wave-length 2138-3  ;   in
cadmium, at wave-length 2288'1."        I    do not agree with Mr.
Ames, and think he      is   not justified in stating the opinion
which  is  the second sentence in the foregoing quotation. The

362       Relations   between the    Lines of various Spectra.
photographic enlargements show that the magnesium triplets
are the same in character as those of zinc and cadmium. First,
the lines are continuous ; secondly, they have a large nimbus;
thirdly, thev are extended ; and, fourthly, the first and second
lines in eacn triplet are stronger than the third, which is the
most refrangible.     There    is, however, difference in the first
                                              a
and second strong       lines  of the  principal triplet in cadmium,
and this difference   is  common both to my spectrum and that
of Mr. Ames namely, the lines are double.
               ;
    He suggests the probability of the corresponding zinc lines
being resolvable into doublets, and       I   should feel inclined to
suggest  that  in  such    an  event  the corresponding magnesium
lines are with equal probability doublets.         But on the whole
I  do not think the zinc lines are double, as      itrather appears to
me that we must expect certain variations in the lines of
homologous spectra, and one of these          is   splitting of strong
                                                   a
lines into two in   the   case  of  elements with greatly increased
atomic mass, just as the intervals between lines in the doublets
and triplets in different spectra become greater with definitely
                                                              a
increased quantity of matter in the atoms.           Of course, under
such  a  condition,   lines   with   approximately the same wave
length in one spectrum, and appearing as one line, would be
represented by corresponding lines in the spectrum of an
element of the same group, but with           a  higher atomic mass,
as two separate lines.       The individual members of any homo
logous series of organic substances possess certain peculiar
properties which are variations from those belonging to the
general type   ; this is  particularly the case with those terms of
the series of high molecular weight, and elements of the same
group exhibit properties which are still wider variations from
the general properties therefore, in such
                           ;                       amatter as the con
stitution of spectra  it   would indeed be strange       if the latitude
in such variations were not still greater. For, as the properties
which the elements of the same group possess in common are
fewer in number than those held in common by homologous
series of organic substances, the constitution of the spectra
may be expected to be less strictly defined.           In other words,
the spectrum of an element may be conceived as being the
expression of the vibrations which are caused            byall the mole
cular  movements     upon    which   the properties of the molecules
depend.
  With regard to the nine most refrangible lines in mag
nesium, zinc, and cadmium,    can affirm that
                               I                        in
                                                 each spectrum
they form  avery striking group, particularly so in magnesium
and zinc.

              I
and this have attributed more to inaccuracies in the measure
ments in this part of the zinc and cadmium spectra than to
any differences in physical characters of the lines. As far as
recorded observations show, the last group of five lines appear

                  in
 has not been realized.    On opening the book        are immediately              we

intelligible and in some oases fairly good, but wherever any shading
has been attempted the detail is entirely obscured and the figure ren
dered almost or quite worthless. As examples of this, the diagrams
of the pulley-blocks (p. 379) and of the speed-counter (p. 535)
may be mentioned, though these are not chosen as being con
spicuously bad.    In other cases the figure is spoiled by a too great
similarity   between   different parts of the apparatus, as in the
ammeter (p. 466), where the coil conveying the current and the
controlling horseshoe permanent magnet are drawn so as to look
exactly like two parallel coils ; or, again, in the sketch of Poggen-
dorff's method of comparing electromotive forces (p. 531), in which
the traditional diagram has been departed from, and a very
remarkable series of circles put in its place.
   It is to be regretted that the work of the engraver has been so
badly executed, since the book is on this account debarred in a
great measure from use by any except those who have access to
the actual apparatus described (presumably that of Harvard Uni
versity).    The text and the order in which the experiments are
given are both good, and maintain the standard of the first volume.
We find in many experiments special devices referred to which
should materially help to increase the degree of accuracy obtain
able. As au instance we may mention the use of the micrometer-
screw to measure the amount of bending of a loaded beam ; the
point of the screw touching the beam closes an electric circuit and
rings a bell. Some few omissions have, as we think, been made ;
nothing is said, for example, about the water voltameter, although
the direct comparison of the electrochemical equivalents of, say,
copper and hydrogen, is a very easy, satisfactory, and instructive
experiment, the results of which are independent both of the
constancy of the current used and of its duration.       Moreover, the
experiment affords a good example of the correction of the volume
of a gas for temperature and pressure.
   In our perusal of the book we have noted one or two misprints
in the text, which will scarcely lead to mistakes or confusion,
except, perhaps, in the description of experiment 98, where
Leclanche is spelt. Leehanche throughout.       A dash is omitted in
each of the formulae (5) and (6), p. 441, and in the lower formula
of page 563 the d should be I in order to accord with a previous
formula there referred to.

Tlie   Steam-Engine considered as a Thermodynamic Machine : a
   Treatise on the Thermodynamic Efficiency of Steam- Engines, illus
   trated by diagrams, tables, and examples from practice.    By  J. H.
   Cotterill, F.SJS. (London : E. & F. N. Spon, 1S90. Pp. xi
   + 420.)
The first edition of this work was published in December 1877,
and was intended " to serve as an introduction to applied thermo
dynamics, while at the same time an attempt was made         to study,

                   Notices respecting New Books.                        365
more completely than had hitherto been done, the process of the
conversion of heat into work in steam-engines."         The treatise has
been long out of print, and so, with a diffidence it is hard to under
stand, the author lias brought out the present edition.              This
reluctance, however, is due to the thought that so great progress
has been made since 1877, that some might wish that a new work
had been written rather than a new edition of an old one published.
The present volume contains eleven chapters, accompanied by sets
of useful Tables, and followed by an appendix containing Notes
and Addenda.        The first nine chapters in the main are a reprint,
but numerous additions and improvements have been made in them
to bring the work up to date.      These additions are more especially
indicated in the Appendix. For the benefit of such as have not
a copy of the work, we briefly note the subjects discussed in these
chapters.     The first treats of the physical properties of steam,
the author then coming to thermodynamics, discusses the con
vertibility of heat and work, and treats of the formation of steam
in a closed vessel, and of internal work in general. Chapters 3,
4, and 5 are taken up with a preliminary theory of the Steam-
Engine, an account                                     statement of the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, an enunciation and explanation of
Carnot's principle, and accounts of some perfect Thermodynamic
Machines.       Chapter 0 is devoted to the generation and expansion
of Steam. In Chapter 7 we have extensions of Carnot's principle,
of the adiabatic equation (with numerical examples), and the con
 nexion between adiabatic curves, with a discussion of several other
 matters bearing upon the subject of perfect, engines with any given
 cycle.    The losses of efficiency in Heat-Engines occupy chapter 8,
and clearance and wire-drawing form the subject-matter of chapter
 9.   The last two chapters have been completely rewritten ; this is
in consequence of the attention which has of late years been paid
to this branch of the subject, viz., the action of the sides of the
cylinder and of water remaining after exhaust, and the conditions
of economical working of Steam-Engines.               They occupy one
 quarter of the book, and contain much matter of interest.         If the
 statements made in this concluding part meet with acceptance, and
 some little time must elapse before a sufficient trial can be made
 of them, then the author's success will be as great as it was upon
the appearance of the first edition.           Every one must wish
 that "the    not  inconsiderable  amount   of  time and labour which
 has been spent in its preparation" by one whose time is well
 occupied with regular professorial work, may meet with an
 ample reward. The book is elegantly got up, and, notwithstanding
 the early clerical error (p. iv) of " then
                                                  " for " than,"  is,  we
 think, printed with extreme accuracy.

ON THE    REFLEXION      OF RAYS OF  ELECTRICAL FORCE FROM PLATES
    OF METAL AND OF SULPHUR.          BY PROF. KLEMENCIC, IN GRATZ.
'TVHE author lias undertaken to investigate the reflexion of the
       rays of electrical force at a dielectric plate of sulphur and at a
zinc plate, both qualitatively and quantitatively ; and to compare
also in this respect the behaviour of these rays with those of light.
    In investigating the rays, he used secondary inductors with
interposed thermopile, as has been already described in a previous
paper (Phil. Mag. vol. xxx. p. 284). Two inductors were used this
time — the one as a standard, the other as the proper movable
secondary inductor.
    The reflexion took place against a sulphur plate, the dimen
sions of which were 120 centim. by 80 by 7, and which was
luade up of twelve bricks ; the dimensions of the zinc plate were
the same except in the matter of thickness, which was far less.
In addition to this, the author investigated the portion of the
rays transmitted by the plates.       The experiments on the reflexion
of metals were completed by observations on a wire grating, and
on a round zinc plate. The dimensions of the reflecting-plate and
of the mirror permitted the investigation only of the incident
angles 30° and 65°.
    Between the reflexion at the zinc plate and that of the sulphur
plate, it has been found that there was a difference, which qualita
tively corresponds to the deportment of the rays of light.           The
intensity of the reflexion is different according to the direction of
vibration of the rays. With the sulphur plate there is a powerful
reflexion under all angles of incidence, if the vibrations are at
right angles to the plane of incidence. It is otherwise with rays
in which the vibrations are parallel to the plane of incidence. In
this case a faint reflexion is found only with small angles of inci
dence ; the intensity of the same increases with increasing angle
of incidence ; and at 60° to 65° no perceptible reflexion could be
established with the methods here employed. This fact agrees
 very well with the optical relations, in so far that from the refrac
 tive indices of sulphur there is, in fact, a polarizing angle of
between 60° and 65°.        As regards the question of the direction of
vibration in polarized light, the conclusions which result from these
 experiments are the same as those found by Troughton (' Nature,'
 xxxix. p. 391).    It was further observed that the intensity of the
 ray transmitted by the sulphur plate was the opposite of that of
reflexion.
    Although for individual angles of incidence the results obtained
 by calculations with Fresnel's formula for intensity are in good
agreement, yet, in general, this does not hold. Some remarkable
phenomena occur which do not harmonize with the behaviour of

rays of light, which have probably their origin in the fact that the
dimensions of the reflecting ray are too small in comparison with
the wave-length of the ray. — Wiener Berichte, 1'eb. 19, 1891 .
  ON THE OPTICAL         PROPERTIKS    OF a-MONOBROMONAPHTHALINE.
                               BY   B. WALTER.
    It  frequently     occurs in researches on fluorescence, phosphor-
ence, &c., that the      well-known powerfully dispersive media prisms
of flint glass and of carbon bisulphide cannot be used, because they
completely extinguish the ultra-violet portion of the spectrum.               It
is therefore of interest to direct attention to the remarkable pro
perty of a-monobromonaphthaline, which, in addition to its great
dispersive power, has also a remarkably complete transparency for
ultra-violet rays. For instance,        I  caused the spectrum produced by
a hollow prism filled with this material to fall on a trough con
                                         I
taining solution of sesculine, and could observe the solar spectrum
in the ultra-violet beyond N. That the absorption which occurred
from this point was not caused by the monobromonaphthaline, but
by the various glasses which         I had to use, follows from the fact
that the spectrum was the same whether              I allowed the rays to pass
near the base or near the apex of the prism.                    By comparing
 photographs of diffraction-spectra            with those of monobromo
naphthaline,     I am convinced that the absorption of ordinary crown
glass    extends  just into those regions.
    If, in addition to these properties of great dispersion and trans-
 missibility for ultra-violet, we remember that its boiling-point is at
277° C, that it has not the objectionable smell of carbon bisulphide,
 and that its refractive index for each degree Centigrade only
increases by 0'0348 instead of 0-0,80 with carbon bisulphide, we
 shall see that optical science has a very valuable acquisition in this
substance. It is said that it alters somewhat with time ; but this
cannot be very considerable, as the liquid in my possession has
still the same properties without alteration as at first. My deter
minations also of the refractive indices agree very well with the
 individual statements of the older observers (Tock and Pulfrich);
 but they differ from those of Dufet {Journal de Physique [2] iv.
 p. 415, 1885), although both preparations proceed from the same
 source.

 OS   THE LINE SPECTRA OF THE ELEMENTS OF MENDELEJEFF's
       SECOND GROUP.         BY PROF. KAYSER AND PROF. RUNGE.
    After we had examined the spectra of the elements of Men-
 delejeff s first group, and had found that they were built up entirely
 in accordance with law, we passed to the elements of the second
 s^-oup,   with the exclusion of beryllium.          Here also we have
 succeeded in finding an entirely homologous structure of the
 spectra; while for the alkalies, pairs of lines were characteristic
 which either showed variable difference of vibration (principal series)
 or constant difference of vibration (secondary series), the elements
 of the second group are characterized by triplets of lines.          Each
 element has constant differences of vibration v, and v both be
 tween the first and second and second and third line of all triplets.
 Of the triplets of each element, one portion is stronger and less
 sharp ; they form a series of triplets the lines of which can be
 represented with great accuracy by the equation which we used with
  the alkalies,
                            A-i-A-B-'-C-*.
 We call those the first secondary series.         The other triplets are
 fainter, but sharper, broadened only on the side of the longer
 waves.    They also form a series, our second secondary series.       For
 Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg, we have found the first and second series, for
 Sn only the first, while for Ba we have not been able to find any
 series.
    According to their spectra the elements fall into two divisions —
Mg, Ca, Sr, and Zn, Cd, Hg ; the latter three more especially pre
sent various common phenomena on which this is not the place to
e'uter.   In each division, with increase of atomic weight the series
move towards the side of the longer waves, as is also the case with
the alkalies.     In this, however, the second division is displaced to
 wards the   side  of the shorter waves.
    While all lines of the spectrum were taken up by the series in
the case of the alkalies, in the present case this is not so ; about
 half the lines observed are superfluous in each spectrum.           For a
number of them we have also found regularities, since they form
either pairs with definite distances or triplets ; in any case the number
of lines which are apparently distributed over the spectrum without
any regularity is a tolerably large one.
    The regular displacement of a spectrum from one element to
.-mother finds a natural expression in a regular variation of the
constants of our formula. — Berliner Berichte, Feb. 19, 1891.

XL1V. On the Mutual Solubility of Salts in Water.— Part I.
    By W. W. J. Nicol, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.E., F.I.C.,
    Lecturer  on Chemistry,    Mason College, Birmingham*.
                             [Plate VIII.]
       has long been well known that certain salts exercise a
IT     marked influence on the solubility of others, when the
two are simultaneously dissolved in water to saturation. In
some cases the amount dissolved of both salts is greatly in
creased, in others as markedly diminished , while in other
instances one of the salts has its solubility greatly affected
while that of the other is either unaltered or changed in the
opposite direction.       The whole of these phenomena may be
                                                 " The Mutual Solu
conveniently grouped under the heading,
bility of Salts," which forms the title of this communication ;
but it is obvious that some limitation must be made, otherwise
it would include cases where chemical decomposition might
take place attended by precipitation.             Though these are
clearly inadmissible, there are other instances which would at
 first sight appear to come under the title, but will on reflection
be found to be similar to the above.         Thus all cases where re
arrangement     of  the  constituents  of  the salts is possible must
be at present excluded ; for our knowledge of the nature of
solution does not enable us to say what happens when two
salts MR and M'R' are simultaneously dissolved in water : we
 do know that the solution is identical with that formed by
                   *  Communicated   by the Author.

 370            Dr. W. W.     J.   Nicol on   the  Mutual
 dissolving M'R and MR', but we cannot tell which pair of the
 four possible salts is present, nor indeed can we decide
 definitely that all four salts are not formed in the solution.
 Again, cases where the salt expelled from solution by the
 addition of another salt is a well-defined double salt must also
 be excluded : for example,          the separation of alum from a
 solution of aluminium sulphate by the addition of potassium
 sulphate ; for here we no longer have to deal with only two
 salts but with three, the third being formed by the union of
 the original pair, but whether this union has taken place in
 the solution or only at the moment of separation we cannot
 tell. This objection also holds good with regard to the well-
 defined double salts which are more soluble than one or both
 of their constituents, such as HgCl22NH4Cl ; here too there
 may be three salts present in the solution. In all these
 instances, in addition to the objections already stated, there is
 the further fatal one, that the composition of the resulting
 solution is dependent on the mass of the undissolved salt.
    The subject is therefore restricted to the case of isomorphous
 salts which crystallize together in any proportion, and to
 those salts which, though not isomorphous, do not form double
salts.           I
         As yet have examined the behaviour only of those
salts which do not form mixed crystals.
    Very numerous and careful experiments have already been
made on this subject from one standpoint.               Kopp, Karsten,
 Mulder, and RiidorfF have determined the amount dissolved of
each member of a pair of salts when water is treated with
excess of both salts simultaneously.              The work of Kopp*,
who, so far as    I  am aware, was the first systematic investi
gator in this branch of solution, for we may pass over the few
experiments of Vauquelinf, led him to two main conclusions
as to the behaviour of salts, when simultaneously dissolved
in water to saturation. Kopp found that the salts examined
by him fell into one or other of the following classes : —
    1. Salts with the same metal but with different acid radicals. —
In this case neither of the salts ever retains the same solubility
as in pure water, each salt affects the solubility of the other ;
as a rule the amount dissolved of one of the salts is increased,
while that of the other is diminished.
    2. Two salts      different metals but the same acid radical.
                                                                    —
" Here the ruleofholds       that, provided there is no       chemical
action of the salts on one another, the salt with the stronger
base retains its own special solubility, exactly as if the other

were not present, and this last dissolves in the solution of the
first in proportions which cannot be determined & priori.”
    Kopp found some exceptions to this rule, but believed that
in these cases double salts were formed which were capable
of existence only in solution, being decomposed on removal
of the solvent; and pointed out that in this respect as in many
others sodium behaves quite differently from potassium.

 372                Dr. W. W.   J. Nicol on  the Mutual
 which is of the greatest possible interest and importance.        In
it he not only gives the results and conclusions from his own
 experiments, but has incorporated the work of all previous
 experimenters. He worked with a very large number of salts,
 his experimental skill and accuracy are of the highest order,
 and, as a rule, his results are completely to be depended on,
 not by any means a common thing in researches on solution.
 I  need not therefore apologize for devoting some considerable
 space to an examination of his results.
     Mulder states, as the results of his experiments, that he
 knows of no better classification of salts, so far as their
 mutual solubility is concerned, than into the three following
 divisions : —
      (1) Salts the amounts of which in a saturated solution are
           dependent entirely on the nature of the solid salts.
     (2)   Salts  the saturated solutions of which are dependent on
           the affinity of the respective salts for water.
     (3) Salts which resemble those in both of the foregoing
            classes, and consequently behave now in one way and
            now in another according to the amount of either salt
            present.
      (1) Solutions of salts belonging to this class contain, when
  saturated, according to Mulder, the constituent salts in simple
  equivalent proportions, and the saturated solution has the
  same composition whether it is prepared by adding salt A to
  a saturated solution of B, or vice verm, or by adding both salts
  in excess to water.
      (2) This second class of salts is divided into two sub
  classes   : —
      (a)  The solubility is dependent on that of one of the salts.
      In this    case we have to deal, according to Mulder, with
  double salts in solution, one of the constituents of which be
  haves as if it were the only salt present, dissolving in the
  water as if it were alone and yet permitting of the solution of
  a quantity of the other salt, with the result that the salts are
  present in a simple molecular proportion.
       (b) The solubility is dependent on that of both salts.
      We have here the remarkable fact that in a saturated
  solution of one salt another may be dissolved, and that to the
   same extent as in pure water, while the solubility of the first
   salt also remains unaffected.       In this case also the salts are
   present    in simple  molecular  proportions.
      Mulder lays great stress on the existence of this simple
   molecular relation between the salts present in a saturated
   solution, and sees in it clear proof of the existence of double
1
   salts in solution and of the chemical nature of solution in

                     Solubility of Salts in Water.              373
general.     He has not, however,         succeeded in obtaining a
single one of these double salts in the solid form and in
definite crystals ; and it will be found, on comparing his results
with those of Riidorff, that the difference of a few degrees in
the temperature of experiment is sufficient to effect a radical
change in the proportions of the two salts, an effect which is
extremely improbable if such double salts really existed in
solution. Mulder's double salts, in all probability, owe their
supposed existence to the arithmetical possibility of fitting any
experimental ratio very closely by ratios such as 1:2, 2:3,
3:4, 4:5, &c.
    Riidorff*, the latest experimenter on the mutual solubility
of salts when dissolved to saturation, has performed an im
mense number of very careful and exhaustive experiments not
only with salts between which chemical action is impossible,
but also with those where double decomposition may take
place.    We are hero concerned only with the former. He
found that these divide themselves into two groups. With
some salt mixtures, as for instance nitrate and chloride of
ammonium, we obtain always one and the same saturated
solution, if only an excess of both salts be employed, no matter
in what relative proportions the excess of both salts is brought
 in contact with the water. With other salts, however, such
 as ammonium and potassium nitrates, the composition of the
 resulting solution is dependent on the proportions in which
 the two salts are presented to the water, which is insufficient
 to completely dissolve either of them.         An excess of the one
 drives out a definite amount of the other salt, so that it is not
 possible with these salts to prepare a saturated solution on
 which one or other of the salts is without action.
     In his later paper on the same subject, he extends his
experiments to many other pairs of salts, with the general
result that, so far as we are here concerned, it is only those
salts which are not isomorphous nor form double salts, nor form
 mixed crystals, that are capable of forming definite saturated
 solutions — -solutions, the composition of which is unaffected
 by the addition of either of the salts in the solid state. A
 fuller account of Riidorff's later work has already been given
by me in a paper on the
                               " Saturation of Salt Solutions."
    The work of the other experimenters on this subject does
 not call for any special comment, as the greater part of it refers
 to individual cases, and is not sufficiently extended either in
 its aim or execution to allow of any generalization being made
from it.

374              Dr. W. W.   J.  Nicol on  the Mutual
mentioned     .above in their endeavour to ascertain the laws of
mutual solubility of salts, it does not seem to have occurred to
any one that only one, and that the least promising side of the
question, had been attacked.        With the exception of a few
incidental experiments of Riidorff, the attention of chemists
has always been directed to the saturated solutions of both
 salts ; no one has realized the importance of experiments on
the solubility of a salt in a non-saturated solution of another ;
 and yet a moment's thought will suffice to convince one that
 it is in this way, and in this way only, that the problem of
 mutual solubility can be solved.         The influence of a salt on
 the solubility of another cannot possibly be studied, if only
 one determination be made of the condition of equilibrium in
 the system of two salts and water.       No matter how frequently
 or how accurately this one determination is made, it will
 throw no light on the question under examination. Several
 years ago, soon after the publication of my previous paper on
 the subject,    I was struck with the futility of the methods
 hitherto adopted, and commenced a series of experiments on
 an entirely fresh field of investigation ; the progress of this
  work has been reported on from time to time to the British
  Association for the Advancement of Science by the Committee
  " On the Nature of
                         Solution," of which    I have the honour to
 be Secretary.
     The work had for its object the determination of the
  solubility of one member of a pair of salts in solutions of
  various strengths of the other member, and vice versd. In
 this way it was hoped that the series of experiments on solu
 tions of gradually increasing strengths would throw light on
  the action of the one salt on the solubility of the other, and
  thus lead to a full knowledge of the condition of equilibrium in
  the saturated solution of both salts.        How far this hope has
  been fulfilled will be seen below.
     The course of experiment was as follows : —
     A salt was taken, and solutions containing 1, 2, &c. gramme-
  molecules of this salt in 100 gramme-molecules of water were
  prepared.     These solutions were then saturated at a definite
  temperature with the other salt added in excess, and the tofail
  salt in solution determined ; precisely similar determinations
  were made with definite molecular solutions of the other salt.
  The solubility of each salt separately in water at that tempe
  rature was then determined, and, finally, the solubility of both
  salts when simultaneously added in excess to water was also
  ascertained.
     The first difficulty met with was that of ensuring saturation;

that the water present should not be lost by evaporation,
otherwise the composition of the solvent solution would be
altered.    The thoroughly efficient method of mixture, by
blowing    air through the solution, previously employed by me,
could not therefore be applied. Recourse was therefore had at
first to what may be termed saturation by gravitation. Tubes of
the form shown in fig. 1, PI. VIII., were made, and were used
in the following manner. The bend a of the capillary-tube was
filled with mercury.     The solvent solution was poured in till
it just covered the surface of the platinum gauze b. The salt,
previously fused and cast into thin sticks, was then placed on
the gauze and the open end of the tube closed with a cork.
The whole was then placed in a wide test-tube, which was also
corked and placed up to the mouth in the water of a bath, kept
at the constant temperature of 20° C. by the method previously
described by me.      After the lapse of twenty-four hours the
saturation-tube was quickly withdrawn.           The mercury was
expelled by blowing into the open end ; and in the same way
a portion of the saturated solution was transferred to a weighed
nickel crucible, and the amount of salt dissolved was deter
mined in the usual way.
    The above method yielded excellent results, but was some
what troublesome, and was after a time discarded for one
which did not require fusion of the salts employed.             In a
constant-temperature     bath  similar   to the   previous  one  was
placed   a  copper water-wheel,     to  the   axle  of  which   were
attached clips to receive the saturation-tubes.      The wheel was
caused to revolve by means of a current of air entering at the
bottom of the bath below the inverted buckets of the wheel.
The revolution of the wheel caused such a circulation of the
water in the bath, that the temperature at all parts was the
same, and never varied more than + 0o,02 C. from 20° C.
The wheel revolved, on an average, 18 times a minute, or
 1000 revolutions per hour ; and as saturation extended over
a period of 20 to 24 hours, the salt and solvent solution con
tained in the saturation-tubes attached to the axle of the wheel
 were shaken together 20,000 to 24,000 times.            The solvent
 solution and the salt in excess were placed in narrow test-
 tubes closed with rubber stoppers, and enclosed in wider tubes,
 also closed, and placed in the clips on the axle.       After satu
 ration had gone on for the required time, the tubes were
 removed from the wheel and placed in an upright position in
 the bath, and, when the excess of salt had settled down,
 leaving the solution perfectly bright and clear, a portion was
 quickly decanted into nickel crucibles and estimated in the
 usual way. In every case two or more determinations were made.

376             Dr. W. W.    J. Nicol on  the Mutual
    The salts hitherto examined are not very numerous, but are
typical examples of two important classes, the chlorides and
nitrates. Indeed, it was found that only a limited number of
salts were available for this form of experiment, inasmuch as
all hydrated salts are unsuited, for the following reason. If a
hydrated salt be added to a solvent solution of a definite
strength, the quantity of water present is increased by the
amount present in the quantity of the hydrated salt that is
dissolved.    What part this water plays is still a moot point.
Does it remain attached to the salt, or does it become part of
the solvent?      Until this question is settled, experiments with
such salts only complicate a problem already sufficiently dif
ficult.    Nor can this complication be avoided by dehydrating
the salt before adding it to the solvent solution ; no water
is indeed added to the solution, but the other objection men
tioned above still remains ; and we are met with a still
 greater difficulty in addition — the excess of dehydrated salt
 that is perforce added removes an unknown quantity of
 water from the solution, and the composition of the solvent
 solution is altered.    Such an alteration is not of course fatal,
 but necessitates separate determinations of the amount of the
 salts present, involving an amount of labour which it would
 be foolish to undertake until it is seen from experiments with
 anhydrous salts that the method of investigation is likely to
 yield valuable results.
    The salts examined were the chlorides of potassium and
 sodium and the nitrates of the same two metals.         These salts
 present special advantages for this and all other solution expe
 riments. They can be easily obtained pure.         They crystallize
 from solution in the anhydrous state, and are not known to
 form hydrates except at low temperatures.             The physical
 properties of their solutions have been more fully studied than
 those of any other salts.     Their solubility presents no abnor
 malities on rise of temperature.    They differ greatly in amount
  of their solubility at the ordinary temperature, and still more
 markedly in the effect of temperature on the amount dissolved.
  Above all, they are all sufficiently soluble in water at 20° C.
  to render any small experimental error of little consequence.
     These four salts were arranged, for the purposes of expe
  riment, in two series of four pairs, the two series being
  complimentary the one to the other.

      In view of the close concordance of my present determina
 tions and the long time allowed for saturation, along with the
 fairly close agreement with those of Mulder and Gay-Lussac,
  I  feel justified in adopting my present mean as the true state
 ment of the solubility of these four salts.
      The solubility of the salts in pairs was then determined,
  with the precaution of adding excess of salt A to one and
 excess of salt B to the other of the duplicate experiments.
 The results are given in Table III., along with those previously
 obtained by me and those of Riidorff.

    I shall  have to return to this question later ; so any discus
sion of the general accuracy of the above results will be best
deferred till then.          With regard to the composition of the
total quantity of mixed salts in the saturated solution little
 need be said here.         At first attempts were made to determine
 the ratio of the two metals in the case of the mixed chlorides and
mixed nitrates by estimating the total chlorine and conversion
into sulphate respectively ; but the atomic weights of the two
metals sodium and potassium differ by so sm.ill an amount,
that all such indirect methods of analysis yield, of necessity,
but approximate results on which no great reliance can be
placed.     In the case of the other pairs of salts the determina
tion of the chlorine gives a direct method by which the ratios
of the two salts can be ascertained, and one which can be
trusted ; but there is a still better method applicable to all
four pairs of salts, which will be described further on.
   The remainder of the research was conducted as follows : —
    Solutions of the second salt in each of the eight pairs given
on page 376 were prepared by weighing definite amounts of
water (about 50 cub. cent.) to the nearest half milligramme,
and adding to these the reqiusite quantity of the salt to form
a solution of a definite molecular composition (n molecules
of salt to 100 molecules of water).                  The salts used were
carefully purified, the potassium and sodium chlorides by pre
cipitation with hydrochloric-acid gas from solutions of the
commercially pure salt, which had been previously treated
with ferric chloride, followed by precipitation of the iron and
other heavy metals that might be present by the pure car
bonate of the metal.          The salt thus precipitated with hydro
chloric acid was thoroughly drained, washed repeatedly with
pure hydrochloric acid, and finally dried by heating to 200° C.
tor several days.          In some cases the salt was fused in a
platinum dish at the lowest possible temperature, and in no
case did the salt possess the slightest acid reaction.                       The

                        Solubility of Salts in Water.                 379
nitrates were purified in various ways ; the commercially pure
salt was precipitated by alcohol, or by pure nitric acid ; in
other cases subjected to repeated crystallization, and dried as
above or fused.     Too much care cannot be taken to ensure the
use of pure salts in all saturation experiments ; for while a
trace of impurity may not make its presence felt in other
solution experiments, it is sure to vitiate the results of satu
ration, inasmuch as in these cases there is always present a
considerable    amount of undissolved salt ; and out of this the
whole of the impurity is dissolved, thus raising unduly the
percentage of salt dissolved.    In this is to be found the expla
nation of the serious differences so often to be observed in all
saturation experiments.
    The salt solutions (solvent solutions) having been thus pre
pared, they were in several instiinces analysed by evaporation,
in order to ascertain whether the method of preparation was
sufficiently accurate for the purpose in view. The results are
given in Table IV.

   These   determinations showed that this direct method of
preparing the solutions was all that could be desired, as an
error of 0"02, or one in 5000, is much less than that met with
in even the most careful saturation experiments.
    The solvent solutions were then saturated with the other
salts, and the results with the eight pairs of salts are given
in the following Tables V.-VIII. The Tables are arranged
 in the order already given, and each consist of two parts cor
 responding to the two series. The arrangement in each table
 is the same.   In the first column is given the number of mole
 cules of the second salt per 100 molecules of water, in the
 second the amount of salt per 100 parts of water that the above
 corresponds to ; in the third column the salt actually found
  (M.S. mixed salt) per 100 of water ; in the fourth the mean
 of the experimental results ; and in the fifth the difference
 between the fourth and second columns, that              is,

dissolved   of the first salt. The last column gives the molecules
of the first salt present per 100 molecules of water.                 The
molecular weights used throughout are            : —
     NaCl=58-5, KCl=74-6, NaN03=85, KNO3=101-l.
With regard to the accuracy of these determinations one or
two words only need be said.               In the 27 duplicate experi
ments the sum of the differences between each pair amounts
to 3'057 parts of salt in the 100 parts of water, giving a
mean error of 0'113 ; but of the whole 27 only four much
exceed this mean error, leaving 23 experiments with a total
error of 1*359, and a mean error of 0*059, or + 0*03 from the
mean.      And it must not be forgotten that the results are
parts per 100 of water and not percentages, and the error
thus appears twice as great as it would have been had the
other mode of calculation been employed.
    The next point to be considered is the ratio of the two salts
in the saturated solutions formed when water is treated with
excess of both salts.      This problem may now be attacked from
two sides.
    (1) That of direct experiment, and better even, since that
is beset with difficulties, (2) that of indirect experiment, for
it is evident that if the data derived from any pair of salts in
the duplicate experiments be plotted the curves thus obtained
 will, if prolonged, intersect at the saturation-point of the salts
 when each is present in excess.             The saturation-point thus
 obtained indirectly will depend not on one or two experiments

                       Solubility of Salts in Water.                      383
 but on all the duplicate experiments in each series, and will,
if it agrees with that obtained directly, be proof not only of
the correctness of the latter, but also of the accuracy of the
data from which it was itself derived.                 To plot* the results,
however,     on    such    a   scale   as  to   give  the  second place of
decimals, is not so convenient as to find formula that will
approximately represent the experimental results.                   The fol
lowing satisfy this condition.             M.S. = Total salt dissolved.

   The saturated solution, when both salts are added in excess
to water, was found to contain 44-70 parts of mixed salts to
100 parts of water. If this be the true solubility of the salts,
and the formulae given on p. 383 be correct, then
             44-70 = 34°52 + n 0.5707-H n°0'0545
and

   The equations worked out give

an error of –0.17 part per 100 of water, showing the
correctness of both the formulae and the direct determination.
   From the above calculation we find that the 447 parts of
mixed salts contain 14:075 parts of KCl and 30.625 parts of
NaCl; or, in molecules per 100 H,0, 3.396 KCl and 9:423

   The saturated solution formed when both salts are added in
excess to water was found to contain 51:87 parts of mixed
salts to 100 parts of water.     If this be the true solubility, and
the formulae be correct, then
         51.87 = 34.52+n 5:26,

      The saturated    solution formed when both salts were added
in excess to water was found to contain 78 89 parts of mixed
 salts to 100 parts of water.      If this be the true solubility, and
 the formulaj be correct, then

 The former equation gives the molecules of NaCl, the latter
 those of NaN03 present in the saturated solution.

 Organic Compounds &c., published in 1888 (Chem. Soc. Journ.
Trans. 1888, pp. 782–802).      Their results are by no means
concordant, owing no doubt to the method of conducting
the experiments, for which reference must be made to the
original paper. The general form of the curves representing
their results is the same as that given by my experiments, as
will be seen by reference to fig. 4, Plate            in which          VIII.,               I

     HOUGH       the fact that water has not a regular dilatation,
        but reaches a maximum density at about 4°C., has been
universally known for a very long time, apparently no expla
nation has yet been offered of this seeming anomaly,                  is
of such vast importance in nature. The object of this paper
is to bring forward a few experiments which afford an inter
pretation of the fact.                                              *
   If the fact of the irregular dilatation of water be carefully
considered, it will be seen that the only possible explanation
of it is that some change in the position of the water molecules
towards each other takes place at about 4°C., whereby such
a considerable variation in the density is caused.         It there                   is,
fore, probable that        this temperature some thermal change
                              at

  well covered up, and the temperature was found to remain
  constant throughout the experiment. The thermometer used
  was a standard one, graduated in tenths of a degree; and as
  all readings were taken with a cathetometer, it was read
  to the hundredth of a degree.        The water was then warmed
  to about 30°C., and readings taken of the thermometer at
  intervals of a minute, till it had cooled to about —3°C., when

  given up to 16°C., as above this it is quite regular.             From
  about 14°C. the    cooling     begins    to take    place slightly  less
  rapidly than would be the case if no internal thermal change
  were taking place, and continues getting less and less rapid
  till from about 5°5 C. to 4°.7 C, it almost stops. At 4.7°C.
  it suddenly begins to sink rapidly again till about 3°C. After
  this point the curve becomes regular again. The part of the
  curve from 30°C., if produced on the supposition that the
  curve is regular, gives the dotted-line curve in the figure.

Kopp, and at 4°0 by Despretz; but here the maximum point
of the irregularity in the curve is at 4°7 C. There can be
no doubt that such is the case, as several separate cooling
  determinations gave this temperature as the maximum, it
  being also corrected for the thermometer, which gave the
 freezing-point of water as +:08°C.            Also the rate of cooling

seems to be greatest at about 4° C, though it is only very
slightly marked.
    The space between the two curves is a measure of the heat
evolved in the cooling of the water.        By calculating its area,
and also the area of the figure abed, it was found that the
specific heat of water is increased, on an average, from 12° C.
to 0° C. by about 3 per cent.          Only a very rough estimate
can be arrived at in this way, as it is not possible to calculate
the position of the dotted-line curve with any exactness.            It
is enough, however, to show that there is a material increase
in the specific heat of water at temperatures near to that
of its maximum density.
    We have now to see to what extent the results obtained
by cooling correspond with the variations in the dilatation
of water.      The density determinations of Rosetti (Ann. Chim.
Phys. (4)     x. p. 47), plotted out as a curve, show that down
to about 16° C. the density increases regularly with decrease
of temperature.        From this point downwards the rate of
increase of density begins to gradually get smaller, it getting
less and less till at 4o-07 C. it stops.           From this point
the density begins to gradually decrease.                  If
                                                           the dilata
tion were regular, the density of water at 4° C. would
be much greater than is actually the case ; that       it is,
                                                           the density
of water in the state of molecular aggregation            exists in at
4° C.  is   considerably less than  it   would be     ifthe dilatation
were regular, and no molecular change took place.                 This
fact serves to explain why water below 4° C. begins to
decrease in density.
    The change in the density of water, which, as has been
 shown,     isattended     by an evolution  of  heat, can only be
due to water molecules aggregating together, and forming
 more complex molecules than before existed.           As, therefore,
 from 14° 0. downwards the aggregated molecules are being
 formed in larger and larger quantities, whilst fewer and
 fewer of the unaggregated molecules are left, the lesser
 density of the aggregated molecules             at last at 4° C.
 counteracts the greater density of the unaggregated mole
 cules;    and from this temperature downwards, when fewer
 still of the unaggregated molecules remain, the density of the
 water begins to decrease instead of increase. We do not know
 at what temperature        the maximum number of aggregated
 molecules       formed
                 is    ;   but the curve for cooling appears to have
a  slight maximum at about 4° C. So        it may     be
                                                       taken that the
 density   of water   begins   to decrease when    about   half of the
 molecules     present have undergone aggregation.              It not
                                                                     is
 necessary, however, that the maximum of the irregularity in

the curve for cooling should correspond with the temperature
of maximum density of water.
   We see then that, allowing for the effect of temperature,
ordinnry molecules of water have the greatest density, aggre
gated molecules have a lesser density, and ice, which must
contain molecules in a still greater state of aggregation, has
the least density.
   Raoult, from his experiments on the molecular lowering of
freezing-points {Ann. Cliim. Phys. (6)       66), concluded that

constituted hydrides of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium are
gaseous, it   is probable that when water-vapour condenses
it undergoes molecular aggregation.      Water molecules from
100° C. to about 4° C. will probably, therefore, have the
formula (H20)2    and below 4° C. these will condense to (H20)4

be considered   merely as molecular compounds, or, what                       is
really more simple, as atomic compounds linked thus —                    :

   We must now examine whether the evolution of heat

the increased specific heat of water at this temperature, shows
itself in the determinations of observers on the latent heat of
fusion of ice and the specific heat of water. Regnault has
determined the specific heat of water from 0°-40° C, 0°-80° C,
0°-120° C, &c but not for smaller temperature-intervals than

that the specific heat of water for the interval 0°-40° C.                    is
appreciably greater than we should be led to suppose from
the specific heats at higher temperatures.
   A. W. Velten (Annalen, 1884, p. 61) has made two series
 of determinations of the specific heat of water.          By the
method     of mixing,  the  specific heat was   determined  for dif
ferent intervals from 4°-7 0. to 100° C.          For the interval

4°7–42°9 C. the specific heat was found to be '9943; for the
interval 7°38–41*1 C. it was 98.63: again, for the interval
8°24-93°6 C. it was 98.73, and for the interval 11°78–93°0 C.
it   was '9837.     Several other determinations showed that for
temperatures     near to 4°C. the specific heat was greater than
the normal.       By means of the ice-calorimeter the specific heat
was determined for various intervals from 0°C. to 100° C.
These results show that the specific heat is about 3 per cent.
greater from 0°–7°31 C. than from 7°31–10°81 C., and at
higher temperatures.         There seemed also to be another slight
increase in the     specific  heat at about 18°C.; but the mixing
experiments, in which it is possible to attain greater accuracy,
do not show this, so it is probably not the case.             If it were
so, the curves for the cooling of water would also show an
irregularity; they were, however, quite regular at this point.
   As the latent heat of fusion of ice is determined by mixing
it with water of known temperature, an appreciable difference
should be observed in the values obtained, according as the
temperature of the mixture is near 4°C. or considerably re

XLVI.    On some Effects of small Quantities of Foreign Matter on
   Crystallization.    By Charles Tomlinson, F.R.S., F. C.S.*
I    WAS    interested in reading an account of a lecture by
      Professor Judd, delivered at the Koyal Institution on
January 30 last, on some phenomena of crystallization.            I
was present at the same Institution on one of the Friday
evenings upwards of forty years ago, when Professor Faraday
performed an experiment which greatly impressed me. He
poured water into a test-tube, and added to it an intense
colouring-matter, such as sulphate of indigo, and then placed
the tube in a freezing-mixture : the water in freezing drove
the whole of the colouring-matter into the axis of the tube,
so that it could be poured away, and, the cavity being rinsed
out, a plug of pure transparent ice, entirely free from colour
ing-matter, was withdrawn.        A similar experiment was tried
with the addition of sulphuric acid to the water, and in a
third experiment of ammonia ; and in these cases also, the
water in freezing expelled both the acid and the alkali, so
that the ice in each case on being melted could be tested for
either with negative results.      In order to free the resulting
ice from air particles, the contents of the tube were gently
stirred with a feather, and reference was made to the rapidity
with which melting ice reabsorbs air, a useful provision in
the case of aquatic plants and animals, as was recently pointed
out, when referring to the necessity of breaking the ice in
fish-ponds.
   A few years later, it was noticed that a large block of
Wenham Lake ice, when illuminated by the electric light,
presented a banded       structure, which Faraday explained
with reference to the experiments above noticed.          Suppose
the first layer of water in a still lake to freeze, it would reject
any saline or other foreign matter into the layer of water
below, and should the temperature continue to fall, the second
layer would be unable to reject the particles derived from the
first in addition to its own, and so this double set of particles
becoming entangled in the ice, would so far alter its structure
that it may be called amorphous, while the first layer would be
crystalline. As the freezing proceeded, the third layer would
be in an analogous position to the first, and the fourth layer
would be in a similar condition to the second.         In this way
we might have alternate bands of crystalline and amorphous
ice to a considerable depth.

substances, and may therefore allow their crystallizing
tendency to gain ground and develope itself, particularly
where the crystal once formed is completely insoluble, as
with quartz.” Prof. Graham found that a liquid silicic acid
of 10 or 12 per cent. coagulates or pectizes spontaneously in
three hours at the ordinary temperature, and immediately
when heated.        A liquid of 5 per cent. may be preserved for
five or six    days;    a liquid of 2 per cent. for two or three
months; and a liquid of 1 per cent. had not pectized after two
years. Dilute solutions of 0.1 per cent. or less are probably
unalterable by time, and hence the possibility of soluble silicic
acid existing in nature.         It was not found that any solution,
 weak or   strong,  of silicic acid in water showed any disposition
 to deposit crystals; but it always appeared on drying as a
 colloidal glassy hyalite.
    In connexion with this subject, we may refer to Professor
 Bischoff in his Chemical and Physical Geology (Cavendish
 Society).    He states that crystals of gypsum, thirteen lines in
 diameter, have been formed within four or six years on the
 thorn walls of salt-works, from drops of brine containing
 sulphate of lime. Gypsum dissolves in 460 parts of water;
 the water of some springs contains 1-10,000th of silica, so
 that this solution is about twenty-two times more dilute than
 the former.      Supposing a crystal of quartz, one inch in
 diameter, to form under circumstances similar to those that
 produce a gypsum crystal of the same dimensions, rather
 more than a century would be required ; the water perco
 lating through the thorn faggots, and depositing nothing but
 silica, would in that time form a crystal of quartz consisting
 of 4,766,652 concentric layers of silica, each about one
 millionth of a line in thickness; but as the water of springs
 usually contains much less than 1-10,000th of silica, the
 time would probably have to be doubled, or even further
 increased ; but such periods are by no means remarkable in
 geological phenomena.
     In the early proceedings of the Geological Society, Mr.
  Bowerbank described some moss agates from Oberstein, con
  taining remains of sponges.         In 1848 Mr. Hamilton stated
  that the real agates of Oberstein are found in igneous rocks,
  so that they could not contain the remains of organic bodies.
  Whereupon Mr. Bowerbank produced sections of moss-agates,
  and placed them under a powerful microscope, when Mr.
  Hamilton admitted that they certainly did contain remains of
  spongeous structure", but how far they are really found at
    * The chalk flints best known to me are those found near Salisbury,
  and they commonly have a spongeous nucleus.

396         Mr. C. Tonilinson on   some Effects of small
Oberstein, or merely brought there to be cut and polished, ia
another question.     It subsequently became known that large
numbers of these agates were imported from Brazil and other
places.
   The effect of small portions of foreign matter in modifying
the structure and physical properties of siliceous minerals is
a difficult subject, and often one of no little embarrassment to
the mineralogist.     In agate, for example, there may be 98
per cent, of silica, and minute portions of iron, in zigzag lines,
as in the variety known as fortification         agate ; in other
specimens,    in various  forms  of  animals   and  plants.   These
lines  seem   to be  the  edges of successive layers    of  material
during the process of formation.      Advantage has been taken
of these lines to stimulate the artist to complete some of them
into the forms of natural objects, forming what the French
call agates zoomorphytes.     These curiosities were in demand
among the ancients.        Thus Pliny (Lib. 37, Cap. 75, &c.)
refers to three methods of manufacture, and describes an
agate, the natural markings of which represent Apollo and
the Nine Muses.      In the British Museum there is a globular
or Egyptian Jasper, which exhibits in the two fractured sur
faces a likeness of the poet Chaucer.      There is no reason to
suppose that this has been doctored, but of course there is a
strong temptation to fabricate these trifles, since they fetch a
high price. Brard, in his Mindralogie appliquie aux Arts,
describes how chalcedony may be etched with a metallic
solution, such as blue vitriol in aquafortis, the result on drying
being corroded lines of a brown colour. But he adds that
designs produced in this way have a more finished appearance)
than the natural markings.        Italy still continues to be the
seat of  this manufacture, as it probably was in Pliny's time.
   Various devices are adopted at Oberstein for conferring an
ornamental value on agates and other pebbles, whether native
or imported. In one process the cut stone is covered with a
layer of carbonate of soda, and heated to redness in a muffle.
This produces a white opaque enamel, as hard as the stone
itself, and adapted to cameo cutting.        A similar result was
produced during the great fire at the Tower of London some
years ago, when many of the gun-flints encountered a rain
of fused nitre, and so became encrusted with white enamel.
Advantage is taken of the banded structure of some of the
pebbles to colour the amorphous quartz artificially.            The
pebbles are washed and dried and then placed in an aqueous
solution of honey or of sugar, about half a pound to a pint.
The vessel is then put on a stove, or in hot ashes, and fresh
liquid is supplied from time to time, so as to keep the stones

        Quantities  of Foreign Matter     on  Crystallization.         397
always covered.       In this state they remain for two or three
weeks,   when   they are transferred to a vessel containing com
mercial oil of vitriol, and gently heated.              After some hours
the stones are washed, dried on the stove, and transferred to
the lapidary.      After being cut they are steeped in oil for a
day ; this causes small crevices to disappear, and gives a
better lustre to the stones after polishing with oil and bran.
The action of the sulphuric acid is to fill up the porous bands
with carbon so as to produce greyish-brown or black stripes,
while the non-absorbent bands become opaque white. Onyxes
are prepared from Brazilian pebbles.            A fine citron-yellow,
uniform or in stripes, or in cloudy patches, is given to chal
cedony     by first drying the stones on a stove, and then
immersing them for two or three weeks in hydrochloric acid.
This contains a little iron, which is probably the source of the
colour. A blue colour is produced by steeping the chalcedony
in a solution of protosulphate of iron, and then in one of
prussiate of potash.       Other colours are similarly produced
hy forming precipitates within the stone.                 Even cochineal
will impart its colour to agate. By the action of heat and
various chemicals a great variety of ornamental pebbles are
manufactured, some of which fetch a high price, such as the
milky-white chalcedonies, with dendritic brown and black
figures. Striped stones are converted into sardonyxes, and
stones of one colour contract true carnelian tints.                In some
cases the pebbles are dried on a very hot stove during some
weeks, then wetted with sulphuric acid, and raised to a red
heat in a luted crucible ; they are then allowed to cool slowly,
and the effect of the heat has been to deprive the hydrated
oxide of iron of water, when the oxide combining with the
silica develops the carnelian colour.
    It would be a useful but difficult inquiry to determine the
influence exerted by small quantities of apparently foreign
or accidental impurities in modifying the structure of siliceous
and other minerals.       These presumably accidental ingredients
bear the odd and apparently inappropriate name of Mineral-
izers.   Their effect in producing a molecular change in
structure seems to be undoubted, but the necessity for a
searching inquiry seems to be evident, on account of the con
tradictory statements that are occasionally met with.                  For
example,    the  green  colour  of the  emerald       is said  to be due to
chromium oxide, but Lewy         * attributes   it   to  the  presence of a
minute proportion of an organic hydrocarbon, which is dissi
pated by a strong heat, which would have no effect on chromium
                      * Ann. de Chemie,  1868, t.  liii.

 398         Mr. C. Tomlinson on        some   Effects of small
 oxide.    Badly coloured carnelians are converted by the action
 of heat into a uniform red.
    The influence of small quantities of foreign matter, in
 modifying structure, may also be noticed in some cases of
 saline compounds.         A striking experiment may be shown
 on a large scale with a supersaturated              solution of potash
 alum.    If   a nucleus be added, octohedral crystals slowly
 descend, until the whole of the solution becomes solid.                But
 if to the boiling solution a pinch of carbonate of potash
be added, there is a brisk momentary effervescence on the
surface, and when the solution is cold it will deposit, not
octohedral, but cubic crystals of alum. So also sal-ammoniac
crystals are modified by the presence of small doses of urea or
of boracic acid. Common salt is another case, when under
the influence of a small quantity of corrosive sublimate.
Pasteur's discovery of two unsyinmetrical varieties of tartaric
acid* are also well known, but his curious experiments on
bimalate of ammonia will bear repetition t- This salt crys-

rubbed or    filed down, as   at  a, b, c, fig. 3, and placed in a pure
solution of the salt, the damage becomes restored in a few
hours. But if the solution be contaminated with some of the
products of decomposition of the salt, occasioned by the heat,
not only are the angles restored, but the upper and lower
edges become bevelled, as in fig. 2.             The presence of these
secondary faces seems to be due to impurities in the solution,
and to exert some action on the growth of the crystal in its

    It was supposed that this mode of increase bore relation
                                if
to the variation in form, the double bevelment might be
 excited in the pure solution which does not produce             under    it
 normal conditions, by means of some contrivance which would
 prevent the lateral growth of the crystal, while          encouraged
                                                              it
 the abnormal growth lengthwise.              Accordingly,       single a
 bevelled crystal, fig.      had slips of tin foil or metallic paper
                            1,
 attached to its lateral facets, while its upper and lower bevels
  were rubbed down.       The crystal thus prepared was put into
a    pure solution under conditions like those of the crystal in
  the impure solution.     Next day        was found that the crystal
                                                it
 had resumed its regular form, the bevels being produced as
  in No.    2. The experiment was varied in different ways, and
  measurements were made showing the rate of increase in
  length and in width of the two varieties of the salt.          Hence
it   appears that foreign matters in solution may, in the act of
  crystallization, change the relations of increase according to
  the three dimensions of the salt, an effect which           as much
                                                                   is
  physical  as  chemical.   The   relations  of the mutual   attraction
  of the saline molecules, according to their different sides, thus
  become changed           the presence of a minute quantity of
                          by
  foreign matter, and new relations are set up between the
  number of particles deposited in the unit of time thereby           ;
  allowing or disallowing the existence of certain facets com
  patible nevertheless with the primitive form of the crystal.

XL VII.     A Comparison of the Bourdon,      the  Tail, and  the Amagai
             High-Pressure      Gauges.    By C. Barus*.
I.   J3RELIMINAR                                           I
                            Y. — In mv earlier work t was obliged
           to content     myself with empiric pressure measure
ment.     I  found, by comparing different Tait gauges of my
own with a large Eourdon gauge, that so long as pressure
continually increased from zero, the relation between the indi
cations of each under like conditions of pressure was linear ;
but that when pressure again decreased from a high value (1000
atmospheres or more), this relation changed to a markedly
curvilinear locus, terminating, however, in the original zero+.
I  inferred that so long as increasing pressures alone were
applied, both gauges could be used with safety.              The present
work,   in  which    the   two gauges are directly compared with
Amagat's
             " manometre a pistons libres," corroborated this in
ference, and shows that the bow-shaped cycles represent the
actual motion of the free end of the Bourdon tube.                 From
this point of view the data are important, for they supply an
example of purely mechanical hysteresis, and possibly of
metallic volume-lag.         The data also show that cyclic change
is absent in the Tait gauge, and indicate a way in which this
instrument may be adapted for the precise measurement of
pressures of any value whatever.
    2. AmagaJCs Manometre. — The instrument§ in possession
of the Physical Laboratory, U.S.G.S., is constructed for
measuring pressures as high as 3000 atmospheres.                  At this
limit the height of the compensating column of mercury (the
diameters of the two pistons being \549 centim. and 12-171
centim. respectively) will be about 464 centim. To read so
long a column with reasonable facility,             I  fixed a painter's
ladder in a vertical position, and permanently attached to one
side of it both the manometer-tube,            and a millimetre-scale
which   I  ruled with care on     a sufficiently long strip of brass.
A round leather belt, passing from top to bottom of the
ladder, and everywhere within easy reach, was suitably con
nected with the mechanism for rotating the two pistons.                 I
was thus able to give the two pistons the rotational movement

      3. The Bourdon Gauge. — The gauge used was the same to
  which my earlier measurements apply, having a tube of steel
  or iron f.      I   made two series of comparison of this gauge
  with the manometre.              In the first of these, the usual multiply
  ing gear was used ; in the other the excursions of the free
  end of the Bourdon tube were read off directly with a Fraun-
  hofer microscopic micrometer, after the multiplying gear had
  been removed.           Tables I. and II. contain examples of the
  measurements made.                There are four series of observations,
   two of them within an interval of 500 atmospheres, the other
  two within 1000 atmospheres.                  In both cases two values are
  shown for each stop of pressure.                  Table II. gives the micro
   meter position of the free end of the Bourdon tube prolonged,
   in centim. /40, this being the scale part of the micrometer.
  As usual, the observations were made in triplets, two at the
   manometre, including each one at the Bourdon gauge.

    4. It appears from Table I. that if allowance be made for
errors of reading, the observations of the first two series lie
on a straight line.        The factors, Bourdon/ Amagat, in the first
series are "998 in the on march and "987 in the off march.                    Ia
the second series these factors have changed to '984 and "992
respectively. It follows from both series that within 500
atmospheres a cyclic march does not appreciably occur.
    In the third series, which shows a change of rate above
700 atmospheres, on, the return march is distinctly cyclic,
and at 500 atmospheres the zone shows a breadth of almost
50 atmospheres.         The zero is regained within 10 atmospheres.
The mean factors are '991 below and T008 above 700
atmospheres, on. The factor of the off march is of no interest.
Remarks of the same kind apply in cases of the fourth series,
where the factors are "982 below and T072 above 700 atmo
spheres, on.      ISome irregularity       in this series is due to un
warrantably vigorous tapping.
    Thus it itppears that the inference drawn in the earlier
paper* from a comparison of the Bourdon and the Tait
gauges is valid.       The breadth of the cycles here was about
40 atmospheres.           It is gratifying to note that even the
standard atmosphere used was correct to 1 per cent.                        The
present results, however, go further : since the whole of the
cyclic motion is in the Bourdon gauge, the indications of the
Tait gauge will probably be found very near the truth.
    ft. My reasons for regarding the mechanism of the gauge
as relatively perfect were given elsewhere (/ c.) ; but it is
necessary to verify this conclusion by a direct-reading screw-
micrometer. Care was taken to fix the axis of the screw
                        * Phil. Mag. [5] xxx. p. 346.

 parallel to the line of motion of the free end of the Bourdon
 tube, which line was found to be about -4 centim. long, and
 inclined at an angle of nearly 45° with the tangeut at the free
 end.     The long slender conoidal plug, at the end of which
 these measurements were made, was about 10 centim. long.
 Of the two series given in Table II., the first shows some
convexity upward in the on march, where the mean factor is
 •000362 cm./atm.           The data of the off march show dis
tinct convexity downward.                Thus the curves form a cycle
whose mean breadth is 40 atmospheres, agreeing substantially
with § 4. The data of the second series, which show rather
better agreement among themselves, in other respects cor
 roborate the first series throughout.             The factor is "000361
 cm./atm.        Many      other     measurements       both within 500
atmospheres and 1000 atmospheres                were    made, from which
the absence of cycles in case of the smaller interval was
again manifest.
    The bow-shaped cycles obtained in the present and the
earlier paper* are therefore cases of actual hysteresis.                     I
venture to regard the phenomenon                   as depending on the
occurrence of volume-lag in those parts of the tube which
are directly influenced by pressure.                 In other words, the
 molecules of the metal near the inside of the Bourdon tube
pass from the original to a second molecular state, in pro
 portion as a certain pressure P is approached and exceeded ;
whereas these molecules pass from the second state back to
the first again, in proportion as pressure falls below a certain
other datum p, where P>/>.                 Tables I. and II. show that
P must lie somewhere between 500 atm. and 1000 atm.,
whereas ji may lie below 300 atmospheres.                  Here, therefore,
is a phenomenon very similar to the effect of pressure on an
under-cooled liquid f-
   •  Phil.  Mag. [5] xxx. p. 344 et seg. (1890). See plate x.
   t  Two other possible explanations of the cyclic changes may      be noted.
In  the first place it is conceivable that the Bourdon tube is hotter during
the off march than during the on march.        To test this directly it would
be necessary to submerge the tube in a water-bath,          which is scarcely
feasible without impairing the mechanism.        I  hold this explanation im
probable; for if it were true, the comparison within 500 atmospheres
should show a cycle proportional in magnitude to the cycle for the interval
1000 atmospheres, which it does not.       Again, cycles should quite vanish
on long waiting (five minutes were allowed per observation in my earlier
work), which they do not. The other explanation seems equally im
probable.     There may be two figures of equilibrium of the Bourdon tube,
one corresponding to low pressure, the other to high pressure ; and the
figure of labile equilibrium through which the tube passes from the first
to the second may be maintained over a relatively large interval of
pressure.

    7. Table     III.  substantiates the general inferences of § 4.
In    the first series, above 300 atin. on, the data make up a
straight line. Between 0 and 300 atin., on, the registration
of the Tait gauge is too high, being more in error as the
pressure-zero is approached.               In the off series all the points
lie on a straight line excepting the zero, which is 10 atm. too
high on the Tait gauge.                Thus the locus consists of two
straight     lines  converging      at   1500 atm., and the cyclic cha
racter in § 3 does not appear.                In the second series these
results are sustained, though the off march returns in the
line of the on inarch. As a whole, therefore, the observa
tions lie on a very flat curve, which above 300 atm. passes
into a straight line.         It is difficult to conjecture the cause of
this curious low-pressure discrepancy, in consequence of the
number of minor errors which may be encountered.                     Possibly
the rise of temperature of a liquid, per 100 atm. of adiabatic
compression, may decrease with increasing pressure, seeing
that at low pressures compressibility is relatively large.
Table III. shows, finally, that the mean factor derived from
all the data is '03596 cm., atm.              If this be increased "4 per
cent, to allow for the temperature of the mercury column of
the manometre, the more correct value is *0361 cm./atm.                      In
 my former paper* the results were "0360 to ,036'9, showing
that my empiric standard atmosphere must have been less
 than 2 per cent, in error.          It. is altogether probable that this
 difference of factor is the result of the excessive use and abuse
 to which the Tait gauge was put during the intervening nine
 months.        Indeed   I believe the residual errors of Table         III.  to
 be due rather to unavoidable fluctuations of the temperature
 of the water-jacket than to thermal effects of compression or
 viscosity of metal.          For this reason        I  doubt whether any
 permanent        expansion    of the   metal    for  the  range 1500 atm.
 has been measured.
    8. Summary. — In the attempt to carry these comparisons
 above 2000 atm.,        I ruptured the stout tube which coupled the
 compressor and the manom6tre.                  The above work, however,
 shows conclusively that the Tait gauge may be perfected so as
 to be available for precise measurement.                 It is perhaps per
 missible to indicate the way in which               I am endeavouring to
  do this here, since many of the experimental contrivances
  involved have already been tested.              Thus far the most annoy
  ing difficulty is encountered in maintaining the temperature
 of the water-jacket sufficiently constant. A point of progress
 will be gained when the whole gauge (excepting the capillary

tube) is constructed of metal.           Furthermore, choice must be
made of as thin-walled a steel measuring-tube as possible, in
order that the volume-increase due to pressure may be large
relatively to the simultaneous fluctuations of temj>erature.
This can be accomplished by connecting the Tait gauge and
the compressor by an interposed j>iston libre.            In the annexed
diagram let A B be the cylindrical piston, consisting of a
single piece of which one end is larger in diameter than the
other*.       Let this piston fit the hollow cylinder, CCC,
accurately, so as to be capable of motion to and fro, or of
rotation, with the minimum of friction.               Let the tube D be
in connexion with the compressor, the tube E with the
Tait gauge, and let the whole apparatus be filled with oil (§ 1).
Then it is clear that exceptionally high pressure acting at D
can be counterbalanced           by relatively low pressure at E.
Hence a Tait gauge reading to only 1000 atm. may be made
to indicate pressures two, three, or many times as large as
this, by selecting a suitable size of piston ; and hence an
exceptionally thin-walled steel tube may be inserted in the
gauge.
    I am far from underestimating the importance of Amagat's
manometre as a standard instrument leading at once to abso
lute results ; but it is certainly uncomfortable to be obliged
to make readings on a column 4*6 metres high even under
favourable circumstances.           Nor would it conduce to con
venience and certainty if the registration were made electri
cally.     On the other hand, in the case of the Tait gauge, the
pressures are read off on a horizontal tube about one metre
long, and as far as 2000 atnu, without pistons libres, and
therefore quite without unavoidable leakage t and continually
decreasing    pressure.
   • My colleague Dr. William Ilallock devised other high-pressure
 apparatus acting on the above principle, some time ago.
   t  Regarding nigh-pressure gauges rigorously free from leakage, let me
 say that I have the apparatus ready for expressing pressure in terms of
 the isothermal diminution of the electric resistance of pure inercury. Cf.

XLVIII.           On   the   Calculation of  the Coefficient of Viscosity of a
      Liquid from      its Rate     of Flow through a Capillary Tube.      By
      L. K. WlLBERFOHCB, M.A., Demonstrator in Physics                  at the
      Cavendish     Laboratory, Cambridge*.
           the   method       ordinarily       for calculating the
                                                 employed
IN coefficient of viscosity of a liquid    from observations upon
its rate of transpiration under a known pressure through a
capillary tube of' known dimensions, it is assumed as a first
approximation that the character of the motion at all sections
of the tube is the same, and that the motion of the fluid
outside the tube can be neglected.        Thus, to this approxi
mation,   all the energy supplied  to the liquid is supposed to be
converted into heat within the tube.
      If
       greater accuracy is aimed at, it will therefore be neces
sary  to  apply corrections on account of (1) the motion of the
fluid outside the tube, and (2) the difference of character of
the motion within the tube at points near its ends from that
at points remote from them.
    The second of these causes seems hitherto not to have been
consider ed ; but a value for the correction necessitated by the
first cause was investigated by Hagenbach (Pogg. Ann. cix.
1860), who noticed that a part of the energy supplied still
existed in the issuing fluid as kinetic energy, and that a de
duction on this account must be made from the whole energy
given to the liquid before it could be equated to the energy
expended within the tube.       The validity of the assumption
upon which he proceeds                     is,
                                  however, very doubtful        but    ;
before discussing this       wish to point out an error in the

Let the transpiration take place under the pressure due to a
column of the liquid of height h, then Hagenbach's reasoning-
is as follows : — If there were no fluid friction, and the flow
took place under the pressure due to a height //, the velocity
of efflux would be V'2gh', and the kinetic energy leaving the
tube per second would be irp                  {2gh')           1
                                                                   ;   hence we    must correct
h   by the subtraction of         a    quantity h' given by the equation
                                  r2              •
whence
   This reasoning is clearly fallacious ; for the pressure which
must be applied to produce a certain amount of kinetic energy
per unit time will depend upon the work done by the pressure
in that time, i. e. upon the volume of fluid issuing ; and this
volume in the actual case differs from that in the ideal case
considered by Hagenbach.
   The correct reasoning from the same assumptions is as
follows   :   — The volume of fluid which actually flows through
the tube under a pressure due to the height h       per unit of                   is,
time, irr'v. The energy supplied to this    therefore m^v ghp,         is
and the kinetic energy which    possesses on issuing
                                             it         vprV                             is           ;
hence the energy converted     into heat within the tube is
               —
mspvg^h            ^j.      Thus the head             h   must be corrected                   by   sub-

   Hagenbach tested his method of correction by applying                                             it
to a set of very rough experiments of his own, made at
slightly varying temperatures, and in which, as  appears, the                it
liquid was allowed to issue into the air, so that there was a
capillary back-pressure of varying magnitude.    The reduced
results which he obtained agreed very badly when the cor

              Coefficient   of Viscosity of a Liquid.                     409
rection became at all sensible, and he accounted for this by
supposing that the flow in the tube became turbulent at the
higher velocities ; but this could not havo been the case, as
the mean velocity was, in every experiment except the last
one, well below the critical value at which linear motion
ceases to be resumed     upon disturbance.            If
                                                  instead of his
correction we   use the modified  form   which  we   have shown
should replace      the results are distinctly better, as will be

the form in which the necessary                             corrections must present
themselves may be of service.
   Osborne Eeynolds (Phil. Trans. 1883) has experimentally
shown that, in a tube of given diameter D, if the mean ve
locity is not greater than a certain critical value the motion
of a fluid at points not very near the ends    e. about 120 dia   (i.
meters off, in his experiments)    settles down into the state
which we have hitherto assumed to exist throughout.          He
refers to these experiments in  later paper (Phil.
                                             a     Trans. 1886),

    It follows  that   the tube be long compared with its dia
                             if
meter, and       the mean velocity be below its critical value,
                 if
both of which conditions we shall assume, the motion near
each end of the tube both within       and outside will depend
                                                   it
only upon the mean velocity and not upon the length of the
tube.
   We shall suppose that the fluid flows from vessel into the        a
tube, and from the tube into      mass of fluid of the same kind
                                             a
in another vessel and that when we investigate the effect of
                         ;
a change in the diameter of the tube, we change the dimen
sions of the vessels in the same proportion, and so arrange the
tube with respect to them that the whole system shall remain
similar to itself, the length of the tube alone excepted; then,
from the form of the equations of motion of viscous fluid, we      a
deduce that the character of the motion at similar points in
the different experiments               will be   a    function of ~        ~
                                                                                onb'-
   We may consider that this motion of unknown character
exists in the vessels and in the tubes up to distances of

Since   for the case  of similar fluid  systems  moving   similarly
the dissipation   function     proportional

which energy is supplied is gphv                           -j-     .   Hence we obtain,       if   I
is the length      of the tube,
      =8^-D{/.(f y^f                                                   )}]   +„-.DF(f          >

If the  walls of the vessels are everywhere at       distance from              a

     The large number of observations

which, according to his method of exhibiting the results,
appeared to exist between those of his first series of experi
ments, led me to apply the above methods of calculation to
most of the data which his second series of experiments fur
nish.  It would be wearisome to tabulate the issues of the
calculations at length the various results obtained with the

 each tube. Then, considering the curves for

                               same abscissa should have
 fered by a constant quantity; and this quantity, multiplied

assumptions,    to be substituted for it.    Gartsnmcister gave no
indications of the method by which this result was obtained,
nor of the reasons which rendered it preferable; but stated that
a paper by Prof. Finkener on the whole subject would. shortly
appear.     Under the circumstances, therefore, it seemed best to
wait for the results which he has obtained before trying to
proceed with the question.
    Another attempt to apply to the numbers obtained by
 Poiseuille in his second series of experiments a correction
 for the kinetic energy given to the fluid was made by
 Osborne Reynolds, apparently in ignorance of Hagenbach's
work on the subject, in the paper already referred to (Phil.
Trans. 1883).        The correction which he employed was
 1*505      and   was   thus slightly   smaller than Hagenbach's,
 whose value was '7937 — .       The authority for this correction
appears to be Weisbach ; but as the experiments from which
he deduced it were made with tubes 1 to 4 centim. in dia
 meter and only 3 to 12 centim. long, and the head of water used
 varied from 9 to 24 inches, it is clear that the velocities wero
 so far above the critical velocity as to make the results inap
 plicable to this case. Indeed, Weisbach mentions that expe
 riments with narrower tubes were found to give a different
 result.
     Osborne Reynolds considered that when the above correc
 tion was applied, Poiseuille's results became consistent ; but
 the correction — gives rather better results in all the experi
 ments of tho second series which        I have examined, while the
 discordances which any of these corrections introduce among
 the seeming agreements of the first series are not sufficiently
 different to help us in deciding between them.
     The subjoined Table gives specimens of the results obtained.
  It indicates the relative merits of the various corrections, and
 at the same time shows the inapplicability of the numbers
 obtained by Poiseuille to the method of calculation suggested
 in this paper.

     XLIX.      Note on the Electric    Conductivity of Hot Gases.
                     By Dr. Svante Akrhenius*.
           following lines have reference to Prof.       J. J. Thomson's
THEletter in       the Philosophical Magazine       for  February 1891,
p. 135.      The question at issue between Prof. Thomson and
myself is whether gaseous hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and
hydriodic acids (and, still more, chlorine, bromine, and iodine)
conduct electricity electrolytically at high temperatures, or
only conduct in consequence of dust-particles suspended in
them.      Prof. Thomson's view is that the hydrochloric-acid
molecules (HOI) decompose partially at high temperatures
into atoms of hydrogen and chlorine (H and CI) which are
charged with electricity, positive or negative, according to
Faraday's Law, t. e. are charged with 96 coulombs per milli
gram-equivalent.                f
                        Crafts has shown that such a decomposi
tion, which would be recognized by its effect on the vapour-
density, does not take place at the temperature of Prof.
Thomson's experiments (yellow heat, about 1100° C). It is
conceivable, however, that very little decomposition might
suffice to cause the electrolytic conduction ; and so we will
assume in the meantime that there is a slight dissociation of
                +       -
 HC1 into      H   and CI, not measurable        by other means.        It
must be clearly understood that this dissociation is assumed
 for the exclusive purpose of explaining the conductivity, and
is not, as one might imagine from Prof. Thomson's account,
suggested by other circumstances.
     If such a dissociation takes place, it need not in any way be
 (perceptibly) dependent on the quantity of hydrogen (H2)
                                                       +    -
present.      The equilibrium is one between H, CI, and HC1;
just as it is between PC13, Cl2, and PC15 in Prof. Thomson's
example.       Whether the presence of H2 will affect the quantity
      +
 of  H   (and  CI) or not, depends entirely on whether there is any
 interaction between H3 and H (or CI) of sufficient extent to
have an appreciable effect on the above equilibrium.                 This
 certainly cannot be asserted a priori, but must be considered
 an accessory hypothesis introduced to explain Prof. Thomson's
 observation that the conductivity of HC1 is diminished by the
 presence of H2.

   Now it seems to me that the following explanation of
Prof. Thomson's experiments is much more plausible. In the
cases under discussion he was always able to prove the presence
of free halogen—in the above example, of free chlorine
(C1,)—by the reaction of the heated gases with potassium
iodide and starch.    It must be expressly stated that this
reaction is for the molecules Cl, Br, and      and not for the                 Is,
ions      Cl,     Br,     and  I,                   in   aqueous                          do
                                    which                                solution     not exhibit
the reaction.                 If   Prof. Thomson, then,                   is   ofopinion that                he
has proved the presence                                        the heated hydrochloric-acid
                                                 of
                                              be Cl
gas, his conclusion cannot                       in         accepted.   On the contrary,                    it

     Prof. Thomson has only thus proved the presence                                                 of    free

means    of such fine particles that convective conduction takes
place.
    That Prof. Thomson has really had to do with convective
conduction (for the most part) in his experiments seems to me
apparent from several circumstances.        Convective conduction
is favoured relatively to electrolytic by low temperatures and
high E.M.F.'s. Now Prof. Thomson worked at a temperature
100° lower, and with an E.M.F. 60 times greater, than         I em
ployed in my experiments; in some of which, even, convective
conduction played a considerable part. Again, conduction
by means of solid particles obeys Ohm's Law ; while electro
lytic conduction (with E.M.F. above 1 Dan.) is characterized
by large deviations from this law.        Prof. Thomson found in
his experiments (with high E.M.F.) that Ohm's Law was
obeyed ; consequently the conduction was probably con
vective, as it was in my experiments with salts of magnesium,
calcium, and strontium.
    Prof. Thomson's results are thus explained very naturally
by the following two assumptions : —•
    1. That, as in the analogous researches         of Becquerel,
Blondlot, and Wiedemann and Ebert, a preponderating non-
electrolytic conduction through dust-particles took place.
    2. That free halogens, like chlorine in the experiments of
Crafts, had a corrosive influence on the platinum vessel and
electrodes, whereby the formation of fine particles (and conse
quently the convection) was increased.
    The experiments with mercury vaponr (Hg) show in the
most decisive manner that Prof. Thomson's view of the activity
of atoms in gaseous conduction is untenable : for it is in the
highest degree improbable that the opinion, grounded on so
many circumstances (e.g. vapour-density, specific heat), that
gaseous mercury-molecules consist of single atoms, will be
sacrificed in order to save Prof. Thomson's theory.
    Finally, Prof. Thomson refers to my query : Who can
                                                         "
prove that iodine vapour decomposes entirely into ions?           It
 might    dissociato   into  uncharged   atoms."     This   question
 Prof. Thomson answers by asking two others connected
with it ; and these, as it chances, are verv easy to dispose
of.    The first is : " It' the atoms of a gas (I2) can be without
charge, why cannot those of a salt (NaCl) in solution?"
If  a measurable quantity of uncharged atoms (Na and CI)
were present in a solution of NaCl, then, as in the case
of ordinary dissociation (e.g. of K2Al2S40i6 into K2S04 and
A12S3012), we should be able to separate those components
by diffusion (dialysis).       Now it is one of the most firmly
established facts that, in spite of numberless experiments, this
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 31. No. 192. May 1891.           2 H

418            Mr. S. Lupton on             the Reduction   of
has never been done in a single case with salts. There conse
quently exist no uncharged atoms in a salt solution.            This
purely empirical proof     can   evidently not  be  extended to  the
case of I2 : but there is    a  great difference between the two
instances.      It is easy to imagine that the two ions of a salt
 (Na and CI from NaCl) , which are in other respects so differ
ent from each other, should also be the bearers of different
kinds of electricity ; but it is difficult to admit that atoms
otherwise completely identical (I and                 I
                                                   from I2) should
 assume, or possess, opposite electrical charges ; for complete
 symmetry prevails in the molecule.        Prof. Thomson's experi
 ments on the feeble conductivity of iodine vapour compared
 with mine on caesium chloride (CsCl), yield, besides, sufficient
 proof that the iodine atoms are not charged in measurable
 degree according to Faraday's Law.
    The second question drops of itself when the first has re
 ceived the above answer.                        If
                               It runs : " we admit the existence
 of uncharged atoms (in solution), why should there be any
 connexion between electric conductivity and osmotic pres
 sure?"       Since our experience shows us that there are no
 uncharged atoms in salt solutions, the connexion Prof.
 Thomson mentions must obtain. With regard to Cl2, Br2,
 and Is, we have no such experience as for salt solutions ; and
 Prof. Thomson's assertion that the conductivity of these gases
 stands in connexion with their dissociation at high tempera
 tures, t. e. with their gaseous pressure, is as yet entirely with
 out foundation, either theoretical or experimental.
   I  share with Prof. Thomson the opinion that, after his two
 questions are disposed of, my own query is so likewise, and
 trust that the facts brought forward in the preceding pages
 will supply sufficient material to any one for its unequivocal
 answer.

hurry of modern life are apt to omit the test of accuracy
afforded by obtaining the same results by several different
methods.   Thus long rows of figures are frequently given
which have in reality no experimental basis to rest upon.
On the other hand, mathematicians obtain formulae which
require experimental results of unattainable accuracy, aud
frequently immense arithmetical labour in the course of which
the experimentalist is led into bewilderment and error.
   There are only three possible methods of finding an equa
tion to connect two or more physical quantities, of which one
has been recently applied in a manner open to very grave
suspicion.
     (i.) By deduction from a general law assumed to connect
 the phenomena the form of the required function is obtained
 and the constants are then determined by experiment.            Too
 little is known about the ultimate constitution of matter to
 allow of the safe application of this method in the cases which
 ordinarily occur in physics and chemistry. It                 is,
                                                            however,
 used not unfrequently in astronomy and practical mechanics,
 e. g. in determining heights by the fall of the barometer, and
 the variation in gravity with latitude.
     (ii.) In the graphical method the experimental results are
 plotted on     a sheet of paper or metal, and a curve drawn
 through these points          assumed to give the most reliable
                                is
 expression for the general law.        The problem of drawing         a
 curve through any given points           essentially an indetermi
                                                  is
 nate one, hence the following further assumptions are gener
 ally made — (a) the simplest curve
               :                                  e. with the fewest
                                                        (»'.
 changes of curvature) which fairly fulfils the given conditions
is   to be chosen    (It) nearly an equal number of experimental
                         ;
 results should lie on each side of each portion of the curve.
     No one can deny the great value of this method in all cases
in which minute accuracy            not required. Thus
                                         is                  gives a

volume of earthwork, and the best shape of roof and bridges            ;

                 is is

questions,        apparently pressed at times beyond its power.
    Regnault made use of a copper sheet divided into small
squares, in which the intersection of the experimental ordinate
and abscissa was drawn by         special dividing-engine.
                                     a                       Among
these points       curve was drawn
                     a                             by
                                             the "free hand" and
engraved.
  Experimentalists now prefer squared paper.        In some of
French manufacture      sheet  a  divided into 1,000,000 milli
                                          is
metre squares            by
                 dotted lines, with five dots to the millimetre.
In the middle part of such a sheet one part in 2500 can be

420             Mr. S. Lnpton on   the Reduction of
measured, though of course the accuracy is greater at one end
and less at the other.    A wooden or steel, occasionally backed
by lead, lath is bent between the points and the curve drawn
along it. With sufficient trouble an arithmetical result can
be carried to any required degree of accuracy.         But it is far
otherwise with a graphical one : probably about -\^Gn "
the limit of careful work in this case.          The value of it
has been calculated by two independent individuals to 500
figures ; by careful drawing, Stanley Jevons could obtain
it only to          Very careful use of the ruler and com
passes is required to obtain the sixth figure in the ratio of the
diagonal to the side of a square, while in a few minutes any
one may convince himself that "/2 = 1*41421 35623 73 . . . .
    Mr. Pickering gives no details as to the method used in
drawing his curves, but mentions one hundredth of an inch
as about the limit of accuracy ; it is therefore a little astonish
ing to find him dealing with an abscissa of 50*06998 parts per
cent, of real acid, and a corresponding ordinate of 1*404296
grams per cubic centimetre. Even the latter value would
assume an accuracy of measurement of T^0 inch in 14,042
inches, or 390 yards: and of course he has to substitute another
method.
    Two points are specially worthy of notice : —
    Even those who depend most upon this method, including
 Mr. Pickering, allow that a strong personal element is intro
duced, since two observers might take different views as to
the form of curve which would most fairly represent the
results ; hence considerable care and practice are requisite
 before it can be safely used.      For this reason alone, if an
 arithmetical process can be found which will give the same
 results in all hands, it ought to be preferred.
    Secondly, according to Mr. Pickering, when the steel lath
 he used is bent by the two hands it is really fixed in four
                       "
 points. He says it does not form a curve of any particular
 nature, and does not necessarily give a curve which will dif
 ferentiate eventually into a straight line ; but if the experi
 ments form a figure on to which the bent steel cannot be fitted,
 that figure certainly does not consist of a single parabolic
 curve" (Journ. C. S. 1890, p. 68).
    A chemist may certainly be excused if he avoids the mathe
 matics of a flexible plate deformed by four pressures ; but
 does not the practical solution approximate to choosing four
 points such that the curve drawn through them may lie evenly
 among the experimental points?          Through four points a
 curve of the second degree can be drawn in a variety of ways,
 since a fifth point is required to determine a definite curve.

                        Results of Experiments.                     421
When       the terms   of an equation of the second degree are
differentiated, and the differential        ~   is replaced   by a new
ordinate z suppose, an equation of the first degree represent
ing a straight line is obtained.          Hence the hydrates of sul
phuric acid are apparently made to depend upon the flexibility
of the steel lath used.
     (iii.) The empirical method — the form of the equation is
guessed at, often by the aid of the plotted curve ; the con
stants are determined from the experimental results, and the
calculated are compared with the observed numbers.
     In the great majority of cases in Physics and Chemistry
 the value of the variant for any value of the variable may be
expressed with sufficient accuracy by one or more terms of
the equation
                   ux=(f>(x) = a + bx + cx'2 + dx3 +
 where a, b, c, d are constants which may be zero or negative,
 and must be determined by experiment.
     The assumption that <f>(x) can be expanded in ascending
 powers of x is by no means universally true.            In some cases
 a derived function becomes a constant and the series becomes
 finite ; in other cases some of the differential coefficients
                                                    _j
 become infinite and the series fails, e. g. e~" when x = 0.          In
 some practical cases, as in that of the tension of aqueous
 vapour, the series required is unmanageable and another
  equation must be chosen.
      Four values of u are determined by widely separated expe
  riments, in one of which, if possible, x is made equal to 0 to
  determine a ; the constants are then solved for by the theory
  of determinants, or by the method of cross multiplication due
  to Lagrange, which gives : —

      Were all the results absolutely accurate, the same values
   for the constants would be obtained whatever experiments
   were used ; but owing to errors of observation             the values
   found differ, and the most probable ones can be obtained by
   the following method.

   When, as occasionally happens, .Tj, .r2, x3 are in arithmetical
   progression with a common difference h,
   Owing to experimental error the differences fonnd sire never
  exactly equal, and Mr. J. Hopkinson (Messenger of Mathe
  matics, 1872, ii. p. 65) proposes to add together the various
  values   obtained and take the mean as the most probable value.
  Though the method has no theoretical basis to rest upon, it is
  comparatively easy and should give the same results in all
  hands, while any method of plotting and curve drawing intro
  duces a further scries of observations liable to personal error.
     There are three great advantages : —
      (a) The sum of the differences of the observed and calcu
  lated values = 0.
     (b)  If  the values in the last column of differences regularly
  increase or decrease, another term must be added to the
  equation.-
     (e)  If  the differences are very irregular, there is a want
  of accuracy in the observations, or the theoretical equation is
  carried further than the experiments warrant.
     If   N be the number of observational equations each
  differencing removes one, so that going as far as S'tt there
  are really only N — 3=n complete equations to deal with.

            º   Mr. S. Lupton
where mean values must be taken for the differences of r,
which are usually small.
    These
                                   on the Reduction     of
                         long preliminaries form a basis for the
discussion of the recent application of the graphical method
to the theory of solution.
    In an account of the nature of solution having special
reference to ethyl alcohol (Journ. C. S. 1887, p. 778), Mende
léeff propounded the idea that, if solutions are regarded as
strictly definite atomic chemical combinations at temperatures
higher than their dissociation-temperatures, the expression for
density u as a function of the percentage composition a must
be a parabola of the second order, or it may be represented by
the general equation
                            w = a + ba -i-ca”.
Between two definite compounds, which exist in solution, we
                                                      du
must expect that the differential coefficient (de = b +2e.” will
be a rectilinear function of w.        This consequence can in the
first place be verified by experiment, and secondly gives the
means of ascertaining what are the definite combinations
existing in solution. The hypothesis has been proved to be
correct, and up to this time       I have not met with a single ex
ception.
    It  seems   then   that Mendeléeff assumed a certain form
of equation;     collected experimental results, from other ob
servers in many cases, to determine the constants; and
found that the equation fairly represented               the results of
experiments.       He then   differentiated,   replaced  the differential
coefficient by a new ordinate, plotted the results, and found
that they were represented by straight lines.               He assumed
that the intersection of these straight lines showed a change
in the nature of the dissolved substance which could only be
the formation of another hydrate.
     This method may be valid if the experimental results can
prove the equation to be absolutely and not only approximately
true. Mr. Pickering, however, made use of an entirely
 different method, and says:—“My conclusions as to the
 first differential of the densities are in direct opposition to
 Mendeléeff’s” (Journ. C. S. 1890, p. 79); and even more
 emphatically in Phil. Mag. xxix. p. 433 :—“I altogether dis
 agree with Mendeléeff's views as to the nature of the density
 first differential.”
     Considering that Mendeléeff’s results were not sufficiently
 numerous or accurate to support such an important con
 clusion, Mr. Pickering undertook a laborious research on the

                        Results of Experiments.                     425
hydrates of sulphuric acid and other solutions (Journ. C. S.
March 1890; Phil. Mag. 1890, xxix. p. 433), with special refer
ence to the density, expansion, heat of combination, and electric
conductivity.      While this work was in progress Prof. 0.           J.
Lodge (' Nature,' July 18th, 1889) gave a word of warning to
experimentalists on the over-pressure of formula?, and Arrhe-
nius (Phil. Mag. xxviii. p. 37) severely criticised a preliminary
account of Mr. Pickering's methods, pointing out that his
equations for sulphuric acid required the introduction of
nearly sixty constants, from which anything could be proved.
   It is always an ungracious and difficult task to criticise
experiments upon which much time and care have been ex
pended, and in this case the difficulty is increased by the
omission from Pickering's paper of many experimental details
and by the great number and variety of the experiments.              To
minimize the latter the following remarks will be confined to
the density of solutions of sulphuric acid at 28° C, containing
from 50 to 38 per cent, of real acid (Table II.), Journ. C. S.
1890, p. 142.
   The objections may be conveniently divided into those
which impugn the extreme accuracy of the experimental
results, and those against the mathematical deductions.
   Experimental : —
    (1) Mr. Pickering's results do not agree with those of
Meudeleeff ; he says : — " Mendeleeff 's values by no means
warranted the conclusion that the first differential consisted of
straight lines          The curves required a second differentiation
before they yielded a rectilinear figure" (Journ. C. S. 1890,
p. 66).
    (2) As the mean of eight volumetric determinations start
ing from pure silver, the acid used was assumed to contain
99*85 per cent, of real acid.       It is a little startling in the case
of experiments the whole object of which is extreme accuracy
to read for the separate values found
                  99-953)                  99-753

 with  a difference   of "1 per cent, on each side of the mean used.
    (3) The thermometer        read to "1 millim. = ,004° C. and the
balance weighed to "0001 gram.             The densities were deter
                                "
mined in a " piknometer           holding 25 cubic centim., it was
apparently     of the  old  form, and a glass plate was placed over
the open capillary.       The objections to this form of instrument,

42C             Mr. S. Lnpton on   the Reduction    of
 which was abandoned by Regnault, are well known ; one is
 that the stopper does not go in to exactly the same position
 when unequally pressed or moistened with different liquids.
    (4) Mr. Pickering does not mention any precaution taken
 to reduce the flask and weights to their true weights in vacuo ;
to remove the oxygen and nitrogen dissolved in' the liquid,
 which might amount to half a cubic centimetre at 10° C, or
 the air retained between the liquid and the glass.         Though he
 states that "0002 gram may be taken as the safe limit of
 error, this is about the weight of a sixth of a cubic centi
metre of air.
    The question of the value of the method is of far greater
importance than that of any individual series of experiments.
    (1) Mr. Pickering complains that his method has been per
sistently misunderstood.
                            " It does not consist in
                                                       fitting sundry
equations    on to curves          It  is quite true that    if a curve
differentiates into a straight lino an equation of a certain
                                   "
form must represent that curve (Journ. C. S. 1890, p. 122).
It is unfortunate that Mr. Pickering has used well-known
words and symbols with entirely new meanings.              The opera
tion of differentiation as usually understood cannot be applied
to a curve, but only to the equation of which the curve is
the graph.      The differentials he uses are not infinitesimal
but considerable (finite) differences.
    What Mr. Pickering does, seems to be, to plot the experi
mental results and draw a smooth curve through them ; to
measure first differences (except in the case of densities), plot
them out and draw a smoothed curve through them, measure
second differences, plot them out and find them represented
by a series of straight lines.    If  this account of the method
be correct there seem to be five chances of personal error
needlessly introduced, while the smoothing process, if accu
rately performed, ought to get rid of those slight changes in
first differences which in the second differences mark changes
of curvature, and therefore by hypothesis changes of hydra
tion. The method seems to be distinct from that of Mendel^eff,
though stated by Mr. Pickering to be the same.
    (2) Mr. Pickering further says :
                                      —" The method would give
absolutely true results only if these differences were infinitely
small ; if they are reduced too much, generally below 1 per
cent., the experimental errors attain such relatively large pro
                                                 " When a second
portions that the results are useless."
differentiation has to bo performed it is hardly possible to
apply it to the experimental values themselves, as the quantities
dealt with would be about the same magnitude as the experi
mental errors themselves" (Journ. C. B. 1890, p. 67).

                     Results of Experiments.                 427
    These sentences  seem to cany with them the condemnation
of the method.      If the original results are not sufficiently
accurate to warrant second differences, no manipulation of a
steel lath, however skilful, can make them so.      Hence in the
case of experiments of such extreme delicacy it seems pre
ferable to throw over the graphical method altogether, and
tabulate the finite differences as suggested under empirical
methods, more especially as they afford a test of how far it is
safe to carry the reduced results. The following Table is thus
obtained from Mr. Pickering's results.     The frequent changes
of value and sign in the third differences shows that the
accuracy of the experiments does not warrant us in carrying
the equation to the third power of the variable.     Let us then
attempt to find an equation of the second degree which
adequately expresses Mr. Pickering's results : —
     c=S2u = -0000471 nearly.
     J=8it  - xj+7j_ 8*u = -01071616   - 119-9711   x -0000471
           = •00506552.
     a=M-te-c*s=l-4809752--00506552 x            58-992484
                                  -•0000471x3512-6.
     a= 1-016704.
 .-.«,=  1-016704 + -00506552^ + -0000471a;2   ;
 from which the colnmn of calculated values has been obtained.
 Since no one of the calculated results differs from that ob
 served by so much as one part in five thousand, the equation
 probably expresses the results well within the limits of experi
 mental error, and with far greater accuracy than could be
 attained by even the most careful drawing.       Probably with
 greater arithmetical labour the calculated and observed results
 could be brought even more closely together. But the fact of
 this continuous curve running so well among the experimental
 results seems to throw very grave suspicion on the definite
 hydrate H2S04 3'92H20 containing 57 per cent, of real acid
 which Mr. Pickering obtains from these experiments.
     The whole question then seems to depend upon the extent to
 which we can safely rely upon the experimental results.       If
 the limits of accuracy are 1/5000, the results can be expressed
 by a (smooth) single curve represented by an equation of the
 second degree ; and this equation when differentiated gives
 an eqxiation of the first degree, which can be expressed by a
 straight line.
                                                                  s

accuracy of Mr. Pickering's results, but only the extreme
accuracy necessary for his purpose ; further they do not of
course disprove the hydrate theory, but only reduce     so far                            it,

               Surface- Tension with Temperature.                   431
   I  believe that the following proof shows that all liquids
satisfy MendelejefPs second condition.
   Let unit mass of liquid have a constant volume, but variable
surface S, and temperature t.
   In a small change of the variables, the heat absorbed is
                            dH. = kdt +   ld8>,
k being the specific heat at constant        volume, / the latent heat
of extension.
   The external work done on the film is
                              dW=TdS.
Therefore the gain of intrinsic energy is
                       + dW = hdt +      (I + T)dS.
   This is a perfect differential.
Thereforo
                            dk _d(l+T)
                            dS~       dt
   Also ^— is a perfect differential.
Therefore

                            dS7~      dt't
Therefore

                          t  dS     idt      tr
Therefore
                              dT=_l
                              dt~        t

                   dt*          tdt     t*      t dS
   Now k does not depend          on the surface     unless the film is
very thin.
   Therefore
                                d*T    «

And
                               T=c—bt,
where   c and b may be functions of the specific volume.
   That b does not depend on the specific volume may be
shown as follows.
                                                                        f

432         Variation of Surface- Tension loith Temperature.
    Let the liquid             be maintained at constant temperature, anil
have a volume v                and surface S ; and let L be the latent heat
of dilatation at constant surface.
   Put the liquid through a cycle consisting of two isome
trics v, v + dv, and two lines of constant surface S, S + (/S.
   Since the cycle is reversible and the temperature is con
stant, the heat absorbed is zero.
    Therefore
                                          dl_       dh
                                          dv~ dS
  Therefore / is independent of v, and so is b since l = bt.
  Thus the latent heat of extension is proportional to the
absoluto temperature.     This agrees with a hypothesis of
Clausius (Phil. Mag. 18G2, vol. xxiv.).
  It has been shown that T can be expressed in the form
                                           f(v)-bt.
We shall show that it can also be written <f>(p)—bt.
 For let the pressure of the liquid remain constant while the
surface, volume, and temperature vary.
    Then
                                         dR=Kdt + ldS,
K  being the specific heat at constant pressure and I having
the same meaning as before, for the latent heat of extension
at constant temperature and volume is also the latent heat of
extension at constant pressure (and temperature).
   The external work done on the liquid is
                                     dW = 1dH-pd^dt,

 But the two expressions <}>(p)—bt an&f{v)—bt can only be
 identical at all temperatures if f(v) and (j>(p) are both equal
 to a constant c.

where c and    b are constant.
   It  appears   then that the     surface-tension of a liquid is
independent     of  the   pressure   and depends      only on the
temperature, unless the film is very thin.
   The critical temperature is c/b, and can be found by deter
mining the surface-tension at two very different temperatures.
LIII.    On some New Methods of Investigating the          Points of
   Recalescence in Steel and Iron.        By Frederick    J.  Smith,
    Trinity College, Oxford*.
      was discovered by Mr. Gore, in 1869, that when an iron
IT wire     was heated to redness, and then allowed to cool,
a   momentary elongation of the wire took place imme
diately after it began to cool.       The phenomenon was made
evident by means of a suitably arranged pointer (Proc. R. S.
1869).     The phenomenon was next investigated by Prof.
Barrett, and it was shown by him to be due to a reheating of
the wire : the phenomenon has been called by him Recalescence
(Phil. Mag. 1873).       Recently M. Osmond has observed that
there appear to be two points at which on cooling the pheno
mena occur (Com j it. Pendus, 1890).
    I have not mentioned other work which has been done on
recalescence, as it would have no immediate bearing on the
subject of this communication.        I  have been led to make some
experiments     on  recalescence,   with   a view to discover what
part it may play in the destruction of certain engineering
structures, such as heavy coiled guns, and those parts of
boilers which are exposed to the effects of fire.
    Up to the present time, observations have been made on
the changes of temperature apart from the lengthening and
shortening of the steel and iron under examination.        I  wished,
if possible, to discover the time-connexion which exists be
tween the change of form and the change of temperature.
Several methods of experimentation were tried, and finally
the following ones were found to give satisfactory results.
    The upper end of the steel wire to be tested was fixed
vertically ; the lower end was attached to a long light lever of
aluminium, so arranged that a small change of length of
                     *

434     Mr. F.   J. Smith on Neio Methods of Investigating
the wire caused a large movement of the end of the lever,
which traced a line on the smoked surface of paper rotating
on an ordinary physiological chronograph cylinder. A thermo
couple made up of two wires, one of platinum, the other of pla
tinum alloyed with 10 per cent, of rhodium, was twisted round
the wire where it was heated ; the thermo-couple was in circuit
with a Depretz D'Arsonval galvanometer. By means of this
combination the temperatures at which the changes of length
 of the wire took place were read. The movements of the beam
of light reflected from the galvanometer were recorded on a
moving photographic film.
    The outcome of the experiments made with this arrange
 ment was that the changes of form of the metal under
 examination took place at the times of change of temperature,
 so that a curve so traced on the smoked paper can be used as
 an index of the changes of form and the changes of tempera
 ture. While an experiment was going on, electrically eon-
 trolled styli marked the time on the smoked paper and on the
 photograpliic record second by second.
    Two copies of curves traced by tliis method are given,
numbered      I and II.   They show that on heating the wire it
expands up to a point B, and then stops, although the heat
is supplied to the wire at a uniform rate, it next expands
                                                             up
to C ; heat then being taken off, it contracts to D, where for a
short time it ceases to contract, it then contracts to E.   The
time is marked on the zigzag line TT every two seconds.
So far two critical points are made evident. The wires used in
tracing the curves      I  and II were differently loaded ; this

              the   Points of Recalescence in Steel and Iron.          435
    caused the point       I
                          to be differently placed in the two experi
    ments.    The wire in      II
                                carried the greater load.     If tho wires
    are not loaded, the critical points are found to be at the same
    height of ordinate.
       AVhile  I was working on the subject, it seemed probable
    that the curious changes which took place in a wire when
    heated and cooled might possibly be accompanied by some
    sounds at the critical points.           By means of a piece of
r   apparatus of simple construction 1 found this to be the case.
    The apparatus was constructed thus : — A disk of mica 5 centim.
    in diameter was fitted, like a telephone disk, into a circular
    recess, turned out of a piece of wood.         The disk was fixed at
    right angles to a table. The steel wire under examination was
    attached at one end to the centre of the disk, at the other to
    a vertical post. The length of the wires tried varied between
    5 centim. and 20 centim.;          the diameters of the wires used
    were about 0*5 millim. to TO millim.          The front of the recess
    into which the mica disk was fitted was furnished with two
    tubes, by means of which any sounds from the disk might be
    conducted to the ears.
       After the tubes were fixed to the ears, a flame was applied
    to tho wire, usually tho tip of a small Bunsen burner.              On
    heating the wire a certain temperature was reached at which
    a sharp crackling sound was heard.          As the temperature was
    increased this ceased ; then, on removing the flame, at tho
    same temperature at which tho first sound was heard, a second
    similar sound occurred. This took place at the point of re
    calescence.    As the wire cooled this ceased, and then, when

    The first two sounds are of short duration, and might easily
    be missed,  ifnot carefully listened for; but the third sound        is
    clear and definite. The wire used in these experiments was
    steel pianoforte wire, annealed         and straightened.      I   was
    unable to get the effect when       awide flame was used, but with
    a  flame about     centim. wide the curious effect can be pro

    a  helix through the axis of which the steel wire passed.

A   Dictionary      of Metric and other useful Measures.  By Latimek
              Clark, F.R.S.
"
                                (London:   E. & F. N. Spon.)
/~\NE of the most marked characteristics of the progress of        Science
       is to be found in the gradual decay of the old rule of thumb
methods     of calculation formerly in use among practical men.
The development of scientific methods in all branches of commerce
necessitates   not only a greater, but also a more accurate, know
ledge of the relations bet ween the units of measurement in various
trades and in different countries.     Also the daily increase in the
number of practical applications of electricity has caused atteution
to be directed to its units of measurement ; and it is to be hoped
that the simplicity of these units will lead finally to their universal
adoption.
   In the volume before us Mr. Clark has arranged all the principal
units of measurement in alphabetical order and given definitions of
each ; he has also given multiplying factors for the conversion
from one system of units to another.            For those who prefer
logarithmic computations    the logarithms   of  these factors are given
with five-figure accuracy, and a table of five-figure logarithms is
also added at the end of the book.        The work is very complete
and has been brought quite up to date, the mass of a cubic inch of
water for example being given as 252'2S6 grains as legalized by
the Board of Trade in 1890, thus displacing the previous number,
viz., 252-458 grains.    The units given include almost all in com
                                                         "
mercial use, and range from the law-writer's " folio to the unit of
self-induction.    The apothecaries' weights and measures have not
been forgotten, and should prove useful to many a photographer.
The alphabetical arrangement is very convenient, and any required
unit can be found at once.      The book       moreover, for
                                                is,            awork     of
this kind, singularly free from errors.    Its figures are printed in    a
good, bold type, very unlike that of the familiar engineers' aud
electricians' pocket-books, but none the less commendable.

      Index   of Spectra.  By W. Marshall Watts, D.Sc, F.I.C.
                    (Manchester: Abel Hey wood Son.)  &
Tins book appears         as   a   revised and greatly enlarged edition  of
the original       work   with     the same title, which was published in

                    Notices respecting New Books.                  437
  1872.    Since that time (in 1884) a Committee of the British
 Association, of which the author was Secretary, has collected all
 the results of various observers relating to the spectra of the
 elements, and has printed them in the Reports of the Association.
 In the present volume all these results are reprinted together with
 others published since the Committee finished its work.       It does
 not, however, contain the most recent measurements made with
 the large diffraction-gratings at the Johns Hopkins University by
 Prof. Rowland and his colleagues.      Indeed the numbers given in
the tables were all obtained from prismatic spectra, and corrected,
of course, for the irregularities in the dispersion of the prism.    In
the preface Dr. Watts gives a table of corrections for reducing
 Angstrom's and Cornu's measurements to the standard of Rowland's
 map.    This is presumably the map issued in 1888, which, if we
remember rightly, Prof. Rowland stated to be in some respects
erroneous ; at any rate not so accurate as the more recent one
(18S9).     The author has introduced a new feature into this Index
 in the shape of a column of oscillation frequencies, these being the
reciprocals of the wave-lengths.       This column ought to be very
useful in ascertaining any harmonic relations which may exist be
tween the various lines in the spectrum.        The Index contains a
very large amount of information concentrated into a small com
pass.    By its means it should be possible to identify with com
parative ease any unknown element which happens to be under
examination.      We are glad to learn that Dr. Watts contemplates
issuing an Atlas of Spectra as a companion to the book before us.
The Atlas is to be constructed so that the intervals between the
lines will be proportional to their differences of oscillation fre
quency. This will differ considerably from Eowland's map, where
the distance between two lines is proportional to their difference
in wave-length.      Dr. Watts's map should show at a glance what
relations, if any, exist between the various lines given by any
element.                                                   J. L. II.
The   Phonopore and      the  Simplex  Phonopore Telegraph.     By C.
    Langdon-Daties.        (London  : Kegan Paul, Trench, Triibner,
   & Co.)
If two   insulated wires be wound side by side on a bobbin so that
a  current passed through one acts inductively on the other, it is
well known that, if one end of the secondary coil be insulated and
the other joined up to a telephone and a galvanometer whose
second terminal is likewise insulated, whenever a current is made
or broken in the primary coil the telephone of the secondary coil
gives a click, but the galvanometer shows no effect. By periodically
repeating the making and breaking of the primary current, we can
produce a musical note in the telephone, but the galvanometer is
still undisturbed.     The author has made use of this fact in the
phonopore, which consists of two coils, as described above, and
which he proposes to apply to a new system of duplex telegraphy.

The one set of messages is to be transmitted and received by an
ordinary Morse installation working with constant currents.     For
the other set of messages the phonopore is used,       primary coil                             its

     are mainly occupied with Statics : in chapter xiv. several problems
     in Statics are discussed : the remaining chapters (viii., ix.t xv. to

     with the dimensions of Units. In the main body of the work are
     numerous examples, some of which are very fully and carefully

     the main, been taken from London University examination papers.

     to be looked for in a work of this character, which is written for
     Students preparing for the above-named and similar examinations.
     But what we have found is that great pains have been taken in
     clearing up difficulties which young students meet with in this
     subject ; and this we state though here and there are small over
     sights, as on p. 21 and one or two other places.                These can easily

     well done ; and in the other weaker parts Dr. Burton sins, if be
     does sin, with the majority of elementary text-book compilers.

   The De Kaap- Valley Beds consist of schists, shales, cherts, and
quartzites, with some conglomerates, chloritic, and steatitic beds of
great thickness, faulted, according to the author, against the
granite.   They contain a few obscure corals, and are provisionally
referred to the Silurian.
    The Witwatersrand Series consists chiefly of sandstones, shales,
cherts, and quartzites, having an estimated thickness of 18,000 feet,
possibly formed in a hollow of the granite, and perhaps of marine
formation.
    The Klip-River Series is formed of shales, flagstones, cherts, and
quartzites, with numerous interstratified traps, and is at least
18,000 feet thick.     Near its base is the "Black Reef" and a chal-
cedonite like that described by the author in connexion with the
Lydcnbcrg district, which confirms his opinion that this area
is formed of part of the Megaliesbcrg formation.       The base of the
scries is generally conformable to the underlying rocks.           The
whole of the lower half of the Megaliesberg formation is let down
against the north side of the granite S. of Pretoria.
    The author divides the formation which he described in 1884
 under the heading of High-Level Coalfields of South Africa into the
Kimberley Beds and the High Veldt. Beds.           The former thin out
 eastward, and are overlapped by the latter, the estimated thickness
 of which is 2300 feet. A volcanic rock overlies the Coal-formation.
Near the base of the formation is a bed of loose, calcareous, sandy
 clay enclosing many waterworn pebbles, some of large size, derived
from the quartzites and " Bankets " of the underlying formation.
The author is convinced that the region was under glacial influences
at Borne time during the long period which intervened between the
deposition of the Megaliesberg formation and of the coal-bearing;
rocks of the High Veldt, which latter, he maintains, are certainly
Oolitic ; the latter contain Glossoptevis (?) and fishes, which he con
siders to be nearly allied to Lejndotus valdeiuis, the latter being
 from the Free State.
    The High-Veldt rocks are of fluviatilo origin, and there appears
to have been continuity of fluviatile denudation from the close of
the Oolitic period until now.
    2. " On  the Lower Limit of the Cambrian Series in N.W. Caer
 narvonshire."    By Miss Catherine A. llaisin, B.Sc.
    In this paper the author examines the questions, whether the
Bangor beds should be included in the Cambrian Scries, and how the
strata associated with the southern felstone should be classed.     The
lithological character of the rocks overlying the conglomerate        at
Bangor is shown to be of little classificatory value, but the apparent
discordance between its strike and that of the beds beneath suggests
the inclusion of the latter in the Pre-cambrian scries, as maintained
by Prof. Hughes and Prof. Bonney.
    Tho age of the northern beds must depend, however, to a great
extent upon the classification adopted for the IJyn Padarn rocks.

It has   recently been proposed to regard the felstone of this district
as a lava-flow of Mid-Cambrian       age, and the beds to the north as
lower strata included in the same great series.         The author points
out as   objections to this view:—(1) the enormous thickness of beds,
which in that case must be cut out by the supposed Arenig uncon
formity at Caernarvon; (2) the difficulty of assigning two felsite
masses lithologically similar to two distinct periods; and (3) the
occurrence of conglomerates       similar to those which are elsewhere
admitted to be basal Cambrian.          But in addition to these minor
difficulties, the theory of a Mid-Cambrian age for the above-named
lava is shown to be without foundation. It was supposed that in the
Bryn Efail quarry the slaty rocks of the district immediately to the
north could be seen in contact with, and altered by, this lava. The
author shows that no slate occurs in the quarry, a diabase having
apparently been mistaken for            and that there  it,     grit     the             is    no          in

     º

should a vibrating     molecule impart energy to the aether without
friction or resistance 2    The resistance is in fact a measure of the
energy imparted.      It appears a question whether, if the amplitude
of the vibration (or motion which stirs up the aether) of molecules
were known, the friction or resistance could not be calculated
therefrom.      For we know the number of vibrations accurately by
the spectroscope,   and the energy imparted to the aether (or contained
in the   waves),  by  the thermopile.    To deduce the resistance to
passage represented by the act of vibrating or swinging, we only
appear to require the amplitude of vibration then.            Perhaps a
limiting value for this could be approximately arrived at.
   Another cause tending to reduce the velocity of translatory
motion possible to the molecules of gases in the accidents of collision,
consists obviously in the fact that the internal motion of the
molecule (vibration, rotation, &c.) is proportional to the translatory
velocity.    So if a molecule attained an excessive translatory velocity,
it would acquire an excessive vibration. This vibration would soon
dissipate the energy in the aether in the form of waves of heat;
and at the next succeeding collisions, the molecule would acquire a
relatively slower translatory motion, as it could not retain the
necessary vibratory motion (internal motion) which is the essential
accompaniment of a very high translatory velocity.          So therefore,
from      all
           these causes, the speeds capable      being acquired by the

A molecule, if    assumed    to acquire an infinite velocity, would
certainly have to be assumed to possess an infinite energy.    may                        It
be questioned whether even the total energy of translatory motion
of the stars in the collective universe is infinite in sum ; if
not, then a single molecule with a supposed infinite velocity
would require to have a greater total energy than this.         The

mathematical calculations applicable to a gas, supposed infinite in
extent.   But in these calculations it seems tacitly to be supposed
that the molecules are moving in empty space, which is, however,
not a fact. On the contrary*, the molecules move in a resisting
substance whose obstruction to motion increases in a high ratio
with the velocity of the bodies which traverse the resisting
substance.

       THE LIGHTNING              DISCHARGE.            BY   S.   TOLVER PRESTON.

July    1, 1880) that trees          struck by lightning give indication of a

       The late Prof. Clerk Maxwell arrived nt some dnta as to the size &c.
of molecules.      If we assume a hydrogen molecule to vibrate through nn
amplitude (say) two thirds of its diameter nt a certain temperature, we
can obviously get the total distance traversed through the aether in one
second by the molecule through its vibrations, i. e. the total distance the
molecule would have traversed             instead of oscillating,
                                             if,                     had moved    it
through the same total distance per second in         straight line.
                                                                  a     find this     I
distance to be about ninety miles,        e. the molecule vibrates at the rate of
                                             i.
ninety miles per second, by the above assumed amplitude of vibration in
terms of dimensions of molecule (which seems quite possible). According
to Maxwell, two million hydrogen molecules placed in                 row Would    a
occupy   a   millimetre.    Hence     appears practicable that molecules can
                                        it
vibrate at     a  greater rate than      planetary velocity, which may seem
                                             a
surprising to some, considering how small the dimensions of molecules are
(and therefore their amplitudes of movement). The velocity of the earth in
its orbit, for instance,     eighteen miles per second, as
                             is                              known. The above
                                                                         is
comparatively high estimate for vibratory velocity of molecules (ninety
miles per second, only       arough estimate of course) may account rationally
for the energy contained in the heat-waves of gases and other bodies,
which (energy)        isa measure of the friction or resistance opposed by the
Rther to the vibration or movement of body in it. Calculations of this

of lilt? icther structure.     If had by me data as to the energy of the waves
                                    I
emitted by     a  giis (radiating power),     would obviously not be difficult to

compute the static resistance opposed by the setker to the vibratory move

leaves, branches, &c. increases radially towards an axial line, where
the effect is a maximum, or explosive.

   Before this observation, or in 1876, had published two articles
in “Engineering, (March 17 and 31, 1876), where, in regard to
the lightning discharge, the above radial movement towards an
axial line—which constitutes the “spark”—was suggested on
theoretical grounds to be a fact; so that I may be allowed to add a
few remarks on this point here, referring to the above-named
articles for more detail. The idea that static electricity is a “reso
nance” of the acther (confirmed experimentally since by the dis
coveries of Prof. Hertz) is speculatively advanced in these articles,
and it was mentioned in a work, “Physics of the Ether’ (E. and
F. N. Spon, London), published by me in 1875.               cannot do               I
       :-
better than quote the passage, as it bears on the present case ;
Viz.
     “Itis evident that friction or any molecular disturbance what
ever would naturally throw the aether within a mass of matter into
vibration.     The stationary vibration of a mass of aether has its
analogy in the stationary vibration—‘resonance’—of a mass of air,
 produced by friction &c. The change of ‘static’ electricity into
“dynamic’ electricity, or the ‘static' state into the ‘dunamic'
state, and conversely, is simply the change of stationary vibrations
into progressive vibrations, the one being necessarily always capable
of producing the other (“Physics of the Ether, p. 133).
   As we may sometimes arrive at initiatory ideas of the modus
operandi of phenomena, which may usefully aid towards their final
solution, no further excuse is probably needed for the considera
tions which follow.
   The spark or lightning-flash will be found at least,           believe, to        I

being followed by the resolution of stationary waves into progres

    The passage from ' Nature' describing the observation of Prof.

    " The Professor contends that it
                                           (the lightning) falls in a shower,
not in a particular flash, and that it runs along branches of trees
until it is all gathered in the trunk, which it twists or tears open in
its effort to reach the ground.        In the instance in question, the
trunk of the cherry-tree is as completely shivered as if it had been
                                         "
 exploded by a charge of dynamite           (p. 204).
    The italicised passage tends to show a radial * (wave) movement
of matter from all sides simultaueously, or is consistent therewith.
It seems to be popularly suposed that the movement of matter is
 propulsively along the line of flash (not sideways or radially towards
where the flash shows itself) ; this is why, no doubt, according to
the popular motion, it becomes utterly impossible to form a
mechanical idea as to how such destructive effects are produced by
lightning.
    The above suggestion makes no pretention to exactness or pre
cision as to the modus operandi of a lightning discharge.               There
are reasons, however, for believing that the idea is true on certain
broad or fundamental points (on account of its apparent mechanical
fitness); and the idea may invite others to reflect on the subject,
which can conduce to progress.

some experiments made by himself some seven years ago.                    The
object   was   to augment   the   effects     of  attraction  by  trying   the
influence of larger vibrating bodies than had hitherto been done.
For this purpose, tuning-forks weighing some four to five pounds
each were taken.        AVhen such a fork was thrown into vibration
by a blow, it was found possible to suspend floating in the
air below the prong, pieces of cardboard, upwards of 4 inches
long, £ inch wide, and about        y1^
                                      inch thick.       This therefore being
so distinct and palpable an instance of attraction            by vibration or
resonance, may have interest especially in reference to the recent
experimental confirmation of the fact that static electricity (which
can " attract

      ELECTRICAL OBSERVATIONS        ON THE HOHER SONNBLICK.
                    BY PROFS. ELSTER AND GEITEL.
   From the results of a series of experiments and of observations
on the Hoher Sonnblick at a height of 10,108 feet above the sea-
luvel, the authors draw the following conclusions.
   1. The intensity of the most refrangible rays of the sun's spectrum
as measured by its discharging action on negatively electrified sur
faces of amalgamated zinc, increases with the height above level
ground, in such a manner that at a height of 10,168 feet it is twice
as great as on ordinary level ground.
   2. Notwithstanding this increase in the power of discharge of
light, we did not succeed in establishing with certainty any new
actinometrically     active substances; even perfectly pure freshly
fallen snow as well as dry rook taken from the ridge of the Sonn
blick were not appreciably discharged by light.
   3. Waterfalls can produce negative falls of potential in a valley,
and even to considerable heights, 1600 feet.
   It may be presumed that this remarkable phenomenon is not
produced by friction, but by the influence of the normal positive
fall of potential on the finer pulverulent water which detaches itself
from the large masses of water.      And it may perhaps be assumed
that, as in a rain-cloud, the process of self-induction increases to
high values the originally feeble negative charges of a layer of air-
dust at the foot of the fall.
   4. In July of this year (1890), on three days which were almost
cloudless until 1 t.m., the normal positive fall of potential on the
top of the Sonnblick was appreciably constant.            The morning
maximum, which in the plain and in Alpine valleys occurs with
great regularitv between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., was not observed at a
height of 10,168 feet.
   5. Before the outburst of the storms which we observed on the
Kith, 18th, and 20th July, the positive fall of potential, within the
cloud which sent only a small quantity of rain, sunk slowly down to
the value zero, at which it then remained for a long time, perhaps
two to three hours, until the electrical process in the cloud
definitely came to an end.
    6. In storm-clouds the atmospheric electricity usually changes
its sign after a discharge of lightning, as with storms in the plain.
    7. St. Elmo's fire was found to constantly accompany storms;
it was not found that negative St. Elmo's fire was more infrequent
than positive.
    8. The observation that negative St. Elmo's fire follows bluish
lightning, and positive, reddish lightning, was frequently confirmed
 by us.    The direction then of the electrical current which traverses
the atmosphere in the form of lightning appears to have an in
fluence on the colour of lightning. — Wiener liericJile, Nov. 1S90.

  ON THE ABSORPTION-SrECTRUM,          AND THE COLOUR OF LIQUID
                      OXYGEN.     BY K. OLSZEWSKI.
   In an earlier research the author found four absorption-bands in
the spectrum of liquid oxygen corresponding to the wave-lengths
628, 577, 535, and 480. Liveing and Dewar (Phil. Mag. [5]
vol. xxvi. p. 286), who observed the absorption-spectrum of gaseous
oxygen in a long steel tube under high pressure, found the same
four absorptions in the visible part of the spectrum, and moreover
in the extreme red the bands corresponding to the Fraunhofer
lines A and B, which have also been observed by Egeroff and
Janssen.     An apparatus recently constructed by the author for
liquefying a large quantity of oxygen enabled him to repeat his
former experiments, and to examine more closely the absorp
tion-spectrum of a thicker layer of liquid oxygen in the extreme
red.
   The liquid oxygen was poured from the generating vessel into a
thin glass tube closed at the bottom, which as a protection against
external warmth was closely fitted in a set of three beakers.      The
thickness of the column of oxygen was 30 millim., and its height
about 50 millim.       The liquid oxygen maintained itself for half an
hour under the pressure of the atmosphere, and at its boiling-
point ( — 1810-4) in a sufficient quantity for making the experiment,
although a considerable quantity of heat was imparted to it,
 especially by the limelight concentrated by a condensing lens, which
the author used for preparing the absorption-spectrum.         A uni
versal spectroscope by Kriiss, with a Rutherford's prism, was used
for investigating the absorption-spectrum.          Besides the four
absorptions already observed the experiments gave a fifth shadowy
band, corresponding to the Fraunhofer line A, which was especially
distinct when a red glass was interposed between the source of
light and the slit of the spectroscope. This band appeared feebler
than the three absorptions corresponding to the wave-lengths 628,
577, and 480, but stronger than the absorption 535. With this
comparatively small dispersion the band A could not, of course, be
resolved into lines. An absorption corresponding to Fraunhofer's
line B could not also this time be observed.
   Liquid oxygen has been described as a colourless body on the
 basis of the experiments made in 1883, in which only small
quantities could be obtained. Since then the author has observed
that whenever oxygen was liquefied in rather wide glass tubes, it
showed in incident light in layers of about 15 millim. a bluish
colour.    In the experiments described above, in which for the first
time a relatively large quantity of liquid oxygen was collected in a
glass vessel, its bright blue colour was decidedly apparent.        In
order to be certain that the oxygen prepared from chlorate of
potassium and manganese did not contain traces of ozone from which
the colour might arise, it was carefully tested in this direction.
Iodide of potassium and starch-paper was not coloured when kept

in the oxygen tested.      Even when the gas was passed for some
time through a solution of iodide of potassium and starch no blue
colour was perceived. The oxygen used for the experiment re

in contact with solid potassic hydrate, by which it was completely
freed from CO., from chlorine, and from aqueous vapour.
   From these experiments there can be no doubt that oxygen in
the liquid condition, and in layers of about 30 millim., has a de
cidedly bright blue colour.       This colour of oxygen agrees very well
with       its
          absorption-spectrum.            was surprising that

     particularly those containing Chlorides of Iodine and bro
     mine.      By  J. Brown*.
  1. CIO     long ago as 1851 Sir William Thomson, in referring
     O      to " galvanic arrangements adapted to allow the [che
  mical] combinations to take place without any evolution of
  heat in their own localities," defined " the intensity of an
  electrochemical apparatus
                                  " as " equal to the mechanical equi
 valent of as much of the chemical action as goes on with a
  current of unit strength during a unit of time"f.                   It has,
  however,     been  repeatedly   shown   that  the practical application
 of this guarded definition is in many cases very difficult,
 mainly because of uncertainty as to the proportion of the
 total chemical action contributing to the current as distinct
 from other work ; an uncertainty arising from want of know
 ledge on the following and other points : —
     The exact nature of the surface of solids employed in the
        cell —as when metals are coated with films of oxide, car
        bonate or with gas-films.
     Possible action of the solvent on the metals —as distinct
                                                              1

        is considered " pure

  2.   It does not therefore seem surprising that Wright and
Thompson should be led to conclude from their extensive
series of experiments that the electromotive force stands in no
simple relationship to the chemical action or the heat evoln-
tion taking place in the cell during the passage of the current
or to the heats of formation of the two substances electrolysed*.
   It would have been perhaps more correct to say chemical
action assumed to take place, and to conclude that, whether
the relationship be simple or not, the chemical action is
certainly not simple.
    Laurie has shown t that in the case of an aluminium plate
we have not to deal with the metal at the surface but partly
at least with its oxide. The case of " passive
                                                    "
                                                      iron is also to
the point.
    3. Notwithstanding all this, however, there        in any given
                                                                 is,
cell, evidently   a certain  relationship (more or less masked            bj
the conditions of the case) between the electromotive force
and the relative chemical attractions of the positive and nega
tive plates for the anion of the electrolyte — these attractions
being measured by the combining heats of the attracting
substances.      In this connexion Lodge thus replies to the
question, Why          the force of a zinc-iron battery less than
                          is
that of zinc-copper or zinc-platinum
        a                                      —       ?
    " If we picture to ourselves the actual forces in action we shall
                                                       :
      a kind of answer indicated to us.      In zinc-iron cell the

the iron were replaced by copper, which pulls less, or                    by if
platinum, which barely pulls at all until                coated and
                                                                it   is
alloyed with hydrogen. This answer cannot be considered as
complete. ..."        Then follows
                      X                 discussion of some of the
                                                a
interfering conditions.
    We note here that the electromotive force of the cell                  is
decreased        by

    4. The above quotation from Lodge calls to mind a passage
 in Sprague's ' Electricity/ p. 334, where he speaks of " the
 struggle between the two metals for the possession of the
 sulphuric radical."
     Sprague evidently pictures the molecules of HaS04 as
 arranged in polarized molecular chains by the superior
attraction of the zinc for the S04 radical,
                      Zinc S04Hs S04H„ &c.
    In much the same way Faraday pictured the molecular
                  "
 arrangement along the axis of power superinduced by the
current   "  in a decomposing electrolyte t> In thinking of the
action in the cell       I  provisionally picture the process in a
similar way, and regard the degree or intensity of this mole
cular polarization as having in some way a relationship to
the electromotive        force.    The transformation of chemical
potential energy into current seems always a concomitant of
a two-endedness in one of the acting bodies —the electrolyte.
There is of course the familiar hypothesis which explains
everything, simply by saying that the anion has a negative
and the cation a positive charge ; but            I am inclined to think
this says too much, and, to use an expression of Professor
Gr. P. Fitzgerald's, makes
                                  " what is known to be complicated
appear unreally simple" %.
    5. On either view, however, any chemical attraction of the
negative plate for the cation would increase the electromotive
force of the cell.        It appears to do so where the negative
plate consists of a high oxide like MnOj or PbOs.                 In what
follows an attempt is made to throw some light in the first
place on the question—
    Under what conditions does a chemical attraction between the
negative plate and cation influence the electromotive force of the
cell?
    6. It follows also from the hypothesis, § 4, that any possible
attraction of the positive plate for the cation might also have
an effect on the electromotive force ; but this point has not, so
far as  I  know, been as yet considered, doubtless because in the
   * After this paper had been sent in, Dr. Lodge kindly referred me to
memoirs by Bosscha (Pogg. Ann. ciii. p. 517) and others, and notably a
paper by Sir William Thomson (Math, and Phys. Papers, i. p. 503), from
which it would appear that in certain cells the affinity of the negative
plate for the anion of the electrolyte is connected with a local conversion
of available chemical energy into heat, thus reducing the E.M.F.
   This is in agreement with what has been said regarding the dependence
of E.M.F. on the relative attractions of the two plates for the anion.

452                  Mr.     J.   Brown on       the   R6le of
cells hitherto examined no such attraction has existed, since
the cation was either hydrogen or a metal with no affinity for
the positive plate employed.    It was therefore proposed in the
second place to take up the question —
   In what way, any, does a chemical attraction between the
                        if
posit ive plate and the cation influence the electromotive force of
the cell ?
   7. To experiment on these questions it was proposed to re
place the hydrogen cation by some substance having an appre
ciable combining heat with both positive and negative plates.
Iodine and bromine in combination with chlorine suggested
themselves.   The former was first tried, and one form of cell
produced would then be represented in the diagram (fig.                         1),
where the relative attractions between the substances con
cerned (as measured by their combining heats) are indicated
roughly by the number of the lines between each pair. The
numerical values of the combining heats (including heat of
aqueous solution) are also marked, that for copper and iodine
as cuprous iodide, since the cupric salt   unknown in the free
                                                         is

Hatton Garden,     who  stated     toitbe fairly pure.      conducts    It
the current very well, as shown by the following experiment.
Two platinum wires were sealed side                      by
                                                 side into   tube so        a
that their ends projected from its end at about half a centi
metre apart.      When connected in circuit with two Fuller
cells and galvanometer they were immersed (with precautions
            a
as to cleanliness) alternately in the chloride and in a 10-per
cent, solution of sulphuric acid.        The iodine chloride con
ducted considerably better than the dilute acid.
    9.   With zinc and platinum plates the chloride acted as an
electrolyte, forming     cell with an electromotive force on open
                             a
circuit of about 1£ Daniell, and giving            current when the

The resulting solution therefore contains iodic acid and the
double chloride of hydrogen and iodine, which is stable in
water. If, however, the iodine chloride contains in addition
to the mono- a higher chloride, and there is sufficient chlorine
present to form the double chloride HC1 . 101, no iodine is pre
cipitated and only iodic acid and the double chloride are formed.

The first portion of iodine chloride obtained, and from which
the aqueous solutions were made, was probably of this kind.
The makers (Irish) stated that it probably contained IClg. It
was in red-brown crystals, and left only a slight yellowish
residue on dissolving in water.       Its solution will be referred
to for convenience as iodine-chloride solution, see § 15.
    11. When electrolysed between platinum poles it deposited
iodine at the cathode, sometimes in long filaments, and gas
at the anode.        When a gradually increasing E.M.F. was
applied   to the  platinum poles, it was found that the ratio of
the electrolysing current to the applied E.M.F. began to
increase very rapidly at about "12 D., which corresponds
nearly with the ratio of the combining heat I, CI to the heat
 equivalent of the Daniel], and indicates the beginning of
 regular decomposition of that compound. The small current
 at lower E.M.F.s may readily be connected with the electro
 lysis of impurities in the solution or the action of dissolved
 oxygen. The ratio of the current to the applied E.M.F. is
 considerably greater after "2D. till "25 D., where the experiment
 ended.     The corresponding curve is shown in fig. 3, p. 458.
    On testing the secondary E.M.F. of this arrangement, it
 was found that immediately on removing the applied E.M.F.
 the electrometer     deflexion decreased (rapidly at first) to a
 point   of  moderate    permanence which varied with the pre
 viously applied     E.M.F.   and current that had passed.        It
 indicated a secondary      E.M.F.  which   (as would be expected
 from the low combining heat I, 01) was small and did not in
 any case exceed *2 D.
    When an intermediate tapping pole was used to test the
  secondary E.M.F. at the anode and cathode separately, it was
  found that the principal and more permanent effect was at the
  anode (from the chlorine probably), whereas that at the
  cathode was only from '1 to -2 of the whole and more
  evanescent.     This might a priori be expected, since iodine is
  not a conductor nor very soluble in the liquid, nor is it likely
  to alloy with the platinum by occlusion like hydrogen, but
  simply forms a loose deposit not well adapted to take any
  further part in electrolytic action.

  scarcely attacked at first, but merely caused a slight whitish
  deposit (? iodate of zinc, compare § 25).       Afterwards iodine

in a U-tube in ice and brine. After the liquid had increased
considerably in Tolume, and absorption of chlorine appeared
to have ceased, a part was transferred to a dried stoppered
bottle in ice and brine, and the rest mixed with distilled
water to form the saturated solution. The results obtained
with this freshly-made chloride were quite similar to those
with the purchased substance, except that the latter left an
undissolved residue when added to water, apparently bro
mine.
    18. Dry bromine chloride does not conduct the current.
This is remarkable, considering its great likeness to the corre
sponding iodine compound.          Two platinum wires sealed in
separate glass tubes were connected up in circuit with a very
sensitive reflecting-galvanometer, and cells giving an elec
tromotive force of 5 volts.        On immersing the projecting
ends of the wires in the chloride (either the purchased sub
 stance or that freshly prepared and kept in the freezing-mix
 ture) I  could not, with certainty, detect the smallest de
 flexion.    Ifthe wires were allowed to touch the glass sides or
 bottom of the bottle under the liquid, there was a deflexion of
 several centimetres on the scale.        I
                                          believe this was probably
 due to the formation on the glass surface of a conducting
 film of hydrated chloride from moisture on the glass.           The
 effect was  less if the glass vessel had  been  very carefully dried
 just before.    A solution of bromine chloride in benzol is also
 nonconducting, and the same effect occurs on touching the
 glass with the wires.
     19. When dry, bromine chloride was arranged as the elec
 trolyte of a voltaic combination with zinc and platinum plates ;
 there is, as would be expected, no current observable,          and
 when these metals were carefully insulated with paraffin and
 kept from touching the glass under the liquid, there was only
a   comparatively small and irregular deflexion produced in
the electrometer.

drated chloride, and when the aqueous solution was electro
lysed between platinum poles, gas was given off from both
anode and cathode, and the liquid lost its colour.   The positive
pole tarnished very soon, but neither smell nor colour of free
chlorine or bromine was detected.    Probably hydrochloric and
hydrobromic acids were formed.           A
                                      positive pole of carbon rod

    show the part of the curve before decomposition of BrCl may
    be assumed to begin.
       The secondary E.M.F. of this arrangement      as might be       is,
    expected, still smaller than that for IC1. In the course of
    the experiment none was detected with up to as much as    D.                    '1

           than in the other cases.     For BrCl the sensitiveness of the galva
           nometer was less than for the others, giving     more horizontal line.

 eneral approximate agreement of the two values points to
     as probably the correct method, notably in cases 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 24, and less distinctly in 6, 11, 16, 27, 28.
   In  considering the discrepancies between the theoretical
and observed values, and the cases where factors besides those
mentioned above come in, the following may be noted. The heats
of solution of ICl and BrCl are not available. If positive, these
would decrease the theoretical values.    As the heat of com
bination for platinum  chloride is not available, the theoretical
values where platinum forms the negative plate are somewhat
   ºie
too high.
             observed forces of those cells with negative plates of
           cadmium,
iron and               7 and 8, are much higher than the theo
retical.    Both these metals coat themselves at first in the
strong solution with a yellowish-white deposit, which may act
                                                                                      ...

as a protective layer in the same way as the film of               On
“passive” iron is believed to do... Professor Letts was kind
enough to examine this deposit from the iron, and found it
to be iron iodate.      Zinc        in very strong iodine-chloride
solution deposits a little light-coloured powder, and both iron
and zinc are less positive in strong than in moderately dilute
 solution, the differences in both cases being about 4 Daniell.
    In 10, the heat of oxidation of iodine to HIO, probably
comes in ; but it seems difficult to estimate even approxi
mately the theoretical value for this cell.            “Lithanode”
 (said to be chiefly  peroxide  of lead) as  negative   plate instead
of  platinum  also increased the E.M.F. of the ICl cell by 2 D.;
                                                      did also,    as it,
but manganese dioxide rather decreased                                      as                to   a

     26. Regarding the three-fluid cells in Table II., the solu
tions noted in the fourth column for 18 and 29 were used
with the idea that they might protect the negative plate from
contact with the chlorine compound, and substitute a bromine
combination ; in the latter case, for instance, by dissolving the
bromide, which is insoluble in water.            Nos. 19 and 20 are
for comparison      with 17   and  18,   when  the bromine chloride is
omitted.
     Some other three-fluid combinations were tried, but the
reaction in these cells seems very complicated and needs
further investigation.       In calculating the theoretical values
for 18 and 20, towever, the combining heat Cu, Br3 has been
 subtracted instead of Cu, Cls, which gives a result nearer the
 observed value.
      27. Thallium (22, 23, 26) as a negative plate was chosen as
 the only metal whose heat of combination with bromine is
 greater than with chlorine ; that       is,comparing the heat of the
 insoluble bromide 82,590 with that of the chloride in aqueous
 solution 76,960, the object being to form            a cell where one
 metal attracted the anion and the other the cation, and note
 the effect on the observed force.           In this particular caseit
 seemed possible that thallium might by attracting the bro
 mine increase the force of the cell in the same way as the
 oxygen of hypochlorous acid in 10 may be supposed to do by
 its combination with the iodine. The assumption that this
 might occur         doubtless at variance with the theory that
                       is
  metals are   " electropositive," and therefore could not combine
  with the bromine, which has here the rdle of an " electro
            "
  positive body. Still          was thought worth while to try the
                               it
  experiment,    which   after   all, however,   is  scarcely decisive,
  since thallium chloride         not very soluble, and has also
                                 is                                  a
  negative heat of solution, and therefore perhaps the heat of
  the anhydrous chloride should be taken.           This being 97,160,
is    greater than  that  of  the  bromide    82,590, and would place
  thallium in the same category as the other metals.
      The forces observed with thallium as negative plate are
  rather variable, owing probably to the difficulty of cleaning
  its surface from oxide.          Probably the higher values are
  nearest the truth, in which case 22 and 23 would agree with
   the hypothesis involved in       §22.

part of the medium considered and the time for which it acts.
The force will involve the particular elasticity of the medium
concerned in the disturbance ; and the time will be inversely
proportional to the velocity of propagation.
   By equating the momentum generated to the product of
the force and the time for which it acts, we get an equation
by which to find the velocity of propagation.
   In the case of the propagation of a series of waves, they
may be considered as a succession of single disturbances, and
the velocity of propagation will be the same as for a single
disturbance.
                    Longitudinal Disturbance.
   Suppose     along cylindrical uniform bar of cross section S.
Let a compression be created in this bar at one end, and pro
pagated along it from left to right.        We may imagine the
passage of the compression to take place by supposing each
portion of the bar, as soon as the compression reaches             it,
                                                                  to
press  forward   on the  next adjoining portion   and  compress          it,
returning itself to its natural condition, the whole of the bar
to the left of the compression being left in its natural condition.
   Let   E be the Young's modulus of tho bar,          Its density.

Suppose   a  length  x to be involved  at each instant in the com
pression, and let       Ibe the amount of the compression,        so
that each point of tho bar travels forward by a distance          as
                                                                   /
the compression passes through it.         Let      V
                                                   be the velocity
with which the compression travels.
   Consider two planes A and         drawn at right angles to the
                                       B

                                                            passing

466         Mr. W. T. A. Emtago on tlie Velocities of
generated between A and B, while the compression                  is tra
velling between A and B, the expression
                               VISd.
   Equating these expressions,      we get
                                    d
   The same amount of momentum is generated between A
and B by the passage of the compression across B, thus leaving
the portion A B at rest.
   In the same way a rarefaction may be propagated by the
successive portions of the bar moving to the left by a dis
tance I.   The momentum generated in A B by the passage of
the rarefaction across A, and destroyed by its passage across
B, is in this case from right to left.
   It has been shown, so far, that the disturbance is propa
gated with a mean velocity                     But we may show       that
                               <\/~p
each portion   of it is propagated  with the same velocity, or
that it travels unchanged in form, by applying the same con
siderations to any portion of the disturbance instead of to the
whole of it.
   Consider a portion of the disturbance of length x to be
crossing the plane A with velocity V. Let I be the amount
of compression in this portion. I is positive or negative
according as the length x is compressed or extended.        The
passage of this portion across A generates  momentum   in  AB,
from left to right, equal to   ES   .    ¦
                                              y.   Also the quantity   of
momentum generated in A B by this passage, supposing the
part of the disturbance in front of x to travel unchanged
                                                           in
velocity and form, is V I S d.
  Thus, if we suppose the entire disturbance, of any form, to
be moving with uniform       velocity    \ l/E      the forces brought
into play at each point are just the necessary forces to keep
up the propagation unchanged. With any other velocity
                                                                  of
the disturbance, or of any part of    this would not be
                                        it,               the  case.
This  istherefore the velocity of the disturbance,  and     travels
                                                             it
unchanged in form.

Thus the successive layers still move towards the right, now
starting from the free end. Thus the compression is reflected
as a rarefaction.   In the same way a rarefaction is reflected
as a compression.     This is the case of reflexion without change
of sign.
   When a compression reaches a fixed end, the momentum
of the bar, from left to right, is more than destroyed at the
end, and a compression is reflected.          In the same way a
rarefaction is reflected as a rarefaction. This is the case of
reflexion with change of sign.
   Case of Two Media. — Suppose we have two bars of cross-
                         AO
section S joined end to end, C being the common surface.

Let E1( dt3 Vj ; E2, ds, Ys denote the Young's modulus, den
sity, and velocity of wave propagation in the two media.
Suppose a compression producing a displacement      I to the
right to be propagated from left to right  in A C. Let this
produce a reflected disturbance of AC, causing displacement
I' to the right.   Then, since the bars on both sides of C
return to their natural conditions after the passage of the
disturbance, the disturbance transmitted to C B causes dis
placement l + l' to the right.   Now the momentum in the
space A B is the same just before and just after the disturb
ance in A C reaches C.    Thus we have
                     SZ^Vj = SZ'rfjVx + S {I +      1')   d3V3     ;
                .:      (Z-Z')^iV1=(/      +   Z,)^Vs.

   By H. M. Vebnon, Scholar of Merton          College, Oxford *.
               manganese dioxide is treated with hydrochloric
WHEN      acid  it dissolves with formation of a dark-brown
coloured liquid.      This liquid evolves chlorine slowly at
ordinary temperatures, and at higher temperatures evolution
takes place much more rapidly, the solution soon becoming
colourless and containing only manganous chloride and hydro
chloric acid. Forchammer showed, in 1821, that when this
brown liquid is diluted with a large quantity of water, the
solution remains clear for a few seconds and then becomes
tnrbid, a mixture of oxides of manganese being precipitated.
He also showed that a similar precipitation of oxides takes
place when solutions of manganese sesquioxide and manganoso-
manganic oxide, Mns04, in hydrochloric acid, were diluted
with water. He did not, however, attempt to arrive at the
 constitution of the higher chloride of manganese which he
 supposed to exist in these dark-brown solutions.
    VV. W. Fisher (Chem. Soc. Journ. 1878, p. 409) endea
 voured to show that the dark-brown liquid contains man
 ganese tetrachloride.     He did this by delivering from a
 burette known volumes of the liquid (1) into a solution of
 potassium iodide, (2) into a large volume of water or, pre
 ferably, dilute potassium-acetate solution.        If the action of
hydrochloric acid upon manganese dioxide is considered to be
represented by the equation
                 MnOs + 4HUl = MnCl,+2H80,

further on.
  It  appeared      me that, although Pickering
                             to                      his paper                    in

                     Manganese   Tetrachloride.                  471
seemed to demonstrate the existence of Mn2Cl6, yet he did not
clearly show that the tetrachloride had no existence.          Expe
riments were therefore made with a view to elucidating this
question.
    If, as  Pickering concludes, the action of hydrochloric acid
upon manganese dioxide is expressed by the equation
              2Mn02 + 8HCl     = Mn2Cl6 + Cl,, + 4H30,
then    it is evident that, if such really be the case, when the
dioxide is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, half of the total avail
able or loosely combined chlorine present ought to be evolved
very quickly, while the other half ought to come off very much
more slowly, as manganese sesquichloride only decomposes
moderately slowly at ordinary temperatures.         Also it would
follow that the rate of evolution of the first half of available
chlorine should be almost unaffected by the temperature at
which the solution takes place ; whilst, as Pickering has
clearly shown by his experiments, the rate of decomposition
of the higher chloride of manganese, whatever it may be,
is very much diminished by lowering the temperature, and is
correspondingly increased by raising the temperature of solu
tion. In fact, the only ways in which temperature would
affect the rate of evolution of the first half of the available
chlorine would be that (1) the dioxide would dissolve more
slowly at lower than at higher temperatures, and (2) chlorine
is more soluble in hydrochloric acid at lower temperatures,
and hence less of it would be evolved from the solution even
if it might exist in it in the free state.
          The Amount   of Decomposition  taking place   in the
                          Dioxide Solution.
   Experiments were therefore made to ascertain       : —
   (1) Whether, on solution of the dioxide in hydrochloric
           acid, a considerable quantity of chlorine is imme
           diately evolved ; and whether, after half the available
           chlorine has been evolved, the rate of evolution
           becomes much slower.
    (2)   To what extent the rate of evolution of the chlorine is
           affected by lowering the temperature.
   The method adopted consisted in drawing a slow current of
air through a known quantity of the dioxide dissolved in a
measured volume of concentrated         hydrochloric acid, which
was kept at a constant temperature.          The air then passed
through potassium-iodide solution. The iodine thus liberated
by the chlorine was estimated by titration with standard

472                       Mr. H. M. Vernon on
sodium-thiosulphate solution. It was accordingly first neces
sary to see how far the passage of a current of air was capable
of removing chlorine dissolved in strong hydrochloric acid. In
the table below will be found a series of determinations of the
percentage of chlorine removed on that present in the solution,
under varyingconditions as to temperature, degree of saturation
of the hydrochloric acid, volume of air drawn through the
solution, and time during which the passage of the air lasted.
The air was caused to take up the same temperature as the
hydrochloric acid through which it was drawn, by allowing it
to first pass through a worm-tube surrounding the flask con
taining the hydrochloric acid, the whole apparatus being im
mersed in water or a freezing-mixture, as the case might be.

      It will bo seen that in a very short time the greater part of
 the chlorine is removed from the solution by the passage of
 the current of air, whether it be moderately fast or slow.              In
 the last experiment, where the current was continued for a
 longer time, the hydrochloric acid was found to contain only
 the merest trace of chlorine.         As in the experiments to be
 described below, the current of air was usually continued for
 two hours or more, it may be concluded that the amount of
 chlorine removed from the solution of manganese dioxide in
 hydrochloric acid gives a very good estimate of the amount of
 chlorine actually set free.
      Both anhydrous and hydrated manganese dioxide were
 used in these experiments.         The anhydrous variety was pre
 pared     by igniting pure manganese nitrate, washing, and
 drying at 100° G. It was found to contain almost the theo
 retical quantity of manganese dioxide (99-2 per cent.). The
 hydrated variety was prepared by dissolving commercial
 dioxide in hydrochloric acid, and precipitating by pouring the

                    Manganese     Tetrachloride.                473
solution into water. The precipitate was collected, washed,
and dried for sixteen hours at 75° C.       Its composition was as
follows :  —
                   Mn02      = 90-77 per cent.
                   MnO       =      4-21     „
                   H30       =      4-80     „
                                   99-78
    This and other specimens        of dioxide were analysed by
heating    a weighed quantity   to redness for about thirty minutes
and reweighing on cooling.         The amount of available oxygen
existing in the oxide, which consists chiefly of Mn304, is then
estimated in the usual way by heating with hydrochloric acid
and estimating the chlorine evolved.        Separate values of the
total manganese and of the water present are thus arrived at.
The available oxygen in the dioxide is determined separately.
     I. To a weighed quantity (-3069 grm.) of hydrated Mn02
in a small flask were added 10 cub. centim. of concentrated
hydrochloric acid.      The flask was immersed in water at 18° C.
                            'i
 In fifteen minutes, when litre of air had been drawn through,
 14-2 per cent, of tho available chlorine was removed.           In
 forty-five minutes longer 31*7 per cent, more chlorine was
 removed ; or, in the first hour 45-9 per cent, had been
 removed.      In this time 1'5 litre of air had been drawn
 through the solution. In the next hour 14-1 per cent, more
 chlorine was removed, and in the next two hours 10'5 per
  cent. more.     We thus see that, while half the available
 chlorine had not been removed even after an hour, yet that the
 amount removed is much greater in the first hour than in the
 second, and this is greater than in the next two hours.        The
 reason of this will be made evident further on.       It should be
  noticed that, while the amount of chlorine removed is much
  smaller in the second hour than in the first, yet that in the
  next two hours it is smaller in about the same proportion; while
  if Mn2Cl6 and no MnCl4 were formed in the solution, we should
  expect the last half of the chlorine to come off at a more even
  rate than it does here.      Also the first half of the chlorine
  cannot be said to have been evolved very quickly, as it took
  over an hour to be removed from the solution.
      II. To a weighed quantity (-2819 grm.) of hydrated dioxide
  in a small flask, surrounded by a freezing-mixture of ice and
  salt, were added 10 cub. centim. of hydrochloric acid which
  had previously been cooled to the temperature of the freezing-
  mixture, viz. — 14° C. The air, before bubbling through the
  liquid, was drawn through a worm-tube immersed in the

  474                    Mr. H. M. Vernon      on
   same freezing-mixture as the flask.       It was found that, after
   the passage of the current of air had been continued for two
   hours, 19.1 per cent. of the available chlorine had been
   removed. In another experiment, at –6°, it was found that
  33.8 per cent. was removed in two hours.           The manganese
  dioxide did not   appear  to be nearly so readily soluble in hydro
  chloric acid at these low temperatures as it is at ordinary tem
  peratures; for it was found that some of it remained undissolved
  even at the end of the two hours.       It was therefore necessary
  to ascertain how much of the dioxide had actually passed into
  solution, as the undissolved dioxide would not enter into the
  reaction at all. In these experiments at low temperatures,
 therefore, after the passage of the current of air had been
 stopped, the liquid in the flask was poured on to a small
 filter, the filtrate passing into potassium-iodide solution, while
 the undissolved dioxide remained behind.           As the filtering
 only took a few seconds, only a very small quantity of chlorine
 would escape from the solution and so not be accounted for.
      III. The amount of chlorine removed from a solution of
 dioxide in hydrochloric acid at –26°C. was then determined.
 The flask and worm-tube used in the previous experiments
 were surrounded by a freezing-mixture of crystallized calcium
 chloride and pounded ice. The vessel containing this being
 well covered up, the liquid was kept at a uniform temperature
 throughout the experiment. It was found that in two hours
 only 1.8 per cent. of the available chlorine had been removed.
 During this time about 2 litres of air were drawn through the
solution.     In the former experiments about 2.7 litres of air
were drawn through during the two hours.
     Another experiment, at –19°C., showed that 12.2 per cent.
of chlorine was removed in two hours.
     It thus appears that the stability of the dioxide solution is
very greatly increased as the temperature is lowered, and so
we might expect that at a still lower temperature it would not
undergo any decomposition whatever.          It would not be possible
to try the action of hydrochloric acid on the dioxide at a much
lower temperature than —26°, as hydrochloric acid solidifies
at –29°, though when it contains chlorine or manganese
dioxide in solution it does not solidify till below this tem
perature.
    It might be thought possible that the reason why no
chlorine is evolved from the solution is not that it is not
actually set free by the reaction of the dioxide and hydro
chloric acid, but that it forms a solid hydrate with some of the
aqueous hydrochloric acid, and so is not removed from the
solution by the passage of the air. That this was not the case

                       Manganese   Tetrachloride.                     475
was proved by passing chlorine into hydrochloric acid at
 — 20    for some time, no chlorine hydrate being formed.
Indeed, it was found that the addition of even a small quantity
or hydrochloric acid to water containing chlorine-hydrate
crystals almost immediately destroyed them.        Thus chlorine
was passed into 10 cub. centim. of water* at 2°, chlorine
hydrate being very soon formed ; when, however, -5 cub.
centim. of hydrochloric acid was added to the water, the
hydrate rapidly disappeared.      Again, when a solution con
taining   water and  HUl  in the  proportion 6 : 1 was saturated
with chlorine at —9°, the hydrate was formed ; this quickly
disappeared when one part more of HC1 was added.         Lastly,
it was found that, when a mixture of water and hydrochloric
 acid in equal proportions was saturated with chlorine at — 1 9°,
 no hydrate whatever was formed.
   It is therefore conclusively shown that when manganese
dioxide dissolves in hydrochloric acid, manganese tetrachloride
and no free chlorine are originally formed, and that the lower
the temperature the more stable does this tetrachloride solution
become.
        The Rate    of Evolution of Chlorine from   the   Solution.
   It is now necessary to ascertain whether, on decomposition
of the tetrachloride solution, the sesquichloride or any other
intermediate chloride is formed.
   If an intermediate chloride, as Mn2Cl6, is formed on the
decomposition of the tetrachloride, we may reasonably expect
that this chloride should be more stable than the tetrachloride.
Consequently when a solution containing originally only tetra
chloride decomposes, we should expect the hrst half of the
chlorine to come off considerably faster than the last half. At
ordinary temperatures the decomposition of the solution is so
slow that it would take a day or two before the greater part
of the chlorine would be evolved.      The variations in the tem
perature of the atmosphere, and also the impossibility of taking
a continuous series of readings of the volume of gas evolved
during this time, would render it impossible to arrive at a
 satisfactory conclusion as to the rate of decomposition of the
 solution.    If,however, the temperature of the solution be
raised to above 30°, the rate of evolution becomes much more
rapid, and the greater part of the chlorine     evolved in
                                                is            few a
hours.
    Small weighed quantities (about      grm.) of the dioxide, in
                                         '2
both its anhydrous and hydrated forms, were placed in the bulb
 of V. Meyer's vapour-density apparatus. This was surrounded
   a
 by an outer tube of water, which was in turn surrounded                by

476                     Mr. H. M. Vernon on
a large vessel of water kept at a constant temperature through
out the experiment.     On the dioxide was poured a volume of
concentrated   hydrochloric acid, varying from 5 to 10 cub.
centim. in different experiments.       he temperature of the
bath was varied in different  experiments   from 31°5 to 75°.
Above this temperature the rate of evolution becomes so rapid
that it is impossible to measure the volume of gas evolved
accurately. The air evolved was collected over water. The
volume of the apparatus was very much larger than that
of the chlorine evolved; and it was found experimentally that
scarcely a trace of chlorine reached the collecting-tube even
after several hours.  Observations were made at intervals of a
quarter or half a minute, or at greater intervals when at the
close of an experiment the evolution became much slower.
The results obtained are represented diagrammatically in the
illustration.   Here the ordinates represent the volume of gas
evolved in cub. centim., and the abscissae represent the time
in minutes. The first curve represents the rate of evolution
at 75°C. It will be seen that the gas is evolved very rapidly,
more than half of it coming off in the first minute, while                all   of
it  appeared    have come off

not quite stopped even after nearly five hours. The first two of
these three curves show that the gas is evolved quite regularly
till the last few cub. centim., when the rate of evolution becomes
much slower. The reason of this is evidently, that at the points
where the forms of the curves change, the greater part of the
tetrachloride present has been decomposed into manganous
chloride and chlorine, and that most of the gas which is
evolved after this is evolved from the hydrochloric acid in
which it is mechanically dissolved.            Chlorine was found to
have about the same degree of solubility in hydrochloric acid
as in water ; at 50°, therefore, it dissolves *9 vol. and at 75°
 "2 vol. of chlorine.      At the commencement of the evolution of
       "           "
 this residual chlorine the acid will be considerably super
 saturated with   it,  but the greater part present will be expelled
 from the solution in the course of an hour or two. We may

 therefore expect the volume of " residual gas to bear some
 proportion to the temperature as well as to the volume of
 hydrochloric acid employed.           In the experiments of the first
 two curves, representing the evolution at 75° and 50o-8,
5    cub. centim. of hydrochloric acid were used.              We see,
 however, that the volume of residual gas          is  much  greater at
 the lower temperature than at the higher,              it being about
 10 cub. centim. in one case and only          4    cub. centim. in the
 other. In the curve representing the evolution at 310,5,
8    cub. centim. of hydrochloric acid were used. Here the
 rate of decomposition of the tetrachloride        is so slow that         it   is
 not possible, from the form of the curve, to tell where the
 greater part of    it    has undergone decomposition        and where
 residual gas begins to he evolved.            They   evidently  overlap
 each other, so as to form one regular curve.               Though the
  form of this curve     is  regular, it  nevertheless shows that the
  rate of decomposition       of the tetrachloride solution         much

  slower at the end than at the beginning of the experiment,
  after allowing of course for the amount of tetrachloride actually
  existing in tne solution. The reason of this will be made
  evident further on. It will be noticed how much more slowly
  the chlorine comes off from the solution when                left alone

   of temperature.      Thus at 18°   it was found that in four hours
  705 per    cent,  of the chlorine was removed by current of air

  from the dioxide solution, whilst here only about 85 per cent,
  of chlorine was evolved from the solution in four hours at
   31°*5.   The reason of this   is   partly that a certain amount of
  the chlorine remains dissolved in the solution without being
  evolved, but it   is  also probable that the passage of the current

    Other determinations of the rate of evolution of chlorine
were made at temperatures between the extremes given above,
namely, at 32°, 43°, 48°2, 57°, 59°, and 63°. The curves

clusively proved that the change in the form of the curves is
due to the evolution of this residual gas, and not to the
decomposition of a more stable higher chloride of man
ganese.
  These   results, therefore, show that when any of the oxides
of manganese, Mn02, Mn203, and Mn304, dissolve in hydro
chloric acid, the only higher chloride produced is manganese
tetrachloride.    The equations for the solution of manganese
sesquioxide and manganoso-mauganic oxide in hydrochloric
acid must therefore be : —
          Mn203 + 6HC1 =          HnCl4 + MnCl2 + 3H20.
          MnA+8HCl              = MnCl4 + 2MnCl3 + 4H20.
         Discussion of the Results obtained by Pickering.
   It is now necessary to see if it is possible to reconcile these
results with those obtained by Pickering.
   The first of his two arguments for the existence of man
ganese sesquichloride and the non-existence of the tetra
chloride, is, that if the chloride formed by the solution of the
dioxide in hydrochloric acid       MnCl4, then
                                     is             can make no
                                                       it
difference to the amount of this chloride obtained whether the
solution be performed in pure hydrochloric acid, or in acid
containing   a quantity of manganous chloride whereas,  ;       if
                                                               the
chloride be Mn2Cl6, then by performing the solution of the
dioxide in the presence of      sufficient quantity of manganous
                                 a
chloride we might succeed in converting the whole of the
oxide, together with some of the dichloride added, into the
higher chloride   ; so that on decomposing         with water, we
                                                       it
should get as much dioxide precipitated as was dissolved,
thus —
    :
            Mn02 + 4HCl + MnCl2 = Mn2Clfl + HsO,        2
                   Mn2Cle + 2H20 = Mn02 + MnCl2          4HCl.
                                                            +
Otherwise,   ifno dichloride were added to the acid, we should
not be able to obtain in the precipitate more than half of the
dioxide dissolved, thus —   :
          2Mn02 +         8HCl = MnjClg  4H20 + Cl2,
                                              4
          Mn2Cl6      +   2H20 = Mn02 + MnCl2 4HCl.    +
  Accordingly, Pickering made        series of experiments in
                                          a
which given weights of the dioxide were dissolved in hydro
chloric acid in the presence of varied proportions of man
ganese dichloride, and the solutions thus formed precipitated
with water, and the dioxide in the precipitate estimated.  He
found that when no manganese chlorido was added, 45 per

480                      Mr. H. M. Vernon            on
 cent. of the original MnO, was recovered.        When one mole
 cule of MnCl2 was added, 80 per cent. of MnO, was recovered;
 and with six molecules of MnOly, 95.5 per cent. was recovered.
 When the results of ten determinations with proportions of
 manganese chloride varying between these limits were repre
 sented diagrammatically, it was found that up to the addition
 of one molecule of MnOl, the curve representing the amount
 of MnO, recovered was a straight line ; after this point the
 form of the curve changed suddenly, the ratio of MnO, re
 covered to molecules of MnCl2 added being considerably less
 than before.
                              i.
                 Pickering considers this to conclusively show
 that the tetrachloride         no existence, and also that the
 higher chloride formed is Mn2Cls.
    On examination it will be found that this argument neither
 proves the non-existence of the tetrachloride nor the existence
 of the sesquichloride. Thus, it can be shown mathematically
 that supposing MnOl, and the solution of the dioxide in
 hydrochloric acid react as Pickering supposes, the form of
 the curve up to the addition of one molecule of MnO, will
 not be a straight line, but will be to a certain extent curved.
 Also, he says that the form of the curve changes suddenly
 after one molecule of MnCl2 has been added.            He forgets,
 however, that there is not one molecule of MnOl, present, but
 1-132 molecule, for the specimen of dioxide used he showed
 to contain 85-15 per cent. MnO, and 9:36 per cent. MnO :
this MnO, on addition of hydrochloric acid, would of course
form MnOlz, and this was not taken account of when the rest
of the MnGl, was added. He found that the addition of one
molecule of MnOl, raised the amount of MnO, recovered from
45 per cent. to 80 per cent.; the addition of 132 molecule would
accordingly raise it 4.62 per cent.      He found the form of the
curve to change, therefore, after a point where 80 per cent.
of the dioxide was recovered, while according to his argument
it should have been after 75°36 per cent. was recovered. Also
he would only have recovered 40°36 per cent. of the original
MnO, if pure dioxide had been used. These discrepancies
may be due to the conditions of solution and precipitation of
the dioxide not being kept quite the same for different expe
riments. It would seem, therefore, that              all
                                               that this curve can
with certainty      betaken   by
                              show        is,
                                        that the amount      MnO,  of
recovered is  increased         to
                            the addition        of
                                            MnCl2     the solution,
                                                              to
the amount     of this increase being     proportion less and less
                                            in
with each addition        MnOl. This does not, however, show
                         of
that when the dioxide dissolves      hydrochloric acid, the sesqui
                                     in
chloride and free chlorine are formed            only shows that

                                                 ;
manganese tetrachloride         more stable
                                is                the presence          of

                    Manganese    Tetrachloride.                 481
manganous chloride, just as, in an analogous case, Wurtz
showed that phosphorus pentachloride dissociated to a very
much slighter extent when volatilized in vapour of phosphorus
trichloride than when volatilized alone.       In the case of the
solution of manganese dioxide in hydrochloric acid, we have
unstable molecules of the tetrachloride continually dissociating
into manganous chloride and two atoms of chlorine, and the
molecules of manganous chloride thus formed continually, but
to a smaller extent, uniting with the atoms of chlorine present,
to form the tetrachloride again.      If, therefore, a large excess
of MnCl2 is present, it is obvious that much less of the chlorine
formed by the decomposition of the tetrachloride will escape
recomposition with Mn(!l2 molecules, and so less chlorine will
be evolved from the solution.        Also it is evident that the
addition of the first molecule of MnCl2 will cause a greater
increase in the amount recovered than the addition of the
second and other molecules, but at the same time a curve
expressing the amount recovered for each addition of MnCI2
would not change its form suddenly after the addition of the
first molecule.
    We thus arrive at an explanation as to why the amount of
chlorine removed from a solution of the dioxide in hydro
chloric acid was considerably greater in the first hour than in
the second, and this was greater than in the next two hours.
It is because that, as the original MnCl4 begins to be decom
posed, a corresponding quantity of MnCl2 is formed.          There
 fore, the more MnCI4 decomposed, the more MnCl2 is formed,
and so the more stable becomes the remnant of MnCL, still
left undecomposed.      The same explanation also applies to the
curve for the rate of evolution of chlorine from the dioxide
solution at 31°"5.
    It might be concluded that if the dioxide be allowed to
dissolve in hydrochloric acid saturated with chlorine, less de
 composition would, for a similar reason, take place, and there
fore more dioxide would be recovered.           In practice, it was
 found that the amount of Mn02 recovered was raised scarcely
 at all by this means.    This is probably due to the fact that
 MnGl2   is unable to  recombine   with molecules of chlorine to
 form the tetrachloride, but only with nascent chlorine set free
 by other decompositions of MnCl4 molecules.
    It was found experimentally that hydrochloric acid con
 taining MnCl2 in solution did not dissolve any more chlorine
 even at —32° than hydrochloric acid alone, and also the
 solution was not darkened in colour. No higher chloride
could therefore have been formed. It is scarcely possible to
 try the action of nascent chlorine upon manganous chloride

to this, the action of chlorine gas upon it when mixed with
cobalt sesquichloride in a hydrochloric acid solution, was tried,
and also the action of lead tetrachloride in the acid solution.
No darkening in the colour of the solution                                    took place,     how

   Pickering's second argument for the existence of man

temperature materially decreases the stability of the higher

tated.   The trace of tetrachloride remaining on the filter-paper
was estimated separately and allowed for.     By this method at
5° and   —9°, from a   specimen   of dioxide containing   4.2 per
cent. MnO, 54.2 per cent. and 53.8 per cent. were recovered.
With a specimen of dioxide containing 72.1 per cent. MnO,
and 12.5 per cent. MnO, 55.77 per cent. MnO, was recovered
at 18°. At —20° this would correspond to the recovery of
about 58.77 per cent.    When some of this dioxide was shaken
in a flask with hydrochloric acid and then poured into water,
56°49 per cent. was recovered ; with hydrochloric acid satu
rated with chlorine, 56-54 per cent. was recovered, the tem
perature of solution being in both cases 18°. The reason of
this slight increase lies probably in the fact that when hydro
chloric acid is dropped slowly on to the dioxide on a filter
paper, the energy of the chemical action raises the tempera
ture several degrees, and so more of the tetrachloride formed
is decomposed.
   With a specimen of dioxide containing 79.53 per cent.
MnO, and 10.5 per cent. MnO, 55.5 per cent. was recovered
at 13°. With a specimen containing 45.33 per cent. MnO,
and 43.76 per cent. MnO, and consisting therefore mostly of
Mn2O3, 74.5 per cent. MnO, was recovered, whilst with some
Mn2O4, 85.43 per cent. was recovered.    These last two expe
riments confirm Pickering's conclusions that the amount of
dioxide recovered is largely increased if molecules of MnOl,
be present in the solution.
     t is thus seen that, instead of the amount of dioxide re
covered being always slightly below fifty per cent., it is
always slightly above                  it,              performed
                                                                        it be

solve in the water.        The reason why the dioxide solution
becomes much more stable with lowering of temperature is
probably that the atoms of chlorine come the less often into
the positions necessary for them in order that they may unite
together to form molecules, although nearly as large a number
of them may exist in the solution                 to MnOl; mole
cules at the lower as at the    higher temperature.
   Even if slightly less than fifty per cent. of the dioxide were
recovered on precipitation, this argument would still hold
good, and so even in this case no proof would be afforded of
the existence of the sesquichloride.
   It has thus been shown that neither of Pickering's argu
ments can be held to prove that when manganese dioxide
dissolves in hydrochloric acid, manganese sesquichloride, and
not manganese tetrachloride, is formed ; and as it has been
shown in the former part of this paper that there is every
probability that in the solution of the dioxide it is only the
tetrachloride that is formed, we must consider that such is the
case until stronger arguments than these have been brought
forward to refute it.
                              Summary.
   The chief conclusions arrived at in this paper are :—
   (1) That when any of the oxides of manganese MnO2,
Mn2O3, and Mn30, are dissolved in hydrochloric acid, the only
higher chloride formed is manganese tetrachloride, the equa
tions for these reactions being:—
           MnO, +4HCl = Mn(1,4-2H,0;
           Mn2O3 + 6HCl = MnO, + MnOl, +3H,0;
           Mn30, + 8HCl = MnOl,+2MnOls--4H2O.
    (2) That this manganese tetrachloride solution is very
much more stable at –26°C. than at ordinary temperatures,
it being probable that at a still lower temperature it would
undergo no decomposition whatever.
   (3) That no evidence has yet been brought forward to
show that any other higher chloride of manganese than the
tetrachloride is capable of existence.

  LX. An      Outline of Mr. Mellard Reade's Theory of the
    Origin of Mountain-Ranges by Sedimentary Loading and
    Cumulative Recurrent Expansion: in Answer to Recent
    Criticisms.   By T. Mellard Ebade *.
                           Introduction.
                                                                      '
      is now four years since the ' Origin of Mountain-Ranges
IT     was written, and during that time it has been subjected
to considerable criticism by many able men in various parts
of the Globe.       I  have purposely refrained hitherto from
answering any of the objectors to my theory, feeling that it
would be better to wait and weigh them.              It appears to me
now that most of tho criticisms primarily spring from an
imperfect realization of its principles, scope, and details.
    The misconceptions no doubt largely arise from the complex
nature of the problems and the difficulty of keeping the
various threads of the argument unravelled.              Under these
circumstances,    I have thought that the best reply      I can make
is to restate in a shorter manner the various salient points of
                              I
my theory. Probably, if had given the theory a name, and
properly christened my bantling before sending it forth in
the world to seek its fortunes,     I  might have been saved from
paternal difficulties.
    To prevent further misconceptions,       I now name my theory
the " Origin of Mountain-Eanges           by Sedimentary Loading
and Cumulative Recurrent Expansion."
    The outline here given is of the barest character, and for
illustrations, details, proofs, and quantitative calculations        I
refer those who want to know more to the work itself, as also
for those portions which deal with other theories, and are of a
destructive rather than constructive nature.

accord with this view ; for if the interior be wholly fluid, as
 some few contend, or if the nucleus be solid and the exterior
 shell solid with a zone of molten matter between, as others
 assume, the explanations of the physical conformation of the
surface, its mountains and ocean-basins, become questions of
 flotation only.
    The crust of the Earth would be like a sheet of ice.          This

486       Mr. T. M. Reade on       the Origin of Mountain-Ranges
fact seems to me never to have been fully realized by those
theorists who favour either of these views.
      The Nucleus     of the Earth   possesses a high   Temperature.
    There is such a general consensus of opinion that the earth
at  a depth of from 25 to 30 miles below the surface is at a
temperature equal to that of molten rock at the surface that
it is unnecessary for me to go over the arguments in favour
of this widely prevalent view. If we assume that it is so, a
very little calculation will show that matter at the depth of
say 30 miles is subject to an enormous pressure, to which we
can find no parallel by experimental methods at the surface.
30 miles = 158,400 feet ; so that if we estimate that a column
of the crust of the earth one inch square has a mean weight
per foot of 1*5 pounds, the pressure at the depth of 30 miles
will be in round numbers not less than 100 tons per square
inch, or 14,400 tons per square foot.            It has been proved by
the experiments         of the late Mr. Hopkins that there is in
certain solids a relation between the melting-point and the
pressure ; so that, if the rock at the depth of 30 miles is at a
temperature sufficient to melt it under ordinary pressures at
the surface, the additional pressure of 100 tons per square
inch may solidify it by raising its melting-point, or at least
render it plastic.        If the pressure increase more rapidly than
the temperature as the earth is penetrated, what may be only
semi-solid at 30 miles may become rigid at greater depths.
    These points, from their nature, are incapable of direct
demonstration, but possess a high degree of probability.
                         Shell of Greatest Mobility.
    Although not accepting the hypothesis that there is a fluid
zone under the Earth's crust, it would follow from the pre-
ceding considerations that the shell occupying the space be
tween the solid rigid crust and the compressed rigid nucleus
would respond to changes of pressure or temperature more
readily than either the crust or the nucleus.

    The deposits out of which great mountain-ranges have been
elaborated by foldings, intrusions, and upheavals are not con
fined to the ranges and their immediate neighbourhood, but
extend over vast areas.     Speaking generally, modern geo
logical investigation goes to prove that the thickest deposits
lie, or have lain, towards the axes of the chains, though they
may have been denuded from the actual axes*.        Beyond the

in which these materials for mountain-building were accumu
lated, were in some cases, on the final completion of sedi
mentation, double the depth of the deepest known oceanic
 troughs, which do not reach more than 5 miles.
    Considering that there is a strong development of Cre
taceous and Tertiary rocks extending along the western coast
of North and South America, it is seen that these operations
have there been carried on on an unusual scale.         Deposit and
alteration of level, elevation and subsidence, but preponder
antly subsidence, progressed for an immense length of geo
logical time in these areas, occupying not a mean portion of
the Earth's history.
    It is not, however, to be assumed that this was a continuous
trough at any one time, rather that it consisted of a series of
connected basins which underwent independent changes of
level, the area being part of the time low-lying land inter
changing with conditions of submergence.
  Volcanic Action often Contemporaneous with the Laying-down
                of Materials for Mountain-Building.
    Contemporaneous     intrusive sheets of volcanic rock are a
common occurrence in some part of the sedimentary history
of a mountain-range.       In addition, it is frequently found that
volcanic ashes laid down in water, or subaerially, have a
large development in rocks composing mountain-ranges ; and
necessarily, if these occur, dykes and volcanic rocks of the
same age must exist in the foundation materials of the range.
                     Dynamical Principles.
    Every theory which has hitherto been proposed to account
for the elevation of mountains and the folding of the stratified
beds forming the Earth's crust hinges finally on changes of tem
perature. Thus the tangential force generated in a rigid crust
of low temperature by the cooling and shrinking of the Earth's
nucleus has been invoked to account for the crumpling of the
crust into mountain-ranges ; the crumpled skin of a dried
apple being the stock illustration.         In this case, the force
called in is continuous contraction by loss of heat.     The theory
which 1 have elaborated is one dependent upon alternations
of temperature in the crust, contraction and expansion both
being agents of uplift and lateral pressure.
     Basins of Deposition and Loading of the Earth's Crust.
    It has already been shown that the establishment of basins
of deposition is the condition precedent to the building of a

 Effects of   the   Rise of Temperature      on the Foundation Rocks.
                                 Initial Stage.
    The section of the crust of the Earth weighted and heated
at the same time will be subjected to a gradually increasing
compressive stress.     So long as the actual expansive force of
the heated crust is insufficient to raise the weight of sediment
                          it,
being piled upon          will continue to sink, though subject
                          it
to vertical pulsations of level due to other causes, which                it   is
not my object to treat of here.        But there will eventually
come   a  time when the accumulated stresses of the expanding
rocks will overcome the weight of sediment, and then the
upheaval, folding, and building of the mountain-chain will
begin. But      it  not to be supposed that the rise of tempera

volcanic action often contributes to the foundation materials
 ofa    mountain-range, and that intrusive sheets and dykes
 penetrate the sediments, and ash-beds are laid down before
 the initial movement ushering in the birth of the range takes
 place.   It evident from this that there will be great varia

   When once the elevation initiated only by piling-up of
sediment, the sinking of the crust, and its consequent heating

a movement of the interior heated matter of the earth must
take place towards the axis or axes of the range.       This is
proved  by  the frequency of granitic cores  in great mountain-
ranges, by the volcanic action accompanying their elevation,
and its persistence or recurrence in a range even late on in
its history, as instanced by the Andes, Rockies, and the
mountains of the Caucasus, where volcanic cones surmount
some of the highest granitic peaks, showing that these are the
lines of least resistance through which the interior forces of
the    Earth expend themselves.
   Heating of    the Rocks of a Mountain-Range recurrent and
               constantly renetced during its History.
   It  is thus seen that the heated interior matter of the Earth
is constantly being drawn towards and injected into the
constituent framework of a mountain-range.         When once the
elevation of the sediments consolidated into rocky matter in
the earth-trough begins through the influence of lateral
pressure and the expanding mass beneath, a reduction of
pressure and increase of volume takes place in the underlying
fused rock.        The compressive stresses of the rigid rock are
partially    relieved  by folding and upward flow, and the tempe
rature    of the   mass falls.  Additional fused matter has been
drawn from the interior, and in process of time the rocks of
the range begin again to rise in temperature.         Such fluctu
ations of temperature are well shown in the intermittent
character of volcanic action. After a great outflow of lava,
a volcano is quiescent sometimes for centuries.      It has lost so
 much matter and so much heat, but the forces accumulate
during the time of quiescence to burst forth with renewed
vigour.       Such intermittent activity I conceive is what takes
 place   on   a larger scale in the history of a mountain-range,
 but with greater time-intervals.
        Dynamical Effect on   the   Strata of   the   Crust   ly Rise of
                              Temperature.
      The effect of a rise of temperature on the rocks of the Earth
 is,  excepting in the case of unconsolidated clays, to increase

their bulk.       From     a  great number of experiments made by
ine on sandstone, slate, limestone, and marble,          I have estimated
the coefficient of expansion of average rock at 2-75 feet lineal
per mile for every rise of 100° Fahr. ; but there is every
reason to believe that the coefficient of expansion rises at
higher temperatures than those at which my experiments
were conducted.           It has been urged by some of my critics
        I
that have not allowed for the compression of the sediments
filling the earth-trough into denser masses, but have credited
all the expansion to mountain-building *.              It has been over
looked that      I  have already explained that the weight of the
mass alone will, by compressive extension, consolidate the
beds below by reducing their thickness.                 Also the denser
 sedimentary      rocks   are often  denser  only by  infiltration.  This
 is particularly the case with sandstones, where the conversion
 into the final stage of quartzite is by the deposit of secondary
 silica in the interspaces of the grains, not by condensation.
     (Jlays contract on heating ; but, according to my views,
 the contraction of such beds in an earth-trough will be vertical
 only, by reason of the superimposed weight.                   A stage of
 metamorphism         is at least arrived at, as we see in clay-slate,
 when the materials of that rock, originally clay, become meta
 morphosed so as to behave like other rocks, and expand with
 a rise of temperature.
     Even if these criticisms possess much force, they do not
 apply to the rocky crust of the Earth already consolidated
 forming the earth-trough in which the sediments are laid
 down.       There will be little or no loss by condensation in them,
  only straining or change of form. It is obvious that deep-
  seated rocks must be so compressed by simple gravitation,
  that lateral pressure will have little effect in further con
  densing them.
             Recurrent Expansion Cumulative in its Effects.
      If a given area of the crust of the Earth is raised in tempe
  rature, when the limit of elasticity is reached the surplus
  material must be disposed of by a change of form : it will rise
  in the line of least resistance.
     Assume that the surplus due to the cubical expansion of a
  horizontal sheet is thrown into a ridge, and that then a fall of
  temperature      takes place to the same extent.           The material
  ridged up     can  never   be drawn   back  again ;   it becomes  a per-

                      Answers   to some Objections.
   The object of this outline of my theory is to focus its
salient points, as many of ray critics for some reason or other
have failed to grasp them.     What they criticise is frequently
not my theory, but some rather vague notion called the
"                      "            What is exactly covered by
  Herschel-Babbage       theory.
this description  I  have a difficulty in ascertaining.   On the
other hand, one writer calls Mr. 0. Fisher's theory, with
which mine has no analogy, the " Herschel-Babbage
                                                        "
                                                          theory.
I trust I shall give no otfence by repudiating this labelling
and claiming the theory as my own.
   Neither Herschel, Scrope, nor Babbage ever advanced so
far as to elaborate what could be justly called a theory of
Mountain-Building. They gave to the world some fruitful
suggestions, and acute reasoning thereon, which have been of
considerable use to n succession of speculators in Geological
Physics, and to myself among the rest *.        One of the most
frequently urged objections      to  my theory is the supposed
inadequacy of expansion by rise of temperature to account
for the excessive folding some mountain-chains have under
gone, linear expansion only being considered.        My reply to
this is that even linear expansion alone places at our disposal
more lateral movement than any other theory.           It is true
that those speculators who have invoked tangential thrust
through the assumed shrinking of the Earth's nucleus, have
had at their command any amount of lateral movement their
imagination liked to draw upon, hence the simplicity and
 success of the theory — for a time.      It has, however, been
shown pretty clearly that the Bank upon which these cheques
have been drawn is one of very limited liability        and quite

    Prof. Hutton, in his very able address to Section      of theC
 Melbourne Meeting of the Australasian Association for the
 Advancement of Science, gives an excellent re'sumd of the
 various hypotheses that have been suggested to account for
 Mountain-Building.       1 confidently appeal to his description
 to show that, omitting the theory of secular contraction of the
 Earth's nucleus, which he disposes of very effectually, none of

support provides any lateral movement other than that due to
intrusions of molten rock.
    Prof. Hutton, in his description of my theory, doubtless
given in the greatest good faith, leaves out what are in mv
view some of its vital and essential portions.        gave as anI
illustration the cubical expansion of an area of rock 500 x
500 x 20 miles, and showed that it would, if raised 1000°
Fahr., have an effective increase of bulk of 52,135 cubic
miles *.    Prof. Hutton seems to assume that this is the Alpha
and   Omega    of my theory — the beginning and the end. I
cannot but think it strange that he should take this view, a?
one of the first chapters       f
                            details illustrative experiments to
give the reader the first conception of recurrent expansion.
    The fact  is,that there  no limit to the lateral movement
                                is
provided by recurrent expansion, excepting the natural limit
of the number and intensity of the successive changes of
temperature.
 I  can assure Prof. Hutton that      had advanced no further
                                         ifI
than the single constructive conception of cubical expansion
as an agent in Mountain-Building, in itself original — or, at all
events, not contained in the Herschel, Babbage, Scrope, or

   The object of this Outline being to correct some prevalent
misconceptions of my views,          Ihave confined myself prin
cipally to restating in a shorter form the essential principles
of my theory of mountain-formation by sedimentary loading
and cumulative recurrent expansion.           For all the details,
proofs,   illustrations, and   numerical  calculations     must, as

before stated, refer those interested to the original work.
Perhaps  it    may lead some who have already read the Origin       it, '

its lucidity.     Honest criticism, even      if

  LXI.    Allotropiv Silver. — Part   111.  Blue Silver, soluble and
               insoluble forms.    By  M.   Carey  Lea*.
                my first paper on the subject of allotropic silver
 WHEN      was   published about two years ago, that product
seemed to be the result of a very limited number of reactions
closely allied to one another.       Further study has shown that
it is a much more common product than at first appeared to
be the case.      Wherever in the reduction of silver a reddish
colour shows itself, that may be taken as a probable indication
that allotropic silver has been formed, even although it may
be destroyed     before it can be isolated.
    What is rather remarkable, is that allotropic silver is pro
duced abundantly in certain very familiar reactions in which
its presence has never been suspected : so abundantly, in fact,
that some of these reactions constitute the best methods of
obtaining silver in the soluble form. In photographic opera
tions silver has often been reduced by tannin in the presence
of alkalies. It has not been imagined that by slightly varying
the conditions, the whole of the silver may be made to pass
into solution as a soluble metal with its characteristic intense
blood-red colour.
   Some of these new         reactions will   be  here  described    in
detail.
       Allotropic Silver formed by Dextrine and Alkaline
                              Hydroxide.
    When dextrine is dissolved in a solution of potassium or
sodium hydroxide, and silver nitrate is added, keeping the
hydroxide in moderate excess, the silver is at first thrown
down in the form of the well-known brown oxide.           This brown
colour presently changes to a reddish-chocolate shade, and at
the same time the silver begins to dissolve.        In a few minutes
the whole has dissolved to a deep-red colour, so intense as to
be almost black.        A few drops poured into water give it a
splendid red colour of perfect transparency. Examination
with the spectroscope leaves no doubt that we have to do with
a true solution.
   It is interesting to observe that silver can be held in solu
tion in neutral, acid, and alkaline liquids.      In the first process
which   I  published, in which silver citrate is reduced by a
mixture of sodic citrate, and ferrous sulphate, the latter may
be used either in acid solution, or it may be first neutralized
with alkaline hydroxide, so that that form of silver is held in
solution in either a neutral or an acid liquid.        The form that

498                    Mr. M. Carey Lea on
is obtained with the aid    of dextrine dissolves most freely in
the strongly alkaline liquid in which it is produced, and when
dilute nitric or sulphuric acid is added, the silver is preci
pitated.    But with acetic acid the precipitation is very in
complete : the solution retains a brown colour, and contains
silver. Even the addition of a large excess of strong acetic
acid fails to throw down any more silver. It follows, there
fore, that whilst this form of silver is most freely soluble in a
strongly alkaline liquid it is also soluble, to some 6xtent, in
 one that is either neutral or acid.
     The precipitate, when once formed, appears to be almost
insoluble. A small portion of it stirred up with distilled water
gives no indication of solution. But if a quantity is thrown
on a filter and washed, as soon as the mother-water is washed
 out, the liquid runs through of a muddy red ; and if this
 filtrate be allowed to stand, it deposits an insoluble portion,
 and then has a fine rose-red colour and perfect transparency.
 Notwithstanding the beautiful colour, it contains a trace of
 silver only, so great is the colouring-power of the metal.
 Sometimes, if the alkaline solution stands for a month or two,
 the silver becomes spontaneously insoluble ; most of it falls
 to the bottom as a deep-red substance, but part remains in
 suspension, with a bright brick-red colour.         The difference
 between this and the true solution as originally formed is
 extremely well marked.
     Dextrine is a very variable substance, and different speci
 mens act very differently.      Common brown dextrine seems
 to do better than the purified forms.
     Convenient proportions are as follows : — In 2 litres of water
 40 grammes of sodium hydroxide may be dissolved and an
 equal quantity of dextrine, filtering if necessary.   28 grammes
 of silver nitrate are to be dissolved in a small quantity of
 water, and added by degrees at intervals.       Complete solution
 readily takes place.    Although the liquid contains less than
 1 per cent, of metallic silver, it appears absolutely black,
 when diluted red, by great dilution yellowish.         With some
 specimens of dextrine the solution remains clear ; with others
it soon becomes a little turbid.
     Perhaps the most interesting reaction which this solution
shows is that with disodic phosphate.        A little phosphate is
 sufficient to  throw down  the whole of the silver, although both
 solutions are alkaline.   When a gramme of phosphate in solu
 tion is added to 100 cub. centim. of silver solution, the colour
 becomes bright red, sometimes scarlet, and the whole of the
 silver is presently precipitated. This precipitate on the filter
has a colour like that of ruby copper, which colour it retains
during the first washing ; but after a few hours' washiug with

distilled water, the colour changes to a deep Nile-green, and
at the same time it becomes slightly soluble, giving a port-
wine coloured solution. With more washing, this solubility
may disappear.
    It is a general fact that all these forms of silver, however
various their colour, have both a body- and a surface-colour ;
and these two colours tend always to be complementary. The
body-colour is that shown by the precipitate while still moist ;
it is also visible when a thin coat is brushed over paper, a coat
so thin that light passes through                   it,

when the substance itself becomes green b}r continued washing,
it   assumes, on drying, a dark gold or copper colour, the
surface-colour changing with the body-colour and maintain
ing its complementary relation. In observing these effects
one  is   constantly reminded of certain coal-tar colours, both
by the great intensity of coloration and by the metallic surface-
colour.   I    am not aware that any other inorganic substance
shows this resemblance to           similar extent.

      Allotropic Silver obtained with Tannin and Alkaline
                                         Carbonates.
   Tannin (gallotannic acid) in alkaline solution reduces silver
nitrate to metallic silver in the allotropic form. Tannin acts
more strongly than dextrine, and therefore does best with
carbonated alkali, dextrine best with alkaline hydroxide,
although either substance will produce the reaction with
either form of alkali and, though less advantageously, with
ammonia. Tannin with sodium carbonate gives a very perfect
solution of silver, quite free from the turbidity that is apt to

 spread on paper vary very much in their relations to light ;
 some are readily converted into the yellow intermediate form,
 whilst others are very insensitive, The least sensitive speci
 mens seemed to be those for which dilute nitric acid had
 been used as a precipitant : they had a steel-grey colour.
 Precipitation by acetic acid seems to tend to a greenish
 metallic surface, colour, and greater sensitiveness.      Different
 specimens also vary very much as to permanency ; this cha
 racter is also affected by the amount of washing received :
 thorough washing tends to permanency.
    In some way the blue, grey, and green forms seem more
closely related to the black or dark grey forms of normal
 silver, for they tend, in time, to pass into them ; whilst, on
 the contrary, gold-coloured silver, if pure, tends, with time,
to change to bright white normal silver on the surface with
 dark, or even black, silver underneath.
                     Action of other Carbonates.
    Tannin is capable of producing allotropic silver, not only in
the presence of the carbonates of potassium and sodium, but
also with those of lithium and ammonium, and also with the
carbonates of calcium, magnesium, barium, and strontium.
                                                                     J
Tho action of the last-named carbonate has been more par-
ticularly examined.        It yields allotropic silver of a dark-red
colour whilst moist, drying with a rich bluish-green metallic
surface-colour in thick films, in very thin films transparent
red.     It is probable that the substances with which tannin
produces      these reactions     would be further increased b\
investigation.
    I  have found some additional modes of production of these
                        ...
forms of silver, modes which are very curious and inter
esting. They are now being studied, and will be reported on
hereafter.
              Nature of   the
                              " Intermediate Substance."
  i
  V It  has been mentioned      in previous papers that when allo
tropic silver is converted into normal silver by the action of
heat, it passes through a perfectly well-marked intermediate
state.    In this state it retains the gold-yellow colour and high
lustre, but none of the other properties of the original form.
Oxidizing and chlorizing agents show nearly the same indif
ference as with ordinary silver.         Whilst allotropic silver is
soft and easily reduced to powder, the intermediate sub
stance is hard and tough.         When a glass rod is drawn over a
film of allotropic silver, it leaves behind it a white trace of
ordinary silver. The intermediate substance shows no such

502                       Mr. M. Carey Lea on
reaction : the trace of a glass rod does not differ from the
rest of the film ; and even hard burnishing produces no change
in the colour. Continued exposure to sunlight brings about
 the same alteration to the intermediate form, and it takes
 place spontaneously with time.
      At that time no explanation could be found as to the nature
 of the change.        It proves, however, to be a passage into a
 crystalline    form.    Some films spread on paper were exposed
 to the action of very dilute solution of ferric chloride.         It
 chanced that one of these films had undergone a partial
 change into the intermediate form ; the unchanged portion
 was darkened by the ferric solution, whilst the portion that
 had passed into the intermediate form retained its bright gold-
  yellow colour and lustre, rendering it thus distinguishable.
 The figures which it exhibited were strikingly crystalline.
  One portion showed a foliated structure, such as is formed
  by interpenetrating crystals ; other parts showed ramifica
  tions with something of a plant-like form. Another part
  exhibited a sheaf of acicular crystals nearly parallel in direc
  tion half an inch to an inch long, and as fine as hairs. These
  appearances indicated with certainty crystalline structure.
  Otl ler specimens have been obtained, though none so well
  defined as that just mentioned, which happened to be taken
  at exactly the right stage of spontaneous alteration to make
  the structure manifest.       The alteration is not apparent to the
  eye,   as the  colour  does not change.
      This change to the crystalline condition does not seem
  to be peculiar to gold-coloured silver. The blue form, when
  gently heated in a tube, becomes yellow. \ By continued heat
  it changes to white normal silver. A film on glass began to
  change from blue to yellow at abojut 180°       C   Light also pro
   duces this change     on blue silver.  The  specimens obtained by
   different processes act very differently ; some change with a
   few hours of strong sunlight, others require many days.
       From what has been written in this and preceding papers,
   it appears     that allotropie and even soluble silver may be
   formed in a great variety' of reactions.      The reducing agent
   may be either a ferrous or a stannous salt, or any one of a
   variety of organic substances of very different constitutions.
    From the solubility and activity of this substance and the
    parallelism which many of its reactions show to those of silver
    in combination,    I have been disposed to think that silver in
    solution might, like silver in combination, exist in the atomic
    form.    It is certain that, up to the present time, we have no

                            Allotropic Silver.                       503
positive knowledge of the existence of any element in the
atomic form as a solid.        We know that four or five metals are
atomic in their vapours, and that in iodine vapour at a certain
temperature the molecules separate into atoms.
    But it may be questioned whether we have not seen solid
elements in the atomic form without recognizing them as such.
There are forms of iron, nickel, cobalt, and lead which exhibit
very remarkable properties, properties that have been hitherto
very unsatisfactorily explained. Lead tartrate reduced by
gentle ignition in a nearly closed tube, and allowed to cool and
then shaken out into the air, forms a stream of fire.         The oxides
of iron, nickel, and cobalt reduced in closed tubes by hydrogen
show similar properties.        It is customary to explain this action
by affirming that the metals are left in an extremely fine
state of division.      This explanation is not satisfactory. Sul
phur, for example, is far more inflammable than any of the
metals just mentioned, and may be obtained in a state of
exceedingly fine division, either by sublimation or by preci
pitation ; but does not, in consequence, show any greater ten
dency to spontaneous inflammation.             It seems more natural
to suppose that these metals are reduced in the atomic form ;
and this view of the matter seems to be much strengthened by
the following considerations.
     The experiments of Ramsey and of Heycock and Neville,
cited in a previous paper, lead to the conclusion that in the
case of a dilute solution of one metal in another the dissolved
 metal exists in the atomic form.          But still more," the experi
ments of Tammann on amalgams indicate that in these alloys
the dissolved metal is atomic ; and it is stated that Joule, by
distilling off the mercury from an iron amalgam, found that
 the iron was left in a pyrophoric condition.         The amalgam of
manganese,        carefully distilled, gives a pyrophoric powder.
 Chromium amalgam, distilled in a current of hydrogen, gives
a similar result if the temperature is not raised too high.           The
 enormous affinity which these forms of metals exhibit for
 oxygen renders their study very difficult.           It has not been
 before suggested that their activity is due to their being
 atomic ; but this would seem to be a much more rational ex
 planation than that of extreme division *. A broad distinction
 must of course be drawn between chemical and mechanical
 division : a substance may be atomic and yet appear in masses ;
may be in the finest mechanical division and yet be molecular
    •
       M. G. Rousseau, in the new Eneycloptdie CMmique, seems to entirely
 abandon the old view of extreme division, and considers these forms to be
 allotropic, and comparable with the allotropic forms of phosphorus, &c,

or polymerized.      Silver being a metal with a very low affinity
for oxygen, could not be expected to show in the atomic state
the same inflammability as more oxidable metals.
   In conclusion, it may be said that there is much reason to
suppose that elements may exist in the atomic form, and that
allotropic silver may present such a case. This           course,                       as      of

tive enough, and if it is made high the electrometer no longer

the force exercised by the first quadrant a in the positive
direction is k y3, where k is the constant of the instrument.
This constant may be omitted, and the force denoted by ?/2.
The force exercised by h is— (y—x)3 ; by c, — (y—x)3 ; and by
d,y3.      The total force is thus 2 (2y—x) x. The needle contact
may      now    be moved from y to x and another reading taken.
This is of course 2 x3. Subtracting this from the first reading,
we get 4 {y—x) x} which is the power token by W.                  This is
the arrangement that was adopted by Dr. Hopkinson in his
 measurements of the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer in 1884.
 During the first reading the instrument is really two idio-
 static voltmeters, one being in shunt to both the resistance
 and W, and the other in shunt to W alone.             During the second
 reading it is a voltmeter in shunt to the resistance alone.
     Professor Ayrton arranges the instrument so that the quad
 rants are in shunt to W, and the needle is first connected to x
 and a reading taken, and the needle is then connected to 0
 and a second reading taken.               During the first reading, the
 instrument is a voltmeter in shunt to W, and during the second
 it is two voltmeters, one in shunt to the resistance and one
in shunt to the whole circuit. The difference again gives the
 power spent in W.                Mr. Smith uses a discharge-key for
 making a change quickly.                The discharge-key can be used
 in either arrangement, but the first is more accurate.              For
 instance, suppose y— x, the pressure on W, is 2000 volts, and
 x, the pressure on the resistance, 20, and suppose the instru
 ment one per cent, low at one reading. The first reading by
 the second method is 8,000,000, the second 8,160,000.           Suppose
 the latter is read one per cent, low, viz. 8,078,400, the result
 ing determination is 78,400 instead of 160,000 ; that is to say,
 the power is more than 100 per cent, greater than that given
 by the instrument.            In the arrangement used by Dr. Hopkin
 son, however,         the    readings are 160,800 and 800, so a mis
  reading of one per cent, in the first makes one per cent, error
  only, and in the second makes no sensible difference.
      The quadrant electrometer may, however, be arranged so
  as to rend power directly without any change of connexions.
  This is shown in fig. 2. A second resistance equal to the
  first is put on the other side of W, and the quadrants are con
  nected up as shown.             The first quadrant a then has a force
  y3,  the  second    b, —      —
                            (y x)°. So far the instrument is like that
  shown     in fig. , but with only half its quadrant utilized.

  There may be some slight error due to the whole needle
being drawn into the quadrants a and b, and out of c and d.
This is obviated by making the needle of such a shape that
there is no appreciable end pull, as shown in fig. 2.

form has four pairs of half-disks.    The Blondlot and Curie
form also reads power directly, but the needle is made in two
insulated portions, and needs two metallic connexions, and
this gives rise to mechanical troubles and loss of sensitiveness.
The instrument shown in fig. 3 has the needle all in one
piece, and the disks can be so far apart that errors from varia
tions of height of the needle due to variations of the length of
the fibre do not become serious.    A long suspension of phos

LXIII.      Alternating and Experimental Influence-Maclune. By
           Mr. James Wimshurst, Member of Council*.
I    HAVE pleasure in bringing to your notice a new form of
       influence-machine which is self-exciting, notwithstanding
that when at work its electrical charges alternate during each
revolution.
   In order that you may readily follow the action of the
machine when at work          Iwill first describe its construction in
all its details.
    It consists of a base or frame, from the sides of which rise
the standards to carry the spindle and boss for the rotating
disk, suitable driving gear being fixed thereto.
    In the same plane as the rotating disk is fixed a square
wooden frame having the necessary holes, plugs, and clamps,
by means of which the inductor-plates are held in position.
    The rotating disks are cut from ordinary window glass, and
are coated with shellac ; they are 16 inches in diameter ; one of
them has no metal upon             the next has four medium-sized
                                      it,
tin-foil sectors upon each of its sides, the last of this series has
 16 sectors upon each side other disks have from
                                  ;                     2   to sectors
                                                             4
of large size upon them              another disk has four large
                                       ;
sectors upon each side, so placed that the sectors upon
one side cover those upon the other side          ;   another has four
very narrow sectors upon each side, and another has 16 sectors
all upon the one side.
    The inductor-plates are squares of glass measuring       9$  inches;
 one corner of the plate      iscut away to admit the spindle and
 the boss.     They are coated with shellac, and upon one side of
 each of them   is   atin-foil patch, and   a suitable device for hold
 ing  the   rod and  the brush.
    Two of these inductor-plates are mounted at the diagonal
 corners, upon one side of the wooden frame, and two upon the
 other side of the frame      ;those at the front of the machine are
 at the lower right-hand corner and the upper left-hand corner        ;
 those at the back of the machine are at the upper right-hand

disks which have           metal upon them are freely self-exciting.

  In   respect   tothe electrical action which takes place       this     in

changes which take place between the two bounding surfaces,

          Focometry of Diverging Lens-Combinations.          511
we obtain by induction an excess of electricity upon the far
surface B of the rotating disk : this excess in its turn is con
veyed by the brush and its holder to the next inductor C, which
in its turn repeats the operation, and so on with each in
ductor, for the inductors are, as you see, situated alternately,
the first upon one side, and the next upon the other side of
the rotating disk.     These excesses of electricity seated upon
the rotating disk, opposite to the inductors, may be viewed
as wave-crests, while the corresponding depressions are under
the surface of the inductor. All that is done by the machine
is to produce this wave-action in the electrical coating or
film ; for there is no metallic connexion between inductor and
inductor, nor between the machine and the earth : moreover,
all the inductors are charged with electricity of one sign,
although, probably, the potential in one inductor may be
slightly different to that in the other.
    The alternations are possibly caused by the repulsion
 between the electrical charges upon the disk and the inductor,
and the consequent slipping of the electrical film upon the
inductor in such manner as to produce a break in the phase
 of the wave in relation to the brushes.
    LXIV.    The Focometry of Diverging Lens- Combinations.
                By Professor A. Anderson, M.A*
         reading the abstract of a paper by Prof. S. P. Thomp
 ON son,      " On the
                        Focometry of Lenses and Lens-Combi
 nations, and on a new Focometer," in the ' Proceedings of
 the Royal Society,' vol. xlix., no. 298. it occurred to me that
 the same principles are applicable to the case of diverging,
 or positive, combinations, and that the method might be
 modified so as to make it capable of measuring the focal lengths
 and finding the positions of the principal points of such
 combinations.
    Let light be incident from right to left on the surface A at
 a small distance from its vertex, the direction of the light
 being inclined at a small angle to the axis, and let Fj and F2
 be the principal loci.   Then, distances being measured to the
 right  from   Hj  and   Ha,   the principal points, we have the
 ordinary formula
                             1_1 _1

    Hence,  if u = -2<U+017F>, v=2f; or, if light    converge to a point Si
   such that HIS1=2f, it will, after passing through the com
   bination, diverge from Sº, where H2S2=2f.          S1 and Ss are
   the symmetric points, and it is clear that S, FIE F.S. = f.
       The combination A B should be fixed on a support which
   is capable of a lateral motion at right angles to the length of
   the optical bench, so that the axis of the combination may be
   placed in or out of the axial plane of the bench at pleasure.
   The additional parts required are two supports which can
   slide along the bench, each furnished with a convex lens and
   cross wires.    The line joining the intersections of the cross
   wires should be parallel to the bench and coincident with the
   axes of the lenses and that of the combination when in the
   axial plane. The lenses should be of exactly the same focal
   length, and the cross wires of both should be placed outside
   (or away from the combination) at equal distances, greater
   than this focal length, from the lenses.        It would be an
   advantage if the positions of the cross wires could be altered
   relatively to the lenses, but in making a measurement they
   should be at equal distances from them.
       Suppose, now, the focal length of a diverging combination
   has to be measured.      A telescope furnished with cross wires,
   and which has been focused for parallel rays, is used to view
   the cross wires of one support through the convex lens of
   that support and the combination, the support being moved
   along the bench till the cross wires are seen without parallax.
   The combination is then moved out of the axial plane, and
   the position of the image of the cross wires formed by the
   rays passing through the convex lens observed.        This gives
   one of the focal points, and the position of the other can be
   found in the same way, using the other sliding support.
   Transparent micrometers may now be placed at these points,
   as in Prof. Thompson's method.       The two supports are then
   placed so that their cross wires are at equal distances from the
   micrometers, and moved along the bench through equal dis
   tances in opposite directions till the image of the cross wires
   of one support coincides with the cross wires of the other, the
   combination having of course been previously moved back
   into the axial plane. The combination is then again moved
   out of the axial plane, and the micrometers are moved till
   the images of the cross wires are seen in them.     The distance
   moved through by either is the focal length of the com
   bination.
      It should, if necessary, be possible to remove the convex
   lenses and replace them by others more suitable for the actual
   combination to be measured.       Of course the apparatus with

out the sliding supports may be used for finding the focal
length and principal points of a convex combination.
    It would, no doubt, be easy to construct the apparatus so
that the same screw could move both the pair of sliding sup
ports and the pair of micrometers independently.                  But it
seems a simpler method, after first finding the principal foci,
to obtain with only one of the convex lenses an image of its
cross wires on a suitably placed screen, by rays passing
through both the lens and the combination. The position of
the conjugate focus of this image can then be found by moving
the combination out of the axial plane and obtaining the image
of the cross wires formed by rays passing through the convex
lens alone.      The distances of these conjugate points from the
principal foci are then measured, and the focal length is given
by the formula dd!=fi.
    A support of the kind described above, furnished with a
convex lens and cross wires, would be required in many cases
for determining the focal or symmetric points of positive or
negative systems ; but in no case would a knowledge of the
focal length of the lens or any calculation involving it be
necessary.

           together and briefly indicate their contents,
    (i.) is a short course which the author has used in his own
 classes for many years, so that it represents what an experienced
teacher has found suitable for junior pupils.          It deals with the
fundamental theorems of Harmonic pencils and " Cross Batios " in
a clear manner, and after a brief look at Linkages introduces the
student to the simpler properties of the Conic Sections.        The book
furnishes a good introduction to Housel, Dr. C. Taylor, and other
writers on the subject.
    (ii.) is an account, of the Circles and Lines discussed, with proofs
that must satisfy the most rigid adherent of Euclidian methods.

p. 385 there is a too general statement which requires correction
(see first five lines).
   (iii.) We like this second instalment of the Elements better
even than we liked the previous one.         Mr. Taylor's treatment in
parts differs from that of other writers, there being a good deal
of rearrangement in the first twelve propositions, but the matter
treated of agrees in substance with that given in Euclid's first
twelve propositions.      Ptolemy's theorem (the so-called Euc. vi. »)
comes    in as Prop. 37 b, being prefaced by Prop. 37 a. There is
also an interesting additional proposition which involves the prin
ciple of the rotation of a plane figure about a point in its plane.
There are also some propositions on Poles and Polars, on Kadieal
Axes, on Orthogonal Circles, and on the Nine-point Circle of a
Triangle.     The carefully selected examples are a valuable feature
of a good elementary edition of the ' Elements.'
                                                                  " first a
   (iv.) The idea of this capital [little book of Eiders is :
deduction is worked out in full, which is intended to serve as a
model for the student.       This is followed by a number of similar
deductions, which are to be written out by the student, the figure
being given in each case, and such hints regarding the mode of
solution as experience shows are required by beginners.            Lastly,
each section contains some deductions to be accomplished without
this aid, no figures or assistance being given except an occasional
reference to the proposition on which the proof depends, or to a
previous example."       It will be thus seen that the idea is an excel
lent one for the majority of young students, and it is very well
carried out. The abundance of good figures is a strong feature.
After working through all the exercises we can strongly recommend
the book, the only drawback that we see being that few can give
so much time to the thorough getting up one book of the Elements
as is involved in working out all the deductions.        The student, or
his teacher t or him, must make a selection if he has not time.        This
we think we can guarantee, that when he has worked through this
collection, he will make short work of the major part of the
deductions which he will meet with in ordinary school examinations.

                 de Fodob. (Leipzig: A. Hartleben.)
Tue series of which the present volume forms a part contains
some excelleut treatises on various subjects connected with electro-
technics written      by competent continental       specialists.    It is
greatly to be regretted that they are not accessible to the majority
of English readers on account of their being written in German.
So far as we are aware only one of them (viz. Tumlirz on
Potential) has been translated into English ; but it would well repay
any one who can spare the time to make translations of some of
the other volumes, aud certainly of the one before us.
   The problem of the measurement of electricity for commercial
and domestic purposes is one which so far has only been very un
satisfactorily and incompletely solved, although the demand for

  a really workable and reliable electricity meter is already great and
  daily increases. The author endeavours in this little hand-book to
  give a clear idea of the principles and details of construction and
  action of the various forms of meter for quantity, power, and
  energy, which are or have been in practical use both here and
  abroad. The figures are extremely well executed and help largely
  to a clear understanding of the apparatus.            At the end of the
  book will be found a summary of the conditions under which
  electrical energy is supplied in various cities, and the charges which
  are made for it.     Indeed no pains have been spared to make the
  volume as handy and yet as complete as possible, and we would again
  urge the desirability of its translation into English.          J. L. H.

    NOTE ON THE ELECTRICAL             CONDUCTIVITY     OF   HOT GASES.
 GENTLEMEN,                                       Cambridge,  May  14, 1891.
         reference to Dr. Arrhenius' remarks in the paper with the
 IN     above title in the last number of the 'Philosophical Magazine,'
 1 have to observe : —
     1. With regard to the question as to the action of an excess of
 hydrogen on the dissociation of HI, HBr, or HC1 : though Dr.
 Arrhenius says that such an excess neednot diminish the dissociation,
 the question is not really an open one, as Lemoine's experiments
 (C. R. lxxxv. pp. 34-37) have proved that as a matter of fact an
 excess of hydrogen produces a large diminution in the dissociation
 of HI.
    2. Dr. Arrhenius attributes the conductivities of the hot HC1,
 HBr, HI, which        I  observed to the production of platinum dust
by the action of the halogens on the platinum of the vessel in
which the gases were contained, and also upon the electrodes.             As,
however, the experiments were made in earthenware as well as
in platinum vessels, and with carbon, gold, and iron electrodes as
 well as platinum ones, this explanation is quite inadmissible.
Again, not only the halogens, but also the vapours of most metals
conduct when hot, and this whether surrounded by nitrogen or
air. In my experiments the effect of surrounding the gas by
nitrogen instead of air was always tried.
    3. With reference to Crafts's experiments on the dissociation of
the halogens,     I may observe that a trace of dissociation would
produce a much greater effect on the conductivity than on the
vapour-density, and that the temperature vaguely described as
yellow heat extends over a wide range, and two temperatures, each
of which might by different observers be described as yellow heat,
might easily differ by several hundred degrees Centigrade.

               PROPAGATION OF HERTZ’s osCILLATIONS IN AIR.
                   BY MM. E. SARASIN AND L. DE LA RIVE.
   We have had the honour of presenting to the Academy the first
results which we obtained in repeating the beautiful experi
ments of M. Hertz on rapid electrical oscillations (Comptes Rendus,
Jan. 13, 1890). We there limited ourselves to the case in which
the electrical oscillation is transmitted along a conducting wire.
We have since then repeated another of M. Hertz's experiments,
which consists in following the propagation of electrical induction
through air in the absence of any metallic conductor.            The
primary exciter is placed in front of, and parallel to, a large plane
                                                                                                                           a it,
metal surface; the electrical oscillations which proceed from
travelling through air, reach the metal surface, which acts                                                            as
mirror; the reflected waves form then, with the direct waves,
a  system     stationary waves, the first node
                    of                               which         the                   of                  is   at
mirror.
     In   order        to
                  examine the system           vibrations which are set up
                                                                 of
in   front       of
                the   mirror,  the circular resonator         moved about                                                   in
two different principal positions: first, keeping              always parallel                it is
to  the mirror and            primary,                    plane          is,
                                                                     the wave; in                       of
                                 it to
                         the             that        the
secondly, moving                the  plane inperpendicular          the mirror                        to
through the axis        the primary—the plane
                                 of                      vibration.        both     of                        In
cases the results are absolutely concordant                       the position                as   to
of   the equidistant maxima and minima
                                                                                a of
                                                        electromotive force.
Besides these two methods Hertz employed                third, which consists
in   producing interferences                          on
                                      the same resonator between waves
arriving from the same exciter, either directly across the air                 by                                  byor
a  conducting wire. From these experiments                  concludes,       the         he

            We give in this Table the means of the measurements obtained
        with each circle, and for the sake of brevity we have not separated
        those made with primary exciters of different dimensions, as these
        did not present systematic differences. In these latter experiments
        in air,    as in our previous researches along wires, we have in part
        established that a circular resonator always gives the same wave
        length, even when the dimensions of the primary are varied within
        certain limitst.          Then, again, is observed what we have called
        multiple resonance.
            In the case of larger wave-length circles of 1 m. and of 0-75,
         we can scarcely determine with any precision more than a node
        and a loop, besides the node on the mirror itself.                With smaller
        circles f or jwhieh the dimensions of the mirrors are somewhat more
        Buited we can easily determine three loops and three nodes, in
         cluding that of the mirror.           The equidistance of the loops and
        nodes is, as will be seen, pretty satisfactory +.
            The most important result of our research follows from the com
         parison of the figures of the three last lines of the Table, which
         show that the wave-length obtained for each circle in the case of
            * The delicacy of the micrometric screw is a very important element
         in this kind of research, especially with the small circles, which only give
         very feeble sparks. In the latter case we used a screw giving the j-, w of
         a millim.
            t As the intensity of the spark of the resonator is feebler in this      expe
         riment than in that of the wires, and as it diminishes, moreover, much
         more rapidly as we move away from the primary, the observation is
         altogether less precise than with wires.       In order to work in good con
         ditions the primary should have dimensions suited to the diameter of the
         resonator. The limits within which we can conveniently observe multiple
         resonance are less extended than in the case of wires, but vary up to
          double or even more.
            | M. Hertz places the first node at a certain distance behind the
         mirror ; this perturbation at the end does not seem to follow from our
         experiments.       As will be Been from the Table, the first quarter of a wave
         length presents no systematic difference from the others.

    propagation through air is very sensibly equal to that which this
    same circle gives along wires, the quarter of each being itself
    almost equal to twice the diameter of the corresponding circle.
    From this it follows that the velocity of propagation of Hertz's elec
    trical oscillations across air is very nearly the same as that with
    which they are transmitted       along a conducting wire *.—Comptes

    ON AN IMPROVED          METHOD OF DETERMINING         SPECIFIC HEATS
         BY THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT.           BY PROF.  J. PFAUNDLER.
        The method published by the author in 1869, which depends on
   Joule's law, in which one and the same current develops quantities
   of heat, in coils of wire arranged in series, which are proportional
   to the resistances, has hitherto found but few applications from the
   circumstance that it only applies to non-conducting liquids.         The
   author has got rid of this drawback by substituting for the coils
   of wire spiral glass tubes filled with mercury. He has also given
   the method far greater accuracy and certainty by inserting three
   mercury resistances in the branches of a Wheatstone bridge, by
   which it is possible to control and keep constant the ratio of the
   resistances during the passage of the heating-current.            Small
   variations in resistance are compensated         by introducing glass
   threads in the straight ends of the tubes which contained the
   mercury. In other cases these changes are measured by displacing
   the contact-key, and in this way the result is corrected.
       The comparative measurement of the rise of temperature is
  made more delicate by means of a thermopile.
       As instances of the utility of the method, experiments were made
  both with continuous and with alternating currents. The attempts
  of the author to use this method for the determination of the
  thermal capacity of water at different temperatures were inter
  rupted by the author's transference to Grätz, and will be repeated
 on a larger scale; these experiments are to be regarded as pre
 liminary ones intended to test the method.—Wiener                Berichte,

 ON      PERIODICALLY      WARIABLE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES WHICH
      ACT ONLY IN ONE DIIRECTION IN A CONIDUCTOR WITH SELF
      INDUCTION.       BY PROF. PULUJ OF PRAG.
     In   this paper the laws of the flow of electricity in a conductor
 with self-induction are theoretically investigated, when the external
     * We have already enunciated this in a preliminary communication
 made on this subject to the Société de Physique et d'Histoire naturelle
de Genève at a meeting on May 1, 1890 (Archives des Sciences phys. et
 nat, vol. xxiii. p. 557): we have since then completely repeated the
researches by varying the conditions in a number of ways, and it is
this latter research which we give here.        M. Lecher, in Vienna, has
found by an entirely new method that the velocity of electrical undula
tions along a wire is equal to that of light.

electromotive force is a quadratic Bine-function of the time, and
impulses are produced in the conductor in only one direction.         Cal
culation gives the result, that while the electromotive force varies
between zero aud a maximum value, the momentary current-strength
is always different from zero, and varies periodically between a
minimum and a maximum value. The mean current-strength                  is
independent of the self-induction and has always the same value,
whether the self-induction of the conductor is very large or is equal
to zero. The self-induction causes no loss of mean current-strength ;
its action only consists in making the waves plane. Formulae are
given for the mean square of the current-strength, and for the work
developed in the circuit, from which formulas it can be seen that
the magnitudes adduced depend on the displacement of phase, and
 satisfy the law of the superposition of the actions of two com
 ponents of electromotive force.         In conclusion the analogy is
 pointed out which exists between the laws investigated of elec
 trical flow and those of the rotatory motion of a heavy wheel
 under the action of successive mechanical impulses. — Wiener

       on wheatstone's DETERMINATION of the velocity of
                   ELECTRICITY. BY PROF. J. STEFAN.
     In the paper on the Motion of Electricity in Wires, Kirehhoff in
 1857 first showed that in certain conditions electricity moves in a
 thin wire according to the laws of wave-motion, and with a velocity
 which can be put equal to that of light.       The agreement between
 the velocities of electricity and of light only holds, however, when
 electricity travels in a straight wire stretched in the air.       Kireh
  hoff restricted his investigation to this case.       If we apply the
  bases of his calculation to other cases, for instance, a wire which
  is bent backwards and forwards in zigzag or is wound in a spiral,
  it is found that electricity travels under these conditions with a
  far greater velocity.
      In Wheatstone's well-known method twenty plane windings of
  drawn-out wire were used, and the velocity of electricity was found
  by this measurement to be half as much again as that of light.
                         I      I
  In the preceding think have given the correct explanation of
  this result.    I have, however, also attempted to give this explana
  tion an experimental basis, and for this purpose     I  have employed
  the method given by Hertz of producing stationary      electrical  waves
   in wires. ] have used a similar conductor to that of Wheatstone,
   but on a smaller scale, and connected it with a couple of long
   straight wires, and compared the length of a wave in the conductor
   with the length of the same wave in the straight wires. The wave
   in the conductor is considerably longer, and in accordance with
   this the velocity of electricity in the conductors is greater than in
   the straight wires, and, according to my experiments, in a ratio which
   still exceeds that found by Wheatstone. — IVieiier Berichte, April 23,
