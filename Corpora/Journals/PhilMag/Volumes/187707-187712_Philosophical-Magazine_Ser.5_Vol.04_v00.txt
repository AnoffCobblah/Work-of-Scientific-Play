           a definite numerical result is obtained.   To say that
that result is liable to errors of  observation,  is only correct
from one point of view. It is true that the result does not
really correspond with the time at which the star crossed the
meridian, yet it is an accurate representation of a certain very
complex event.      Undoubtedly, the principal feature in that
event is the time of crossing the meridian ; but there is also
involved in it various properties of the instruments, the atmo
sphere, and the observer himself, &c. . The object of the obser
vation       is,   of

plete certainty that we cannot have affected the principal
event in any way by the method of observing. In experiments,
however, it is impossible to imitate exactly the proposed con
ditions ; so that, even when corrections have been applied, and
when we can estimate the degree of uncertainty in the method
of observing, there remains another sort of uncertainty, viz.
as to the closeness with which the proposed conditions were
imitated ; that is to say, the principal event is rendered un
certain and complex.
   The case of experiments graduates into that of observations
of natural phenomena, where we have no control over the dis
turbing causes, and have no opportunity    -   of slightly altering
the conditions.
   The line of demarcation between the principal event, whose
laws are to be determined, and the disturbances, here becomes
still more undefined. And where we are still groping after a
law of the phenomena (as in the case of meteorology) it is
unknown what is to be classed as the principal event and what
as disturbances.

amine the main features of the series of waves.
   The problem of how best to combine a number of discon
tinuous observations into a continuous law, so as to give a
general representation of them after disturbances due to falli
bility of measures, runs of chance (as in statistics), &c. have
been set aside, is one that constantly presents itself for solution;
and a rational and methodical treatment can hardly fail to be
of value.
   The most frequent occasion for the solution of the problem
arises from the necessity of drawing a curve passing close to
the extremities of a number of ordinates; and the usual way
 of solving it is to draw a curve without abrupt changes of
curvature as close to the points as possible.      If the changes of
curvature are    abrupt  enough,   the curve may   be made to pass
            º
exactlythrough the points; but then each observation is treated
as exact, and we have exactly the case of the series of waves
with ripples on them.        But, by what precedes, it appears that
we had better omit the ripples; and the question remains as to
how far we are justified in smoothing down the curve. This
process of smoothing is often done by the free hand ; but it
will probably be done better by a system ; and it will be an
additional               if the system admits of arithmetical as
well as graphical application.

     In   those cases in which an algebraic law can be assigned,
to which the ordinates ought to conform, the best method of
treating the problem is to determine the constants involved in
the function by the method of least squares; but it might
often be not worth while to carry out this process, as, for ex
ample, where the deviations of                     i.
                                          various observations from
the law are large, and where it would accordingly be pedantic
to assign values to the constants with precision.
   Where the law is unknown and the observations are equi
distant, a method of treatment might, perhaps, be devised by
the assumption of some form of function containing fewer
constants than the number of given points, and consisting of
a number of simple harmonic terms, none of which go through
a large fraction of their period in passing from one ordinate to
the next. The constants involved might then be determined
by the method of least squares, so that the function should
give the best representation of the observations.           But the as
sumption of the form of function would be arbitrary, and the
process very laborious.
   On the whole it will be more convenient and equally satis
factory, as far the result is concerned, to proceed empirically
from the first, remembering that the main object is to exclude
ripples of short period.

of the curvature of the curve.   But if the rate of change of
curvature of the curve is small (as it must be assumed to be
to justify the smoothing process), P is very little better or
worse.    Now, as on the average the series of points deviate
as often to one side as to the other of the curve, there clearly

 they have no signs of addition or subtraction prefixed.         Then
 by tossing up a coin over and over again and calling heads +
 and tails —, the signs + or — are assigned by chance to this
 series of errors. About a dozen equidistant values of some
 function (say sine or cosine) were next taken from a Table,
 and the errors added to or subtracted from them in order.
 The errors may be made either small or large by multiplying
them by any constant.         The falsified values may then be fairly
taken to represent a series of observations; but we here know
what are the true ones. The corrections were then applied, in
some cases arithmetically and in others graphically, and the
deviations of the corrected values from the true were observed.
   In other cases a series of equidistant ordinates were taken,
and a sweeping free-hand curve was drawn to represent the
true curve, and the several ordinates of this curve were falsified
by the roulette and then corrected by a graphical application
of the rule. The general result of a good many trials was such
as to justify the smoothing process.          Where the errors were
considerable the mean error was much reduced, although the
actual error of some ordinates was increased; where the
errors were very small the mean error was even slightly            in
creased.     Although the danger of over-smoothing was obvious,
and the    sharpness   of the features of the curve was generally
diminished, yet     I think it was clear that the method might
generally be employed with advantage, especially in such
cases as the attempt to deduce some law from statistics or a
series  of barometric oscillations of considerable periods. The
errors must be very large to justify a quadruple operation.
This method of trial could not be so well applied to testing the
case of an odd number of smoothing operations, where we are
left finally at intermediate ordinates.
   On the whole, I think the process is justifiable if applied
with caution. Nevertheless it undoubtedly tends to spoil the
                     º
results if applied to a series of points which are already in a
sweeping curve; and therefore        I have tried to find some other
process which should not have this disadvantage.             This can
only be done by               more than three     points of the curve
into consideration; and therefore the process must be more
cumbrous.
   The method pursued was as follows:—
   Let –2, y”;     -1,    y'; 0, y; 1, yi; 2, y, be the coordinates
of five consecutive points on the curve. Suppose them to be
represented by a curve whose equation is y=a+bt+ca”--da”;
and make the following expression a minimum, viz.
                      X(a + ba +ca”--dr”—y)*,

0, 1, 2, and the corresponding values of y. In other words,
the values of a, b, c, d are to be determined by the method of
least squares, so that this curve shall give the best representa

   The equations for finding a, b, c, d are therefore

tions, this would be of slight consequence, as the work would
be performed once for all.
    n conclusion, I will add one other rule—namely, for inter
polation between the oceanic meteorological observations when
smoothed, as before suggested.        This is a formula for inter
polation in the case of a function of three independent variables,
the values of which are given at equal intervals, as is the case
in the mean barometer-heights in latitude, longitude, and time.
   Let A, D be the differences between successive barometer
heights in latitude and longitude respectively, and 8 the dif
ference in time (that is to say, between the values for suc
cessive months). Then, following the former notation,
          [æ--É, y +      m, t   +   rj =[r,          y, t|]+ £A +         m   I)+tó

               + &c.
   The proof of this will be obvious to those acquainted with
the Calculus   of Finite Differences.   No doubt it has been
 iven before, although I do not happen to have met with                                                  it.

condition of the disturbance of the equilibrium of the forces,
as explained above.    As long, therefore, as the forces remain
in equilibrium (as they do, for example, during the uniform
rise or fall of the barometer), any amount of condensation or
expansion may take place without affecting the temperature.
This is contrary to universal belief. But it is true for   that.                                        all

not a sufficient condition for the existence of a pair of perpen
dicular lines or planes. We proceed, therefore, very briefly
to describe the principal cases which present themselves when
the coefficients are connected by one, two, three, four, or five
linear relations.   By a linear relation connecting the coeffi
cients we understand a linear homogeneous equation of the
type
  Yp                           -
               pA + q B+ rC+2p'A' +2/B'+2r'C'=0,

These    we shall term the quadratic form and the reciprocal
quadratic form appertaining        the given relation.  to For brevity
we shall attend only       the cases     which given relations exist
                                         to                       in

remarkable that      every  case the conditions

and symmetry depend solely             the coefficients      on

relations, would resemble one another exactly                respect                   in                 of

that the quadratic form        appertaining        the given relation

 26        Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Theory of Sound.
 which sound actually passes over from the inside of a tube
 into the surrounding air. The work was based on the modern
 potential analysis; and some of the chief difficulties in it were
 overcome by giving to the various expressions the meaning
they would have had in the              of electricity, and employ
                               specially to that theory.
*#.       results that belong
      ord  Rayleigh  treated important   portions   of the same sub
ject in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions, 1871 (Mr.
 Strutt “On Resonance").        The analysis s much simplified,
but it is essentially the same in principle as Helmholtz's. The
 reference to electrical analogies is used freely.
    A paper by Grinwis (Pogg. Ann. 1877, No. 2, p. 276) goes
over that portion of the ground which refers to resonators; it
does not appear to me to differ essentially in principle from
the papers already mentioned.
   When sound diverges from the end of a cylinder, the mo
tion is such as it would be if the cylinder were made a little
longer and the process of divergence were disregarded.   The
principal numerical result, the obtaining of which is the object
of theory, concerns the magnitude of the length supposed to
be added to the cylinder as the equivalent of the divergence.
The whole space considered is always supposed to have                                                     its
dimensions small compared with the wave-length.

                     Symmetrical Spherical Divergence.
   The simplest case of the divergence of sound is where it
issues from a spherical source, and spreads symmetrically in
all directions. This may be realized by supposing a small
sphere, pierced with holes like the rose of a watering-pot, to
be connected through a long tube with a source from which
air alternately issues and is abstracted, the tube being thin
enough not to interfere sensibly with the spherical divergence.
Of course also the conditions are the same in hemispherical or
 sectorical divergence, the sound diverging always from a cor
responding portion of a spherical surface.    In these cases the
assumption that R, the velocity-potential, is a function of r
and t only, is legitimate, but in no other case.
    Ifwe form the equations of motion in three dimensions in
 the ordinary manner, making the above assumption, we have

clouds and mists can float in the strata of air whose tempera
ture is much below zero, without assuming the solid state?

                                          w increases as the volume

the diameter of the drop the greater will be the value of K.
Does not this explain how M. Mousson" was able, at very low
temperatures, to keep in the liquid state globules of water of
less than $ millim. diameter disposed upon a surface which
they did not wet? In the same way Mr. Tomlinson f, more
than thirty-five years since, could see minute drops of water,
alcohol, ether, roll upon the surface of a fixed      raised                                          oil              to

we shall then have                   :—

Therefore the quantity of heat to be supplied or withdrawn
varies proportionally to the fresh surface produced, Sº-S1.
  This theorem can easily be applied to some well-known
phenomena, such as the ebullition of liquids and the fusion of
solids.
   1. When the temperature of a boiling liquid remains nearly
stationary, the liquid is traversed by an infinity of bubbles, the
limiting surfaces of which possess a potential energy that                                                          in
creases in proportion to their extent; each bubble therefore
grows larger only by cooling the liquid ; so that the mass
must be constantly heated to counteract this cooling.         To this
cause of production of cold must be added further the renewal
of the bounding surface of each bubble, which arises from the
volume comprised within each bubble becoming saturated with
vapour.    Accordingly we conceive that the ebullition will be
the more active (that is to say, the greater number of bubbles
will be formed) the more heat is supplied in the same time.

               if the free liquid surfaces disappear at the time
     Conversely,
of  the condensation of the vapour, the potential energy of
which those surfaces were the seat vanishes, but is found again
in the form of heat sensible to the thermometer.      To me the
preceding theory appears to show perfectly the origin and the
nature of the latent heat of vaporization ; indeed, taking for
our starting-point the incontestable existence of the potential
energy of a free liquid surface, we have arrived by calculation
at this result—that every enlargement of the surface develops
cold, as every diminution or suppression of a free surface will
give rise to a production of heat.

temperature sufficient to effect                its
                                              fusion, the surface      con                  of

active the more quickly the heat supplied can replace one con
tact-surface      by  another smaller.
    Conversely, when solidification takes place, there are also
formed successive surfaces of contact between the solid and
the still liquid material; but            this case, instead
                                           in                     going           of              on

consequently produce          a progressive heating.                     It

                                                S   vary simultaneously,

48        Mr. S. P. Thompson     on the Chromatic   Aberration
    I  consider it a very fortunate circumstance that observers
have met with facts so abnormal in appearance, because these
                                                                    i
latter give a valuable support to my theory.         In reality, the    s
character    of the maximum or minimum of the expression S
for particular values of S and t necessarily involves two effects
of contrary signs on this side and on that of this particular
state of the body.     It hence follows that, if physicists had not
already noted the striking irregularities of which I have spoken,
my theory might have instigated their discovery.
    IV. If the consequences which I have deduced from my
formula be verified not only by the facts already known, but
moreover by the experiments which it may suggest, it can be
foreseen of what importance this theory will be in thermody
namics, in which the state of a body is at present regarded as
determined when the volume, the temperature, and the pres
sure supported by the body are given. When a liquid, and
                                      |
very probably also when a solid or a gaseous body, is in ques
tion, it will be absolutely necessary to take account of the po
tential energy which prevails in         the bounding surfaces.
    The investigation of this question will be able to be carried
 on step by step, in proportion as facts shall have brought more
 confirmation to the calculations which have served me as a
 basis for the deduction of the various consequences enunciated
 in my two communications.
     V. I should now have to investigate what are the electrical
 phenomena corresponding to the various developments of heat
 which have been in question in this note ; but this is too wide
 a subject for any thing less than a special treatise.      I will, for
 the present, only say that, from the numerous bibliographical
 researches which I have already instituted,      I hope to find for
 my theory a confirmation     as complete   in the domain of elec
 tricity as in that of heat.

      for there can be no doubt that where these means are avail
     able, the mind is guided to a large extent by them in the for
     mation of an estimate of distance, unless carefully trained to
     disregard them and to depend on other circumstances, or
     unless, as may happen to individuals, some physical injury
     has occurred to render the eye abnormal.                With respect to
     the consideration advanced in (c),               have some reason to  I
    doubt whether we really do judge apparent distance by the
    muscular sensations of the external and internal recti muscles
    of the eye. Stereoscopic pictures appear to me equally “solid"
    whether in a Wheatstone's reflecting stereoscope, a Brewster's
     lenticular with prism-shaped lenses, or a Helmholtz's with
:   parallel axes, or by superimposition by effort of the recti
    muscles, in each of which cases a different convergence is
    required.      Moreover it would be very inconvenient if our
    estimate of distance depended on the action of these muscles,
    as they are peculiarly liable to fatigue.

coin when     looking    with the two    eyes, especially   if you expect
no   dissimilarity    and do not use the      eyes  alternately.    There
are, on the other hand, experiments of Helmholtz, Fechner,
and Volkmann" which go to prove that the retinal magnitude,
as appreciated by the muscular sweep of the eye, affords a
fairly accurate means of comparison of the angular magni
tudes and positions of two objects in the field of vision whose
images can be successively brought upon the same spot of the
retina. This involves, however, the question of the persistence
of visual impressions, without which such a comparison of re
tinal magnitudes might be quite fallacious.
    17. The sensation         (f) of tension of the ciliary muscle is a
very delicate means of estimating near distances, and is a
 sensation capable of training to a considerable nicety.                 In
October 1870 the writer was unable to perceive any difference
of strain of adjustment to vision between distances of 4 yards
and 400 yards.         At the present time he is conscious of a dif
ference of tension when the eye is directed to objects 15 yards
and 300 yards distant respectively, and this with either eye.
I  insist on this means of estimation of distance, because it                        is,
 for monocular vision,         ofeven more importance than the mus
 cular sensation    of   convergence        of

front lines of the crystals with ultramarine, and the back lines
with vermilion. Several, though not all, of these when placed

blue lines, whose positions would stereographically give a
front presentment, retiring behind the red lines of the crystal.
   That the mind does, however, habitually make use of the
dissimilarity of binocular vision is evident from the old trick
of looking with one eye through a short tube while attempting
to walk up to a suspended ribbon and cut it with a pair of
scissors.   Yet persons who have the use of but one eye find
no difficulty in performing the task; and, with practice, the
feat becomes easy if the distance be carefully estimated by the
sensations of ocular focus.    The linear distance between the
two eyes, however, sets a limit to the range of habitual esti
mates of distance founded on the fact of binocular dissimila
rity ; and, as Mr. Ruskin has observed", it is possible to see,
and to see in focus together, the extreme distance and the
middle distance of a landscape, though the foreground and
distance cannot so be seen together.
   19.         I
          cannot here dwell upon questions involving linear
perspective (h). The various considerations upon which linear
perspective becomes a basis for the perception of distance are
purely associative—mental rather than optical, geometrical
rather than physical.
   20. I pass on, therefore, to aerial perspective (i); the various
definitions of which may be summed up in one as the expres
sion of distance by colour. A distant hill looks bluer than a
less distant one by reason of the slight opacity of the intervening
atmosphere (“sky”); and      blueness       its                is

lished  matter", it is now time to inquire how far these various
considerations are affected by the fact that rays of different
colours have different focal length in the eye.

   24. In Wheatstone's classical research of 1838 it was de
monstrated how great is the capacity of the brain to combine
together two slightly differing retinal images.       This faculty
once  admitted,  however  explained,  renders it  unnecessary  here
to discuss how far the inexactness of focus for any particular
tint is concerned in binocular vision. In the present paper i
must suffice to treat of the non-achromatism of the eye in                                                      its

 58          Mr. S. P. Thompson           on the     Chromatic Aberration
white paper.     These were cut by an assistant and adjusted—
their distance and size being unknown to the observer, and
varied between each experiment. Hence, under the condi
tions given, the eye could form no judgment of distance
based upon apparent magnitude, upon parallax, or upon
apparent form or shadow ; the estimation depended solely
upon the muscular sensation of adjustment to focus.    After a
little practice this became moderately easy with white light,
and the estimations were fairly within limits. With a screen
of yellow glass interposed no difference was experienced.
When a ruby-red glass was employed, however, the estimations
were generally, though not invariably, too small, and with a
cobalt-blue glass generally (though not invariably) too great.
The following is the mean of six experiments taken at random
from a number made with a red glass, and of another six from
those made with a blue glass.          -

   35. When a solution of permanganate         was employed in
conjunction with a blue glass, giving equal intensities of red
and blue rays, the attempt to estimate the distance of the
white pieces of paper became perplexing in the extreme. The
object seemed to be moving backwards and forwards as the
focus changed from red to blue and blue to red.
   36. After about forty experiments with blue and red glasses,
the errors became less. Evidently the effect of practice was to
sophisticate the result, the mind knowing the probable result
beforehand, and making allowance involuntarily.        The forty
experiments were not         made  all
                                    one  time,  because the eye

    been convinced that these alleged characteristics were some
    thing more than associations with blue sky and red rocks :
    and the universality and tenacity with which artists pronounce
    this opinion is surely indicative of a reality somewhere.  The
    opinion of Goethe on this point sums up the whole matter.
    I  quote from Sir Chas. Eastlake's edition of the ‘Farben
    lehre **.
        “As the upper sky and distant mountains appear blue, so a
    blue surface seems to retire from us.”
        “Rooms which are hung with pure blue appear in some
    degree larger, but at the same time empty and cold.”
        38. So the blueness of the lower misty air may, as Alpine
    travellers know, cause the base of a mountain actually to ap

there are well-expressed  foregrounds and distances, and look
at it through the coloured media employed in the earlier
experiments.             If
                    the facts of distance are expressed only
indirectly, by suggestions of magnitude, by linear perspective
of vanishing lines and the like, the interposition of a red or a

slightly hazy but cloudless eastern sky in the Thames valle

noticed that trees and grass reflecting the light from this aspect
presented a most unwonted redness of tint.

blackened pith ought to move away from the pith, and therefore
towards the light, when the pith is illuminated.     This inference
was submitted to the test of experiment by means of an apparatus
represented in fig. 1 and constructed as follows:–A piece of elder
pith 2.5 centims. in length and 1.2 centim. in breadth, blackened
on one side, was fastened by one end to the interior surface of the
bulb of an ordinary boiling-flask (of about 200 cub. centims.
capacity) in such a manner that the free end of the pith extended
towards the middle of the bulb.      A light glass rod with a small
magnet on one end, and a disk of thin microscope-glass on the
other end, was so suspended in the bulb that the glass disk could
be readily balanced in a position nearly parallel with the surface
of the blackened pith, and a few millims. distant from  it.  The silk
fibre from which the glass rod was suspended hung from        a fixed
arm  at   the upper end  of   atube, the lower end    of  which was
hermetically fastened into the neck    of the flask. An elongation
of  this tube (not shown in  the figure) witha  contraction for seal
ing, served to   connect the apparatus with the exhaust-tube      of
                                                                   a

Sprengel pump. The pump was set in action, and occasionally the
flame of an ordinary gas-burner was held at a distance of about
 10 centims. from the blackened pith while the microscope-glass
was closely watched.           When the gauge of the pump showed a
tension of 7     millims.,  as compared with the mercurial column of
a barometer    standing    in the same vessel of mercury, the glass disk
was    distinctly repelled    from the pith and towards the source of
light.    As the exhaustion was continued the repulsion between
the  pith   and the glass increased. The apparatus was sealed off
from the pump when the mercury falling in the exhaust-tube had

  We now endeavoured to determine quantitatively the influence
of variations in the tension of the residual gas, and also the
influence of variations in distance between the reacting surfaces.
For this purpose we constructed the apparatus represented in
fig. 2.
   On a wooden stand supported by three levelling-screws rests a
glass tube 20 centims. in length and 3.8 centims. in diameter,
having a tubular opening at one side, into which is cemented hori
 zontally a smaller tube 1.5 centim. in diameter. In the larger
 tube there is a circular disk of elder-pith 2:3 centims. in diameter,
having one side blackened with lampblack; it is supported in a
vertical position on a movable stand of iron wire.           By means of
a magnet the pith disk can be moved up and down the tube, and
thus placed at any required distance (within 12 centims.) from
a delicately suspended circular disk of thin microscope-glass,
3 centims. in diameter and 0.3 millim. in thickness. The glass
disk is attached to the end of a glass arm, which is suspended
in the smaller tube by means of a silk cocoon fibre contained in a
vertical limb 38 centims. in length and 9 millims. in diameter.
In order that the torsion of the silk fibre may be conveniently
regulated, there is a small <U+017F>h-shaped piece of iron wire attached
to it a few centimetres below the end from which it hangs. A
 horseshoe magnet is suspended outside the tube with the piece
                        to its

other end of the large tube is contracted and terminates in a nar

        found it necessary to avoid the irregular actions which
arose when the incident light was allowed to shine on the inside
of the glass tube. This was accomplished by projecting on the
disk the image of a uniformly illuminated circular aperture in a
screen of copper foil placed outside the glass chimney of an
Argand gas-burner. The lens employed for this purpose is per
manently attached to a stand on which the lamp is secured.   When
the position of the pith disk is altered, the position of the stand
carrying the lamp and lens is altered to the same extent; so that
the pith disk is always in focus. The burner is automatically
supplied with coal-gas at the uniform rate of 3:2 cubic feet per
hour, this being the quantity that gives a flame of the required
Slze.
  We found that the torsion of a cocoon fibre furnishes a force
which is too variable to admit of                          its

      In  the above experiments          it will be observed  that the distance
  between the pith disk and the swinging glass disk was constant,
  viz. 100 millims.            We have made several series of experiments,
  with the disks at various distances, in atmospheres of various
 tensions.         The means of several of these series are graphically
 represented in the following diagram.                 The ordinates represent
 the distance in millimetres through which the index moved in a
 period of 15 seconds; the abscissas represent the distance in
 millimetres between the disks.

      Our expectation of being able to ascertain the thickness of the
  Crookes's
  at    present
                          has not been entirely fulfilled with the apparatus as
                   constructed,     owing to the presence of the exceedingly
  feeble force that is         represented   by the horizontal portions of the
 diagram.           We have found this feeble force nearly constant at

                            Geological Society.                      73
each tension when the two disks are at any distances asunder
exceeding 20 millims.        So far as we have been able to ascertain,
it seems to arise partly from the sudden expansion of the gas
throughout the extent of the Crookes's layer as soon as the light
is turned on (an expansion which acts on the swinging disk as if
a feeble explosion had taken place in front of it), and partly from
a Crookes's force acting between the upperside of the tube and the
swinging disk (caused by the inside of the tube becoming sensibly
heated by the convection-current that commences as soon as the
Crookes's layer is established). We do not think that any appreci
able part of it is due to the direct action of the convection
current.
    The rest of the diagram represents the forces which we found
when the disks were at distances of 10 and 5 millims. asunder.
The forces which presented themselves at these distances are
to be attributed mainly to a true Crookes's reaction between the
disks; and they seem to warrant the conclusion that Crookes's
reaction was manifested at a distance of at least 10 millims. in a
hydrogen vacuum, when the outstanding tension was as much as
5 millims. of mercury.
    At distances of from 20 to 80 millims. the very feeble force
acting on the glass disk in our apparatus seemed to vary about
inversely as the tension. As already mentioned, it appeared to
be nearly independent of the distance when the distance exceeded
20 millims.
    At distances of 5, 10, and 20 millims. the force on the swinging
disk made some approach to varying at each tension inversely as
the distance.     But, so far as may be judged from our measures of
such exceedingly feeble forces, there is a sensible deviation from
this law at most of the tensions.
    Moreover the diagram, taken as a whole, seems to suggest, in
conformity with the dynamical theory, that the law changes with
 variations of density; for if the law were the same at all the
observed tensions, the converging lines in the diagram should
converge to points in the axis of abscissas, whereas they converge
towards points lower down.
    We will postpone the further discussion of the observations
already made with this apparatus until we can supplement them
by others.

      1. “Remarks on the Coal-bearing Deposits near Erekli, the
 ancient Heraclea Pontica, Bithynia.”        By Rear-Admiral T. A. B.
 Spratt, C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author described the occurrence of true Coal
 measures    near Erekli, on the north coast of Asia Minor, from
observations made by him when on service in the Black Sea in 1854.
The coal was obtained near Kosloo, about 30 miles east of Erekli,
where it cropped out on the sides of a valley, and was worked by
horizontal drifts.     The district was much disturbed by faults, and
the workings could only be driven from 100 to 400 yards into the
hill. In the eastern ridge bounding the valley of Kosloo there were
 11 or 12 seams of coal of different thicknesses in a distance from
N. to S. of about 2 miles, one of them being about 18 feet thick,
and the best coal forming a seam of 4             in. The seams dipped
                                                        ft.   10
S.E. about 26°.     They   were interstratified with shales, sandstones,
and conglomerates          quartz-pebbles, and occasionally with thin
                                  of
bands      clay
             of  and ironstone.    From some                  of
                                                   the seams the author
obtained fossil remains       plants, which sufficiently prove that these
                                       of
coals belong       the Carboniferous period. They include, according
                       to
 to Mr.  Etheridge,  species    Lepidodendron, Lepidostrobus, Calamites,
                                        of
Pecopteris, Sphenopteris, Neuropteris (?), Sigillaria, Stigmaria, Glos
sopteris(?), and Sphenophyllum. The author also noticed several other
localities    the immediate neighbourhood where coal was known
                  in                                                                    to

as    to
      the true relations     the Lizard serpentine and the associated
                                       of
hornblende schists, and         the origin
                                       as   to the serpentine. He had

                        the junctions accessible     the Cornish coast;

                        On    the Serpentine            Rocks   of      the   Lizard District.                           75
inland they are generally obscured.               Some of them are concealed
by débris, &c.; but the majority prove beyond doubt that the ser
pentine is intrusive.         Further, almost everywhere large fragments
of hornblende schist are caught up and included in the serpentine.
    Besides the serpentine there is a large mass of gabbro at Crousa
Down, and many dykes and veins along the east coast almost to
the extremity of the serpentine region. At Coverack Cove, near
the above mass, are gabbros of two ages, the older much resem
bling a kind of troktolite; on microscopic examination it proves
to be chiefly plagioclase felspar, augitic minerals (including dial
lage), and olivine partially converted into serpentine; there is a red
and a green variety. The newer, a coarser gabbro, appears to be
of the same age as the other veins on the coast, and connected
with the main mass. Some remarkable changes have taken place
in this also. In certain places it exhibits a separation of its mineral
constituents, causing it to resemble a foliated rock.              This is proved
to be due to     pressure  at  right  angles    to the structure. The minerals
also are often changed.         The felspar is replaced by a white granular
mineral resembling saussurite; the diallage (which occurs some
times in very large crystals) is often partially, or even wholly, con
verted into rather minute crystalline hornblende. In these spe
cimens there is no olivine to be distinguished. The great mass, how
ever, is rich in olivine; yet a weathered specimen from                resembling                    it,
in   aspect the gabbro          the veins, does not show olivine.

being converted into serpentine, aids                  forming the hornblende.

semivitreous lavas, with their associated agglomerates and ashes,
constituting the ridge of Ercal Hill, Lawrence Hill, and the Wrekin,
and the low ridge parallel to this to the west, both of which are
marked as “greenstone” on the Geological-Survey Map. Their com
position and structure show them to have been originally identical
with some of the glassy volcanic rocks ejected during the most recent
geological periods.   After noticing the geological relations of these
rocks, the author described the structure of modern perlitic and
spherulitic rocks, and pointed out that the spheroidal balls which
characterize them are produced by a process of more or less con
centric cracking during the contraction of the mass after it has
been solidified.    He then indicated the characters of the ancient
rocks of the Lower Silurian district of Shropshire, and showed their
identity of structure with the modern spherulitic pitchstones and
perlites; he also noticed that in some instances they had become
devitrified.  As the result of his investigation, he says that the
structure of these rocks proves their original vitreous condition, for
the perlitic and spherulitic formations, with their associated micro
liths, are only observed in connexion with the obsidian or pitchstone
varieties of volcanic glass—and that in the older as in the younger
series there is the same gradation between the vitreous and stony
varieties.

enter into the rocks of the district is remarkable.
   The authors endeavoured to correlate the stratified rocks, and
adduced evidence to prove that the pebble and ash beds of Forest
Gate, the grit and pebble beds of the Hanging Rocks, the similar
beds in the grounds of A. Ellis, Esq., at Swithland, and the
quartzites of Bradgate-Stable Quarry, Groby Pool, and Steward's-
Hay Spring form one horizon, the slate breccias of Blores Hill,
Bradgate, Ulverscroft Mill, Markfield, Bardon, and High Towers a
second, the coarse ash-beds of Benscliff, Chitterman Hill, Timber
wood Hill, and the Monastery a third, and the quartzose rocks of
Charley Wood, Charley, the Old Reservoir, and Blackbrook a fourth.
   Hence they showed that the beds are considerably dislocated near
the syenites, which removes the main objection which previous
writers have urged against these being intrusive; and they described
the evidence they have obtained as to this being their real nature.
This evidence included the description of actual contacts of igneous
and sedimentary rock seen at two points in the wood south of
Bradgate House, and at a third in Bradgate Park.
   They propose, in a continuation of the paper, to touch upon the
faults, and to describe in greater detail the microscopic structure of
the rocks.

             is one point in connexion with my paper “on the Mode
THERE of the Propagation of Sound”, published in the last Number
of your Journal, on which I would say a few words.              As regards
the process whereby the molecules of a gas automatically adjust
their motions so as to move equally towards                             all
                                                      directions, and thus
produce equilibrium        pressure,of   should    stated,

possible misconception, that this depends (as deduced            Professor         by
Maxwell)          on
                the oblique collisions    the molecules causing
                                                        of            equai                an

of pressure       in     all
                     directions.
   The fact that the molecules            gas move equally towards

two opposite directions) was deduced                          by

of the equilibrium        pressure; but this deduction
                                   of                         not original,       is

                           ELECTRICITY.                    BY E. GUIGNET.
    In most physical institutions we find electrical motors (Froment's
system more or less modified).               The École Polytechnique of Rio
de Janeiro      possesses    such a motor formed of five fixed electromag
 nets and a movable barrel furnished with six bars of soft iron.
The current of ten Bunsen elements being thrown into the wire of
the electromagnets, the barrel turns briskly from right to left, or
from left to right, according to the general direction of the current.
Moreover a commutator, carried by the axis, changes the direc
tion of the current, in each of the electromagnets, at every fifth
 part of a revolution.
    This apparatus has for a long time served for showing how an
electric current, whatever                       its
                                        origin, can produce work, doubtless
very costly, but          which the expense depends directly upon the
                           of
net cost       of
                the current.       The same apparatus can              used for the       be
inverse demonstration—a fact which appears                       me important for  to
the instructor; for the experiment                easily carried out

   I determined     h by experiment thus: through a thick-walled brass
tube   I caused  hot water of a known temperature to flow, and ob
served the temperature on the outer surface of the mantle.               Theory
gives for this case

the outer and inner circumferences; and then the result of the
observations is                     h = 0.00078.
   For a   brass wire    it   can now be calculated how much the          tempe
rature at the centre is higher than that at the surface;               and when

can now be calculated for other wires also.

May Number of Poggendorff's Annalen, has also given a calcula

given; the equations obtained are not so general, and the numerical
data are based on experiments of another kind than those                   I have
employed; so that       I   had no hesitation in making public my inves

      GENTLEMEN,
   Mr.   Burbury has pointed out to me a mistake in my paper on
dissociation in the June number of the Philosophical Magazine
which is important. On page 415, the sign of               I should be changed.
This will affect the ratio of the         specific  heats  given  on p. 417; in
the first case
                 .  will  be 1-585 instead of 1.609, and          in the  second
1.338 instead of 1:423.           Consequently the reasoning at the end of
§  20,  which   depends      on these ratios, will be invalidated.        If the
quantity   I were   positive,    as in the paper, we should get gases cooling
when they combine, or passing from one state into a less stable state.

1.           the classification of any series of objects is meant
                 actual or ideal arrangement together of those
which are like and the separation of those which are unlike,
the purpose of this arrangement being, primarily, to disclose
the correlations or laws of union of properties or circumstances,
and, secondarily, to facilitate the operations of the mind in
clearly conceiving and retaining in the memory the characters
of the objects in question.”f.
    In the classification of a series of objects we wish to discover
the deepest and most general resemblances which hold good
between these objects; we do not wish for mere arbitrary de
finitions.   In a perfect system of classification, each class of
objects must be distinguished from            other classes     all

recognition; and, further, these properties must                really                     be

every property must exist            each individualin      the class.
    The advantages      such classification are apparent. Given

classification are also apparent. . We may find certain proper
ties correlated together in two individuals; these individuals
we form into a class. Yet we may discover another individual

class, and nevertheless in one or more of        properties    shall             its                       it

according to their valency does not interfere with the arrange
ment of the same elements into other groups in accordance
with their specific gravity, their electric and thermal conduc
tivity, their malleability, their atomic weights, &c. &c. In fact,
the nearer we rise to a perfect system of classification (which,
however, we can never attain to) the more useful do the sub
sidiary schemes of classification become. We begin even now
to see some connexion between the grouping of the elements
in accordance with their atomic weights, and the grouping in
accordance with general physical properties, or with valency.

   If  pushing feeble analogies too far led Lavoisier astray as
regards the constitution of hydrochloric acid and chlorine, a
somewhat similar use of analogy led him to true ideas regard
ing the constitution of the alkaline earths.
     avoisier observed that metals dissolved in acids with efferves
cence, and that bases dissolved without effervescence; he fur
ther observed that lime and magnesia dissolved in acids without
effervescence : hence he inferred that the latter substances are
probably eompound bodies. In this case Lavoisier put forward
his views regarding the constitution of these alkaline earths
in the form of an hypothesis only ; the hypothesis was useful
º
as a guide in future work, and was most fruitful of good re
sults. In the cases of hydrochloric acid and of chlorine, Lavoi
sier put forward what was really an hypothesis, founded on
        the same kind of evidence as the hypothesis concerning
 the nature of lime and magnesia, as an ascertained fact.
 The false fact retarded the advance of science, and raised
 many prejudices in the minds of chemists which future                                    in
 vestigators found it hard to remove.
    7. The views of Lavoisier concerning the constitution of
 salts were developed by Berzelius in the terms of his famous
 theory of Dualism.
    Starting with the assumption that a salt is formed by the
 union of an acid with a simple or compound radicle, Ber
zelius represented        salts    all
                                   built                       up

                                                                                           an as
ever complicated the radicles, Berzelius regarded the salt
consisting      two distinct parts tied together,
                     of                                    were,               as

    If  we compare the views                           of

                             of

posed?. The futile attempts of the alchemist to found a science
naturally led those who were the authors of the true chemistry
to disparage the method of their predecessors to an extreme
degree. Nothing was to be hoped for from a desultory gather
ing together of innumerable reactions; the quantitative study
of the composition of substances appeared to promise brilliant
results: hence Lavoisier tended to overlook the quantitative
study of reactions, while paying           regard          all

pound radicles as imagined by the school of Berzelius was
exceedingly distasteful to the substitutionists. The properties
of a compound depended, in their view, not so much upon the
elements which it contained as upon the position of these
elements.
   We have in the idea of substitution, as a guide in classifi
cation, a distinct advance upon the idea of dualism. The
sole point upon which the attention must be concentrated is
not, says the upholder of substitution, the composition of a
substance; we must also pay regard to            reactions, whether.its
of  formation       or
                     decomposition.
                          of             The new school therefore

Elated with the success which had attended their attacks upon
the clumsy and often contradictory formulae            dualism, they          of

                          the elements          radicles  or    compound         in   a
body.

90         Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir on Chemical Classification.
        Let us for a moment trace the development of these ideas.
    Reactions were observed which could be best explained by
supposing that a group of elements had moved from one com
pound into another without the members of the group becom
ing separated from one another, and without disturbing the
equilibrium of the molecule of the compound into which the
group entered. These groups might, or might not, be isolated ;
the theory did not demand any proof of their actual existence
in the free state ; they were regarded merely as hypothetical
existences which served to bring out analogies between groups
of reactions which could not find an explanation in terms of
any other theory.
    The application of this theory of substituting radicles was
soon attended with the discovery of relationships between
bodies which appeared to have but slight analogies with one
another when viewed in the light of the older theory of Dualism.
The researches of Liebig and Wöhler upon the benzoyl com
pounds found their interpretation in the theory of substitutin
radicles.     Berzelius had also spoken of radicles: he had ind
                           all                                         up     of

                                                   radicles, simple
compound; but the radicles            dualism had almost nothing

drogen in water was capable of replacement in halves, not only
by compound radicles but also by elementary substances.
Two derivatives of water, in which the hydrogen was partially
or entirely replaced by potassium, could be prepared.                Other
elements, again, were capable of replacing at once the whole
of the hydrogen. But one derivative of water was known in
which the hydrogen was replaced by calcium; but in this deri
vative the whole of the hydrogen was replaced by the metal.
Hence arose the idea of varying capacities of saturation of the

general chemical properties with the composition of the com
pound radicle? It required the genius of a Berzelius to pierce
the veil which shrouded the inner constitution of bodies from
the vulgar gaze, and to tell authoritatively, by the juxtaposition
of what radicles the substance was built up. The upholders
of substitution and of the unitary theory endeavoured to cor
relate together general chemical function and atomic structure:
and in so doing they made a step in advance; for they took a
wider view of the necessities of a perfect scheme of chemical
classification.     But general chemical function is a somewhat
vague term; and the use of types as a means of classification,
 tiºn        doubtless a distinct gain to chemical science, almost
for the time increased the vagueness.                                  I
                                                     have already pointed
out some of the essential weaknesses of a classification by types:
these weaknesses were illustrated in the case of chemistry.
 From the vagueness of a typical classification we may be said
to have now emerged into the greater definiteness of a system
largely based upon the valency of the elementary atoms.                   But
does this system give us a means for definitely settling the
 characteristics of each class? Does it enable us to mark off class
 from class? Can we by                        its

fore be employed, in place of hydrogen, in determining equi
valents. We know also of certain compound radicles which
combine immediately with hydrogen, or with those elements
alluded to in the preceding sentence, only in the proportion of
one atom to one atom"; we may therefore employ
pound radicles in determining equivalents. The amount of an

gen, or with one atom of chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine,
methyl, ethyl, &c. is therefore the equivalent of that element.
The determination of equivalents evidently supposes that the
atomic weights of the standard elements are known, also that
the number of atoms, in the compound under consideration, of
the standard element, and also of that element whose equiva
lent is sought for, can be determined. Before the equivalent
of an element can be known, the molecular weights of a num
ber of compounds and the atomic weights of the elements in
these compounds must be determined.      Many difficulties have
to be encountered     in  determining   molecular and atomic
weights.   But until a number of these weights have been de
termined, we cannot satisfactorily deduce the equivalent of an
element, and consequently we cannot         the valency     the     fix                           of

    Very striking examples of the class of compounds under
consideration are met with in the combinations of certain of
the nitrogen group of elements.          Sal ammoniac is one of the
most common of these compounds.                If this body be really a
chemical compound of the composition expressed by the for
mula NH, Cl, then nitrogen is a pentad element.                        if this        #.
be  so, why   does  NH,  Cl  split  up, on   heating,  into NH3+ HCl2
Because, answers one school of chemists, although nitrogen is
a pentad, yet       its
                    “affinities"        “combining-powers” are
                                               or                                                      of
unequal values; three are stronger than the other two. Or
the answer may             be
                         stated           slightly altered form: The

from this. They say that the combining-powers                      nitrogen           of
are all, originally,       equal value, but that, after three

regarding nitrogen as a pentad, and in quoting the probabi

so as to include             bodies as those to which the empirical

others like them, we may make nitrogen of almost any va
lency we choose.          We may also extend the same kind of
reasoning to other elements —Because KClO, and KNO, are
isomorphous and show other points of analogy, chlorine is a
triad or it may be a pentad; but KCIO, and KMnO, are also
isomorphous; chlorine appears to be a dyad or a tetrad; and
so on.     These and other similar contradictory results may be
obtained by admitting solid bodies (that                 bodies which are   is,

   The edge of one of the fixed disks is graduated, as shown in
fig. 4; and the nearest moving disk carries a vernier, the zero
of which for the position of the scale given in the figure must
be in the direction KT.      It is convenient to mark 5° of cir
cumference as 1° of      graduation,  since the disk moves five
times as fast as the prisms open out from one another. The
reading may then be made to give the angle between conse
cutive prisms. Motion can be given to the instrument by
connecting the moving and fixed disks by a rack and pinion.
   It may be necessary to adopt some contrivance for keeping
the pins always pressing against the same sides of the slits
through which they pass.

the disks somewhat in the positions a, &, y, 8 in fig. 3, and
passing an elastic band round each pin and the corresponding
peg.    The bands and pegs are placed on the sides of the disks
remote from the prisms, so as not to interfere with the rest of

the machinery. To ensure pressure always against the same
sides of the       in the arms, a peg is inserted at E in the fixed
disk, fig. 4, and pegs are inserted at F, G, H,      in the arms;                   I
the  pins  P, Q,  R, S are connected with the   pegs   E, F, G, H.
respectively by elastic bands; and thus the pins P, Q, R, S
are drawn round K in one direction, and the arms K P, KQ,
KR     are drawn in the opposite direction.      It will be found
that there is not much variation in the length of the band.      In
order to   pull  the arm K S    by  a band which shall not     vary
much in length, a slit whose middle line is                                  r=F         (*)      should be

long and 24 inches in diameter, on which were two helices
containing each about 1030 turns of wire. It was excited by
ten quart Grove cells arranged in series. . The submagnet
consisted of a wedge of soft iron 5 inches long by 2 inches
thick at the wide end, and having an edge 24 inches long.

                            Hospital,
as the                                 in Lower Circular Road,
was struck   by lightning.   The branches of this tree overhung
the wires of the   telegraph-line,  from which they were only
about a foot distant.    The discharge passed from the tree to
the wires (of which there are four), broke fourteen double-cup
porcelain insulators, and passed to earth through the iron
standards on which the wires are supported.
   The one ends of all the four wires were connected to earth
 through instruments in the Calcutta Telegraph office, at a
 distance of about 5% miles from the locality of the accident.
 The other ends were connected as follows to earth through        in
 struments—the first at the Telegraph workshops (a distance
 of less than } mile), the second at the Lieutenant-Governor's
 residence (less than $ mile), the third at Atchipur (less than
 14 miles), and the fourth at Diamond Harbour (less than 25
 miles). At the moment of the discharge nothing extraordinary
 was noticed at any of these offices.
    It is often far too generally stated in text-books that light
 ning invariably follows the best conductor to earth.            This
statement is misleading at the best, and is absolutely untrue
 if the word “conductor” be employed in the sense to which
 it is usually restricted in electrical science. In this instance,
for example, we find that the lightning broke fourteen insula
tors, each having probably an electrical resistance of several
thousand megohms, in preference to traversing a wire-resist
ance of not more than 500 ohms to earth through the receiving
instrument in the telegraph-workshops. The writers appear
to overlook the fact (experimentally illustrated long ago by
Faraday) that there is exerted a mechanical stress proportional
to the square of the potential tending to produce disruptive
discharge, as well as an electromotive force proportional to
the simple potential tending to produce a conductive discharge.
Thus the discharge may occur either along a path of minimum
mechanical resistance or along a path of minimum electrical
resistance.    Which form of discharge will occur in any par
ticular instance depends, of course, on the special circum
stances of the case ; but, generally speaking, as the potential
increases, the tendency naturally         is,cateris paribus, for the
disruptive  to  predominate over the conductive.         In  the case
of   lightning the potential   is   so  great, that, for any form  of
“lightning-protector”     to   be efficient, the conductive facilities
offered must       correspondingly great; that
                  be                               is,  the protector
must offer   no  sensible resistance      earth, otherwise

                  Mr. R. S. Brough on a Case of Lightning.                                                107
tive discharge may take place from the protector itself, which
under these circumstances becomes merely a source of danger".
This tendency to disruptive discharge is taken advantage of
to protect telegraph-instruments from lightning. An earth
wire is brought very near to the line-wire, from which it is
insulated by only a very thin stratum of air; when the poten
tial of the line-wire rises abnormally, a disruptive discharge
takes place at this point, and the receiving-instrument is thus
saved.
   I    havetwice lately seen it stated that Sir W. Thomson
found that the resistance of air to disruptive discharge de
creased as the thickness of the stratum increased ; and a
French writer has referred the possibility of the occurrence
             §y.
of lightning discharges several kilometres in length to this
Cause.           Thomson's earlier experiments certainly showed
this unexpected result, probably due to the minute distances
at which he was operating ; but a later series of experiments,
made at larger distances, showed this result in a much less
marked degree; and Sir W. Thomson himself says, “it seems
most probable that at still greater distances the electromotive
force will be found to be sensibly constant, as it was certainly
expected to be at               all
                         distances”                   f.

now employed          lightning-protectors
                            as                     buildings       not     on                        do
“attract”    lightning.    This statement     literally true, accord

    the place than      the protector were not there.

Clerk-Maxwell does not        appear      hold this  opinion

 108        Mr. R. S. Brough     on a Case   of Lightning.
 with a lofty metallic rod, discharge is more likely to occur

 than if the rod were away. In proof of this may refer to
 the case reported by Mr. Pidgeon in “Nature,” and subse
 quently discussed before the Society of Telegraph Engineers
 (Proceedings, May 12, 1875), in which the                     acted the
 part of an ordinary “lightning-protector.”                          -
    Professor Clerk-Maxwell observed, in his paper recently read
 before the British Association at Glasgow, that such lightning
 protectors are designed rather to relieve the charged cloud
 than to protect the threatened building.           In fact lightning
 rods are legitimately employed for this very purpose in the
 vineyards, where the object in view is to relieve charged
 clouds and prevent disruptive discharges and the consequent
showers of hail.
    Under ordinary circumstances, however, the noise and light
 of the lightning-flash must be regarded as a very harmless, if
 disagreeable,    way of getting rid of some of the potential
 energy of electrical separation.
    The protection of cities on the same principle, even if ne
 cessary or desirable, would be too expensive and unsightly
 ever to be put in practice. But Faraday has proved that if
 our houses were made of metal, they would constantly remain
 at the potential of the earth, we should virtually be “under
 ground,” and live within them in perfect security. The iron
 churches occasionally employed in Europe fulfil this condition
 exactly. It is not, of course, usually practicable to live in
 metal houses; but we can live in almost equally effective
 metal cages formed by running conductors connected to earth
along the summit, eaves, and corners of our houses".
    The usual rod protectors appear to be only suitable to such
structures as themselves determine lines of maximum induc
tion, e.g. church-spires, factory-chimneys, flagstaffs, &c.
    The case of lightning referred to at the beginning of this
paper is of peculiar interest, because we know precisely the
mechanical effect produced by the flash, and from this we can
work back and estimate roughly the potential and quantity of
the electrical discharge.
    In the first place we can calculate the force required to
burst the cylindrical portion of the porcelain insulator into
which the iron stalk is cemented.
    Let r = radius of the inside of the cylinder,
       R=           27       outside        77
 and    F  = the resistance to bursting ;

        has been deduced by Professor Maxwell          Mag.
Dec. 1873) that the number of molecules contained in a cubic
centimetre of any gas at normal density may be estimated,
in round numbers, at 19 million billions. This is carefully
given     Professor Maxwell as a probable or approximative re
sult.   }
       But,  on the other hand, it should be kept in view that
the result is estimated on the basis of experimental data; and
other results predicted by mathematics in connexion with the
kinetic theory, and
                      Wis, admit of direct test by experiment,
have (as is well known) been confirmed in a striking manner.
Also it is needless to add that mathematics is not less cer
tain because the dimensions dealt with are small. Sir William
Thomson in a paper on “Atoms,” published in “Nature'
(March 31st, 1870), by four distinct lines of argument arrives
at accordant results as limiting values for dimensions of mole
cular structure;    and these results agree very well with the
above    estimate         of Professor Maxwell.Sir William Thomson
finally remarks that the results may be considered as estab
lished with “a very high degree of probability.”
    3. Taking, therefore, Professor Maxwell's result in refer
ence to a gas, if we take the cube root of the number of mo
lecules contained in a cubic centimetre, or ~/ 19 × 10”, we
have the number of molecules which (placed at their mean
distances) would reach the length of a linear centimetre, or
 we have 2,668,400. The mean distance of the molecules of
a gas at normal density is therefore gag, and of a centimetre,
about one seven-millionth of an inch—which, it may be re
 marked, is about one seventh of the distance capable of being
 measured by a Whitworth machine.             We have now to con
 sider what the effect is on rarefying the gas. To clear the
 ideas, suppose

                          is commonly termed a “Vacuum.”                                  113
visible on any scale, and the number of molecules of re
sidual gas contained even in a cubic centimetre of space may
be reckoned by billions.     In the case of what would be re
#.        as an ordinary “good  vacuum,” such as that used in
   eissler's vacuum-tubes for electric discharges (say, 0-7 of a
millimetre of mercury, or a rarefaction of one thousandth),
the distance shifted through by the molecules under the
action of the pump in the act of rarefying would be only
about Hºng of an inch, and the number of molecules in a
cubic centimetre of the residual gas 19 thousand million mil
lions (a cubic centimetre being about one fourteenth of a cubic
inch).
   5. It may perhaps be of interest to consider what effect the
rarefaction has upon the mean path of the molecules of gas,
the mean path being the mean or average distance moved
through by a molecule before coming into collision with ano
ther molecule. The mean path of the molecules of several
well-known gases has been calculated by Professor Maxwell
from some carefully executed diffusion-experiments by M.
Loschmidt.    The mean path of a molecule of hydrogen at
normal   density  is given at 0000965 of a millimetre, or
about     gºod  of an inch. Loschmidt has deduced the fol
lowing proportion:-‘As the volume of a gas is to the combined
volume of all the molecules contained in        the mean pathit,   a so
ofa molecule          to   one eighth      of
                                    the diameter              of
                                                     molecule.”  The is
mean path            of  a        therefore increases directly
                            molecule                              the                as

nished.         The mean path accordingly increases directly      the                as
number          oftimes the gas    rarefied.

these
       assumptions may naturally arise from the idea that in
a “vacuum,” so termed, the molecules of gas are few and
widely scattered. This, we have shown, is by no means the fact.
It may therefore be worth while investigating from the above
result of Professor Maxwell what the mean path of the mole
cules of gas is at the degree of rarefaction at which the rota
tion of the radiometer was observed to be at a maximum. This
maximum is stated in Mr. Crookes's paper to have occurred
in the case of hydrogen at a rarefaction of 50 millionths.

  III.  Temperature being 2°4 C., an electromotive force of
0-0087 volt gave (after waiting eleven minutes to allow the
current to overcome any previous polarization) a deflection of
212, corresponding with a resistance of 355,000 ohms per
cubic centimetre.      Allowing the temperature to fall slowly,
we found the readings to remain pretty steady for thirty-four
minutes when the temperature had become —0°-6 C. From
this time there was a moderately rapid increase of resistance
up to 14 megohms per cubic centimetre after forty-three                               mi
nutes, the temperature now being —3°8 C. The deflection

    It  might have been expected that doubling the electromo

 the diminution of resistance in a dielectric produced by time
of charging only proceeds gradually—whereas the deflection
only increased from 30:1 to 39-5.              This peculiarity is shown

of the ice. We charged for ten seconds with an electromotive

it is possible, however, that the apparently corresponding
points of maximum temperature and maximum conductivity
shown in the curves (fig. 2) may not have really exactly cor

companied changes in the current.

   In the above  experiments the ice condenser always remained
short-circuited while the temperature was being raised between
each set of experiments. The results obtained' appear to show
that the specific inductive capacity of ice does not materially
alter from -9°5 C. to —2°5 C.; the apparent change
near the melting-point is very probably due to the increased
                #º
conductivity of the ice allowing much of the charge to be lost
before the            through the galvanometer. Our preceding
experiments have shown that the conductivity                           of
                                                                            {   *}

increases regularly without discontinuity from                  —10°C. to +10°
C., although altering very rapidly at 0°C., where the change of
state occurs.     The specific inductive capacity, on the other
hand, appears to             very little while the dielectric (ice)
is solid, and perhaps   also changes very little while the dielec
tric (water) is liquid.    It must therefore probably undergo a
great change at the melting-point, since we have shown that
the specific inductive capacity of water at 8°7 C. is about
2240 times that of ice at –13°5 C. The specific inductfue
capacity seems therefore to be a stress and strain phenomenon,
and to    i.
          intimately connected with the rigidity of the body;
whereas the connexion between conductivity and rigidity
seems to be less marked. This, we think, bears out       recent             all

removed—say half an inch of water. The motion in the sur
rounding air was explored first with a candle-flame, and then
with a pendulum formed by a piece of light fluff attached to a
thread. The latter means proved far the most sensitive. The
motion consisted of a forward blast occupying a cone of ver
tical angle 20° to 30°, the outer air streaming towards the cone
from all sides. The inclination of the stream to the axis of
the tube is approximately half that of the radius vector from
the end of the tube to the point—the inclination of the stream
Fº
being nil at points close to the tube itself, about 45° at points
in the plane of the mouth, and nearly at right angles to the
             axis of the tube where the stream joins the outward
   last.  The phenomenon is that familiar as the origin of the
steam blast, and in connexion with a well-known problem in
hydrodynamics.
     When the flame was placed close to the pipe, a short dis
tance behind the mouth, it curled over and bent towards the
mouth in such a way that it was hardly possible to believe
that the air was not being drawn in. A tube was then used
disconnected from the bellows, and the air alternately drawn
in and blown out while the flame was in the above position ;
 the movements of the flame, when suitably placed, were undis
 tinguishable in the two cases. It is therefore clear that we
 have here a source of transformation, in the case of musical
 pipes with open ends, by which the octave of the note of the
 pipe must be formed in the surrounding air. The amount of
 transformation due to this cause, however, is small ; for the
 currents of this description are very faint.
     The case of a tube terminating in a plane or flange was
 then examined. A brass tube about 2 feet long and 9 inches
  in diameter was fitted with a flange 6 inches in diameter,
 through a hole in the centre of which the end of the tube
 passed.    The other end of the tube fitted into the sound-board
 of   the acoustic bellows, by means of which currents of air
 could be driven through the tube.       Burning substances which
 gave off dense smoke were placed on the flange; and the course
 of the smoke was watched against a dark background. The
 issuing air diverged in a cone with vertical angle 20° to 30°.
     When the blast was strong enough, a steady horizontal cur
  rent was maintained along the surface of the flange directed
  towards the issuing cone; the smoke was carried in by this
  current and mixed with the issuing air, which then formed a
  well-defined cone. There was here a source of inaccuracy in
  the upward tendency of the smoke; there could, however, be
  little doubt that the currents of the outer air preserved a direc
 tion nearly at right angles to the prolonged axis of the tube.

    I failed to get any distinctdifference in the vertical angle
with and without the   flange, though   it is clear some such dif
ference must exist;                   I
                        also failed to ascertain any dependence
of the vertical angle on the pressure or velocity of issue. Pos
sibly with an apparatus adapted for accurate measures differ
ences of this kind may be shown to exist.
    Secondly, as to air sucked into the orifice of the pipe.                                             I
have made but few experiments in this case; but there can be

                                   tend towards the orifice, and

with the numerical results of Helmholtz's theory and with ex
periment.    It must be understood that these numerical results
can be obtained in several different ways; and other condi
tions, such as knowledge of the coefficient of extinction, or
proportion"of energy failing to reach the source after reflexion,
and knowledge of the actual form of motion, must be applied
to distinguish between the hypotheses.     The calculation re
duces itself, according to the methods of the last note, to the

where S is the surface of the wave-front.
   To determine this surface,
let a be the radius A C of the
circular end (So) of a cylin
drical tube, r the radius with
which the spheres are de
scribed whose sections are the
circles shown, r being also the
distance through which a
given disturbance is supposed
to have travelled since it left
So.    It is required to find the
surface of revolution about the axis                  of the tube traced out by
the outer limit of the circles shown.
   The curved half-ring surface traced out by the semicircle
whose centre is A is easily found by the theorem of Guldin :
it is

                      those which must express the motion. We
can draw at           one conclusion about such functions in
general, for which we have been already prepared. Compare
the cases     in
              which the same form       r=a diverges into hemiat
sphere and sphere.     One such   pair   values    726, '69; an of                is

       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Theory of Sound.         133
other such pair is 555, 53. Hence we infer that a flange
 which imposes hemispherical divergence affects the numerical
result by altering the form of motion near the source, and
that the difference between the results of various forms at
great distances is insignificant if the form near the source is
constrained to be the same.

We   can determine an approximately conical form of expansion
in this case which agrees fairly with the observed conditions,
as far as the position of the centre of phase and angle of diver
gent cone are concerned ; but the part of the observed pheno
 menon which consists of the flow of the surrounding air
towards the diverging cone is not truly represented; and we
have seen that the hypothesis, of which the law is an expres
sion, is not admissible.      Assume
                            S=tr(a+kr)”,
which represents a plane circle of radius a + kr; this may be
represented as tracing out a cone of semivertical angle k.      If
we then calculate r by the above formula, we find

                                r= H
Ascribing the known values to r, we find

respectively. This corresponds fairly with experiment, and
shows that we are approacimating to the form of function which
is capable of representing the observed facts.

  We   then showed how to calculate approximately the posi
tion of centre of phase for the case of uniform spreading from
the end of a pipe both with and without flange.
   We then showed that there are an infinite number of pos
sible forms of divergence, which can satisfy the known nu
merical conditions on the assumption of a suitable law of
divergence of reflected elements, and came to the conclusion
that the reflected energy-elements diverge within the issuin
cone nearly according to the numerical law which would                                                  .#
if they were reflected as if issuing from an image of the source.
We see that the real explanation cannot involve any such
reflexion; and we get a sort of idea of the direction in which
the explanation lies.

   I. The two following propositions are included under the law
           effects of simultaneous electromotive forces are super
pOSa Die.
   (a)  Iftwo jars be made of the same glass but of different thick
messes, if they be charged to the same potential for equal times,
discharged for equal times, and then insulated, the residual charge
will after equal times have the same potential in each.
   (b) Residual charge is proportional to exciting charge.
   These propositions are verified experimentally within the limits
of errors of observation.
  II.  Electric displacement through a dielectric may be supposed
to depend not only on the electromotive force at the instant, but
also in part on the electromotive forces at          previous times.                      all
If  we assume that the effect       the electromotive force of   any                                      at
previous time decreases according       some law    the time elapsed

tance (thousands of times as great as 1, 2, or 3) and small residual
charge.
         Electrolytic conduction may occur through the soda-lime
glasses at the ordinary temperature      of the air.
   Summary.—The experiments appear to verify the fundamental
hypothesis, viz. that the effects on a dielectric of past
                                                               and pre
sent electromotive forces are superposable.           Ohm's law asserts
the principle of superposition in bodies in which conduction is
not complicated by residual charge.           Conduction and residual
charge may be treated as parts of the same phenomenon—an after
effect, as regards electric displacement, of electromotive force.
The experiments appear to show that the principle of Ohm's law
is true of the whole phenomenon of conduction through glass.

Production of Induced Currents in Electrolytes.” By J. A. Fleming,

   This paper contains an account of an experimental inquiry
into the production of induced currents in liquids by magneto
electric induction.   Faraday examined one such case of induction,
in which a  conducting  liquid was used as a secondary circuit. He
coiled round the armature of an electromagnet an india-rubber tube
filled with dilute sulphuric acid, and found, on making and breaking
the primary circuit, the induced currents generated in                             the             it,   as   in
case        metallic conductors; but

                                                                                                                        in in

current generated in it by its movement.     It was noticed that the
plates were polarized by the currents so created. As a consequence
of this, the deflection of the needle soon fell to zero; and on the -
liquid flow being stopped, a polarization current in the opposite
direction was obtained. This proved that in experiments on induc
tion in liquids, in order to obtain any constant current, non-polar
izable electrodes must be used.
   2. Production of induced current in a mass of liquid rotating over
a magnetic pole.—In this case radial currents should be produced.
They were obtained as follows:—Flat porous cells were placed
round the circumference of a large basin, and in the centre a cylin
drical one. These were filled with a solution of cupric sulphate,
and contained copper plates. The basin was filled with dilute sul
 phuric acid. The centre copper plate was connected with one
 pole of the galvanometer, and the circumferential ones with the
 other.    The whole was placed over the pole of the electromagnet.
 On exciting the magnet and rotating the dilute acid, a constant
 current was obtained, flowing from centre to circumference or the
 reverse according to the direction of rotation.      With platinum
 electrodes the effect cannot be obtained, but with non-polarizable
 electrodes it is easily produced.   Mercury was likewise tried with
 still better results.
   3. Production of induced current in a liquid at rest in a variable
magnetic  field.—If a flexible tube filled with conducting liquid is
wound round an electromagnet, and into the ends electrodes placed
so as to include a galvanometer in the circuit, then induced currents
are obtained whenever the strength of the magnet varies. This is
the case examined by Faraday.          His experiment was repeated
by MM. Logeman and Van Breda (Phil. Mag. [IV.] vol. viii. p. 465),
who noticed that the electrodes were left polarized after the induced
current had passed. These experiments were repeated with more
powerful apparatus, using a soft-iron wire core within the inducing
helix instead of solid iron, and employing a condenser in the
primary circuit.    Very strong induced currents were obtained, and
correspondingly great polarization of the electrodes placed in the
ends of the coil of acid. It was hoped that the currents might
produce visible inductive electrolysis; but even this improved
arrangement did not yield that result.              Other saline solutions
were tried with similar results.
   Lastly, the phenomenon observed by Arago, of the retardation
in the vibrations of a magnetic needle oscillated near the surface
of liquids, is examined. Evidence is brought forward to show that
this is not, as in the case of solid plates, due to induced currents
created in the liquid:—(1) because the retardation           is,
                                                               carteris paribus,
not   proportional     tothe   conductivity   ofthe  liquid    but dependent
on its   volatility;  (2) because    it takes  place   equally   when   a   light
brass   needle,  oscillated    by torsion,  issubstituted for the       magnet,
 provided the needle     is light and the period      ofoscillation not very
 small. Thus       a  magnetic     needle which    required       min.
                                                                   4      20  sec.

   In conclusion the magneto-electric induction taking place in
moving masses of water on the earth's surface under the influence
of terrestrial magnetism is briefly discussed.
   Before the introduction    of the absolute system of electro
magnetic measure, there was no means of estimating the electro
motive force so brought into play by the flow of a river or ocean
stream, and the magnitude of the effect was perhaps over
estimated.

    Such redetermination was not superfluous, as appeared from a
 collation of the statements to be found in various standard works.
 In the tables of specific gravities compiled by Prof. F. W. Clarke,
 and published by the Smithsonian Institution*, there are four
 authorities quoted, with the numbers given by these, as follows:–
                                                                                     Sp. gr. of solid mercury.

   The last of these numbers, on reference to the original papert,
turns out to represent no actual experiment with mercury itself,
but is the density calculated for this metal from the examination
of a number of amalgams. Kupffer and Cavallo do not profess to
 give the exact density, but merely state it as about 14, the number
 apparently resting on no special experiment, though             have not                           I
 been able to verify this by reference to their paper S.        The only
 other apparently independent statement I have met with occurs in
 the ‘Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes’ for 1876 (p. 385), where
 the density 14:39 is given on the authority of Rivot; but have not                                 I
 been able to find any reference to a paper by him bearing on this
 or any analogous point, and it seems probable that we have here
 only a reproduction of Schulze's result.     In different handbooks of
 chemistry and physics numbers between 14 and 15 are given as
 approximations, but with no other authority than some of the above.
 Some of the best and most recent works simply state that mercury
 undergoes considerable contraction in freezing.       Hence our know
ledge on this subject appears hitherto to have rested on the experi
ments of Schulze and Biddle, both of which date back to the
early years of the present century.     Schulze's paper was published
in “Gehlen's Journal, vol.                         iv.

 1808; and Biddle's belongs        the year 1805.        have had access                  I
to  neither; but the character      the instrumental means (balances,
thermometers, &c.) generally available        the time the experiments   at

                                        to         be unlikely that very              it

   The method adopted in the experiments lately made in this
laboratory was the following:—
                                 Mallet on the Density of Solid Mercury.
   (1) A specific-gravity flask was prepared from a large cylindrical
         by closing in, and smoothly rounding, in the flame of the
 amp one end of the cylinder, while the tube remaining attached
to the other end was cut short and united by fusion to a second
pipette of like shape but smaller size, the upper and open end of
the shortened tube of which was fitted with a small carefully
                                                                                                        147
ground glass stopper.      The neck between the larger and smaller
cylinders was drawn down to a small bore (about 2 millims.), and
at this narrowed part a fine line marked round it with a diamond.
The shape of the vessel is shown in the annexed sketch, on a linear
scale of one half the real size.  The principal cylinder held about
58 cubic   centimetres,   and the small reservoir above 25 cub.
centims.   The whole vessel weighed about 46 grammes.
   It enabled the experiments to be carried out with more than
half a kilogramme of frozen mercury.
   (2) This vessel having been accurately weighed when empty and
dry,         its
          capacity                up   to
                          the mark was ascertained      filling                          by             it   to

    (11) The specific-gravity flask having been emptied and dried,
558.9353 grammes of mercury was introduced, the metal having just
previously been purified by careful treatment with dilute nitric acid,
washing with water, and quiet distillation from a glass retort.
Filling up with the same alcohol as that used in the above ex
 .
periments, and which had been kept in a well-stoppered bottle, the
 flask was gradually cooled, and finally, in the last freezing-mixture,
the mercury frozen, and the alcohol brought exactly to the mark,
 taking care that it became and remained quite stationary, while
 during the freezing of the mercury the change of volume was very
rapid and easily observable.               The temperature having been noted
when the final adjustment was made, the little flask was set aside,
stoppered, until it could be washed off and dried, and was then
allowed to acquire the temperature of the balance-case, and weighed.
               before introduction into the final freezing-mixture, and a separate
small portion in a tube was similarly cooled, to be used in filling up to the
mark if necessary.        The stopper was carefully inserted as soon as the adjust
ment of the liquid was secured, so as to avoid any loss by evaporation.
    * This weighing was not quite so satisfactory as the remainder; the tempe
rature a little doubtful.

F.G.S.
  The author              describes sections              of   strata     in   the south      of   Russia, and
traces the following succession                         of     events:—
 *

152                         Geological Society.
     1. Deposition of marine Miocene beds when the Vienna basin and
 the Aralo-Caspian area were joined together, and had free com
 munication with the Mediterranean.
    2. Interruption of the communication with the Mediterranean,
 and deposition of the Sarmatic beds in a closed sea-basin.
    3. Gradual freshening of the water of this area and deposition of
the Congerian strata.
    4. Lowering of the water of the Vienna basin and Aralo-Cas
 pian area to below the present level of the ocean, and great denuda
 tion of the preceding strata. The author thinks that the drainage
 was at this time to the north.
    5. Interruption of drainage to the north and deposition of flu
 viatile beds, with freshwater shells of existing species and remains
 of the Mammoth and Irish Elk.
    6. Drainage to the north completely stopped and formation of
 a great lake, over which floated icebergs with northern drift.  For
 mation of diluvial clay of the south and boulder clays of the north
 of Russia.
    7. Lake gradually lowered by the cutting through of the channel
 of the Bosphorus.
    The author considers that the formation of the great lake was
 due to the ice of the glacial period flowing down the beds of the
 Atlantic and Pacific, and damming back the drainage of the con
 tinents as far as it extended.    To the rising of these waters he
 ascribes the destruction of palaeolithic man, the mammoth, and the
 woolly rhinoceros, which he considers are prediluvial.     This lake
 was once suddenly and torrentially discharged through the breaking
 away of the Atlantic ice-dam, causing the outspread of the middle
 glacial sands and gravels, but was formed again, and ultimately
drained by the cutting through of the channel of the Bosphorus.
    He also offers suggestions to account for the preservation of the
 Aralo-Caspian fauna and the arrival of Arctic animals in the area.
  3.      “The Glacial Period.”  By J. F. Campbell, Esq., F.G.S.
     Inthis paper the author gave the results of numerous observa
tions extending over many years, and made in many different parts
of the world, the results of which had led him to form the opinion
that no geological record exists of any abnormal Glacial periods
colder than the present world's climate.      But if the term “ Glacial
period” be used with a limitation, such as “local,” or “Alpine,”
or “European,” he saw nothing to object                 to.

  4. “The Action of Coast-ice on an oscillating area.” By Prof.
John Milne, F.G.S., of the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokio,
Japan.
  In this paper the author   described the results of observations
made by him in Newfoundland, Labrador, and Finland, which had
led him to believe that many of the marks generally regarded as
furnishing evidence of the existence of an ice-cap, or at least of an
enormous extension of land-ice at certain periods, might easily be
explained by the action of coast-ice upon an oscillating, and espe
cially a rising area.

 ON   THE SPECTRUM OF THE ELECTRIC SPARK IN A COMPRESSED
                         GAS.     BY A. CAZIN.
ITFrankland,
    is generally admitted, from the observations of Wüllner,
              Lockyer, and Cailletet, that the spectral lines of an
incandescent gas become more and more spread as the pressure is
augmented, and under a sufficient pressure unite to form a conti
nuous spectrum.      I am led by my own observations upon air and
nitrogen to the following proposition:-"The electric spark in a
gas is analogous to the flame of an ordinary hydrocarbon.”          In
each of these sources of light there are gaseous particles, which
produce a line spectrum, and solid or liquid particles, which pro
duce a continuous spectrum.        In the spark the latter come from
the electrodes, and from the sides when these are very close.
                                     i.
When the pressure is increased, these particles become more abun
dant, their continuous spectrum grows brighter, and at last causes
the line spectrum of the gaseous particles to disappear.
   It is in the fiery trail that things happen thus; the paler lumi
nous sheath called the aureole is            of gaseous particles, the
line  spectrum   of which is more or less visible: it is to the total
spark what the blue base of the flame of a taper is to the entire
flame.
   My first experiments on this subject are of the month of May
1876, and were at that time communicated to the Société Philo
matique.   I  observed the spectrum by means of an ordinary spec
troscope with a single, very dispersive prism.      The gas was com
pressed in a glass tube by aid of a sort of mercury piezometer. A
platinum wire is soldered to the upper end of the tube; a second
wire, similar, is kept, inside, parallel to the preceding by an iron
wire fixed to the bottom of the tube and which dips in the mer
cury.    A large Ruhmkorff coil produces the spark between the
                                                 by
platinum wires; and      its image is thrown     lens upon the slit
                                                 a                  of
the spectroscope.

   At the ordinary pressure, in nitrogen, the spark is pale and
ridged with little strokes of fire; in the spectroscope, upon the
wires are seen the channellings attributed to nitrogen, and in the
intervals between these the principal lines of that gas.                On com
pressing, one sees the channellings gradually fade, while the lines
grow fainter and the continuous ground of the spectrum becomes
brighter.     At two atmospheres there are only six nitrogen-lines
from the orange to the blue, and five diffuse bands beyond. At ten
atmospheres there remain only two nitrogen-lines,                  A=567 and
X'=500, and then a brilliant line in the violet (A"=424), which
made      its
            appearance       five atmospheres, and which from my last
                                            at

About        atmospheres the spark becomes dazzling; upon the con

instantaneously passed from one electrode                 the other,           so    to                           as

    The lines indicated by an asterisk have been already noted as
belonging to nitrogen; the others have not before been observed.
Among these, those which are indicated by the letter a are not
produced in air with knobs of tin; the rest are common to both
spectra, and consequently belong to nitrogen or hydrogen.                       Most
of the a lines are more intense at the extremities than in the middle;
 the spectrum obtained with knobs of tin showed that the lines of
the electrodes present this peculiarity.                This effect is rendered
most apparent by placing the spark parallel to the slit of the spec
troscope.
    In the chief experiment which remains to be described the spark
is perpendicular to the slit. We have then on the photograph
some short lines, and long ones which extend on both sides beyond
the median band of the spectrum.                  After operating on nitrogen at
the   ordinary     pressure,       I  compressed     the gas in the cylinder to
 eight atmospheres, and took a photograph without making any
change in the apparatus.              The comparison of the two proofs ob
tained at 1 and at 8             atmospheres    fully confirms my proposition.
 At 1   atmosphere        the    nitrogen-lines    extend on both sides of the
median region impressed by a feeble continuous light; throughout
                                                ãº
their length they are admirably sharp, since more than thirty of
them could be measured in the space of 3 millime res.
    At 8 atmospheres the median region is quite continuous, and
the lines of the gas can hardly be                                 there; but these
extend in both directions as in the              preceding  spectrum,        and pre
serve their sharpness.             This is precisely the effect which would be
 produced by a trail of fire formed by solid particles of dust and en
compassed by an aureole of luminous gas.

           PHOTOMETRIC RESEARCHES ON COLOURED FLAMES.
                           BY M. GOUY.

                                    had, in the absence of any data
on the subject,  to make a  preliminary  study of the conditions on
which the  brightness of coloured flames depends: the most impor
tant are the thickness of the flame, its composition, the nature of
the salt, and the quantity of it carried along in the combustible
mixture.    The apparatus employed has been described in the
Comptes Rendus *.
   1. The augmentation of brightness of a line when the thickness
of the flame becomes twice as great is easily deduced from the ex
periments described in a previous Note.       That result, controlled
and completed by another method, leads to this relation:—When
                                                                                      ...    1           -

  little   proportion     the brightness as  the flame increases.    The
                                                                     of

   3. It was first ascertained that solutions diluted to Tºm are con
verted to powder and carried along by the gaseous mixture in the
same quantity, whatever be the substance dissolved.         For that
purpose a crystal of nitrate of calcium is added to a portion of a
solution of nitrate of strontium ; the liquid gives the spectrum of
strontium with the same brightness as the original solution.     The
experiment repeated with other salts gives the same results.     It is
therefore sufficient, in order to compare salts having the same base
and different acids, to prepare dilute solutions of them containing
the same quantity of metal per litre and submit them to experi
ment.    Each salt is compared with the nitrate by pulverizing each
of the two solutions alternately, and thus making four or six cross
experiments.      Here is a series of measurements made with a

162            Prof. G. Wiedemann on     the Magnetic
former professors of the type theory; and in many quarters it
is regarded as the firm and final foundation upon which the
edifice of our chemical science has to be built. If in particulars
views sometimes differ, yet upon the whole the structure theory
is believed to express decisively the constitution of chemical
compounds, the placing of their atoms.       Nay, some have even
gone so far as to wish to render the latter in symbolical repre
sentations; and in consequence of this, a few individuals have
esteemed the schematic notation of the bonds on a plane sur
face not sufficient, the molecule being corporeal—an error
which can only have resulted from a strange confusion of
symbol with reality, the figurative representation of the sup
posed reciprocal binding of the atoms with the shape of the
molecule consisting of them.
    It is frequently held that a purely chemical investigation is
sufficient, without the measurement of vapour-density, to
establish the relative positions of the atoms in compounds in
                                 j,
the sense of the structure theory. Corresponding to this me
thod of investigation, besides the molecular weight, the struc
tural formulae represent, although in a very complete manner,
yet only the processes out of           they have resulted; they
mark the groups of atoms which, on the various chemical
attacks (heating &c.), separate from the combinations or are
exchanged with others.       Meanwhile other questions are:—
whether, beyond these limits of direct observation, the funda
mental hypotheses of the structure theory (often not a little
complicated notwithstanding their apparent simplicity) can be
brought into harmony with the principles of general mecha
nics; and how far it can account for the physical properties
of the compounds, which properties must yet result immedi
ately from their chemical constitution.
    This is not the place to enter upon a more special reply to
 these questions, of which especially the first would require a
 very detailed discussion. In regard to the second we will only
 cursorily mention that in fact the structural formulae indicate
 very well in isolated cases certain regularities in the physical
 properties. Thus the isomorphism of some substances coin
 *
 cides with the analogy of their formulae (KNO, and CaCO3,
          The repeated entry in like manner of CH, into the for
 mulae of the fatty acids, alcohols, aromatic compounds, with
 the normal twofold binding of the carbon atom of that group
 to two other carbon atoms, corresponds to a like alteration of
 the boiling-point, the molecular volume, the refraction-equi
 valent: the latter constants are different with isomeric com
 pounds of different structure, &c.
    On the contrary, the structural formulae do not in any way

              Behaviour of Chemical Compounds.               163
conform to the electrolytic deportment of the compounds.
While in the case of non-electrolyzable substances considera
tions upon electrical contrarieties of their constituents, without
experimental foundation, can only be the subject of purely
theoretical speculations, the separation, effected by the same
current, of various electrolytes into their ions proves that the
latter contain equal quantities of positive or negative electri
city (are electrolytically equivalent). This equivalence is not
everywhere expressed by the structural formulae: thus in the
compounds FeCl2 and Fe, Cl, equal quantities of chlorine
   2Cl), on the one hand, and the different quantities of iron
   Fe and 3 Fe) combined with them, on the other, are equiva
lent. It is the same with chloride of potassium and the yel
low prussiate of potash, to which are assigned the formulae
 KCl and 4K+FeCys, while yet the equivalence of equal quan
 tities of potassium in them is ascertained, and so on. These
 electrolytic relations of the compounds, however, would surely
 have as much right to be taken into account, in the conside
 ration of their structure, as their chemical properties; and it
 is obvious that a complete knowledge of the constitution must
 give a full account of them as well as of the latter.
      Similar relations present themselves on the consideration
 of the magnetic properties of compounds.       While in the che
 mical and electrolytic investigation of bodies it is always the
 result of a displacement or separation of their atoms that is
 discovered, and consequently only at the beginning and end
 of certain states of motion is the way in which they are com
 bined considered, the magnetic investigation of compounds
 offers the advantage that we can study a physical property
 altogether characteristic of the individual atoms of the com
  pounds without any decomposition, on the unaltered compounds,
  and can therefore draw a conclusion respecting the particular
  behaviour of those atoms in them.
     Permit me, in the following, to epitomize the communica
  tions which I  have previously published on the magnetic be
  haviour of chemical compounds, together with an account of
  more recent observations     on the same subject.     Perchance
  this combination may furnish a fresh instance of even a purely
  physical method of investigation sometimes giving a revela
  tion, in certain directions, respecting the constitution of che
  mical compounds, such as could never be attained through
  purely chemical reactions exclusively.

 measured by meansof a torsion balance. The head of it could

   Therefore, so far as can be concluded from the preceding
observations,   the magnetism of the dissolved salt diminishes
proportionately with the rise of temperature, and, for all the
salts hitherto investigated, notwithstanding their great chemical
difference, according to the same law.
   The number 0.325 coincides approximately with the coeffi
cient of the diminution of electric conductivity of the metals
with rise of temperature.

magnetism calculated for the unit of weight of the salts dis
solved in water is equal to m, and the molecular weight of the
salts A, the value p = Am is the magnetism of one molecule
of the salt in question,                        its
                                molecular magnetism.      like                                      In

   The salts may also exhibit a similar alteration when their
density is increased by drying and heating to redness.       In
some  cases, especially with the salts of the strongly magnetic
metals, certainly at first a greater reciprocal action of the
magnetically directed elements of the individual magnetic
molecular groups, and therefore an augmentation of the
temporary moment under an equal external force, may also be
thereby conditioned—for instance, with the cobaltous and
nickelous chlorides. In other cases the rotability of the mag
netic elements in the individual groups of molecules may be
diminished.
    The effect of the alteration of the molecules in consequence
of condensation might also be, that the molecular currents
              º
induced by the magnet, which condition the diamagnetic
behaviour of the bodies, would, along with the turning of the
magnetic atoms endowed with permanent magnetic molecular
currents, come forth with greater intensity, whence, therefore,
likewise a diminution of the temporary magnetism would
result. This is particularly evident with the very dense
cupric bromide. That through alteration of the density alone
the proper                    of the magnetic atoms themselves is
changed, is per
                      º  a  scarcely   admissible assumption.
    Except in such extreme cases, however, the divergencies
between the magnetisms of the dissolved and the solid salts
are but slight.      Accordingly we say, generally, that with like
chemical   properties   of the metallic atom in the molecule of dif
ferent compounds           its
                          atomic magnetism         also the same.

bromide), while the cuprous salts and also metallic copper
are feebly diamagnetic.       Therefore a diamagnetic metal
(copper) combined with diamagnetic elements (e.g. bromine)

the molecular groups of metallic copper—groups in them

for the investigation of the behaviour of two salt-solutions
with double decomposition. An aliquot part of the salt
solution the magnetism of which was investigated in the flask
of the torsion-apparatus was put into the flask with a quantity
of potash or soda lye, or liquid ammonia, sufficient to produce
precipitation; with the latter the flask was filled up to the
mark, and after agitation, before deposition, the magnetism of
the hydrate determined.          The calculation of the magnetism of
the precipitated oxide took place as above, except only that
from the magnetism of the precipitated solution that of the
glass and the water, or of the soda or potash lye or the am
monia (which differed but very slightly from that of the
water), was deducted.

  partly very approacimately the same             those  as the correspond    of

  the altered density-ratios, we may perhaps assume that these
  values would, under otherwise similar circumstances,
                                                                                         of be

172               Prof. G. Wiedemann on the Magnetic
     If ferric
             hydrate be dissolved in a not too dilute solution of
ferric chloride (in which latter, according to the experiments
to be subsequently mentioned, the ferric chloride continues
without dissociation almost unaltered), the magnetism of the
solution is composed directly of that of the ferric chloride and
that of the colloid solution of ferric oxide, as well as that of
the water.
   Such a solution contained 0-177 gram of iron in the ferric
chloride, 0.020 gram of iron in the colloid solution of the
oxide. Its observed magnetism was equal to 30:07, while the
magnetism of an equal volume of a solution of ferric chloride,
which contained 0-394 gram of iron, was 68.31, and that of a
solution of colloid ferric oxide, which contained 0.204 gram
of iron, was 7-56. According to this the magnetism of the

number 11-7. The magnetism of the dissolved chromic oxide
was therefore about 0.94 of that of the chromic oxide in the
salts, and nearly equal to that of the precipitated chromic hy
drate: accordingly we cannot well assume that here the
chromic oxide is dissolved in the colloid state; it is much
more probable that the chromium in the alkaline solution is
                   in the same state as in the peroxide-salts.

              whose molecule is diatomic, and which is formed
by the combination of two elementary gases A and B. We

and it must therefore cut the curve C E at one point, and
only one.
   24. That the equations possessed at least one set of solu
tions answering the given conditions, we might have known
à priori, since the hypothesis is a possible one, and being a
possible one, must have some real solution.             But we could
not assert beforehand that there could only be one; and this
last result is most important, since it shows us that our hypo
thesis is not sufficient to account for the fact that a mixture of
two gases may exist at the same temperature in two different
states, as, for instance, N + 0 and NO.         From a priori consi
derations we     might    have  thought,  as                       I
                                                stated in § 6*, that
two such states could be      possible.  But,  further,  not only does
it show that the particular hypothesis of dissociation we have
used is incapable of explaining this fact, but it also leads us
to conclude that no other, depending on mutual influence as
affected by the motion of translation, is sufficient for the ex
planation.

           we consider fig. 1, we see that the reason why we can
only have one suitable solution is that the surfaces cut OA,

178        Mr. W. M. Hicks on           some Effects       of Dissociation
We know that the mean internal energy of the molecules is in
a constant ratio to the energy of agitation; and it is also
highly probable that when the internal energy of a particular
molecule is greater than a certain quantity, the molecule can
no longer exist. This would modify the distribution of the
velocities slightly; but the number breaking up in any time
from this cause will be expressed by the number of molecules
existing multiplied by a coefficient which is a function of the
temperature.    This only adds to the equations terms of the
form   —Xa,   -uy,  -v2, and, as before, we shall only get one
set of solutions.    None of these hypotheses, then, accounts
                 i.
for more than one state of a gas at a given temperature.      Is
it possible that, as some think, the action between two atoms
is alternately attractive and repulsive, and hence that colli
sions with          between (say) c and c' make the molecule
                                                           fºil.
split up, those with blows between c' and c” produce a combi
nation, &c., where c <c' &c" < ...? It is           that in this
case two states of the gas at the same temperature may be
possible ; but the reactions appear too complicated and arbi
trary to be consistent with the general simplicity of nature.
   Any hypothesis which would allow us to write the first two
equations in the form
                 ass(a-a')"—a - - - } =0, &c.,
where a is a positive function of the temperature <}, might
allow two or more states, as is evident by putting was 0, waa,
a =# in succession, when the left-hand member becomes posi
tive, negative, and possibly positive alternately. But cannot             I
see any physical justification for this form.        e seem driven,
then, to the conclusion that, though dissociation may exist to
some extent at         all
                     temperatures,        not sufficient
                                            it   is         account   to
for the fact that two gases may exist combined                   or
                                                        uncombined
at the same temperature.      Some modification will therefore                be
necessary; but what,        not clear: most probably
                             is                            combina-

tion  ofthe three  just suggested.
   27. Whatever our hypothesis may be, not only will                          it
be  necessary that the solutions         our equations satisfy the

  Number of this Journal, renders the reasoning less convincing.
 When the correction is made it will be found that the ratio of
 the specific heats, when 6,-5000, is not 1:4, but much smaller.
  For some value of 6, between 100° and 5000°, probably about
  500°, the value of     will become 1-4; but then & will be some
                       #
 thing near 4, and about three fifths of the gas will be in a
 state of dissociation.   This we cannot allow; for though we
 might explain the near equality of the pressures and specific
 heats of different gases by supposing that 6, is the same, or
 nearly the same, for each, yet the constancy of the specific
 heats with respect to temperature will not now hold even ap
 proximately. The difficulty as to the ratio of the specific heats
 therefore still remains.

 THEtwoeffect
            or more plane waves is in a few simple cases easily

    So far as know, the only apparatus of the kind in use by
lecturers is one based on the method described by Dr. Young
 (Natural Philosophy, Lecture xxxiii.); but here, to obtain
any variety of effects, a series of dissected waves are required,
and these are troublesome to make or expensive to purchase;
whereas with the arrangement          I now exhibit to the Society,
when once the framework of the          apparatus  is made, combina
tions of  any   desired waves    may    be  drawn,   with merely the
trouble incidental to cutting out the required waves in card
board or thin tin.
    The apparatus consists of a board, AA, about 3 feet long,
2 feet wide, and 1 inch thick, set upright on a base-board B.
A strip of cardboard, C, is fastened by drawing-pins to the
board; and on this is drawn the compound wave resulting
from the two component waves W, W’. These component
waves are cut out of strong cardboard or tin, and can be easily

 board F with the attached pencil ; and as this board F is car
 ried along it rises and falls to the elevations and depressions
of the wave W. But, as has been said, it also rises and falls
to the wave W: the motion of the pencil is therefore the alge

             it is apparent that to fix the valency of an element is
                              I think it is also apparent that at pre

                                                         we can look for
much help in this task. So difficult is it to determine the
valency of an elementary atom that many chemists have been
inclined to regard each element as possessed of several valen
cies varying with the compounds which the element forms.
Thus carbon in carbonous oxide would be regarded as a dyad,
and in carbonic oxide or in marsh-gas as a tetrad. Other chemists
have regarded the power of combining with a definite number
of hydrogen, chlorine, &c. atoms as an essential and unalter
able property of the elementary atom.            To say that the atom
of an element is now divalent, now trivalent, to attempt to
eaplain the differences between compounds by means of the
hypothesis of “varying valency”                          is,

two experiments which appear to be carried out under similar
conditions are really so carried out.
   Nevertheless we may arrive at a conviction that these two
quantities (valency and chemical composition) are really con
nected together, if we notice that “one always varies percep
tibly at the same time as the other”", although we may be
unable accurately to measure the quantities, or to state the
quantitative relations existing between them.
   The only way of dealing with the question before us                                                    is,  I

speak of Mendelejeff's periodic law.      The physical properties
 of compounds present us with measurable quantities; and it
 seems to me that by measuring certain of these we have a
 means of arriving at a more definite knowledge concerning
 the relations existing between structure and chemical function.

 the physical properties of compounds and their composition,
 as part of the wider problem of the connexion between che
 mical character and the valency of the combining atoms,                                                 I
 must content myself with the merest outline of the field of
 investigation.
    In a paper on Isomerism, published in this Magazine
                                       I
 (September 1876), drew attention to the probable connexion
 existing between the boiling-points and the composition of
 groups of chemical compounds.        Isomeric substances exhibit
 different boiling-points or different degrees of fluidity: we can
 scarcely do otherwise than attempt to correlate these with dif
 ferences in structure; and in the paper cited         adduced ex                I

lationf. The melting-points of solid substances are also, in
 allprobability, functions  the structure  of
                                          these bodies. Few           of
attempts have       yet been made towards systematizing the

numerous data must be first obtained.
   Most intimately connected with the boiling-points           liquids                    of
is the  question    the  vapour-tensions

connexion probably existing between the tension and the che
mical composition of vapours, it would be necessary to deter
mine the tensions of many groups of compounds at the same
temperature, or, better still, to determine the connexion exist
ing between tension and temperature for each compound
throughout a considerable range. Meyer" has well pointed
out the disadvantages of the usual practice, which is to deter
mine the temperature at which each vapour exerts a tension
equal to 760 millims. of mercury.        There is no doubt that
careful determinations of     vapour-tensions of groups of com
pounds would throw much light upon the composition, and so
upon the classification of these compounds f.
    Connected with determinations of boiling-points and of
vapour-tensions is the general question of specific and latent
heat.    We say that bodies have different capacities for heat,
or that different quantities of heat must be communicated to
equal masses of different bodies in order to produce equal              in
crements of temperature in these bodies.       Evidently part of
the heat communicated has disappeared; and different propor
            ãº.
tions of the total heat have disappeared in each case. W. have
adopted a practical unit for measuring the amount of heat
which has                    We believe that this heat has gone
to do work of some kind.       Different amounts of work must
be done in different elements and compounds before the heat
added begins to be apparent to our measuring-instruments.
There must surely be differences in the inner structure of these
elements and compounds. . May we not reasonably hope that
careful determinations of those quantities which we call spe
 cific and latent heats, carried out for groups of compounds as
 they have been partly carried out for groups of elements,
 will throw considerable light upon the composition of these
 compounds?
    In connexion with this subject we must look with much
 interest to the results of Weber's promised researches upon
            º
 the specific heats of carbon compounds. From his preliminary
 researches, Weber thought himself justified in concluding that
 “the specific heat of carbon when in combination is a function
 of the temperature, and of          all
                                   those circumstances which            in

   Measurements of the diffusion, of the viscosity, and of the
transpiration of liquids have already thrown some light upon
the chemical composition, and so upon the classification, of
these liquids.
   “The coefficient of diffusion represents                                    the rate at which
the equalization of chemical composition                                        goes on by the
exchange         of the molecules                       themselves.”               “The coefficient
of viscosity                   the rate at which the equalization
                     . . . . represents
of velocity goes  on by the exchange    of the momentum of the
molecules”.      In each case,                          “if
                                     the temperature remain the
same, the rate of equalization is inversely proportional to the
density”f.      But the density is proportional to the mass of
the molecules; hence heavy molecules will diffuse more slowly
than lighter molecules.    The velocity with which the mole
cules  diffuse, or the velocity with which they pass through
capillary tubes, will therefore be dependent upon the relative
masses   of those molecules; hence our knowledge of the mole
cular   weights  of solid and liquid compounds may be very ma
terially advanced by careful measurements of the coefficients
of diffusion, viscosity, and transpiration of various bodies.
And if this be                so,                                                             by

 been made upon the physical properties of groups of com
   ounds justify us in concluding that there is a close connexion
           these properties and the chemical composition of the
 compounds. To render this connexion more definite, to ex

 triumphs of chemical science.

properties.     If
                 we can do this, we have very strong evidence
(1) of the existence of an essential connexion between struc
ture and physical properties, and (2) in favour of the hypo
thesis of valency as a foundation on which to build a general
scheme of chemical classification.   As a matter of fact, che
mists have not yet succeeded in completing the chemical
history of any group of isomeric bodies; but            think that the    I
recent advances made in this direction warrant us in expecting
that the history of many groups will be thus completed—that
to do this is indeed a possibility, and that meanwhile to accept
the hypothesis of valency, as an hypothesis, is not to overstep
the limits of true scientific method.
    Again, given two or more elementary atoms, and given the
valency of these atoms, the existence of certain compounds
becomes, theoretically, impossible.        Every failure, succeeding
honest attempts, to prepare these bodies lends strength to the
theory. We have instances of such failures.
    It also becomes possible, on the assumption that the valen
cies of the constituent atoms of a compound are known, to
deduce the (theoretical) possibility or impossibility of the oc
currence of certain reactions.        It may be possible, we argue,
 to introduce a fresh atom of a certain valency into this com
pound; or we say the introduction of an atom of this valency
 must cause decomposition,-the compound, under the new
 condition of affairs, can no longer exist. Every experimental
 confirmation of such deductions is a point in favour of the
theory.     Are we not continually meeting with experimental
               .
confirmation of facts deduced from the theory of valency?
    In attempting to deduce possible reactions &c. from the
 theory of valency, and in attempting to confirm these deduc
 tions by appeal to experiment and observation, it is essential
 that we bear in mind how very imperfect our theory as yet                              is,

is necessary to fix our attention upon the chemical properties no
less than upon the physical properties of groups of compounds.
Assuming the hypothesis of valency, and given a certain
                dº
number of elementary atoms and the valencies of these atoms,
we deduce the possible existence of a group of compounds.
Have we any               means for recognizing the existence of
these compounds?        From a study of the chemical processes
involved in the formation, in the reactions, and in the decom
positions of a group of bodies, can we gain any insight into
the structure of these bodies?
   Now, granting that there is some kind of structure, we may
safely assume that difference in structure is correlated with
difference in chemical behaviour. From a study of chemical
behaviour we should then arrive at a knowledge of the struc
ture of the bodies under consideration. Let us take an ex
                                       i.
ample. Analysis and vapour-density determinations point to
the formula C, H, O as expressing          empirical composition
and molecular    weight  of common alcohol. From the theory
of  valency (the valencies of the constituent elements being Cº.,
H', and O’’) we deduce the possibility of the existence of two
compounds, each having the empirical formula C, HSO: for one
of these we have the constitutional formula CH3—CH2—O—H,
for the other the formula CH3—0—CHs. Which constitutional
formula is to be assigned to alcohol? When alcohol is acted
upon by sodium or potassium, one atom of hydrogen is ex
changed for one of metal ; the remaining five atoms of hy
drogen cannot be so exchanged: it is also possible to substitute
a monovalent group for one of the hydrogen atoms in alcohol.
From the constitutional formula CH3—CH2—0—H, we
should infer that one of the hydrogen atoms would be ready
to undergo reactions which would not affect the remaining
five.   The formula CH3—0—CHs points to no such difference
between the atoms of hydrogen.        Further, the first formula
represents the sixth atom of hydrogen as alone in direct com
bination with oxygen: those substances which readily replace
one atom of hydrogen in alcohol are themselves ready to
combine with oxygen. Other reactions are known in which
a monovalent group or element replaces the whole of the
oxygen and simultaneously one atom of hydrogen in alcohol:
thus,

The possibility of such reactions is evident     if we adopt for
alcohol the constitutional formula CH3—CH2—0—H. But
the product of the first reaction formulated above, C, H, Cl,

produced by removing OH and putting Cl in                     place, we
conclude that the position originally occupied                  the OH
group was the same         that now    occupied

idea of atom-linking has gradually arisen in chemistry; it is
based more immediately upon the theory of types as inter
preted in the light of the general theory of valency.     From
the vague ideas entertained in the earlier days of the atomic
theory concerning the manner in which the atoms in a com
pound mutually influence one another, we have gradually ad
vanced to clearer conceptions of atomic action.       We now
regard each atom in a compound molecule as exerting an action
of some kind upon that atom, or upon those atoms situated
near itself; we look upon chemical action as an action between
atom and atom; we imagine a regular atomic system of some
 kind, not a conglomeration of atoms confusedly huddled toge
ther.   We have attained to the notion of atomic “chains”
and atomic “rings” &c.
   Most chemists now regard the molecule as an atomic system
the members of which act and react upon one another in ac
cordance with definite laws.     The system is regarded as bound
                                                            j.
together in one whole, each part depending immediately upon
the part next itself, and each depending mediately upon
every other.     From this idea, and from the theory of valency,
the  possibility  of the existence of various            of atomic
structures is deduced.    For instance, a series of divalent atoms
is capable of combining in two ways, either to form a “chain,”
such as —0—S–0–, in which case the molecule is evidently
unsaturated, or to form a             “ring,”    such as
                                                           6.º            in which
case the molecule is saturated.       The chain is evidently capable
of taking  up  two monovalent      atoms,  and so becoming a satu
                  although           maintaining            its

was based upon the functions performed by these substances,
and those in which the system was based upon the composition
of the substances classified. . In the six subsequent paragraphs
I  endeavoured to establish the truth of this statement upon
historical evidence, while at the same time attempted briefly                    I
to trace the rise of that system of classification which, founded
mainly upon the doctrine of valency, should pay regard alike
to function and composition in attempting to frame an exhaus
tive classification of chemical substances.             In paragraphs 11
           I
to 23 endeavoured to sketch the outlines of the theory of
valency, noticing the difficulties which have been overcome
and those which are yet to be conquered ; and                     sought to                     I
show that a connexion really exists between the properties
(chemical and physical) of a compound and the valency of                                                       its
constituent atoms.            have also endeavoured

     From consideration

to these compounds any other formulae than those given above.
The differences in the properties of these substances cannot,
therefore, be accounted for by differences in structure; they
must be dependent upon the nature of the constituent atoms
Fº
other than oxygen and hydrogen.             But we know of bodies
              of the same empirical formula and of the same mo
  ecular weight as acetic acid, yet differing altogether in pro
perties from this compound ; these differences in properties
are most probably due to differences in structure.            If this
view be      accepted,  it follows that just  as differences in the
 nature of the atoms in a series of molecules, each containing
the group OH, may cause this group to assume different func
tions, so differences in the structure of such molecules may
produce a similar effect.        Now the constitutional formulae
already assigned to alcohol and acetic acid exhibit differences
in the structures of the two molecules".         In alcohol we have
the OH group joined to the group CH2           (CH3—CH2—OH);
in acetic acid the OH group is joined to the group CO
(CH3–CO—OH).              I have already detailed some of the rea
sons for     adopting  these constitutional formulae.     These two
 compound groups —CH2—OH and —CO—OH are believed
to exist in certain classes of alcohols and in acids respectively.
 Granting that carbon acids contain the group –CO-OH, it
 becomes possible very readily to determine the constitutional
formulae of manyacids. Thus formic acid, H., CO2, can have (on
our theory) but one constitutional formula, viz. H-CO-OH.
                       "º" ºr
There are many reactions by which we may recognize the
compound groups                      and —CO—OH: the action
of PCls, with the subsequent action of water upon the body
produced, is one of the best; the action of the haloid acids is
another; the action of the alkali-metals, contrasted with that
of the alkalies, is a third; the action of methyl or ethyl
iodide upon the metallic derivatives of the body under consi
deration, combined with the action of potash or ammonia upon
the product so obtained, is a fourth.        There are many other
reactions.
    We find that compounds containing the group —CH2—OH
î.ield, on oxidation, acids containing the group —CO—OH ;
     we have reasons for regarding the first group as charac
teristic of alcohols: some bodies which, for other reasons, must
be classed among the alcohols, do not yield such oxidation
products as we should expect to be produced from substances
containing the group —CH2—OH. Such a result naturally
leads to a further study of the apparently anomalous alcohols;
   * Although these bodies are not isomeric, they may nevertheless be
used as illustrations.

     Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir on Chemical Classification.                                   205
and we find that a second class of these bodies may be best
regarded as containing a new group —CH-OH.              For in
stance, we have primary butylic alcohol with the constitu
tional formula CH3—CH2—CH2—CH2—OH;                but we have
also secondary butylic alcohol with the constitutional formula
CH3–CH2—CH–CHs.                           If
                              the latter alcohol really contain
                         di
the group       —CH-OH,   we are compelled to regard the posi
tion of this group as different from that assigned to the group
—CH2—OH in the primary alcohol. Chemists speak of the
OH as placed “at the end of the chain" in one case, and in
the “centre of the chain '' in the other.
   Such ideas as these, founded on the theory of valency, de

 mity of the motion of the particles takes place due to their
collisions with mundane matter, the particles themselves read
just the uniformity of motion.
    4. Le Sage imagined that the collisions of the particles dis
turbed permanently the uniformity of their motions, and there
 fore supposed these collisions to take place only at intervals
 of time very remote from each other. Thus he assumes
“.    . . . that not more than one out of every hundred of the
particles meets another during several thousands of years; so
 that the uniformity of their motions is scarcely ever disturbed
 sensibly.”       We now know that, so far from the collisions of
 the   particles  among themselves disturbing the uniformity of
 their motions, this is the very cause which corrects and main
 tains the uniformity of motion, or preserves the uniformity
 of motion in opposition to external disturbing causes. The
assumption, therefore, of the above enormous interval of time
 between the collisions of the particles, though admissible, is
by no means necessary.           The only necessary condition is that
the path of the particle should be a certain length, not that a
certain time should be occupied in traversing                   The time           it.

Thomson (Phil. Mag. May 1873) that the distance through
which gravity is effective would depend on the distance through
which the gravific particles move before being intercepted
collision with each other (which is equivalent to the mean
length of path of the particles).          By assuming the distance of
the stars to be a    multiple    of the mean length of path of the
particles, it would therefore follow that the stars do not gravi
tate towards each other—this satisfying the condition for the
stability of the universe.        The assumption of          the bodies                           all                          of
the universe    gravitating     towards each other        evidently  quite                     is
inconsistent with    stability    (as already  pointed   out     Professor                                  by

212            On Le Sage's Theory of Gravitation.
that gravity may be sensibly proportional to mass) that the
total volume of free space in a substance, in the form of inter
stices between the molecules or in their structure, must be
great compared with the total volume of matter contained in
the molecules themselves.    Le Sage assumed the molecules of
substances to have a sort of open structure in the form of
cages with wide interstices. This condition of free interstices
would be equally satisfied by assuming the molecules to be
small relative to their mean distance, or on the condition of
the vortex-ring atom theory, without any necessity for making
the above somewhat fantastic assumption of cage-structure.
   11. It is necessary to assume that the particles producing
gravity are in very close proximity compared with molecules,
otherwise the particles would be unable by their motion to
produce a perfectly equable pressure upon the molecules of
matter.    It might be thought that, because the particles of the
gravific medium are so close, and the molecules of ordinary
matter relatively far apart, therefore the quantity of matter in
the form of gravific particles enclosed in a given volume of
space must be very great compared with the quantity of ordi
nary matter that that same volume of space would contain—
or, in other words, that there must be a relatively enormous
quantity of matter in the form of gravific particles. This by
no means follows; for although the gravific particles may be
very close, the relative quantity of matter in them may be very
small, provided the particles themselves are small. Indeed by
simply conceiving an extreme degree of subdivision, the par
ticles pervading a given volume of space may by continued
subdivision be conceived to be brought into as close proximity
as we please; and though the space itself is large, the total
quantity of matter thus used may be conceived as small as we
please.   No consequence how minute the size (or mass) of a
particle may be, the effect produced by                   its
                                               motion remains                          as
great, provided          its
                      velocity       be
                                   adequately augmented.     The
minute size     the very condition adapted

eludes detection.    The   pressure   (termed “gravity”) due                           to

to see what mechanical objection can be urged against this
realization of the problem, which is extremely simple.
    12. The theory of “action at a distance” being rejected,
which is necessary in order to explain the facts at all, the
effects of gravity can in principle be referred to only two
conceivable causes. The tendency of two molecules of matter
to approach each other can be referred (1) to a motion pos
sessed by the molecules themselves disturbing the equilibrium
of pressure of the medium between them; (2) to a motion
possessed by the medium itself
currents) acting upon the molecules. º    the form of streams or
                                            The first of these two
conditions appears to be inadmissible, from the fact that we
cannot interfere with or modify gravity at will, whereas we
can very readily interfere with or modify the motion of the
molecules of matter (as by adding or subtracting heat, for ex
ample). It therefore would appear that gravity must be due
to some motion that we cannot interfere with, i. e. to a motion
 in the external medium which we cannot handle or which is
 beyond our control.      Only one conclusion appears therefore
to be possible here; and therefore it would seem that the theory
 of Le Sage can scarcely be regarded as a mere hypothesis,
 but rather as an irresistible deduction which is forced upon us
 in the absence of any other conceivable inference. Certainly,
 if simplicity be a recommendation, the theory needs no recom
mendation on that ground.

    Equations which present themselves in Physical Investiga
    tions.   By the Rev. S. EARNSHAw, M.A.
   To the Editors of  the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
      HE   Astronomer Royal, in his treatise ‘On Sound and
        Atmospheric Vibrations,’ has drawn particular attention
 to equations of the following general form,
                      d’u     d’u    a du

 and has expressed an opinion that equations of this class can
 not be approached by any one general method of attack. The
 equation has been solved by the Astronomer Royal himself in
 a finite form for the two cases a =0 and a = 2; but in other
 cases he has had recourse to infinite series, which, it is observed,

214              The Rev. S. Earnshaw on the Finite Integrals
is an unsatisfactory form of an integral when         convergence                           its
is not assured.
   Now       looking
                 on      the above equation, we see that mt-H

this very consideration: see in particular page 178, where the
following words occur:—“I cannot refrain from observin
here how entirely remote such a chamber” [viz. a
vacuum indicated by one tenth of a millimetre of mercury]
“is from being empty. It follows from what we know of
number of molecules in gases at ordinary pressures, that the

number remaining in this so-called vacuum will be somewhere
about a unit-fourteen, i.e. one hundred millions of millions, in
every cubic millimetre.”    After which      quote, in proof of         I
this assertion, the determinations of the mean interval at which
the molecules of gases are spaced, by Professor Loschmidt in
1865, by myself in 1867, and by Sir William Thomson in
                                            -
1870.
   It is plain, however, that Mr. Preston has done good service
by recalling attention to the immense number of the molecules,
and the consequent shortness of the excursions of each mole
cule between its successive encounters with other molecules;
since the subject was new to himself, and had been overlooked
by some of the writers upon Crookes's radiometer.

good   workman becomes familiar with such sizes as ‘001 and 0001
of an inch,   he will not rest satisfied until he can work with corre
sponding accuracy” (pp. 73, 74).              The instrument whereby the
workman is enabled to become             practically  acquainted with these
minute   divisions,  is the  workshop     measuring-machine;      the primary
object of which is the construction of accurate difference-gauges,
e.g. of a series of solid cylinders whose diameters shall form an
arithmetical progression having a common difference of 1-5000th
of an inch.     It consists essentially of two small planes accurately
                                                                         ºf
parallel to each other, and capable of being adjusted at any assigned
distance by means of screws with accurately divided heads.                The
article to be measured (say a solid cylinder) is placed between these
planes, and one of them is moved                           until the cylinder
experiences in passing between them a slight resistance, the in
tensity of which can be judged of by the touch ; the distance be
tween the planes can then be determined by reading the screw
heads.     As the planes touch the cylinder, their distance is                                                           its

                   Thermometers at the Kew Observatory.                                          227
English physicists       are dependent for their accuracy upon that
of the verifications at Kew.            Many thousands of thermometers
have already been verified by the apparatus about to be described.
     Up to the year 1875 the apparatus for this purpose at the
Kew Observatory was of the rudest character.
     It was simply a glass jar 94 inches wide and 18 inches deep,
filled with hot water and standing on a turntable, in which a brass
frame was placed.
     The thermometers were attached to this framework, and the
observer having well agitated the water with a plunger, read the
instruments in succession through the glass as                           |.
                                                               turned the jar
round before       him,   reading   each thermometer as it passed.           He
first turned it round from        right  to left, and then back again from
left to right. Each thermometer was thus read twice, and the
mean of the pair of readings was taken.             It is obvious that if the
rate of cooling of the water be uniform, and if the thermometers
are observed at precisely equal intervals, the mean of every pair of
observations would be strictly referable to the temperature of the
 water at the same moment of time, namely to that which is half
 way between the beginning and end of the entire set.              It is need
 less to point out that these conditions can never be strictly ful
 filled, although, notwithstanding the imperfection of the process and
 the coarseness of the apparatus, the observers acquired much
 certainty and skill in           its
                               manipulation.      Still the time occupied was
 unnecessarily great, and the chance             error, owing
                                                          of         variations     to
in    the rate      cooling
                   of            the water, was larger than
                                    of                                need be.          it
 Partly owing       tothis latter reason, and partly                    to
                                                             the fact that the
 number    of   thermometers sent              tested has considerably

   The thermometers to be compared are hung side by side round
the circumference of two brass rings, 103 in. in diameter, that are
attached to the side rods of a cylindrical frame. The thermome
ters are held in their places against the ring by spring clips, one
of which is shown full size in fig. 4, and one of the rings is shown in
fig. 3; the latter slide up and down the brass rods that form the
sides of the cylindrical framework, and are clamped at such a
distance apart as may best suit the thermometer under examina
tion.
   Forty thermometers can be suspended at a time.          The bottom
of the frame is provided with six rollers—three placed radially, for
the purpose of guiding it up and down the interior of the water
vessel; and three tangentially and projecting below the base, in
order to support the frame whilst putting on or taking off the
thermometers.     This operation is performed when the frame is
standing on the closed lid of the box, a circular brass ring being

     The rate of cooling is much reduced when the process consist”
  in first raising the water to the highest required temperature, and
  then cooling it by successive additions of cold water. The heat
  of the stuffing that surrounds the vessel being thus much higher
  than the water it contains, keeps it at an equable temperature.
     The temperature of the water in the vessel, after agitating
  it and allowing it to settle, differs somewhat at different levels;
  this is due to the impossibility of securing perfect intermixture
  and to the variations of the temperature of the stuffing in respect
  to that of the water. The greatest differences observed between
  a thermometer whose bulb was immersed 2 inches below the
  level of the water and one that was immersed 19 inches was 0°-68.

      “On     Stratified Discharges.—IV. Stratified and Unstratified
  Forms of the Jar-Discharge.” By William Spottiswoode, M.A.,
  Treas. R.S.
      It is well know that if a Leyden jar be discharged through a
  vacuum-tube, the discharge generally takes the form of an unbroken
   column of light, extending from the point of the positive terminal

 232                    Royal      Society:-Mr. W. Spottiswoode                          on
  to the hilt of the negative, i.e. to the extreme negative end of the
  tube, and that it shows no trace of either negative glow or inter
  vening dark space.         On the other hand have found, by experi I
  ments with a     large  Leyden    battery, that if a tube have one terminal
  connected with the        negatively   charged coating of the battery and
  the other held    beyond   striking-distance    from the positively charged
  coating, the discharge in the tube will show a separation of the
  positive from the negative part by a dark intervening space. Under
  suitable circumstances of exhaustion it will also show striae, in the
  same manner as when the discharge is effected directly with a Holtz
 machine, having the conductors either closed or open beyond
  striking-distance (see Roy. Soc. Proceedings, vol. xxiii. p. 460).
  Again,      I
              have found, with the same battery, that if the tube be
  connected otherwise as before, and held at a distance less than at
 first, but a little greater than striking-distance, a stratified discharge
 much more brilliant and more like that produced by a coil will be
 exhibited.      It should be remarked that the latter form of discharge
 appears to the unassisted eye, in the cases which              have examined,  I
 as an unbroken column of light, but with a negative glow and dark
 space.     A revolving mirror, however, resolves the column into a
 regular array of striae, having a rapid proper motion towards the
 positive terminal.
     The transition from the first to the second of these forms, and
 from the second to the jar-discharge proper when the tube was
 brought within striking-distance, was, if not absolutely abrupt, at
                                                                                          no

  the conductors of the machine and by increasing the number of
  the jars.
     The first object proposed was to ascertain whether a jar could
  be charged with so small a quantity of electricity as of itself
  to give a stratified discharge in a tube; in other words, whether
  the resistance of the tube itself, if resistance it be, could by a
  suitable charge of jar be made to insure a stratified discharge.
  For this purpose a jar was charged with small sparks from the
 machine, and discharged after receiving charges of 1, 2, 3, &c.
  sparks in succession. The experiment proved successful with a
 coal-gas tube at a pressure of about 4 millims. : charges of three
  sparks gave bright flake-like stratifications; higher charges gave a
 discharge with a positive column, a negative glow, and a dark space,
 although the striae were not always discernible.                   But when the
  charge exceeded 5 or 6 sparks, the positive column advanced so
  far as to obliterate the dark space, and ultimately made                     way          its    to
  the hilt of the terminal.
     Similar experiments were made with both forms                             instru   of
  mental arrangement, and with tubes containing different gases and
 at  different pressures.

 the head     of  the  positive  column advanced towards the negative ter

     dimensions; and when the head                  the column drew very near

 still further increasing the charge, the drop withdrew                       the hilt  to

mination, however, was always greater with the larger charges, i.e'
with the greater quantity of electricity discharged.
    The experiments above described were made first with tubes in
which the pressure was moderately high.             They were afterwards
repeated with lower pressures, and results of the same character as
before were obtained.         But, owing to the smaller amount of the
critical  charges,  to the  greater  extension of the negative glow, and
to the   consequently   increased    delicacy of the phenomena, the same
numerical     precision  was not attained.      But there seems no reason
to doubt that the discrepancies might be indefinitely diminished by
instrumental refinements.
    The duration of the stratified discharges observed throughout
these experiments was exceedingly short, indistinguishable, in fact,
from that of the true jar-discharge.          When viewed in a revolving
mirror, either with or without a slit, they showed no sign whatever of
prolonged duration ; and we may thence conclude that, so far as our
present instrumental arrangements extend, there is no inferior limit
to the duration of discharge necessary for the production of striae.
    In connexion with this part of the subject another form of ex
periment was arranged.          Beside the jars hitherto described another
was used, having its inner surface connected with one terminal of
the tube, and its outer with the other.         When this disposition was
made, the additional jar acted as a buffer, and produced a stratified
discharge under circumstances which would without it have pro
duced a true jar-discharge.
    A comparison of the results here obtained with those detailed in
 Part  II.  of these researches shows that the phenomena produced
 by suitable disposition of the Leyden battery coincide with those
produced by the induction-coil.           With the coil it was found that
(1) for a given electromotive force the column of striae was shorter
the larger the battery-surface or strength of current used; (2) that
the proper motion, when directed, as usual, towards the positive
terminal, was more rapid the greater the electromotive force
employed.       With the Leyden battery (1) it was found that, in
order to maintain the same length of column with an increased
surface, the charge must be increased in a larger proportion than
the surface; and (2) it was noticed that the striae, which when the
tension was low were distinct and well separated, became more
blurred as the tension rose, until they sometimes were blended into
an apparently unbroken column of light.            The presence, however,
of the   negative  glow  still showed that the true jar-discharge had not
yet been reached.

                    Zeolitic and Siliceous Incrustations.                 235
in Amygdaloid and other altered Wolcanic Rocks.” By Prof. A.
Daubrée, F.M.G.S.
    The author described the formation of zeolitic minerals by the
 infiltration of masonry by the waters of thermal springs at Plom
bières (Vosges), Luxeuil (Haute-Saône), Bourbonne (Haute-Marne),
and near Oran in Algeria. In breaking through the wall of concrete,
 composed of fragments of stone and brick built by the Romans
 round the months of these springs, it has been found that the
materials employed have undergone a great change by the long
continued action of the water. The cavities in the bricks are occu
pied by minerals, generally zeolitic, among the most abundant of
which is chabasite, agreeing in all respects with the natural mineral.
Phillipsite or lime harmotome also occurs, associated with the pre
ceding, just as in the amygdaloidal trap of Iceland.        In hollows of
the calcareous cement small crystals of apophyllite occur, with pul
verulent and minutely crystalline fluor spar, together with other
minerals not identified, but resembling in character gismondine and
scolezite.  At Plombières hyalite occurs with the zeolites; and where
the masonry is exposed to the full flow of the water there is a
transparent gelatinous deposit which becomes white and opaque
when dry, and is a hydrated silicate of lime analogous to okenite.
Arragonite occurs generally in acicular crystals, but sometimes of
the form called apotome by Haüy, found in iron-ore deposits and in
some basalts.    Calcite is frequently associated with the chabasite,
as in Icelandic lavas.    Halloysite is also met with at Plombières.
   Besides the formation of geodes in the visible cavities, the whole
substance of the bricks was found to be altered by contact with the
water. This change rendered the originally friable brick very hard
and compact; and microscopic examination showed that its minute
pores were filled with colourless and transparent mineral substances.
The author gave the following list of the minerals thus found—
chabasite, Christianite(?), mesotype, hyalite (?), tridymite, chalce
dony in radiate spherules, calcite, and some globular bodies of un
 certain nature. The association of chalcedonic quartz with opal is
interesting, as proving that silica may be deposited in the anhydrous
form when the temperature of the surrounding medium does not ex
ceed 70° C.     Analysis showed that the amount of zeolitic sub
stance added to the bricks is from 13 to 14 per cent. of the total
weight.
   This contemporary production of zeolites and other minerals
identical with those found in amygdaloidal and many other altered
volcanic rocks is regarded by the author as an experimental demon
stration of the mode of formation of the latter, which are no doubt
produced in a similar manner by the percolation of water through
the substance of the rocks, conveying              to,
                                               and depositing in, their
cavities mineral substances dissolved      during         its
                                                       passage.    Zeolitic

 Dee which exhibit Phenomena having an important bearing on the
 Origin of Boulder-clay and the Sequence of Glacial Events.”        By
 D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author minutely stated the results of repeated
 examinations of a number of new sections of drift–deposits, with a
 particular reference to the character of their bases and lines of
junction    between    them.   He described in detail the patterns
exhibited by the grooved erratic stones of the shelly clays compared
 with irregularly scratched stones of the Lake-district.      He then
 gave a particular account of the character of the two shelly clays,
 and assigned reasons for believing in their threefold origin—the
 local grit and broken shells accumulated by the sea, which at the
 time was fully charged with subglacial clay, and the erratic stones
 carried and dropped by floating coast-ice. He described pheno
 mena proving that boulders must have fallen into the clay, and
called attention to the varying directions of striae on rock-surfaces
(including some he had lately discovered), and their relations to the
 courses and cross-courses taken by erratic stones, some of which
 had travelled 200 miles.     He then connected the special observa
tions he had lately made with the results of many years' investiga
tions extending around the basin of the Irish Sea, from Carlisle to
Crewe, and from Crewe to Anglesey, and traced the horizontal and
vertical extent of the three shelly drifts, and their relation to the
mountain drifts of North Wales and the Lake—district.       He stated
 many reasons for rejecting the idea that land-ice had distributed
either of the two Boulder-clays he had described, but left it an open
question whether the blue clay of North Wales, the Lake-district,
the Yorkshire valleys, and parts of Lancashire, with             local                its
stones, may not have been accumulated under land-ice.         He con

   9. “On the Superficial Geology of British Columbia.”               By George
Mercer    Dawson,      Esq.,   F.G.S.,    Assoc.   R.S.M.,   of the  Geological
Survey of Canada.
   The author stated that the rock-striation and fluting on the
south-eastern peninsula of Vancouver's Island shows that at one
time a great glacier swept over it from N. to S., filling the Strait
of Georgia, 50 miles broad in places, and having near Victoria a
thickness of ice of over 600 feet.           Traces of this glacier also occur
on San-Juan Island, and on the coast of the mainland. The de
 posits immediately overlying the glaciated rocks, besides what may
be moraine profonde, locally developed, are sandy clays and sands,
 arranged in water, and sometimes containing marine shells. The
lower beds, at least, of these, were probably formed at the foot of the
retreating glacier, the sea standing considerably higher than at
present.     The northern part of the Strait of Georgia and the fjords
opening into         it,
                     and the fjords north          the Strait, show ice-action

ON THE ELECTRICAL AND CAPILLARY PROPERTIES OF MERCURY
     IN CONTACT WITH DIFFERENT        AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS.        BY M.
   LIPPMANN.
            mercury is in contact with pure or acidulated water, one
WHEN    has only to add to the water a small quantity of certain sub
stances in order to notably change two of the physical properties of
the contact surface—the capillary constant or superficial tension, on
the one hand, and, on the other, the electromotive force (that is to
say, the difference of the electrical potentials) of the water and the
mercury.     The experiments which                           I
                                         have made on this question,
in the laboratory of M. Jamin, and which          have the honour of       I
submitting to the Academy, have conducted me to this very simple
relation :-For each value of the electromotive force the capillary
constant has a determinate value, and one only, independent of the
chemical composition of the liquid.    In other terms, if for two dif
ferent combinations the electromotive force is the same, the capillary
 constant is likewise the same.
     To verify this law,            I
                                at first employed the following very simple
 apparatus:–Two equal capillary tubes, T, T', are placed vertically
 side by side, and communicate by their lower part with one and
 the same reservoir of mercury; their upper extremities are fur
 nished with two funnels, E, E, to receive the liquids for experiment.
If   the same liquid has been put into both E and E' (e.g. water to
 which has been added one sixth of its volume of sulphuric acid *),
 the capillary depression of the mercury is the same in both tubes,
 since
             all
             is symmetrical                  on
                                     both sides.        one           In
                                                                 the tubes little    of                  a

 taining dilute sulphuric acid, with which can be mixed substances
 suitable for causing the capillary constant of the meniscus to vary—
 such as chlorhydric acid, chromic acid, &c. The electrical difference
 of the meniscus can be maintained constant.        For that purpose
 the mercury and the liquid under experiment are put in communi
 cation respectively with some mercury and acidulated water con
 tained in a large vessel V'.     It can then be ascertained that the
 changes in composition of the liquid V do not cause the position of
 the meniscus to vary; this can be verified by means of a microscope
 with a reticule.    If the electrical communications described above
 be suppressed, the meniscus becomes, on the contrary, very sensi
 tive to the changes of chemical composition of the liquid.
    It is necessary to employ for these experiments substances
 which, in small quantities, act powerfully on the capillary constant;
 two aqueous solutions put into contact do not take sensibly the
 same electrical potential, unless they have nearly the same chemical
composition.      Between two very different liquids, such as chlor
 hydric and sulphuric acids, taken each pure and diluted, an electro
 motive force of contact is produced, which would complicate the
 experiment.    As bodies active in small quantities we may mention
 (1) the  hydro-acids  and hyposulphite of soda, and (2) bichromate
 and  permanganate    of potash in the presence of acids. Chlorine,
 sulphurous acid, and carbonic acid, on the contrary, have but little
action.     Bromine and iodine act in the same direction as the hy
 drogen acids, and in the opposite direction to the oxidizing bodies,
such as chromic acid.—Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences,

NOTE ON THE EFFECT OF CHROMATIC ABERRATION IN DISTANT
    VISION.    By B. THOMPSON LOWNE, F.R.C.S., ARRIS AND GALE
    LECTURER ON ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY IN THE ROYAL
    college of surgeoNS,        LECTURER ON PHYSIOLOGY IN THE
    MIDDLESEx HospitaL MEDICAL SCHOOL, OPHTHALMIc sur

    Mr. S. P. Thompson, in   a communication on this subject published
in the July Part of the “Philosophical Magazine’ speaks of chromatic
aberration as if it were an advantage in distant vision.      I fail to
understand, however, how this can be the case.       There can be no
doubt that distant     objects are seen with a   predominance   of the
more refrangible blue and violet rays; an eye, therefore, which is
emmetropic for such rays is hypermetropic for the less-refrangible
red rays. Taking the dispersive power of the eye as equal to that
of water, this hypermetropia amounts to two dioptrics.        Such an
eye would therefore have the red objects of the foreground more
out of focus than if it were achromatic.      An eye which is emme
tropic for red would on the other hand have blue objects accurately
focused, without any accommodation, if they were situated at a dis
tance of half a metre from the eye. No doubt, if red and blue are
situated on the same plane at the same distance from the eye, as
the red requires the greatest effort of accommodation it will appear

nearer than the blue; but it can hardly be conceded that the eye
has been modified that we should see the red pigments of a paint
ing apparently nearer than the blue background. This cannot
be the meaning of the author when he speaks of the disadvantage
of an achromatic eye, and when he supposes that such an eye would
in process of time lose   achromatismits                       by
                                          variation and selection.

small retort, was mixed with excess of silver cyanate in the
cold. The silver cyanate was converted into chloride with
slight rise of temperature; the liquid acquired the smell of
picoline, while at the same time a very pungent smell was
observable.    After the silver chloride had been removed by
filtration, the filtrate, which had a strong smell of picoline,
was placed to evaporate over sulphuric       ; after some weeks .#
small indistinctly formed crystals separated.      When these
crystals were dissolved in water and warmed, picoline and a
gas were given off; when heated alone, the salt fuses and
evolves picoline in large quantity along with some ammonia,
and crystals of cyamelide sublime.      As was to be expected,

      Oridation of Picoline.—4 ounces of picoline were oxidized
 by Professor Dewar's process (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. 1872,
 pp. 189-196) with potassium permanganate.                  After the re
j
 duced manganese had been removed by filtration and the un
 oxidized picoline recovered by distillation, the liquid was
                                ...
 neutralized, boiled, and precipitated while boiling with excess
of silver nitrate. The extremely bulky curdy precipitate was
 filtered through cloth,                   and washed repeatedly with
 boiling water.        It was then    again   stirred up with water till
 thoroughly disintegrated, and decomposed with sulphuretted
 hydrogen, or with hydrochloric acid. After the silver sul
          or chloride had been filtered off, the liquid was concen
 trated to a comparatively small bulk; on cooling, long white
 crystals of dicarbopyridenic acid, C, H, NO, filled the whole
 vessel.     After these crystals were removed, the mother-liquor
 gave a second, but much smaller, crop on further evaporation;
 it was also collected, and the filtrate was set apart for further
 investigation.
     The filtrate from the precipitate with silver nitrate con
 tained but a very small amount of organic substance.               I suc

       Amide.—From the chloride, the amide was prepared                         by
 passing anhydrous ammonia over it while hot.       The amide is
 insoluble in water; it dissolves in a large quantity of hot
 alcohol; when this solution was evaporated over sulphuric
 acid, it came down as a white, apparently amorphous powder.
 It is also insoluble in ether, and possesses neither taste nor
 smell. It melts at 295'5–297° (uncorr.). When warmed, a
 sublimate of long needles was obtained, the melting-point of
 which was above the                     of mercury. Whether

    Methyl Ether.—The methyl ether was prepared in two
 ways:–first, by boiling the silver salt of the acid with methyl
 iodide in presence of alcohol; and, second, by ochobating the
 chloride with methyl alcohol. In both cases the same body
                                     -
 was obtained.
   When prepared by the first method, 12.5 grms. of the
silver salt were boiled with 200 cubic centimetres of alcohol
and 11 cubic centimetres of methyl iodide for some days.
The liquid was concentrated to a small bulk; and small white
crystals were deposited, which were redissolved in alcohol
and recrystallized.
   It was also prepared from the chloride by placing some in
                              Hijj
a dry flask, and adding to it anhydrous methyl alcohol. Heat
was evolved, and the             began to boil.     When the action
had   moderated,   the mixture was cohobated for some days, to
ensure the complete conversion of the chloride into the
ether.    Most of the alcohol was then removed by distillation;
and the ether crystallized out when                    its
                                                solvent had become

pure ammonium platinichloride, the last of pyridine platini
chloride. In no case did the amount of platinum found indicate
that the base possessed a higher molecular weight than that of
pyridine.    Similar results were obtained with the portions
which had not been boiled with nitric acid.        It is therefore
certain that no bases are found, the molecular weight of which
is greater than that of pyridine, and probable that pyridine
is the only base produced with exception of ammonia.          This
affords a strong presumption that lutidine is not dimethyl
pyridine; for, were it produced, it is certainly stable enough
to resist decomposition by soda-lime.
   Mr. Dewar mentions in his memoir that he obtained a
mixture of dicarbopyridenic acid with another acid of much
higher molecular weight, less soluble in water than the
above-named acid.                                   I
                        Of such an acid could find no trace;
but the mother liquor of dicarbopyridenic acid, by repeated
fractional crystallization from alcohol, deposited very well
formed rhombic crystals, of which              I
                                        had about a         at my

heated, and when gently warmed sublimed, apparently with
out alteration.     Its melting- and decomposing-point was
216°5–217°     (uncorr.),  while that of dicarbopyridenic acid,
taken at the same time with the same thermometer, was
237°5.    With ferrous salts, dicarbopyridenic acid gives a
deep-red coloration, while the new acid gives a yellow colour
like that of ferric chloride. The basicity of the new acid,
determined by titration with standard potash, was found to
be 152 :    the potassium salt contained 33.85 per cent. of
potash; the molecular weight of dicarbopyrdenic acid is 167;

  Assuming the acid to be dibasic, it must contain four
atoms of oxygen; and as it gave off a smell resembling
pyridine when heated, it contains nitrogen, probably one
atom. The basicity has been determined. Calculating the
carbon and hydrogen contained in the lead-salts, from these
data, to their percentage in the acid, the following are the
results:—

   The formula agreeing most closely with the above results
is C, H, NO, which requires 45.85 per cent. of carbon and
4:20 per cent. of hydrogen.        Its potassium-salt would con

                    that oxidized                       by
                                        myself, was practically free
from lutidine.      Mr. Dewar compares the oxidation          picoline               of

the reaction took place more quickly.   The filtrate from the
manganese hydrate was treated with silver nitrate, and the
insoluble silver salts decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen.
The mixture of acids obtained dissolved in water with dif
ficulty, and on cooling crystallized out in crusts. The acid
was again dissolved in hot alcohol, in which it is sparingly
soluble, and crystallized.     It deposited in microscopic needles.
Some of it was transformed into the silver salt, and ignited.
   0.2913 grim. gave 0.6335 grim. of metallic silver=45.82
per cent.
   The molecular weight of the acid, if dibasic, is thus 257.
No dicarbopyridenic acid could be discovered among the pro
ducts of oxidation after crystallization.        From a scarcity of
material it was    impossible  to obtain enough    of the acid giving
the  salt,  the  analysis of which is   given   above,   for complete
     º
investigation.      By the kindness of Professor Ferguson, to
whom      I  have to express my deep indebtedness for kindly
supplying to me the material for this research, I have now
&l           quantity of lulidine at my disposal, and intend to
examine       its
                oxidation products more carefully.             already        It   is
certain that lutidine       not convertible into

254              Mr. R. S. Brough on the Maximum
magnets".       The latter supposed the dimensions of the bobbins
      I
(as also do in this paper) to be given, fixed, and immutable ;
while the learned Count starts with varying the depth of the
                                                                    effect
bobbin, and piques himself on getting a larger magnetic
out of it than Mr. Schwendler did. The best thickness of wire
to wind on a given bobbin, and the best size and shape of bob
bin to employ for a given purpose, are two totally distinct
                     -
questions.
    While investigating the above problem, the question of the
influence of the insulating covering of the wire on the results
occurred to Mr. Schwendler ; and he went into it in a subse
quent paper f.
    Mr. Schwendler attacked the problem from the point of view
of the resistance of the bobbin ; but it seems to me that it
yields more readily and presents a more definite result (the
former method gives an equation of the fourth order, which
has to be solved by a rather coarse approximation) when we
                                                ...;
start from the thickness of the wire. This method has also
led me to a singularly simple relation existing between the
resistance of the electromagnet and the                   resistance.
    I  shall take the case of an     elongated   bobbin with straight
sides and circular     ends, because this is a very common form
to  give   to galvanometer-coils,    and because the results can at
once be reduced to those applicable to circular bobbins by
simply putting the length of the sides equal to nothing in the
various expressions.
    Let  Y   = the magnetic effect of the bobbin,
          R = the resistance of the bobbin,
          S = the external resistance,
          E = electromotive force of the battery,
and       n = the number of convolutions.
Then (Jacobi and Dub)
and the problem is to make        Y  a maximumf, treating the dia
meter of the wire with which the bobbin is wound as the inde
pendent variable, of which       n and  R are known functions.

   f  The force exerted by a coil on a steel magnet is proportional to Y,
whereas the force exerted on a soft-iron armature is proportional to Y’;
but whatever value of the variable makes    Y a maximum will also make
Yº   a maximum; so the one solution meets both cases.

27.    S.O. far as actual experiments, taken in conjunction with
          the theory   of valency and that of atom-linking, allow
us to judge,   it would appear that there is a close connexion
between the valency of the atoms constituting a compound and
                                       º
the general properties, chemical as well as physical, of that
compound, but that the position of the atom in the molecule
also influences the character of the molecule.      On this view it
will be possible  to regard  the properties of a compound  as func
tions (1) of the nature of the constituent atoms, and (2) of the
manner in which these atoms are linked together.             By the
word “nature,” as here used, is to be understood                those                all
properties (atomic weight, density, valency, &c. &c.) which are
inherent       in
              the atom considered as an individual existence.

separate the questions, What is the structure of this or that
body ? and Why is the structure as it is ? The first question
relates to chemical statics, the second to chemical kinetics.
The greater part of the labours of chemists has hitherto been
devoted to attempting an answer to the first question. They
have made some progress in the attempt; but there remains
much to be done.           When they shall have fully answered both
questions, the science of chemistry will be complete. But that
when is a long time off.            Nevertheless, of each question it
may be said, in the words of Lothar Meyer, “dass ihre                                Er
 forschung nicht nur méglich ist, sondern auch eine ausseror
 dentlich dankbare Aufgabe für den menschlichen Forscher
 geist bildet” ".
    28. I   have thus endeavoured to give some kind of answer
 to the   questions     proposed at the close of paragraph 11, con
 cerning the utility of that system of classification which is
 mainly founded upon the valency of the elementary atoms.
 This system does not, as yet, give us “a means for definitely
 settling the characteristics of each class;” it does not enable
 us, as yet, “to mark off class from class;” we cannot, as yet,
 “by   its aid, correlate the leading characteristics                     of
                                                                 each class

 physical properties           elements and compounds.”

stone, Cooke, Kremers, Pettenkofer, Odling, Newlands, and
others extended the observed points of connexion between
the atomic weights of the elements and their leading pro
perties".                                      -
  But it is especially to Mendelejefff that we owe a syste
matic attempt to correlate the leading properties, physical
and chemical, of the elements with the atomic weights of
these elements.
  Lothar Meyer f has also made important contributions to
the same subject; and in his Modernen Theorien he has
gathered together most of the facts which have been as yet
established concerning the relations between atomic weights
and  properties of elementary substances.
   31. The researches alluded to in the preceding paragraph
allow us to say that a very large degree of probability has
      º
been established in favour of the hypothesis that the nature
of the chemical elements is a periodic function of their atomic
weights.
         may define a periodic phenomenon as one which,
with the constant and uniform change of the variable, returns
time after time to the same value” $.
     In the case before  us we have as “variable” “atomic
                                                          weight
                                                                 ;”
as    “variant   ’’ we have the “nature of the chemical atom.” In
the present state of our knowledge we cannot define this variant
with accuracy; hence it is not as yet possible, granting that
the “nature of the chemical atom" is a periodic function of the
relative weight of that atom, to state quantitatively the nature
of this function. Nevertheless it may be possible to establish
roughly that the general nature of the atom does vary perio
dically with the relative weight of the atom. It is necessary
to break up the quantity “nature of the chemical atom,” and
to endeavour to show that such phenomena as specific volume,
malleability, ductility, electric position, power of forming
oxides, of forming chlorides, &c. &c. are really periodic
functions of the atomic weights of the elementary atoms. .

metals are situated on the ascending portions of the curve, at
no great distance from the points at which the minima are
reached.    An element whose atomic volume is greater than
that of the element with the next smaller atomic weight is
generally comparatively easily fusible, while an element
having a smaller atomic volume than that of the element next
below it in order of atomic weight, is fusible only with diffi
culty.   The same relation holds between atomic volume and
volatility of the elements. The ductile metals, whose position
on the curve is at, or very near to, a maximum or minimum
point, crystallize, as a rule, in the regular system ; those ele
                                             i.
ments which are more brittle and more volatile, and are
situated on ascending portions of the curve, crystallize for
the most part in systems other than the regular.
   The more volatile elements, which are             on ascending
portions of the curve, generally possess a greater coefficient
of expansion by heat than those more fixed elements found at
the minimum points of the curve. What we know concerning
the refraction-indices of elementary bodies points to a periodic
connexion between these numbers and the atomic weights of
the same elements; but our knowledge is as yet too limited
to allow of anything more than a general statement of such a
connexion. The specific heats of the elements appear to bear
some relation, not only to the atomic weights, but also to the
atomic volumes of the elements.       It would appear as if a cer
tain   magnitude   must be attained by the atomic volumes of
those elements which have small atomic weights before the
law of Dulong and Petit is obeyed.
   That the conductivity for heat and for electricity of metals
varies periodically with their atomic weights is also apparent
from a study of these three quantities.                        -
   The facts which I have now stated evidently point to a close
 connexion between atomic weight and general physical proper
ties of the elements.   The atomic weight may be regarded as a
 variable, and the physical constants of the elements as variants.
 Physical phenomena, says Meyer, must probably be regarded as
                   ãº
 functions, not only of space, of time, &c., but also as functions
 of the atomic weights of the elements exhibiting these pheno
 mena, or of the              constituting the compound bodies
which exhibit these phenomena.          Such a consideration offers
 a wide field for future physical determinations; it also de
 mands more exact atomic-weight determinations than have yet
 been made for many of the elements.
    The elements may be roughly arranged in an electric series,
 wherein some are more positive, some more negative than

   receding groups of three.    In the sixth section lead and
           occupy analogous positions to those occupied by
 antimony and iodine in section five; but lead and bismuth are
possessed of but ill-defined negative characters.      Now the
differences between the atomic volumes of phosphorus, sul
phur, and chlorine, especially between those of sulphur and
chlorine, are considerable; but so are the differences between
the atomic volumes of arsenic, selenium, and bromine, espe
cially between those of the two latter elements.   In this case,
then, it would appear as if the less-marked negative character
                                              º
were to be traced to the larger atomic weights of the three
elements as compared with those of the preceding three.       It
is also to be remarked that, while the whole of the elements in
that period which includes phosphorus, sulphur, and chlorine
are divided into but two groups, one of which is positive and
the other negative, in the period which                 arsenic,
 selenium, and bromine there are four groups—first a positive,
 then a negative, then again a positive, succeeded finally by a
negative group. The three elements in question are situated
in the last negative group. Very probably the double change
influences the properties of the whole of the elements in the
complete period.     The same considerations may be applied to
the case of tin, antimony, and iodine. The differences be
tween the atomic volumes are here smaller than in the two
series we have just considered; the atomic weights of the
elements are larger; and the elements form the second group
of negative elements within one period. The negative pro
  erties of these elements are not so well marked as those of
either of the preceding groups of three which we have men
tioned. In the case of lead and bismuth, we have two ele
ments situated somewhat similarly with antimony and iodine;
but the difference between the atomic volumes of the two
former is much less than that between the atomic volumes of
the two latter; the atomic weights of lead and bismuth are
very large ; these elements occupy a position in the period
succeeding the electro-positive elements mercury, thallium,
&c., which again succeed the negative elements tantalum and
tungsten.     Now the negative character of bismuth is ex

possessed of no acid properties.       And this is what we should
expect from a consideration of the position of bismuth in the
periodic curve of Meyer.         Further, the curve of the sixth
section is almost    certainly  incomplete;   there is a great gap
between barium and tantalum.           The determinations of the
atomic weights of many members of this section also stand in
much need of revisal. The next metal after bismuth, in order

  Each of these elements forms an oxide X3 Os; but these oxides
are possessed of different degrees of stability, of fusibility, &c.
N, O, is possessed of no great stability; it melts at a low tem
perature.   P. O. sublimes unchanged at a red heat, but is
entirely deoxidized by heating with carbon. W. O. is also
easily reduced by heating in hydrogen, or in contact with
carbon; it melts at a high temperature without decomposition.
As, O, is reduced to As, O3 by heat alone. Sb2O, is also
reduced by heating; and Big O, loses oxygen at 150°. On the
other hand, Nb, O, and Ta, O, neither melt nor volatilize, nor
are they decomposed at a white heat.      Niobic oxide becomes
 crystalline at a very high temperature; this oxide is also
 reduced by heating in hydrogen, while tantalic oxide is only                                º
 reduced by contact with charcoal at a very high temperature.
 Now these two elements, which form the most stable and the
 least–easily reducible pentoxides, also form pentachlorides
 (NbO), and Ta Clº) which are capable of existing in the state
of gases. VCI, appears to be capable of existing for a time in
the gaseous state.      P Cl; and Sb Cl, are split up into P Cls
and   §:   and Sb Cl3 and Cl2, respectively, when heated.
does not exist.

    Now, if we examine the positions of these eight elements
upon the curve of atomic volumes and atomic weights, we find
certain points of interest.        Nitrogen is situated near a
minimum-point; it is preceded and followed by electro-nega
tive elements (carbon, oxygen, and fluorine); the differences
between the atomic volumes of nitrogen and                immediate     its

of the exact properties of groups of compounds and of ele
ments will doubtless enable us to make a nearer approximation
to the nature of the function in question.             Supposing that
the periodic law be clearly established, we shall then be
met with such questions as these :—Are there periods within
periods?      Is the divergence from the law itself periodic *
and so on. The field for inquiry is evidently immense.
Very many measurements must be made before we can
attempt an answer to the simplest of the questions presenting
themselves for solution.
   It would not be difficult, perhaps, even now, to deduce some
empirical mathematical expression which should appear to
satisfy some of the results concerning the connexion of
atomic weight and physical properties.           If the measurements
be accurate, such an empirical law may be generally easily
enough deduced ; but in a case so complicated as that pre
sented to the chemist, an empirical law would be of little
value; it would almost certainly be untrue. We must be
content to wait for further researches, in the hope of being
                                                                                          of all

that science has no need of hypotheses appears to me to be
but falling, if possible, into a worse error.
   34.   I have    thus endeavoured shortly to trace the evolution
of chemical      theory    in the past, and to indicate a few of the
main lines     along     which,  as it seems to me, it must proceed in
the more or less immediate future.              Although I have entitled
this paper “On Chemical Classification,” yet                have made no                  I
attempt at a system of classification : the time for such an
attempt is yet,           Ibelieve, a long way off.        We have, it is
true, various systems, each, it may be, good in itself, and
useful for certain limited purposes.              But it is only when we
shall have attained to a much wider knowledge of the con
nexions existing between               composition and properties of
chemical bodies that          any  attempt   at a large scheme of clas
sification   likely    to prove of lasting value need be made.
     The three main lines of research (see par. 29) indicated in
 the foregoing paragraphs even now blend into one another;
we cannot keep them altogether separate, if we would. The
 barriers between them are, of course, artificial, and merely
 set up as aids to research.             Many subsidiary problems, not
 strictly included within any of these general questions, already
 present themselves, and will, in                             all
                                                 probability, increase                                              in
 number    as   investigation     progresses.
   A    considerable number            exceptional phenomena are even
                                              of

XXXV.        On the Determination                  of Temperature-coefficients for
  Insulating Envelopes.  By THOMAs T. P. BRUCE WARREN,
  Analytical Chemist to the India-rubber, Gutta-percha, and
   Telegraph-Works Company, Limited *.
A*     the Exeter Meeting of the British Association      read a                I
       paper on Electrificationt, in which      endeavoured to  I
show that the rate of variation in the insulation resistance of
a core or cable under changes of temperature could be deter
mined for any period of contact.
   A statement was made in that paper which has led to the
belief that india-rubber has the same constant for correcting
from one temperature to another and for any period of con
tact.   Professor Fleeming Jenkin, Mr. Latimer Clark, and
others have pointed out that this phenomenon is not met with
in gutta percha or any other insulator with which they are
acquainted.    This has led me to reexamine the matter, and to
consider carefully the experimental data upon which the paper
was founded.
   The method of representing graphically the decrease of
resistance due to increase of temperature corresponding to one
minute's electrification can be followed out for two, three, or
any number of minutes.          In this way a series of logarithmic
curves are obtained for   any  required   duration of contact. These
curves are generated by a constant which must first be ascer
tained by experiment for changes of temperature at the end
of one, two, three, &c. minutes. This was omitted in the pre
vious paper, or at least not dealt with as fully as the importance
of the subject required.
  The phenomenon of electrification, from what has just been
pointed out, must appear to every electrician to have received
additional importance, and no longer to be regarded as an unin
telligible or inapplicable fact. One very important consequence
of   its being reducible          intelligible variation
                                    to      an                 that we    is,

insulator due      variation
                      to         temperature, but we can ascertain
                                            of

     If the temperature-coefficient were constant for               and every        all

               of                                                       curves

 Now,      asthe temperature-coefficients for increased duration                                      of
contact diminish, the curves more nearly approach each other
as   the temperatures increase, which agrees with the fact that
electrification-ratios are reduced less and less as the resistance
º
itself diminishes.

XXXVI.        On Binaural Audition.  By SILVANUs P. THoxip
     soN, B.Sc., B.A., Lecturer in Experimental Physics, Uni
     versity College, Bristol".
1.
     DU.N.   the course of a series of experiments made a
       few months ago I had occasion to listen to a tone of
slightly fluctuating pitch, the sound of which was led to one
ear by a caoutchouc tube.       Desiring to measure the pitch of
the tone, it occurred to me to try to obtain interference-beats
with a fork of very nearly the same pitch. Under the                         cir
cumstances this could only be accomplished by holding the
vibrating standard fork to the other ear. On doing this                            I
was somewhat surprised to observe that the “beats' were
heard with remarkable distinctness.       Up to this time      was       I
not aware of    any  experiments   on the binaural estimation of
beats, nor even that they could be so heard.       Shortly after
wards I learned from Dr. W. H. Stone that he has been in
the habit of using both ears, with a tuning-fork applied to
each, in counting beats, and that he finds no difference be
tween the result of this method and that of listening to both
forks with one ear.
   2. When two forks producing “beats” are thus applied,
one to each ear, there is a possibility of the vibrations of the
one fork being conveyed to the other ear exteriorly through
the air. To eliminate as nearly as possible this chance       took       I
two UT.(c’    – 256) forks, by Ducretet of Paris, and loaded
one with wax to give about 2.5 beats per second when
sounded with the other. The forks were unscrewed from their
resonant boxes; an india-rubber tube was inserted into an
aperture in the wall of each of the resonant boxes correspond
ing to the forks; and the two tubes were led to the two ears
of the observer, and plugged round with cotton-wool.           For
 the sake of   greater  precision, the tubes were led  away   from
 the apartment into two others, in each of which an assistant
 struck one of the forks and held it in front of the mouth of
 the resonant box.     The “beats” were most distinctly heard,
 and seemed to be   taking   place within the cerebellum.   When
 the forks vibrated so slightly as to be singly             all
                                                   but inaudible,
the beats   ofthe two were most distinctly heard.
     3.When the beats were augmented          number per second
                                                       in
 by additional loading, they were still very distinct     binaural  to
 audition, and unusually harsh. On listening attentively for
a  combinational (difference) tone, none was observed.         Two
    Communicated       A,by   the Author, having been read before    the British

sounds were separately led to the two ears. The same was
the case with        and SOLs. The effect was not entirely
agreeable, being peculiarly harsh, yet unlike any ordinary
discord. When                       Mi.
                       and SOLs were thus employed together,

                                      of   a combinational tone         no
was produced, but the effect was disagreeable and grating                                             in
the extreme—a most unpleasant jarring sensation being ex
cited, apparently     the region     the top

Several observers concurred         the absence       any com                            of

sensation.

intensity, but differing        phase.     in   series        A

experiments               on

                                                is        completion; but
                                                             in               of
before these were begun the following simple experiment was
tried. One          my two UT's forks was loaded until
                         of                                            gave                    it
two beats     per   second with the other. When                 they   were
sounded together, there was obviously produced                   rapid suc               a
cession        of    all
                possible differences          phase.          of

sion      of
          interferences was afterwards            employed.      When the
two forks were presented separately (and simultaneously)                                              to
the two ears, and also when their tones were independently

of  such     tone,
               a    and the statement rests merely upon the evi
dence        of the senses.
   5.     It   is   not easy          to   explain why interference-beats should
thus occur           in       the simultaneous individual action      of the two
ears, while combinational tones                                  (difference-tones) are              in
audible. There         the case is   in                      of    the auditory nerves,               or

the former do not intersect after leaving the fourth ventricle,

they diverge right and left. There is in health a possible
communication between the ears across the pharynx, through
the Eustachian tubes.        Moreover the bone of the skull itself

for         ears hearing a sound entering by one only.

why combinational tones should not be equally audible in
binaural as in monaural audition ; so that we are driven to
the hypothesis that any means of comparison which may
exist in the nerve systems of the ears exists deep-seated in
the actual structure of the brain. This may be the reason
why dissonances are in binaural audition so excessively dis
agreeable, and why even ordinary consonant intervals become
harsh.    They evoke a discontinuous sensation when there is
no   opportunity   of their blending previously to acting upon
the sensitive mechanism of the nerve-structures.                   dis                        #.

    Therefore the molecular magnetism of the burnt oxides is
much less than that of the corresponding salts and hydrates;
it varies also according to the manner of exhibition and treat
ment of the oxides.         From the behaviour of the mixtures of
ferric and chromic oxides with alumina it follows that when
the coagulation of individual particles of the magnetic oxides
is prevented by the presence of an indifferent substance, their
magnetism turns out greater.             This may arise from the en
hancement of the molecular forces that hold the magnetic
      ãº,
atoms of metal in their relative position and prevent their
rotation, occasioned by the condensation with the heating,
being considerable; and in that case, with a finer division,
the                     mutual action of the parts lying side by
side is as much weakened as the magnetizing action of those
situated one behind another. Since in certain cases the former
is greater than the latter, this distribution may effect an           in
crease of magnetism.         Whether moreover the diminutions of
magnetism here observed are to be attributed only to the con
siderable alterations of density, or are connected with an actual
change in the atom-grouping, cannot at present be decided.
    12. The Hydrates of the Superorides of manganese, cobalt,
and nickel have only a very feeble magnetism; it is different
with the magnetism of the so-called superovide of chromium,
CrO2. The round glass vessel was filled first with a solution
of chromic sulphate, and then with one of bichromate of potass,
and each time the magnetism determined ; in the second case
it was nearly equal to that of water, therefore negative. After
wards the glass was partly filled with the first, and then filled up
to the mark with the second solution, and the magnetism again
   * The ferric and chromic oxides were, for these experiments, precipi
tated jointly with the alumina from a mixed solution of ammonia-alum
and ferric chloride or chromic nitrate, and the mixture afterwards heated
to incandescence.

278                   Prof. G. Wiedemann on                         the Magnetic
determined.    Calculated for the atom of the chromium con
tained in the chromic-sulphate solution, it was found nearly
equal to the atomic magnetism of chromium in the ordinary
chromic salts. Thus the magnetism of the total chromium
            (1) in the solution of chromic sulphate                                     54-2
        (2) in the mixture . . . . . . . 231
The  weights  of chromic oxide in the two were as 23.62:11:30
 ==1:0:47, the magnetisms as 1 : 043. Therefore the mag
netism of the chromium oxide was not essentially changed
with the precipitation. Accordingly the so-called superoxide
of chromium is a saline combination of chromic acid with
chromic oxide, as, indeed, it is also well known that by
washing it with water it can be more and more decomposed
into those two constituents.

cannot arise from a possible separation of colloid oxide of

      A
      further  insight  into the constitution    the ferro- and            of

280                 Prof. G. Wiedemann on               the   Magnetic
 ferricyanides &c. is afforded by the experiments described at
 p. 170, and by others similar to them.          By those experiments
 it is proved that when a solution of these salts is mixed with
 the solution of a salt of iron, nickel, cobalt, or manganese, and
 thereby the potassium in them is partially or entirely replaced
 by the magnetic metals of the latter, the molecular magnetism
 is augmented by the magnetism of those metals—as, e.g., on
 the replacement of the potassium in the chloride of potassium
 by the same metals, in which the magnetism of the potassium
 is a vanishing quantity against that of the latter. The electro
.
 lytic behaviour shows that the ferro- and ferricyanides and the
 analogous salts of manganese and cobalt are to be regarded
 as compounds in which the one constituent (e.g. the potassium)
 is electrolytically opposed to the radical combined with it
 (ferrocyanogen &c.) in like manner as the chlorine in potas
 sium chloride. It results from the magnetic investigation that,
 even in the undecomposed salts, the potassium in the ferro
 cyanide &c. possesses altogether the same properties as in the
           of potassium &c. The constitution of both series of
 salts is in this respect the same; the former are therefore, like
 the latter, to be considered, even in the undecomposed state, as
 binary compounds.
    It is remarkable that also the combined cyanides of nickel
 and potassium (NiCy3+2KCy), which possesses a composi
 tion deviating from the constitution of the ferocyanides, is
feebly diamagnetic. Consequently this salt is not to be ima
gined a double salt; much rather, as results from              electro      its
lysis, may the potassium           be

  According to this the magnetism of the chromium in the
 otassium chromicyanide (42-7) and in the potassium chromi
sulphocyanide (41*1) is nearly the same as that of the rest of
the chromic-oxide salts (419); there is no such diminution of
 it to be perceived as that which is conditioned by the atomic
 grouping               to the ferricyanide. We should hence be
                         º
justified in considering the potassium chromicyanide and
 chromisulphocyanide simple double salts in which chromium
 possesses quite the same properties as in solution of chromic
 chloride, for instance, &c.          -
    17. Of great interest is the magnetic deportment of a series
 of ammoniacal compounds of cobalt, nickel, chromium, and cop
per. As is known,                    the so-called ammonio-cobalt
 salts behave  differently  from the ordinary salts of cobalt; and
one is inclined to assume that in them the cobalt occupies the
place of a part of the hydrogen of the ammonium.         Other
ammoniacal compounds of cobalt, e. g. the double salt am
monio-cobaltous sulphate &c., on the contrary, range them
selves perfectly with the ordinary cobalt-salts. The same dif
ferences are shown also in the magnetic behaviour of the
various    cobalt compounds; and the latter is accordingly
adapted,   in doubtful cases, to decide concerning their consti
tution.
   Nearly the same molecular magnetism is possessed by the
double salts ammonio-cobaltous sulphate &c., and by the am
moniacal compounds obtained by passing gaseous ammonia
over anhydrous cobaltous sulphate, cobaltic chloride, &c., as
by the ordinary oxygen and haloid salts of cobalt. Thus, after
deducting the magnetism of the glass filled with water, retain
ing the previous notation, there was found:—

and 11, are even diamagnetic.         We must therefore assume
that in the latter salts the cobalt is combined in a quite differ
ent manner from that in which it is in the ordinary cobaltous
salts or those analogous to the ferric salts.      Much rather may
these salts, exactly like the ferrocyanides, contain the cobalt
in a special scarcely magnetic group, while perhaps the cobalt
replaces a portion of the hydrogen of the ammonium.                 For
the first four salts Geuther" had put forth the opinion that
".
they were double salts which contained respectively, together
       one molecule of luteocobaltammonium sulphite, either
(1) two or (2) one molecule of cobaltic sulphite, or (3) with
one molecule of sulphite of roseocobaltammonium          one molecule
of cobaltic sulphite, or, finally, (4) with two molecules of hy
posulphate of luteocobaltammonium one molecule of basic
cobaltic hyposulphate.
    The formulae of the salts 1 and 4 would therefore have to
be multiplied by three, that of salts 2 and 3 by two. They
would contain (1) six, (2 and 3) four, and (4) six atoms of
cobalt; and their molecular magnetism would be respec
tively:-(1) 888, (2) 104, (3) 924, (4) 192. The luteoco
baltammonium sulphite (in analyzed formula 12 NH3, Coz O3,
3 SO2) and roseocobaltammonium           sulphite (10 NH3, Co, Os,
3 SO2), as well as the hyposulphate of luteocobaltammonium
 (12 NH3, Co, Os, 2S, O, H, O), contain two atoms of cobalt
each.    Since, further, the luteo- and roseocobaltammonium
salts are to be considered almost unmagnetic, the total magne
tism of the double salts would fall to the cobaltic sulphite and
hyposulphate only. The magnetism of each atom of cobalt
 contained in the fue would accordingly be (1) 22:2, (2) 52,
 (3) 46, (4) 0:48.     But these atomic magnetisms deviate con
 siderably from one another; only salts 2 and 3 could contain
 a common magnetic group of atoms.           At any rate the cobaltic
 salt to be assumed as existing in the salts could not be consi
 dered after the analogy of the ordinary ferric salts, since then
 the magnetism of the cobalt contained in them must be greater
 than in the cobaltous salts (67.2).

 acid solutions of cobalt-salts nitrite of potass showed them
 selves by their magnetism to be                   different from the
 ordinary cobaltous salts, as well as from the first-mentioned
 salts (1–3); and so did the nitrites of cobalt which at the same
 time contained barium, strontium, or calcium (17, 18, 19).
 The magnetism of the latter is nearly the same as that of the
 so-called potassio-cobaltous nitrite precipitated from a neutral

       e peculiar violet compound     obtained when freshly preci

tion, mixed with excess of hydrochloric acid, slowly evapo
rated to crystallization, is sometimes regarded as the salt of a
proper chromium base similar to the platinum bases, as tetra
mine chromic chloride Cr (NHA), Cla-i-H. O. The magnetic
investigation of the solid salt gave the following results:—

 while the atomic magnetism of the chromium in the ordinary
 chromic salts is equal to 419.        Hence in ammonio-chromic
 chloride the chromium exhibits the same deportment as in the
 chromic salts.     Here, too, we cannot assume that the atom
    oup containing the chromium is essentially other than in
    e latter; and we are compelled to attribute to the ammonia
 a similar part as to the water of hydrates—precisely as in the
 ammoniacal nickel- and copper-salts.          The formula of the salt
 should accordingly be written:-Cr, Cle, 8NH3, 2 H2O.
   18. Dissociation.—It is known that a number of ferric salts in
 their solutions undergo dissociation, at a lower or higher tem
 perature, into colloid ferric oxide and acid. We have already
 (p. 172) mentioned that by the determination of the magne
 tism of these salts their partial dissociation can be quantita
 tively verified.    If mois the magnetism of unit weight of iron
 in the solid salts or in those present in a very acid solution
 and not dissociated, m1 the magnetism of unit weight of iron
 in the colloid solution of ferric oxide, m the magnetism of unit
 weight of iron in the solution of a partially dissociated salt in
 which the quantity of the ferric oxide combined with the acid

286               Prof. G. Wiedemann on the Magnetic
is to the colloidally dissolved free oxide as 1—w                                        : æ,   then is
                      m= m,(1—a) + m1 r.
Since the magnetism mi of the colloid ferric oxide is only
0-2198 of the magnetism mo of the oxide in combination with
acid, therefore
                                                              ºn,

Consequently by determining the magnetism we can directly
determine the ratio a . 1 of the quantity of ferric oxide disso
ciated to the total quantity of it in the salt.
   In this manner the magnetism of the unit weight of iron in
variously dilute solutions of ferric chloride was observed, with

    The variation of the nucleal radius as the # power of the
atmospheric radius (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1876, k) may furnish a
mechanical explanation of results which seem to have been
obtained independently, and nearly simultaneously, by Silas
W. Holman (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1877) and E. Warburg (Pogg.
                                                                         º:
Ann. clix. p. 415). Holman concludes, from the results of a
number of careful experiments, that the “viscosity of air
increases proportionally to the 0.77 power                          the ab
solute   temperature      between 0° and 100° C.”               e  extreme
range of his results is 738 to 799. Warburg, from experi
ments both with hydrogen and with air, deduces the expo
nents between 20° and 100°, -76 for air (the extremes being
:74 and '76), and “about 3" for hydrogen (the extremes
being ‘57 and 65). The closeness, the narrow range, and the
mutual confirmation of these independent results, as well as
the new analogy between molar and molecular forces which
seems to be indicated by the atmospheric experiments, are                                             all

Deville (Comptes Rendus, lxxxiv. p. 1259) says:– “My first
experiments on the dissociation of water, in perfect accord
with those which M. Bunsen has since published, demonstrate
that at temperatures of 2500°, according to M. Debray and
myself, or of 2800°, according to the illustrious professor of
Heidelberg, nearly half of this vapour is reduced to           ele                               its

precisely with    very probable estimate

solar and terrestrial superficial attraction.

the velocity of seismic-wave transit that the instant of genesis of
the wave, or instant at which during the period of genesis the
wave whose traffsit-velocity is to be measured starts, should
be accurately known ; and for this the impulse generating the
wave must result from one single explosion; and, if possible, the
commencement of movement of the rock-mass should be visible
from the distant time-observing-point at the extremity of the
measured range. Now in this case the impulse was due, not
 to one explosion, but to thousands of small charges scattered
in various directions within a limited but considerable distance
                                                                                i.

                                                                    a                     of
   between the other three results...        am therefore compelled
                                                                I                                          to
   look with entire distrust    upon       these results.  all     every case             In
   the wave-transit occurred through earth covered for very vari
   able portions       the entire range
                       of                     water variously    by    motion,                 in

300      Mr. R. Mallet      on the Seismic Results obtained
and differing much in depth at various parts. Now, as seismic
wave-transit is much more rapid through water than through
any known rock or other formation, and as the impulse was
transmitted from about the same focus through the water
and the earth it partially or wholly covered, it is exceedingly
improbable that the rapid rate of transit in the water should
not more or less influence that through the rock beneath.
There then must arise, as it seems to me, great difficulty in
knowing what wave it was that the observers at the different ex
tremities of the different ranges noticed by their instruments.
It is certain that no two of the observers could have seen the
same wave under like modifications, due to the unlike circum
                                            .
stances of transmission in the different respective ranges.
  . Nor, amongst the numerous sources of uncertainty present,
 must we omit to notice that there were at least three sets of
 waves generated at the outset, viz. (1) that of the crackling
 explosion itself, (2) that of the fall of the dislocated masses of
 rock into the cavity excavated beneath the reef, (3) the return
 fall of the huge mass of water thrown up by the explosion.
 The further an elastic vibration travels through any part of
 our earth's crust, the more it gets broken up and diffused as
 secondary waves; hence very long ranges are less suited for
 experiment than those of more                      length, and moderate
 charges are on the whole better than very powerful ones. From
 all  these causes, therefore,    it   seems impossible        decide what to
                   origin  of   the “tremor” seen          the seismoscope
                                                                  at in

                 By Colonel A. R. CLARKE, C.B., F.R.S.
     do not know that any demonstration has ever been given
      of a theorem enunciated by Gauss in a letter addressed
by him in 1853 to General Baeyer. It appears from the letter
in question (of which a translation appeared in the Comptes
Rendus des Séances de la Commission permanente de l'Associa
tion Géodésique internationale tenues à Florence en 1869) that,
at the suggestion of General Baeyer, Gauss had investigated
the influence of altitude above the sea-level on observed lati
tudes, and had arrived at a result which, if not very important
to geodesists and astronomers, still is very curious and inter
esting. The point in question is this:–In the adjoining dia

memoirs, and has had to study compression in every possible way.
In some cases the results of an extensive investigation are stated
in a short article; in others important theorems are given in the
form of examples, the reasoning by which their truth is established
being left to be made out by the student with little or no assistance.
Thus, on p. 139 Mr. Routh gives as an example M. Morin's ex
perimental proof that impulsive friction obeys the laws of ordinary
friction; in Art. 151 he gives (with certain variations), the sub
stance of M. Morin's investigation of the friction of carriage
wheels; in Art. 224, under the head of an example he gives four
 of the principal theorems of Mr. Ball's Theory of Screws; and
 similar cases are to be found elsewhere—e.g. Ex. 2 p. 312, Ex. 1
p. 366, Ex. 1, 2 p. 371, Ex. 4 p. 498, &c. All these are, we believe,
additions made to the present edition.
   In other cases the additions are supplementary to articles that
occurred in former editions.     Thus, in Chap. IX. (on the motion
of a   body  under the action of no forces), in this and in former
editions, the determination of the angular velocities round the
principal axes is shown to depend on a differential equation, the
integration of which can be made without difficulty to depend on
an elliptic Integral.    In the present edition the solution is actu
ally effected by means of elliptic functions, according to a method
due to Kirchhoff.
   In a case where the matter of a book is very closely packed, and
where a good deal of detail is left to be made out by the reader,
there is of course considerable danger of needful explanation being
altogether withheld, or given with so much brevity as to be insuffi
cient for the wants of many of the readers.    Although Mr. Routh's
explanations are for the most part sufficient, and in many cases
singularly clear, yet we cannot help thinking that occasionally his
text might be expanded with advantage.      We will give an example
of what we mean.       On p. 411, in the chapter on the motion of a
body under the action of no forces, after defining the polhode, and
showing that      its
                  equations are

   The apparatus made use of consisted of a cast-iron disk 2 feet
in diameter and weighing 86.2 lbs., supported on a steel axle whose
ends were less than one tenth of an inch in diameter. These ends
were supported in bearings which consisted of rec.angular notches
cut in pieces of the material whose friction against steel was to
be measured. The disk was caused to revolve and then left to
itself, when it came to rest in consequence of the friction on the
ends of the axle. The rate of retardation was found as follows:–
A strip of paper 23 inches broad was stretched round the periphery
of the disk; and a pendulum was caused to swing across this paper
in a plane perpendicular to that of the disk. On the pendulum was
fastened a fine glass siphon, one end of which dipped into a box
containing ink, whilst the other stood at a short distance from the
paper strip, across which it was carried as the pendulum oscillated.
lº
By keeping the ink-box strongly electrified, ink was deposited on the
        by the point of the siphon in a rapid succession of fine spots.
  y this means, without the introduction of any new source of
friction, a permanent record was made of the resultant motion of
the pendulum and the revolving disk. This frictionless method of
recording was designed by Sir William Thomson for telegraphic
purposes, and is employed in his siphon recorder.      From the curve
drawn in this way it was easy to determine the rate of retardation
of the disk (and therefore the friction) corresponding to various
velocities of the rubbing surfaces.     The lowest velocity for which
the determinations were definite was about 0.0002 foot per second;
and the highest velocity to which the experiments extended was
0-01 foot per second. The surfaces examined were steel on steel,
 steel on brass, steel on agate, steel on beech, and steel on green
heart—in each case under the three conditions, dry, oiled, and wet
 with water.     In the cases steel on beech oiled or wet with water, and
 steel on  greenheart   oiled or wet with water, the coefficient of fric
tion increased as the velocity diminished between the two limits
given above, the increase amounting to about twenty per cent.
of the lower value. It appeared that at the higher limit of
velocity there was little further tendency to change in the co
efficient ; but it is impossible to say how much additional change
might take place between the lower limit of the velocity and rest.
In the case of steel on agate wet with water there was a similar
but much less marked increase of friction as the velocity de
                                                            lº.
creased; and in the case of steel on steel oiled there was a slight
and somewhat uncertain change of the opposite character—that
 is,a   decrease   of friction       the velocity
                                       as                       This case,
however, would require further examination.                    In   all

Scotia.”  By Edwin Gilpin, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The author described the occurrence in the northern part of
Nova Scotia of a great band of Silurian deposits, running nearly
east and west, and traversed in a corresponding direction by nume
rous detached bands of granites, syenites, &c. Roughly parallel to
the line of the latter there is a tolerably well-defined series of
fractures running from Parrsboro on the Bay of Fundy to Guysboro
on the Atlantic coast. The course of this line of disturbance is
marked by metamorphism, and by the presence of associated ores of
iron and copper. The principal localities where the latter occur
are noticed by the author, who states that the copper deposits
attain their greatest development near Lochaber Lake and Polson's
Lake, where they form a series of veins cutting at oblique angles
black and red shales and quartzites, apparently of somewhat doubtful
age.   The quality of the ore is said to be good.

Jack, Esq., F.G.S., and John Horne, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geological
Survey of Scotland.
   In this paper the authors noticed the statements of previous
observers as to the occurrence of glacial drift in the northern part
of the Carpathian range, and described the rock-formations sur
rounding the head-waters of the Theiss, and some drift sections
observed in the valley of that river.   They arrived at the following
conclusions:—Glacial   deposits  are not abundantly developed in the
valleys of the north-eastern Carpathian.       The drift in the upper
reaches of the Theiss is of the most    fragmentary   character, and is
confined  mainly to the broader    portions  of the  valley.   There is,
however, sufficient evidence for maintaining that the Theiss valley
was filled with    glacier upwards
                   a                      of   45
                                             miles long, although the
authors were unable     determine whether this glacier ever debouched
                       to
on  the plainsof Hungary       or
                              ever reached the edge  of  the Carpathian
chain; but they think   itprobable that such was the case.

By W. A. E. Ussher, Esq., F.G.S., of H.M. Geological Survey.
  The author discussed the views advocated by Mr. D. Mackintosh
on the terminal curvature of slaty beds (Q. J. G. S. vol. xxiii.
p. 326), and objected to the hypothesis that the phenomenon was
produced by the action of ice in any form, which was the agency
to which Mr. Mackintosh was most inclined to ascribe it. The
author thought that what has been called terminal curvature might
be produced by three distinct causes, namely:-1. The curvature
produced by internal movements at great depths, afterwards ren
dered superficial by long subsequent denuding agencies; 2. The
action of wedging frosts on the upturned edges of the beds, as ad
vocated by Mr. Godwin-Austen; and 3. The intrusion between the
laminae of the rocks of the roots and rootlets of growing trees.
   15. “On the Chronological Classification of the Granitic Rocks of
Ireland.” By G. H. Kinahan, Esq., M.R.I.A.
   The author adopts Scheerer's definition that a granite is a rock
of certain constitution, in which               all
                                     the constituents are separately
developed,  and gives the name             of
                                       elvanites      those granitic rocks
                                                                to                                   in
which part        the constituents are not perfectly crystallized. The
                  of
elvanites pass into true granites           on
                                          the one hand, and          the other       on
into plutonic        volcanic rocks. They are thus “passage-rocks”
                       or
between the two sections.

  The author states that    these rocks are greatly altered     meta                      by
morphic action. Quartz rock occurs            dykes and other masses
                                                           in
among the Cambrian and Cambro-Silurian rocks, but chiefly among
the former;    mayit    foliated and converted into quartzite

the author calls metapepsis   (see preceding paper).

 at Greenore, and on the S.W. coast of Wexford.                       At the former it is
 a fine reddish   conglomerate,        lying     on or      against      schists; at the
 latter a massive slate conglomerate. The rocks of this series in
 ascending order are:—1. Black carbonaceous shales and slates, or
 grey beds with subordinate beds of grit ; 2. Green and grey grits,
 shales, and slates; 3. The Ballymoney series of green, grey, black,
 and red grits, sandstones, slates, and shales, with interstratified
igneous rocks; 4. Red, purple, and green beds, usually more or less
argillaceous.
    The Cambrian formation generally consists of green, purple, or
reddish grits, shales, and slates, but here and there with grey or
even black beds.     The author describes the Cambrian rocks in the
various areas in which they occur, namely                  at:-
    Howth, where they are but little altered in the N., becoming more
altered towards the S.
    Bray Head, generally unaltered, and containing many specimens
of Oldhamia, and with massive dykes of quartz rock.
   S.E. Wicklow, where the western boundary is doubtful. Near
Carrick Mountain and to the westward the rocks are much altercd,
and the author thinks that probably masses of Cambrian rocks were
forced by disturbances into the Cambro-Silurians,                          and then the
whole were metamorphosed together.
   N.E. Wexford. The area commences on the east coast near Cour
town Harbour, extends S. to and beyond Wexford, and then S.W. to
the coast near Bannow Bay. The rocks are generally submeta
morphic, with many large protrusions of quartz rock, generally
changed by metapepsis          into quartzite.             Rooney's Rocks, S. of
 Poulshore, consist of two protrusions of quartz rock, between and
N. of which are green and purplish Cambrian shales, in which
 Oldhamia antiqua has been found, as also in a green bed further
south at Cahore. On the coast of Haggard and Bannow the Cam
brian and Cambro-Silurian rocks are mixed up very irregularly by
means of numerous faults.         At Bannow Oldhamia is not uncommon.
The most continuous sections are seen in this area in the valley
of the river Slaney, where the rocks generally dip to the N. at
angles of 10°-60° or 80°, and are, going from N. to S.:—
   1. Massive grits with some shaly beds, underlain by
        more or less altered grits and shales; average dip
        30°, giving a thickness of about . . . . . . . . . . . .               3000 feet.
   2. Schists with quartzites (metamorphosed grits), dip
        50°; about. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4000   ,
   3. Schists with masses of quartzite (altered quartz
        rock), dip 40°; about . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          4000   ,
                           Total about            . . . . . . . . .. . . . .  11000   a
but the numerous faults render the numbers uncertain.

  denser? It is this question that               I  have endeavoured to determine
  by the following experiments.
      Two plane condensers, quite equal and furnished with electro
  metric appendages, are connected each with one of the armatures
  of a Holtz machine, on the one side, and, on the other, with the
  earth.     One of them is provided with a plate of glass of 1:32 mil
  lim. thickness; the other receives plates of various kinds and thick
  nesses.     The spontaneous discharges always take place at a constant
  distance.     Under these conditions the quantities of electricity
  translated, during one and the same time, by the number of sparks
  furnished by each of the conjugate condensers may be regarded as
  equal.
      The following Table sums up the results of a great number of
  concordant experiments.             The number of sparks refers to the          in
  terval between two sparks from the standard condenser.

      The rarer the sparks, the stronger they are. This can be ac
   counted for by the report and the light which accompany them;
   but it can be demonstrated also by means of a variety of the Kin
   nersley thermometer in which the action of the spark upon the
   liquid is replaced by the pushing-back of an index of elder-pith.
      It is seen that the ratio of the number of sparks to the thickness
   of the plate is sensibly constant for plates of the same nature. The
   irregularities presented by the vulcanized caoutchouc proceed,

   doubtless, from its want of homogeneity.
       It is morever seen how great are the differences of effect ob
   tained with plates of the same thickness but of different kinds.
       Besides, the ordinary laws of the discharge of a condenser are
   very well verified by employing our conjugate condensers supplied
   with plates of the same nature. It will be sufficient, in order to
   comprise in Clausius's formula the peculiarities here signalized, to
   introduce a constant dependent solely on the nature of the dielec
   tric. This constant, it seems, would be no other than that of
   Faraday; but it will be remarked that, according to our results,
   the greater it is the feebler is the discharge.—Comptes Rendus de

  ON    THE SPECIFIC HEAT AND THE HEAT OF FUSION OF PLATINUM.
                              BY J. VIOLLE.
      I. The specific heat of platinum was measured at 100°, 800°,
  1000°, and 1200° upon some pure metal, for which
  to the kindness of M. H. Sainte-Claire Deville.
                                                         I am indebted
      The mean specific heat between zero and 100°, determined with
  M. Regnault's classic apparatus, was found to be 0.0323.
      In order to obtain the mean specific heat between zero and 800°,
  the porcelain reservoir of an air thermometer of M. Deville's and
  an unglazed porcelain vessel containing the platinum mass (423-140
  grammes) submitted to experiment were introduced into one and
  the same horizontal muffle, which was heated with gas in a furnace
  with a double casing, Perrot's system. When the temperature of
  the entire apparatus had become quite stationary, the vesse' con
  taining the platinum was taken out, the metal withdrawn and ra
  pidly plunged into a platinum eprouvette placed, with the orifice
  upward, in the midst of the water of the calorimeter.    Equilibrium
  of   temperature between the hot  platinum  and the water surround
  ing it was slowly established. Care had also been taken to place
  the calorimeter within an enclosure with a constant temperature, on
  the model of that adopted by M. Berthelot.         The correction for
  cooling was made by the method indicated by M. Regnault and
  carried out by M. Pfaundler.     Of two experiments thus conducted,
  one gave 0.0364 at 787°, the other 0.0366 at 780°; therefore the
  mean specific heat of platinum between zero and 784° is 0.0365.
      The mean specific heat between zero and 1000° was obtained in
  precisely the same manner. An important change, however, was
  introduced into a portion of the experiments. To avoid the uncer
  tainty which always exists respecting a correction for cooling,
  although it is small (not exceeding 0°3 for an excess of 11 or 12
  degrees), in certain experiments the platinum eprouvette was
  omitted and the hot platinum plunged directly into the water: only
- an insignificant quantity of vapour was liberated ; and the time
  required for attaining the stationary temperature was reduced from
  fifteen or twenty minutes to a few seconds, which did away with
  any correction for cooling. The results of twelve experiments (the
  first three by the old method, the nine others by direct immersion
  of the platinum in the water of the calorimeter) were:—

gramme          of   solid platinum  from the  fusing-point zero. For this
purpose         a   certain quantity    platinum was melted; into the fused

 320           Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
 platinum a wire spiral of the same metal was dipped ; and at the
 instant when the surface began to solidify, a rosette of solid pla
 tinum was taken up with the wire and immersed in the water of
 the calorimeter.     With five rosettes, weighing respectively 57.3,
 57.87, 81.5, 40.67, and 49 grammes, the following heatings of the
 water of the calorimeter for 1 gramme of platinum were suc
 cessively observed—0°-0722,        0°-0704, 0°-0702, 0°.0715, and
 0°-0708; mean, 0°-0710. The mass in water of the calorimeter
 being 1052,524 grammes, we have
                           q=74-73 units
 for the quantity of heat given up by 1 gramme of platinum from
 the fusion-point to 15°, the mean temperature of the calorimetric
 liquid in these experiments.
    If it be admitted that the specific heat of platinum is repre
 sented, up to the fusion-point, by the formula above-given, it
 follows that, for the fusion-temperature of platinum,
                               T=1779°.
 But the increase of the specific heat of platinum with the tempe
 rature is without doubt accelerated in the vicinity of the fusing
 point, the platinum passing through the pasty condition before
 becoming liquid; the true temperature of fusion will therefore be
 slightly below the number thus obtained.
    III.  By running a certain weight of melted platinum taken as
 near as possible to the fusion-point, into the platinum eprouvette
 of the calorimeter, we can measure the total heat of fusion of the
 metal—that is to say, the quantity of heat necessary to transform
 1 gramme of platinum at zero into liquid platinum at the very tem
 perature of fusion.      With weights of 47-51, 783, 40.82, and
 158.79 grammes of melted platinum, the following heatings of the
 water of the calorimeter, for 1 gramme of platinum, were suc
cessively observed—0°.0756, 0°-0757, 0°-0747, and 0°.0767; mean,
 0°-0757. The mass in water of the calorimeter being, in these ex
 periments, 1345.42 grammes, we have for the total heat of fusion
 of platinum, starting from 170° (the mean temperature of the water
 of the calorimeter),
                           L=101-85 units.
 If  from this we deduct the quantity of the heat q necessary to
 raise 1 gramme of platinum to the melting-temperature, we have
 the latent heat of fusion
                            X=27-18 units.
    IV.  The melting-point    of silver, determined in the course of
 these researches, upon a pure example kindly prepared for me by
M. Lory, was found to be 954°, a temperature very near to that
given by M. Edmond Becquerel.           Other melting-points (those of
gold, copper, &c.) shall shortly be measured.—Comptes Rendus de

322     Prof.  J. W. Mallet on the Weight of a Wire placed
currents, which pass also from east to west on the upper            sur
face   of the earth beneath.
    In  one respect, however, the analogy between the earth
and a large magnet seems at first sight to fail.             If into the
neighbourhood of an ordinary magnet we bring a second
magnetic bar, or instead of it a spiral wire traversed by an
electric current, not only have we directive action, tending to
render the axes of the bars (or of bar and helix) parallel, but
there is also attraction, tending to bring the two acting masses
together, whence we might expect to find that a magnet, or
spiral conductor conveying a current, would also be specially
attracted by our earth after taking up the naturally assumed
north and south position—or, in other words, that the weight
 of such mass would, under these circumstances, seem to be
 increased.      Conversely, if two magnetic bars be placed
 parallel to each other with similar poles adjacent, we have
 repulsion, the currents of Ampère on the nearer sides of the
 bars being in opposite directions; and so we might look for
 repulsion by the earth, or an apparent decrease of weight, on
 the part of an ordinary magnet placed parallel to the earth's
 magnetic axis, but with reversed poles, or on the part of a
 helix of wire similarly placed but traversed by a current
 passing from west to east on the lower side of the spiral. No
 such appearance of change of weight occurs.
     This, however, may be readily seen to arise from the neu
 tralizing effect of the action on one side of the magnet or
 helix upon that exerted on the other, the difference of distance
                                                 i.
 of the two from the earth as a whole being practically nothing.
 But if one side could be detached from                other, and action
 upon the one alone observed, attraction and repulsion ought
 to be producible.     In the case of a magnetic bar this cannot
 be   accomplished,  but with a helix it can, one portion of the
 wire being rendered movable in relation to the rest, while
 preserving continuity of the electric current. The helix may,
 of course, for simplicity's sake, be reduced, as in Ampère's
 well-known experiments, to a single circle, and this to a
                      |.
  square or rectangle the sides of which represent the vertical
  and horizontal components of the current.             A straight hori
  zontal wire, then,            east and west and traversed by a
  current from east to west, should be attracted by the earth—
  and if the direction of the current were reversed, should be
  repelled.
     This result was clearly foreseen by Faraday in the course
  of his early researches on electromagnetic rotation. At the
  close of his paper of October 1821", he says:–“Theoretically,

therefore, a horizontal wire perpendicular to the magnetic
meridian, if connected first in one way with a voltaic battery,
and then in the opposite way, should have             weight altered                                its                           ;

  movable wire or wires being fixed so far as horizontal motion
  is concerned, there would be a lateral swing of the turned
  down ends tending to lift them partially out of the mercury;
  and to the extent that, by such lifting, copper in mercury
  was exchanged for copper in air, there would of course be
  increase of effective weight brought to bear upon the balance.
  But measuring the lengths of the balance-index, arm of the
  beam, and vertical distance from suspending-ring to surface
  of mercury in which the wires dipped                          on very simple
  calculation, that the amount of vertical motion observed would
  require, to be thus accounted for, not only a far greater am
 |. litude of horizontal swing than was actually seen to occur,
         much greater than could possibly occur without being
  arrested by the wires striking the sides of the mercury
 cups.
      Thus it appears that in                 all

                                        to       motion when the current
 passed   ;   and when the current was from east                  west, and the

 reverse, the apparent gain and loss                weight represented the

         XLV.        On the Influence of Light on Electrical Tension
                        in Metals.   By R. BöRNSTEIN “.
RPº            experiments have undoubtedly established the
       fact that luminous radiation produces on the electrical
behaviour of metals an effect which cannot be due merely to
an elevation of temperature.     This action takes place in two
ways, either producing a change in the electrical resistance
(a diminution) or a change in the electrical tension.      In a
former papert the authorias given a summary of the results
obtained by other observers with respect to the dependence
of the resistance on the illumination. On the subject of a
change of electrical tension produced by illumination, experi
j
ments have been made by Becquerelf, Grove $, Pacinotti |,
Hankel", and Adams and Day”".
   The first four of these observers examined into the electrical
phenomena which were presented when, of two plates of the
same metal plunged in the same liquid, one was illuminated
while both were connected with the terminal wires of a sensi
tive galvanometer.      Under these conditions different kinds
of  light were found to produce distinct variations in the che
        action; and this difference of chemical action caused the
illuminated plate to acquire an electrical state opposite to that
of the unexposed one; and consequently an electrical current,
which could be measured by a galvanometer, was generated
between the two plates.        In the papers of Grove, Pacinotti,
and Hankel we                #.
                         descriptions of the changes which took
place when conductible heat instead of light was allowed to
act upon one of the metal plates.         Grove found that heat
produced no effect when acting upon one of two platinum
plates standing in water slightly acidulated ; he attributes the

whole of the effect of illumination to the galvanic polarization
produced by the light. Blue light acted much more power
fully than yellow; red light was the weakest; and consequently
Grove concludes that these phenomena are due to the chemical
and not to the thermal rays of the solar beam, since in the
latter case the colours would act in the reverse order.     Paci
notti states that, of two  copper  plates standing in sulphate  or
nitrate of copper, the illuminated one, when exposed to the
rays of the sun, of a petroleum lamp, or to the radiation from
a heated iron plate, was always negative to the other.         On
the other hand, when he placed two small insulated copper
boxes of different sizes, one within the other, and filled the
space between them and the inner one with water of diffe
rent temperatures, the warm copper was positive to the
colder.    Hankel found that warm copper was always nega
tive with respect to cold copper; when two well-polished
copper plates were plunged in water, and one was exposed to
sunlight, it became negative to the other; and, on the other
hand, the more the plates were oxidized or covered with salts,
º
the more did the illuminated one acquire the positive state.
One or two Volta's piles were found to give opposite effects
                        i.
according as they were exposed to luminous radiation or to
heat.    Hankel        experimented with plates of silver, tin,
brass, zinc, and platinum ; but he describes only the effects of
           to light, and no experiments with heat.
     n     these experiments the electrical currents were pro
           all
 duced simultaneously with certain chemical phenomena, and,
 as   is   assumed     to       be   the   case

physicists, resulted from them.         But     appears that electrical

German silver a deflection of 300 millimetres was obtained on
warming the junction with the hand. In this case the distance
of the mirror from the scale was about 2+ metres. In com
mencing operations each of the plates, already described,
was covered with a black cloth and left to itself until any
possible deflection of the galvanometer had vanished.             This
precaution was necessary, owing to the fact that, when the
different parts of the apparatus had been recently connected,
differences of temperature had probably arisen, through the
tightening of binding-screws, the warmth of the observer's
body, and other causes.
    As soon as the galvanometer indicated no change for re
versed positions of the commutator, the plate was uncovered,
and was then exposed to diffuse daylight, when a small deflec
tion was sometimes observable.         This deflection immediately
increased when the metallic side of the plate was illuminated
by magnesium-light.         The true deflections, i.e. the semidiffe
rences of the extreme positions of rest of the needle corre
sponding to reversed positions of the commutator, amounted,
when magnesium-light was employed, to from one to four
millimetres.     After exhibiting this phenomenon, each plate
was then warmed by means of a spirit-lamp at the junction
of the two metals, and a deflection was thereby produced
which was invariably opposite in direction to the previous
one, and, in general, greater than          The plates were usually

proved that the current generated          thebylight  had always the

have originated within      it.
    Of the five metals here mentioned, nine different combina
 tionsof   two were examined, and several specimens                  of
                                                                  each

334              M. R. Börnstein    on the Influence   of
each consisting of a pair of dissimilar metals, were employed.
The different samples of the same combination were so arranged
that, as far as possible, each of any two particular metals
should sometimes be the upper and sometimes the lower one
at the surface of contact; but the results of the experiments
gave no indication of this producing any difference. The
silver and the platinum, on account of their adherence to the
glass, could only form the lower layer in any combination.
The tenth possible combination, viz. platinum and silver,
could not be prepared.
    On warming the junctions, the thermoelectric series of the
metals under examination was found to be as follows:–
                           +Silver,
                            Platinum,

                            Copper j
                             Aluminium.
In this list the relative positions of the first two metals is
assumed from the results obtained by several other observers.
It was impossible to determine directly the relative behaviour
of silver and platinum.
   Under the influence of luminous radiation these metals
arranged themselves in the reverse order,        viz.:-
                           +Aluminium,
                             Gold,

                             Platinum,
                             Silver.
Here, again, the relative behaviour of platinum and silver
could only be determined by analogy.                                            -
   Some experiments were then made with plates consisting
of one metal only, the construction of these plates being, in
other respects, exactly like that of the previous ones.      In one
such single plate of gold a current was produced on illumina
tion, and a current in the opposite direction on slightly warm
ing   it.   In  this case we may fairly assume, just             as
                                                                 the  in
experiments      of Adams and Day with partially illuminated
pieces  of  selenium, that the substance was not homogeneous,
and therefore behaved like      a combination    ofdifferent metals.
Other   plates,  which consisted    ofsilver only,     or   of
                                                         aluminium

two metals, nothing but a thermoelectric current could be
detected.      This was analogous to the behaviour of illuminated
silver plates, whose electrical resistance increased under the
influence of the entire solar beam, while it diminished under
the influence of particular-coloured rays.
     The phenomena here brought forward might possibly admit
of an explanation analogous to that for thermoelectric cur
rents.    If    these latter owe their origin to the fact that the
 difference of electrical tension at the point of contact of two
 metals is altered by a rise of temperature, then it is quite con
 ceivable that the difference of tension may also be altered by
 the penetration of the luminous rays.

     Ifthe results thus obtained for the five metals silver, pla

 metals in general, then the results of this investigation may
be summed up as follows:—
   In a circuit consisting of two different metals a photoelectric
current is generated whenever the two junctions are earposed to
luminous radiation of different intensities.
    When the same junction is earposed in one case to an increase
of temperature   and in another to a more intense illumination,
the thermoelectric and photoelectric currents respectively gene
rated in these cases are opposed to each other in direction.

without  being treated with sodium. The greater portion
came        below 210°. After repeated fractionation and
           over
removal of the solid matter which separated out on standing,
the main portion of this liquid boiled between 198° and 203°.
  After each fractionation, however, a considerable quantity
of resinous matter remained in the flask; and it was only
when this had been repeatedly removed that it was found pos
sible to distil the liquid entirely below 203°.           It would thus
appear that the liquid contained compounds which became
polymerized by the action of heat alone; in this respect it
agrees with the behaviour noticed in the case of many other
essential oils.      After repeated distillation over sodium, the
fraction which, on the second distillation, boiled below 190°,
was split up, for the most part, into two portions:—a smaller,
boiling from 156° to 158°; and a larger, boiling from 166° to
168°.      During the fractionation a very considerable quantity
of yellowish-red resin was formed, chiefly, it seemed, by the
action of the sodium upon the oil. This resin was decom
posed by agitation with water; the                                oil
                                                obtained was separated,

 fractionating the distillate, solid matter was deposited from
 those fractions which boiled below 220°, but not from the
 higher fractions. After the removal of all matter volatile
 below 240° dark-brown liquid, with distinct green fluores

duced, by the polymerizing action of heat upon the original

158° was fractionated until the greater portion boiled con
stantly at 157° to 157°5 (thermometer surrounded with
vapour, and barometer at 760 millims.).       The liquid so ob

340       Messrs. M. M. Pattison Muir and S. Sugiura on
action of nitrosyl chloride upon this terpene, and to determine
the rotatory power of a column of the liquid.         The action
of nitrosyl chloride is in every respect similar to that ob
served between the same substance and the terpene from
French turpentine oil". The nitroso-derivative, Clo His NO,
forms monoclinic prisms of the same form as those described
by Story Maskelyne in an appendix to the paper of Tilden
referred to:—“The plane ends are replaced by a sort of
pyramid, which makes them look more pointed. In general
appearance the crystals are not unlike dog-tooth sparf.       The
melting-point of the nitroso-derivative is 129°; the alcoholic
solution of this substance is optically inactive. The specific
rotatory power of the sage-terpene is [2]D = —37-3.
   7.  †.   determinations of the optical properties of this
terpene agree very closely with those which have been made
for the terpene from French turpentine-oil (terebenthene).
 Moreover the specific gravity of the sage-terpene is practi
cally identical with that of terebenthene.     Ribant gives the
formula 0-8767–0'0008277 t as expressing the specific gravity
                      jbe
of terebenthene at any temperature, t, below 80°. At 15° the
specific gravity            0.8643. The specific gravity of sage
oil terpene      0.8635
                 is          15°. The boiling-points

*.
terpenes are also almost identical, probably really identical.

   8. About 20 grms, of the terpene      boiling at 157° was
surrounded by a                    and concentrated sulphuric
acid was added drop by drop, the liquid not being allowed to
become warm. A trace of sulphur dioxide was evolved, and a
deep-red semisolid mass was formed. After 24 hours this
was distilled in a current of steam ; the distillate was dried
and fractionated ; the greater portion boiled between 175°
and 178°, and gave the reactions of cymene.        On analysis,
the  following numbers were obtained :—
 0-1885 grim. gave 0:6125 grim.          CO,    and 0.181 grm.        H.0.

  A   small quantity of this cymene was oxidized by chromic
                                         º
liquor; it yielded terephthalic and acetic acids.
   About 7 per cent of cymene was obtained from                            the
terpene.
   9. Twelve grims. of the terpene, placed in a flask sur
rounded with snow and salt, was                    to the action of
bromine, added drop by drop                  a  narrow   tube.   The
bromine was      very rapidly   absorbed,  a  hissing   noise  being
produced on the addition of each drop. When no further
absorption appeared to take place, it was found that the liquid
weighed 25 grims.     In order to convert 12 grims. of Clo His
into C10H16   Brº, 14 grims. of bromine (in round numbers) are
required; 13 grims. were used in the foregoing experiment.
The liquid thus obtained was a heavy colourless oil. On sub
mitting it to distillation, torrents of hydrobromic acid were
evolved, and a nearly colourless liquid came over, which,
however, quickly darkened, until of a reddish-brown colour.
On attempting to distil this liquid, it was again decomposed,
yielding hydrobromic acid, a distillate boiling from 175° to
 180°, another and heavier portion boiling from 220° to 240°,
and a considerable quantity of black resin. This process was
repeated several times with the same result; nevertheless
the greater portion of the liquid eventually distilled between
 220° and 240°.     That fraction which boiled between 175° and
180° gave      all
                the qualitative reactions for cymene;            oxi  on
dation,    yielded terephthalic acid.

 157° was subjected to the action of two litres of boiling
 chromic liquor, containing 10 per cent. of potassium dichro
 mate, and sulphuric acid sufficient to saturate the bases

    Wright f has shown that the terpene from orange-peel oil,

sulphuric acid and distilled in steam, nor does it yield a trace

   The following are the results of a vapour-density deter
 mination of this liquid:—
   Height of barometer =758 millims.
   Temperature of air = 18°.
   Height of mercury column in barometer-tube =511 millims.
   Temperature of vapour = 185°.
   Tension of mercury vapour at 185° =12 millims.
   Weight of mercury required to occupy space formerly
     occupied by vapour = 874.7 grams.
   Temperature of mercury = 20°.
   Hence, volume of vapour = 64-61 cubic centims.
   Weight of liquid =0.0804 gram.
   Weight of volune of hydrogen equal to volume of vapour
     under same conditions of temperature and pressure =
     0.001129 gram.

       Hence, specific refractive energy =0.0522, and

                                  specific rotatory power of the terpene
boiling at 167° to 168° is [a]p=–19-9.
    14. The results of the vapour-density determination detailed
in paragraph 11 led us to look on the presence of a small
 quantity of a higher-boiling liquid in this terpene (C15 Hz,”)
as probable.      It might be supposed that the liquid boiling at
 167° to 168° is really a mixture of the terpene of lower
boiling-point with about 4 per cent. of a terpene of the type
 C15 Hz, (paragraph       11). Such a mixture—assuming the
 C15 Hz, terpene to have a specific gravity of 0.915, which is
about the mean of the densities of terpenes of this formula
as determined by Gladstone, and assuming that no condensa
tion of volume occurred through mixing the two liquids—
 would have a specific gravity                 f
                                        about 0.865 at 15°; but the
 liquid boiling at 167° to 168° has a specific gravity of
 0-8866 at 15°. The assumption that this liquid is a mixture
 of the 157°terpene and such an amount of a Cls H2, terpene
as would be in keeping with the result of the vapour-density
determination, is therefore not borne out by the actual specific
 gravity of the liquid.     We are rather inclined to believe that
 sage-oil contains two terpenes of the formula Cio His, differing
 in physical properties, and perhaps a small quantity of a ter
         !.
pene of higher molecular weight.
    The physical as well as the chemical properties of the
terpene            at 157° leave little doubt of the identity of this
compound       with terebenthene, the terpene obtained from
          oil

   We have not made a vapour-density determination, inas
much as the results of analysis leave little doubt as to the
correctness    of the formula Cio Hig O, and the boiling-point
prevents the supposition that the molecular weight is repre
sented by a multiple of this formula.
   The specific gravity of sage-camphor is greater than that
of common camphor, and less than that of borneol. We do
not consider the actual numbers obtained by us yet suffi
ciently trustworthy for publication.
   After several sublimations sage-camphor melts at 184° to
186°, and boils at 210°.
   This substance crystallizes in monoclinic prisms, ~ P, -m P;
the crystals are generally rounded off on the prism-edges.
   An alcoholic solution of sage-camphor is without action
upon the polarized ray.
   The appearance, smell, and taste of this camphor closely
resemble those of the common variety; sage-camphor, how
ever, has a peculiar sage-like odour, which ordinary camphor
has not.    Sage-camphor is soluble to a very slight extent in
water; it swims upon the surface of water, and exhibits the
peculiar rotatory movements of camphor. It is soluble in
alcohol (from which solution water precipitates it in the form
of white flakes), in chloroform, and in ether. Nitric acid

                     Essential Oil of Sage.                          347
dissolves sage-camphor with the evolution of small quantities
of lower oxides of nitrogen (see paragraph 20). Sulphuric
acid dissolves it with difficulty, and hydrochloric acid only
after continued boiling.
    18. A quantity of sage-camphor was dissolved in chloro
form; an equal quantity of bromine was gradually added, the
vessel being kept well cooled.         Ileddish-coloured crystals
were almost   immediately   deposited.    The whole was allowed
to stand over sulphuric acid in vacuo for 12 hours: when the
vessel was brought into the ordinary atmosphere the crystals
very quickly melted, and hydrobromic acid was evolved in
considerable quantity.      On standing for several days over
sulphuric acid in vacuo, crystals were again formed. On dis
tilling the red liquid very large quantities of hydrobromic acid
were evolved, a camphor-like solid was deposited, and a con
siderable portion of the liquid was resinized.          The solid
camphor-like substance, after several sublimations, melted at
160° to 163°.     A similar substance, having the same melting
 point, was prepared by treating sage-camphor directly with
bromine, washing with caustic soda, and subliming.            The
melting-point of the crystals increased after each sublimation,
until the maximum, 160° to 163°, was attained.         During the
earlier sublimations hydrobromic acid was evolved.
    19. When sage-camphor was distilled in contact with
phosphorus pentasulphide, the greater part of the material
underwent resination, but a small quantity of liquid was
obtained, which, after washing with soda, drying, and frac
tionating, gave the reactions of cymene; on oxidation with
chromic liquor terephthalic acid was produced.
    20. A few grams of sage-camphor was dissolved in about
10 parts of concentrated nitric acid, the liquid was boiled for
30 hours or so, the acid was distilled off; the residual semi
resinous matter was dissolved in hot water; the solution was
boiled down and set aside.      A small quantity of a colourless,
indistinctly crystalline body was obtained. This substance
melted at 172° to 176°.     The quantity at our disposal was too
small, and not sufficiently pure, to allow of accurate analyses
being made ; the numbers which we did obtain agreed as
closely as could be expected with those required by the formula
 for camphoric acid –Cio His O.
    21. Sage-camphor is almost certainly an isomer of common
 camphor;   its melting-point, boiling-point, and other physical
properties, however,   as   also the difference of   its behaviour
towards bromine, prevent      us  from believing that      itiden
                                                                is
tical with common camphor.

 allow us to enter into theoretical discussions concerning the
 structural formula of camphor and the substances related to it;
 nor can we venture to make any generalizations concerning
 the members of the terpene group.       Both of these subjects
 are of much interest.    We purpose to prepare much larger
 quantities of the terpenes, salviol, and sage-camphor, and to
 determine the physical and chemical properties of these bodies,
 combining this investigation with a research into the consti
 tution of the camphors in general.
    We take this opportunity of again returning our best
 thanks to Drs. Gladstone and Tilden for their kindness in
 examing the optical and other properties of the two sage
 terpenes.
 XLVII.         On   the    Lower Limit of               the      Prismatic Spectrum, with
       especial reference to some Observations                        of Sir John Herschel.
     By       Lord RAYLEIGH,           F.R.S."
 A*        theoretical investigations into the laws of dispersion
         have led to the conclusion that, as the wave-length of
 light increases, the refractive index for a given substance ap
 proaches a finite limit, below which it cannot pass. According
 to Cauchy, the refractive index (a) can be expressed approxi
 mately as the sum of two terms; of which the first is constant
 and coincident with the limiting value just spoken                 while                     of,
 the second varies inversely                             the wave-length  of

duly dilated.         In order to obtain a map independent of any
particular setting of the prism, it is necessary to readjust
to minimum deviation for each ray that is observed.                           But
even this map depends upon the refracting-angle.
    The best representation of the prismatic spectrum for theo
retical purposes is one in which the position of a fixed line
measures               its

    Another method, also discovered by Herschel, depends upon
the use of papers prepared with red prussiate of potash and
perchloride of iron. The mixed solution (which, if the salts
are pure, is at first free from green or blue precipitate) is washed
over paper under the influence of the spectrum. The thermal
rays manifest themselves by a brown coloration, which after
wards changes to blue. The action of the blue and violet rays
is purely photographic, and produces at once the deposit of

                                 of the thermal spectrum “as far as
8, with even some trace of e” ".
    Notwithstanding this concurrence of evidence, there is great
difficulty in accepting Herschel's result. The heat-spots 6 and
e are decidedly beyond the position at which dispersion should
cease; and it is doubtful whether there should be thermal effect
even so far down as y.         I  have examined one of Herschel's
spectraf in which the positions of the fixed lines are indicated,
and find for the limit of refrangibility a position close to the
spot y; but the data are hardly precise enough for more than
a rough estimate.
    Wishing, if possible, to find the explanation of the discre
          I
pancy, have made many attempts to repeat Herschel's expe
riments, but without obtaining any evidence of thermal action
 nearly so low down in the spectrum as that recorded by him.
 The sun's rays were reflected horizontally by a silver-on-glass
 mirror, or by a piece of common looking-glass, into a darkened
 room, where they fell upon the prism. In order to obtain a
 spectrum of about the same purity as Herschel's,         I generally
 employed a bisulphide-of-carbon prism of 60°, giving a beam
 containing about three square inches of light. The prism was
 placed in such a position as to give minimum deviation for the
 extreme red. To collect the rays various lenses were tried,       in
 cluding a single lens of 24 inches focus and a photographic por
 trait-lens of about 8 inches equivalent focus, the latter of which
 gave an exceedingly intense spectrum.           In some experiments
 a heliostat was employed; and in others the solar image was
 kept nearly in one place by hand. In order to guide the eye,
 the waste light reflected from the first face of the prism may
 be collected to a focus by a suitable lens and thrown upon a
 small hole in a piece of card. Even a small apparent motion
 of the sun will then give rise to a reappearance of light at the

     the Berlin University, I have arrived at the following results.
         1. We cannot maintain any more the distinction which has
     been drawn between the positive and negative lights; nor is
     it probable that the positive discharge is analogous to the
     metallic or electrolytic conduction, as has been stated.      Posi
tº
     tive and negative light are of the same kind; and it is possible
     to connect them by a continuous series of intermediate stages.
     I  retain, however, for the present the name negative light
     for the phenomenon in which the properties which have been
     hitherto supposed to be characteristic of the light at the nega
     tive pole are prominently brought forward.
         I have been able to give, by a suitable experimental disposi

    6. Since              Plücker's time it was believed that, while the ne
gative light sets in magnetic curves in the magnetic field, the
stratified positive light behaves like a solid conductor fixed at
both ends, and is accordingly deflected according to Ampère's
law (Hittorf).                    I
                        have found that the positive light behaves
in the   magnetic   field exactly like the negative light; a smaller
force even is necessary to set the positive light into the curves
than that required to do the same for the negative light.
   In order to show this behaviour of the positive light, it is
only necessary that the vessel containing the gas should have
such a shape and position that                curvature       its

ing as the position of the tube is equatorial or axial. One of
the two arms of this figure is always more or less narrow,
and pressed against the wall of the tube; the other arm is
wide, and in the equatorial position spread out like a sail. This
sheet appears continuous if the discharges are not very strong;
if the discharges are strong, it breaks up into distinct magnetic
curves.        If
             the discharges are very intense the two arms are
separated, and we have the appearance which I have described
in a former communication as the magnetic effect on “thick
sparks” ".
   The inclined bridge between both arms of the figure appears
also in the form of a wide sheet made up of magnetic curves.
The narrow arm joins this bridge to the positive pole, the wide
 arm to the negative pole. If the tube is shifted parallel to
itself, the position of the bridge shifts towards the other side.
    9. The phenomenon just described allows us to convince
ourselves that the magnet can set parts of the positive light
into magnetic curves.               If
                                 the positive pole lies in the line
joining the poles of the magnets, the positive light close to the
pole sets into the lines of magnetic force.        I have also inves
 tigated the green light which appears on the glass under cer
tain circumstances, chiefly round the negative electrode.
    10. I have found that this luminosity of the glass is rather
due to phosphorescence than to fluorescence, as it lasts a good
deal longer than the discharge.         The colour of this light may
even    change    during          its
                              existence,         does  as   itcommon  in      a
 glass, from green towards yellowish red.a
    11. The negative light which produces this phosphorescence
is,   as Hittorf has already assumed, propagated               straight       in
 lines which emanate from the electrode into the          surrounding

few degrees.               If
                  the electrode, for instance, is formed by a
thin wire, the negative light surrounds it in the form of a
spheroid; through the spheroid a small assemblage of cones
may be seen more luminous than the rest. The negative light
extends therefore in straight lines from the electrode, and
 from each element of the electrode, chiefly in a direction near
the normal.           -

discharge are such that the wall surrounding the negative elec
trode shows the phosphorescent light.                  If an additional wire,
not connected with any source of electricity, is introduced
parallel to the electrode,                     its

        14. The stratification
tinuous variation of    forms,   the first and last of which have
little resemblance to each other.        One extreme form repre
sents the stratification as it was first observed, and which is
generally known: it consists of a series of narrow disks of
light separated by small and dark intervals. The other ex
treme form shows long columns of light, the length of which
is sometimes a hundred times that of the former kind; these
long columns follow each other closely ; the beginning of
one and end of the other is chiefly marked by the fact that
the different poles of one stratification have a different                       in
tensity.                                     -
    The two kinds of stratification may appear in the same tube.
The first kind corresponds to the pressure at which the strati
fication first appears on exhausting the tube; the other form
corresponds to the lowest pressures at which the stratification
is still visible. Different gases show also variations in the form
of the stratification which first appear on exhausting the tube.
    15. The brightness of each stratification is not uniform.      It
has a maximum at              its
                           negative pole and decreases towards
the positive pole, quickly      the length

colour. These differences are sometimes not only differences

more than two colours.

  18. Differences in thickness, curvature, mobility, are easily
observed. These differences are strikingly shown by the colour
of the different stratifications. Just as one and the same
stratification may have different colours in different parts, the
different stratifications of the same discharge may vary in
colour.                                     -
   In a tube filled with hydrogen I saw, for instance, the first
stratification blue, the second pink, the third half blue and
                                                         I
half pink. A variation in the pressure, as have said, varies
the colour of each stratification; but each stratification shows
a different variation.
   19.     I
           shall not here enter into various combinations which
may thus be obtained ; but it is clear that the statement
that one and the same gas shows always the same colour if
rendered luminous by the electric discharge is wrong.         The
discharge may show a great variety in colour for the same
gas, even if the cross section of the tube be constant through
out.
    Different spectra must correspond to the different colours,
though in some cases such a difference may only be due to
difference in the relative intensity of the different parts of the
spectra.
    It follows  that for the same gas, the same pressure and cross
 section of the tube, and intensity of discharge, the spectrum
 may yet be different.
    20. One is tempted, of course, to look for the cause of these
 differences in the irregularity of the tube or the impurities.
I  shall give, further on, the proof that the real cause lies deeper,
 and that there is a law regulating these differences.
      Ifwe number each stratification, calling the one next to the

wide.
    27.   I have already mentioned that a continuous transition
may be established from positive to negative light.          This can
be shown in the     following   way.    I have said that a   rapid  di
 minution in the cross section in the direction of the positive
current produces a negative glow at that point.          If in a tube
presenting such rapid changes, the variation in the cross sec
 tion is gradually diminished, so that the tube gradually as
 sumes the shape of a tube of uniform width, the negative
 glow gradually assumes the shape of a positive stratification,
 and the dark space which always forms the boundary to the
 negative glow gradually passes into the dark space which
 separates the different stratification.
     The same result may be obtained with one and the same
 tube by varying the pressure of the gas.         If the variation in
 cross section is not too rapid, the negative glow extending
 from the narrow into the wider part gradually loses the cha
 racteristic properties of the negative glow on exhausting; and,
 finally separating entirely from the narrow part and passing
 into the wider parts, it forms the first positive stratification.
     I may state these results in the following words; but as a
 matter of precaution, I limit the statement to the longer stra
               i.
 tifications, excluding the short and oscillating ones, which can
 not easily be subjected to accurate observation      :-
     Each stratification of the positive glow corresponds to the
 so-called negative glow which surrounds the negative elec
 trode ; the              positive discharge is therefore only a suc
 cession of   negative  glows.
     28. We may also look at the negative glow as a simple
 stratification.
     This new way of looking at the negative light allows us to
 draw many conclusions, especially if we combine with it another
 law.
     29. This law may be stated in the following words:–The
 interval between the ends of two stratifications for a given
 pressure and intensity of discharge depends entirely on the
 number of the stratification as counted either from the pri
 mary or secondary negative pole.         I assume here that the tube
 is of the same width throughout.
     The intervals between the different stratifications need not
 be the same. The interval, for instance, between the negative
 light and negative end of the first positive stratification is
 always larger than the interval between two positive stratifica
 tions, if the tube is of the same width throughout.

   36. Finally, tubes may be prepared in which not only the
whole positive light has disappeared, but also the dark space,
so that only the negative glow remains, which fills the whole
tube. This effect is produced at pressures which are the higher
the shorter the tube is.
   The distance between the stratifications is therefore the
magnitude which chiefly determines the appearance of the
electric discharge.
   37. This magnitude, which was shown to be independent of
the length of the tube, varies not only with the pressure, but
also very much with the dimensions of the tube.                 do not                      I

 were removed to a double distance, the imaginary spherical
 surface described through B with A as a centre, would have
 four times the area; but the area of the molecule B remain
 ing constant, B would therefore only shelter A one fourth the
 amount it did before; and accordingly A would be impelled
 towards B with one fourth the force, the same being true
 of B relatively to A.
    10. It is found that gravity is proportional to mass.              It
 must therefore be assumed that, owing to the porosity of
bodies, or open structure of the molecules, the gravific medium
 (whose particles are extremely minute) can penetrate freely
into the interior of bodies, and thus act upon the internal
 molecules, so that the total effect is proportional (sensibly) to
the number of molecules, or gravity is proportional to mass.
 Of course this could not hold true with an infinite mass; but
it is rigidly demonstrable (by a given degree of porosity)
that it could hold true with as near a degree of approximation
as experience has shown, and even nearer if necessary.                                                         In
dependent physical reasons for inferring this extreme porosity
 or permeability of matter will be given further on.

many mechanical beauties and extreme simplicity as a means
to an end, satisfactory, not only in the absence of any other
conceivable cause, but as affording a perfectly rational con
ception to the mind of the processes by which the effects are
brought about.
   12. The most difficult thing perhaps at first sight is to con
ceive the great permeability or porosity of matter necessary
to this theory. It may be perhaps just noted in passing, that
most truths are strange at first sight, or else it would be com
petent for any one to arrive at them.              think it may be shown    I
that this open structure of matter is a thing in itself probable,
and also distinctly warranted on independent grounds.                     In
architectural and engineering structure generally we do not ob
serve a solid block formation, if may so express              I    but that                      it,
open structure which             essential
                                         is     elasticity and strength.

So    in molecular architecture, we may not expect                   find                          to             a

sary that not less than a certain total of energy should be con
tained in a given volume of the gravific medium, not that
thereby the energy of each particle should necessarily be great.
The energy of each particle (whose sum produces a given total
of energy) would evidently depend on the number of particles
in unit volume. Professor Maxwell assumes that it is “tole
rably certain that N, the number of (gravific) corpuscles which
are at any one time within unit of volume, is small compared
with the value of N for the molecules of ordinary bodies.”
Now we may ask, Is this certain or necessary? for the whole

There may possibly be some who may be inclined to think that
this explanation was somewhat forced, or was warranted only as
explaining that special case, without being independently likely.
I  think that, on considering the subject, it will be found that the
 explanation is in itself           probable on independent grounds.
 Where do we find substances in nature whose elastic rigidity
is the same.      It would be in the highest degree unlikely that
 portions of matter differing so vastly from each other in                                            di
 mensions as a molecule and a gravific particle should have the
 same elastic rigidity.                If
                                the elastic rigidity be not the same,
 it is a strict dynamical fact, not a supposition, that the energy
 of the particle after             its
                              rebound from molecule, though the

total quantity of matter contained in (say a cubic mile) of the
medium might be indefinitely small, and yet the particles                                      in
definitely close together, provided the particles are very
minute.     By a given velocity of the particles of a medium,
the uniformity or steadiness of the pressure exerted against
matter evidently does not depend on the size of the particles,
but on their closeness (which determines the rapidity of suc
cession of the collisions against matter). By a given proximity
of particles, therefore, no consequence how minute they may be
(and therefore how small the quantity of matter composing the
medium), the pressure will remain equally steady.              It follows,
therefore, that a medium may produce all the uniformity of
pressure due to the flow of a continuous fluid, and yet the
quantity of matter composing the medium may be indefinitely
small. Owing to the frequency of the collisions against matter,
due to the close proximity of the particles of the gravific
medium and their high velocity, the pressure exerted by the
medium is so even and regular as to be imperceptible to the
senses, excepting in the effect “gravity.”         The pressure termed
“gravity " due to the motion of the particles of the gravific
medium is no more difficult of realization than the pressure of
the air due to the motion of              its
                                      molecules.     To get true idea            a

application of the theory of functions shows that each unitate,
of the normal kind, must of necessity be an integer; the                                   in
terpretation of symbols points out that the symbol Use is a
perfect representation of “the unitate of the number w to the
base 8,” and that therefore U. 'w is the representation of the
phrase, “any one of the series of numbers whose unitate, to
the base 8, is r.”
   27. Many advantages are gained by the fixedness of whole
numbers, as in unitation, over the variability of the denomina
tion and meaning of remainders to division. The first instance
is treated of in the Philosophical Magazine for July 1873,
p. 40.    By no kind of division could                         i+2857, have been

divided by 9 so as to give 4 as a remainder;                       yet, regarded as
a number which has the same unitate to the base 9 as
the result is

                        arrived at.

   follows:—“The author referred                                                                       of                    of

The results of ‘unitation' may be conveniently applied to the
verification of many numerical operations. The method of
unitation is practically equivalent to the theory of congruen
cies; viz. the equation Use = y would be written w = y (mod 8);
and many of the results are identical with those given by Gauss.”
This statement is different from that contained in the paper (see
Phil. Mag. November 1876, p. 345 et seq.), and it has no
warranty from the author. The original title of the paper was
“On a new Mathematical Function;” in compliance with a
simple request, and considering that the starting-point of the
paper was division-remainders, the author permitted the title
to be altered to “On Division-remainders in Arithmetic.”
The statement in the “Report’ misinterprets the meaning of
the author—inasmuch as the paper was not intended to iden
                                       –
tify the function Usa y with the statement “a divided by 8
leaves remainder y,” but to point out the great distinction be
tween the remainders in arithmetic and the periodic and dis
continuous function Use.       The symbol w = y (mod 8) does
not presuppose any function, but simply expresses a statement
which has for              its
                    basis the division-remainders     obtained by               as
actual  division, and therefore has      part              no
                                              with unitation.

planetary spaces show this preponderance of the lighter ele

case of knowing what is in the interior as well as on the surface,
which we do not know of our own globe; but, on the other hand,
we know little or nothing of the atmosphere which, by analogy
with the other heavenly bodies, we may suppose to surround
each meteoric mass before it mixes with our own air.          The
various known constituents may be classified as follows:–

of such diamonds. Some corroboration of this theory is to be
found in the fact that some meteors contain carbon in the form
of graphite; and the connexion between meteoric streams and
comets seems to be established.

                                        It occurred to me to examine
                                                                   º
whether the volatilized carbon between the points of an electric
light gave out this band spectrum. I                 difficult, though
not impossible, by the aid of Mr. Ladd, to throw this
upon the screen without the overpowering flood of light from
the white-hot points themselves.         A more convenient way of
examining it was to throw the image of the charcoal points
upon the screen in the usual manner, to place my eye in the
intermediate blue, and look at the source of light with a direct
vision spectroscope.      I  thus found that with large battery
power, and the points far removed from one another, there
appeared occasionally a band spectrum, but that generally
it burst forth as a multiplicity of bright lines. When, how
ever, the spark was made about as feeble as possible, there
appeared pretty constantly the three bands closely resembling
those observed in carbon compounds and the heads of comets;
and a measurement of the brightest portion, the least-refran
gible edge of the middle band, confirmed my belief in their
identity*.    While, however, it is possible that the light of the
heads of comets is due to pure vapour of carbon, there seems to
me to be a very serious difficulty in theory.       The luminous gas
in falling back again to the tail would condense into drops of
liquid or solid carbon, which at their first formation must
necessarily pour forth a flood of rays of every refrangibility;
but this is not the case. It seems to me more probable that
the material shining in the heads of comets is of the nature of
carbonic oxide, or of those hydrocarbons which we know are
occluded in many of the iron meteorites, and which could be
easily driven out by any heat, even if they do not form a part
of their atmosphere under ordinary circumstances.
   We thus see that the deductions drawn from the theory that
the solar system was once a great nebulous mass, are borne
 out by the chemical phenomena accessible to us; and this of
course affords another argument in favour of the nebular
theory itself.
   * After reading my paper, I learnt that Captain Abney had previously
made similar observations with the spark of the magneto-electric light.

most students only obtain a firm hold of the principles of Mechanics
gradually, by applying them to particular cases.
   The printing, form, and binding of the volume are such as to
suggest that it is designed as a companion to Mr. Williamson's
Treatises on the Differential and Integral Calculus, which have
been recently noticed in our pages.       We cannot perhaps better
express our sense of its merits than by saying that it is well fitted
for the position it appears to be designed to fill.

it became necessary, with a view to learn how far it bore upon the
subject in hand, to inquire into the nature of a peculiar fact which
was observed by his friend Mr. Gore, and published in the Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society, January 28th, 1869, under the title
of “A Momentary Molecular Change in Iron Wire.”                           In this
communication it was shown that if a strained iron wire were
heated to redness by a voltaic current or other means, on being
allowed to cool, the contraction of cooling was at a certain point,
and for a limited period, arrested by an action of elongation.
   “With wires of iron 0.65 millim. thick (No. 23) and 21.5
centims. long, strained to the extent of ten ounces or more, and
heated to full redness, the phenomenon was clearly developed.                  For
example, the needle of the instrument went with regularity to 18.5
of index-plate; the current was then stopped; the needle instantly
retreated to 17.75, then as quickly advanced to 1975, and then
went slowly and regularly back, but not to zero.                 After shutting
off the source of heat, the wire contracted 0.75 millim., and then
expanded 2 millims., so that it returned 1.25 millim. beyond the
original point of heating, and then resumed                course towards zero, its

might be expected, much lessened, whilst the jerk back is scarcely
affected.    Increasing the tension of the spring, the forward jerk is
correspondingly increased, and the backward jerk diminishes and
can be made to disappear.          Without the spring, an iron wire can
be seen by the naked eye to undergo a momentary contraction
during heating, and a momentary and more palpable elongation
during cooling.
    “All kinds of iron do not exhibit this behaviour; and some show
it in a more or less marked degree.          I have not been able to detect
any change in certain specimens of good soft iron wire; but in
hard iron wire, and notably in steel wire, it is very apparent.
    “The wire, moreover, requires to be raised to a very high tem
perature before the jerk is seen on cooling.                         I
                                                          have not observed
the momentary elongation on cooling when the wire has only been
 heated to a point just beyond that at which it would otherwise occur.
    “During the cooling of the wire it was found that just as it
reached a very dull red heat, a sudden accession of temperature oc
curred, so that it glowed once more with a bright red heat. It
was found that the reheating of the wire occurred simultaneously
 with the momentary elongation.”
    In studying these phenomena it seemed, in the first place, de
 sirable to construct apparatus of much greater delicacy and heating
 power than that used by either of the previous observers, so that, if
possible, the shortening during heating could be shown with the
 same facility as the elongation during cooling.               This has been
 achieved by means of the instrument a sketch of which is given
 with the Charts.       The main idea has been to construct an apparatus
 which would exhibit the phenomena readily without the use of mir
 rors or batteries, and that would admit of experiments being per
 formed either with or without strain.            This latter has been ac
 complished by placing the wire vertically, so as to get rid of                                        all
 drooping when heated.           With apparatus thus constructed, we
 found      nodifficulty      displaying the phenomena

   During    the heating of a wire, when in its commercial state, there
are one expansive and two contractive tendencies exerting their
powers at one and the same time; and conversely, in the act of cool
ing, there are one contractive and two expansive influences at work,
viz.:-ordinary cooling contraction; an expansion which is the oppo
site of the temporary contraction of heating—the cooling-kick ; and
an expansion which is the opposite in nature, but not necessarily.
in amount, of the contraction of heating—crystalline expansion.
In every case the interpretation of the general result depends
upon the accurate estimate of the extent to which these inter
acting forces have modified each other's effects. Thus during the
heating we have a temporary and a permanent contraction, assisting
each other to oppose the dynamical expansion.         In cooling, on the
other   hand,   we have two  expansions,  one of which is temporary and
the other   permanent,   opposing  the  dynamical contraction of cooling.
   It will be desirable to    carefully  define the nature of these re
spective influences, and the terms which will be used to distinguish
them in this research.

the ordinary dilatation produced in bodies generally, by raising
them from a given temperature to a higher one, and which is exactly
counterbalanced by contraction when the original temperature is
regained.      It is proposed to call this kind of contraction “the dy
namical contraction.’
    II. Contraction of Heating.—In the diagrams representing second
 heatings [vide fig. 2] we get the first inkling of the existence of a
 contractive or shortening influence excited by heat simultaneously
with the expansion. In the diagrams of annealed and hardened
 wire [vide figs. 3, 4, 5] this influence becomes more obvious still.
 In these cases it is seen to greatly mask the dynamical expansion.
 This kind of contraction may be also displayed by protracted heating
of the wire, when it exhibits itself at the end of the expansion as
 a slow, continuous contraction of considerable extent [vide fig. 5].
    III.  Temporary Contraction.—This term is applied to the cooling
influence which is excited in the wire during heating, and which,
at a certain point, balances the expansion; for heat being rendered
latent at the same rate as it is being absorbed, produces a stop
(which indicates that the expansion is arrested and balanced) or a
kick (which implies an absolute cooling of the wire from excess of
latency).      The diminution of the rate of expansion, or the actual
shortening produced by this kind of contraction, is of a temporary
character, and must not be confounded with the heat-contraction
which it accompanies.
   These, then, are the phenomena of heating:—
         (1)   Dynamical expansion;
         (2)   Permanent or heat contraction;
         (3)   Temporary contraction (heating-kicks);
         (4)   Stretching; and                     º

         (5)   The influence of oxide.
   We have now to consider what influences are present during
the cooling:—

            slon.
     II.   Permanent Earpansion of cooling.—(Crystalline expansion.)
   III.    Temporary Expansion.—The thermal expansion due to the
reglowing of the wire during cooling.            This is the proximate cause
of the stops and kicks which occur in cooling.              It is evanescent as
an opposing force, and must not be confounded with the permanent
 or crystalline expansion of cooling, of which it is simply the effect.
    We have, then, in cooling:—
          (1) Dynamical contraction ;
          (2) Permanent expansion of cooling;
          (3) Temporary expansion (cooling-kicks); and to              these may
                  be  added

     An extended study of these various conditions has led to the
elucidation of the nature of hardening, softening, tempering, an
nealing, &c. of iron and steel, and has further shown that nu
merical values may be assigned to these states.
   In brief, the research establishes:—
   1. The existence in steel, and in iron containing free carbon, of
a contraction or shortening which is excited by heat, and which pro
ceeds simultaneously with the dynamical expansion and masks                                                          its

   A concentrated solution of davyum chloride gives, with potassic
sulphocyanide, a red precipitate which, slowly cooled, produces
large red crystals.    If the same precipitate is calcined, the davyum
sulphocyanide takes the form of a black powder.          These reactions
show that this salt is allotropic.
   The chloride is very soluble in water, alcohol, and ether; but
the crystals of this salt are not deliquescent.       Calcined, the salt
gives as residue the monoxide.        The chloride of davyum forms
double salts with the chlorides of potassium and ammonium ; they
are insoluble in water, and highly soluble in absolute alcohol. The
double salt of sodium and davyum is almost insoluble in water and
in alcohol; this reaction is characteristic, because several sodic
salts of the platinum group are highly soluble in water.
   This chloride of davyum is the only one that exists, as the
second product, containing more chlorine, decomposes during the
   I
evaporation of the solution, liberating chlorine.
      have made some new researches upon the density of cast
davyum ; three experiments gave the following numbers—9:388,
9-387, 9-392 at 24°C.
   These results agree very closely with those of my first trials:
the density given in my first Note was 9:385 at 25°.
   M. Alexejeff, engineer, has undertaken the determination of the
equivalent of davyum; but as the quantity of the metal which                I
possess is very trifling, accurate results are very difficult to obtain.
Some preliminary experiments have shown that the equivalent is
above 100, and probably not far from 150–154.
   An additional quantity of platiniferous sand which will be placed
at our disposal will give a sufficient supply of the new metal for
fresh experiments; we expect to have, in a little time, about 1-2
gramme of davyum.—Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences,

           ON THE FLUORESCENCE  OF THE LIVING RETINA.
            BY M. WON BEZOLD ANI) DR. G. ENGELHARDT.
  Studies on the laws of colour-mixture, some years since, sug
gested to one of us the question whether the fluorescence observed
by Helmholtz", and afterwards by Setschenow f, in the dead retina
could not also be demonstrated in the living structure.     Experi
ments made at that   time, however, gave no  result, but rather led
to the conviction that the solution of this problem would be possible
only in conjunction with an ophthalmologist.
   Interest in this subject was awakened afresh by the path-opening
discoveries of Boll and Kühne, since through them                inferences             all
from the dead      the living retina must appear

which are conditioned partly by the absorption-phenomena of the
blood, and in part by fluorescence.        The aspect of this picture is
extremely beautiful.       While the retinal background shows the
picture of the spectrum in the usual manner, the vessels stand out
in very various colouring: shown upon the red background only
by a somewhat intenser tint, in the orange almost absolutely un
recognizable, they appear in the green deep black in wonderfully
sharp outline, but in the blue in a dark brown-yellow tint, which
becomes in the violet a dark red-brown.          In the orange they are
so feebly prominent that one might think they were filled with
water, while, on the contrary, at the commencement of the green
they become suddenly as black as if they contained ink; and this
leap from the one into the other tint takes place in such a striking
manner that they appear almost as if cut off.          As is well known,
in   feebly luminous   spectra    pure  yellow  is not perceptible; we
know, however, from experiments on the absorption of blood that
it commences in the region of Fraunhofer's line D, and, indeed, a
little preceding                it,
                         follows from the fact that the vessels when

impression".          Moreover fluorescence-light issuing from parts of
the eye situated in front of the vessels of the retina could not but
make itself perceptible, even in viewing Purkinje's figure in mono
chromatic illumination—which, according to our observations, is
not the case.
    The peculiar brown and red-brown colouring of the retina-vessels
in the blue and violet parts of the spectrum, can consequently be
explained only by fluorescence of the retina situated behind them ;
indeed the commencement of it must be sought in the same place
 in which it was found by Helmholtz in the dead retina.
     Although, according to what has just been said, the fluorescence
 of the living retina has already been proved by this one experiment,
 yet we were not willing to rest satisfied with this, but to pursue
 the matter still further in different directions, in order thus to
 procure further material of proof. In the first place we endeavoured
 to imitate the phenomena seen upon the retina; for we brought a
 capillary tube filled with blood-solution before a spectrum projected
 upon a surface.         Here also exactly the same phenomena were seen
 in the   red,  orange,   yellow, and green, in the blue and violet like
 wise when the screen fluoresced in these colours.                 It is true that
 here the    slightest   trace of fluorescence is      perceived,    so that even
 white paper permits it to be distinctly recognized; and the colour
  of the tube before such a screen reminded one, in                  parts,        all
                                                                                 the               of
  blood-vessels on the retina; that here, however, we had                    fact             in         to
  deal with the light             of

 was strikingly shown                 by
                                this—that the brown and reddish colouring
 of   the capillary tube totally vanished when the screen was removed
 so   that the black space             of
                                  the dark room served           background, and

the objection that in this way a perfectly pure spectrum is with
difficulty obtained. It almost needs a lucky accident for the posi
tion of the lenses and the accommodation of the eyes to cooperate
so favourably that the eye observed sees distinctly the Fraunhofer's
lines at the same instant in which the observer has the background
of the eye sharply before him. Now, although a slight deviation
from perfect purity cannot do much harm when the blood-vessels
are made use of as a criterion of fluorescence, and consequently the
mere superficial judgment of the observer is enough for the attain
ment of sufficient purity, yet it was still desirable to entirely
obviate the objection mentioned.           This was done in the following
in anner :—
    By means of a large, powerfully dispersing, direct-vision prism,
a  spectrum     was projected of 40–50 centims. length. . The observer
now     repaired   to the region of the image-plane, and caught with

in the behaviour of air and hydrogen, apart from the greater

(equal volumes of which, at the same pressure, have the same
specific heat) possessed also equal thermal conductivity and
equal diathermancy.

               and Diathermancy of          Air   and Hydrogen.          403
mometer fixed in a horizontal position.         The upper vessel is
filled with boiling water, which, during the experiment, is kept
in ebullition by the introduction of steam. To keep the sur
rounding medium at as constant a temperature as possible,
the apparatus is placed in a beaker, and this again in a second
beaker filled with water of a constant temperature to the height
of the boiling water in the inner vessel.
    In order to diminish radiation as far as possible, a cork disk,
or a thin silvered copper plate, was placed as a screen above
the bulb of the thermometer. But the desired object was very
imperfectly attained in this way; for the thermometer stood
8 degrees higher than that indicating the temperature of the
water in the outer beaker, even when the air was almost en
tirely exhausted.     On allowing air to enter, this rise of tem
perature diminished more and more with the increase of pres
sure, thus proving that, as in solid and liquid bodies, the heat
                                            .
rays are partially absorbed by their passage through air.
Conductive motion, if such existed, was masked by the stronger
effect of radiation.
    Similar results were obtained by Magnus with a great
number of other gases investigated by him. With hydrogen,
on the contrary, he found that the temperature increases with
the increase of density; and even at ordinary atmospheric
pressure it has a greater diathermancy than a vacuum.
    It was more especially on account of this behaviour that
Magnus inferred the similarity of hydrogen to the metals as
regards the conducting-power.
    A more minute and careful investigation of the above method
led me, however, to a different                    and eventually to
a renewed experimental investigation.
    My apparatus is similar to that used by Magnus, with such
alterations as seemed to me appropriate.         My object being to
study the conductive power of gases, other influences being
excluded (such as the effect of radiating heat &c.), a brass
cylinder, instead of that of glass in Magnus's apparatus, was
cemented air-tight upon the glass vessel.        The bottom of the
cylinder facing the thermometer is a polished clean metallic
surface; a double wall surrounds                it,

       º         Prof. H. Buff on the Thermal Conductivity
 lims. below the metal plate. The two exterior ends of the
 wires, near each other but well insulated, are connected b
 means of copper wires with an astatic galvanometer.
 are                by a thick covering of cotton-wool to protect
 them against sudden alterations of temperature.
     The substitution of a thermoelectric pile for the mercurial
 thermometer has in the first place, like the metal plates of the
 brass cylinder, the object of diminishing the influence of ra
                                                                     Bo
 diation; but, besides that, it is more sensitive to thermal influ
 ences than the latter, on account of the adjustment of the sol
 dered junction.
     In the first experiments a strip of silver was placed above
 the soldered junction as a screen to protect it from radiation ;
 but in later experiments, on finding this precaution super
 fluous, it was removed.       Magnus had found that the advan
 tage he had expected to derive from the use of the screen was
 more than counterbalanced by the screen itself becoming warm
 and communicating heat to the sides of the vessel. This                                         I
 found to be the case in my experiments also.
     The whole apparatus is surrounded by a wider glass cylinder,
 the ground edge of which fits onto the plate of the air-pump.
 The space between this outer cylinder and the apparatus can
 therefore be filled with cold water. I, however, like Magnus,
 did not at first use the cooling arrangement.
    The very first experiments
                                                ...;
                                              a source of error, which
 had to be eliminated. The hot water in the brass cylinder not
 only heated the junction of the thermoelectric pile and the air
 surrounding          it,
                     but also, very probably             higher degree,

                                                                      a

                                     in                                                        to

  It       thus evident that current            gas ascends along the

  I had observed     that, if the hot liquid in the brass vessel was
allowed to cool     freely,  the astatic needle nevertheless after
some time assumed a maximum deflection, indicating a state
of equilibrium between the influx and loss of heat. It is
known that tolerably strong deflections of the needle of a
highly sensitive galvanometer correspond to but slight altera
                                                                       º

    Air  as well as hydrogen, before being introduced into the
apparatus, was passed slowly                              40 centims. long,
filled with well-dried calcium         chloride;    and a beaker filled wit
calcium chloride was placed in the glass cylinder.
    The results of these experiments are, as far as hydrogen is
concerned, the same as those obtained by Magnus, viz. that
the denser hydrogen is more diathermanous than the rarefied.
Air, however, shows the same property, the cause of which
becomes clear on studying the course of the experiments.
    After the greatest deflection of the needle had been reached,
it remained almost constant for 30 minutes or more, although
the temperature of the hot water continually decreased.                   The
decreasing supply of heat from this source had therefore to be
made up in some other way. By suddenly cooling the contents
of the brass vessel by means of ice, the influence on the needle
was perceptible only after the lapse of several minutes. Evi
dently the temperature of the junction had become more and
more dependent on the thermal condition of the sides of the
cylinder.        Inasmuch as the conductivity of glass is not great,
it is  easily    conceivable how the temperature of those parts of
the cylinder at a distance from the heating vessel continued
to rise, although the temperature of the water had already
considerably decreased.           Under these conditions the thermo
meter must have received numerous heat-rays from the sides
of the cylinder, and upward currents of gases must have been
produced whenever the glass cylinder was filled with gas.
    The results of the experiment must therefore remain doubt
ful as long as no care is taken to prevent the heating of the
walls of the vessel intended to receive the thermopile.

    In the subsequent experiments, the annular space between
the inner and outer glass cylinder was filled with water, at the
temperature of the room, up to within 7 millims. of the bottom
of the brass vessel.
   The effect of this alteration became at once apparent: the
deflections of the needle became less; and the maximum effect
was more quickly attained. I give as illustration of this the
following series of experiments:—

   A  comparison of the two Tables shows that the effects upon
the junction  were somewhat greater on the removal of the
screen, but they did not alter essentially.   Since the screen
ºj
appeared thus superfluous, and might even have disturbed the
uniformity of the experiments, it was henceforth emitted.
   The propagation of heat in air, which at first had exceeded
 that in vacuum, upon cooling by water considerably fell below
 the latter. Now, since the thermal motion in strongly rarefied
 air could essentially be caused only by radiation, it follows
 that air of atmospheric density must exercise a considerable
 absorptive power on such rays as have proceeded from a source
 of moderate temperature. }. the first experiments, when no
                was used, this property of air must have been
 concealed by the upward currents, conveying heat to the
soldered junction.     But the same disturbing influence must
have manifested itself in the experiments with hydrogen, and
favoured the passage of heat through this gas, independently
of   its
       supposed conductivity.
   The last two series       experiments likewise show, notwith

                 seemed unavoidable under these circumstances,
                  in the mobile hydrogen, and as thus there was
                    to suppose that these currents were the only
cause of the greater thermal motion of hydrogen, it appeared
indispensable to maintain a constant change of the cooling
water. This was done by drawing off the water by means of
a siphon from the upper part of the annular space, whilst at
the same time cold water was introduced at the bottom. By
this arrangement the temperature of the cooling-water was
             so uniform that it did not change more than 0:1
to 0:2 degree in the course of an observation.
   In addition to this, the soldered junction of the thermopile
was lowered from 23 to 45 millims. below the bottom of the
                                                              and Hydrogen.

as by the cooling-water, the possibility of the glass becoming
warm down to the level of the soldered junction was consi
 derably diminished.

410         Prof. H. Buff on the Thermal Conductivity
   True, what we speak of as a vacuum is not absolutely free
                                      º'.
from gas; when compared with a perfect vacuum the diather
mancy of hydrogen may                   be less.    This seems even
beyond doubt; for it would be impossible to raise the tempe
rature of hydrogen if this gas did not possess any absorptive
capacity for heat.
      e preceding remarks, as already stated, are not meant to
deny that hydrogen possesses a certain degree of thermal con
ductivity, but to show that this conductivity is too small to
become distinctly apparent—i.e. beyond the limits of the
errors of observation in the experiments performed by Magnus
and repeated by myself.
   The numerical results given in Magnus's paper” exhibit,
therefore, not the differences in conductivity of the various
gases, but in diathermancy, greatly affected though by dis
turbing influences. This is especially the case for air and
hydrogen, the figures of which are too                      fift
                                                 in comparison with
the average value found for vacuum. In this manner the
supposition must have originated, that hydrogen possesses a
conductivity similar to that of the metals.
   Proceeding from this supposed property of hydrogen, Mag
nus thought he had found the key to                     |.

1.5 millim. tension the average value was                                       =434.         Thus
half of the rays of low refrangibility entering dry air of atmo
i.
spheric density are absorbed by those layers which are nearest
     sources          of heat.
   With decreasing density the diathermancy increases.                     But
the experiments 9 to 15 of the Table show that the increase is
not inversely proportional to the tension of the air, but takes

source of heat, I have not yet been able experimentally to de
termine.    Glass cylinders of larger diameter would be neces
sary in order to have the cooling-water more distant from
the junction of the thermopile.     These experiments, though
unsuccessful, have,         I
                       think, shown why the results obtained by
other observers, whose names alone are sufficient guarantees
for the correctness of their statements, differ so very widely
from those obtained by me.
   According to the first observations made by Magnus, dry air
absorbs 18 per cent. of the heat-rays proceeding from a dark
source".    But it has already been pointed out that sources of
error sufficient to account for such differences were not taken
into consideration in his method.       His thermometer, parti
cularly, was not sufficiently protected from currents of warm
all",
    Magnus himself does not seem to have placed much confi
dence in those experiments, as far as they had reference to
the diathermancy of different gases; for in a second series of
experiments f, undertaken with the view of investigating the
diathermancy of gases, his apparatus was essentially altered :
for the mercury thermometer, as described in his memoir,
a thermoelectric pile was substituted.         This was placed in
a glass cylinder 175 millims. in height by 100 millims. in
width, and surrounded by water of constant temperature.
The source of heat was at least 200 millims. above the face of
the pile ; and the rays before reaching the face had to pass
through a narrow          nnel of only 24 millims. width.    With
this apparatus Magnus found that the air absorbed only 11
per cent. of the incident rays.
    Here there could be no possibility of a disturbance from air
currents; but other difficulties presented themselves.        The
thermopile, whose bars were only 30 millims. long, was wholly
within the vessel for the reception of the gases; one face was
turned towards the source of heat; the other was fixed to the
plate of an air-pump by means of a cork, into which the lower
end of the cylindrical casing penetrated for a short distance.
This arrangement prevented, or at least impeded, a free circu
 lation of the gases around the lower face of the pile.
    It is probable that, as the experiment lasted several minutes,
 the heat received by the blackened front face of the pile was
 soon propagated to the lower face (where, as already stated,
the elimination of heat was greatly impeded), and very soon
 raised  itstemperature above             É.

two faces of the pile became incompletely developed, the de
flections of the needle being indeed greatest in those cases in
which the rays passed most directly to the pile, i. e. when they
traversed a vacuum or hydrogen.           And such behaviour is
clearly shown in the experiments.
    A still more important source of error lay in the consider
able distance of the source of heat from the thermopile as
compared with the small diameter of the glass cylinder.
    Almost simultaneously with Magnus, Tyndall published a
comprehensive memoir on the diathermancy of gases and va
pours". His method differs essentially from that first adopted
by Magnus, in that the rays had to pass through a polished
plate of rock-salt before they reached the vessel containing
the gas under investigation.       This vessel consisted of a hori
zontally placed metal tube 4 feet in length, polished inter
nally and hermetically closed at both ends by plates of rock
             :
salt. The heat-rays emanating from a Leslie's cube at a dis
tance of 8 inches, after passing through the air, entered the
tube through one of the rock-salt plates, issued again by the
second,         having traversed a second layer of air, fell upon
the conical reflector of a thermopile.
    By this method              all

 diathermanous; and it was perfectly justifiable to trust such an
 authority.     But Melloni was not aware that air absorbs a con
 siderable proportion of heat-rays: he, indeed, regarded it as
diathermanous, because he had observed that rays, after once
entering air, lose nothing after traversing a distance of several
metres.       He never compared the diathermancy of air with
that of a   vacuum,   nor did he try to send rays from a vacuum
into rock-salt.     Thus it might easily occur that rock-salt,
though it allowed                    all

  In   the first three experiments the air in the glass cylinder
was of atmospheric density, in the last three it was greatly
rarefied. Of about 100 rays which passed through the rarefied
space and the rock-salt, only about 83 were transmitted through
the denser air.
   The thermal colours of the two substances are not perfectly
alike, but sufficiently similar to explain the phenomena ob

   Tyndall determined the absorptive capacity of dry air from
the very small alteration caused by filling the previously ex
hausted tube of 4 feet length with dry air.        After what has
been stated it will not be surprising that other gases, such as
moist air and olefiant gas, possessing other thermal colours,

                                             But such differences
do not prove a greater absorptive power of the respective
gases, as Tyndall supposed, but, in the first instance, a difference
only in their thermal colours.
     n comparing the small effect of dry air upon the needle
with the greater one produced by moist air, as resulting from
his mode of observation, Tyndall arrived at the remarkable
conclusion that the thermal absorption of the latter is from 20
to 40 times as great as that of the former. This conclusion
                    º
was called in question by Magnus, who had found in his ex
periments with         and moist air, when not using a plate of
rock-salt, that the difference in their absorptive powers for rays
of the temperature of boiling water is very small, though that
of moist air is somewhat the greater. Thus originated the well
known controversy between the two scientific men—a contro
versy which excited            all
                            the more interest, inasmuch         both                 as

 the results were so                 different.
    My own observations on the diathermancy of moist air agree
pretty closely with those of Magnus. Unfortunately, the season
 of the year prevented the application of tensions above a tem

bottom of the brass vessel. The numbers obtained are tabu

the latter are the results of a repeated examination.

420          Prof. H. Buff on            the   Thermal Conductivity
  To fill the glass cylinder with aqueous vapour, a small vessel
of water was placed within it; near it a thermometer was
hung, the readings of which are given in brackets in the last
column but one.
   The first two experiments with moist air were made in a
space as highly rarefied as was attainable by means of the                                        air
pump. The manometric numbers indicate therefore the pres–
sure of a mixture of air and water-vapour, in which that of
the former did not exceed 1.5 millim.     After the termination
of these    experiments,  air of 75.7 millims. barometric pressure
 was allowed to enter the space already saturated with vapour.
 The amount of vapour had to be determined from the tempe
 rature indicated by the thermometer.
    It appeared of particular interest to investigate olefiant gas
 according to this method—partly because               specific gravity its
                                                     +j

 the heat-rays than air.

    From these experiments the diathermancy of olefiant gas
appears somewhat higher than that of air. True,                                      I    cannot
warrant the       purity    of the    gas   ;    but   I  believe that         any     possible
admixtures must have tended rather to increase than to dimi
nish the absorption.
    The diathermancy of a hydrogen-vacuum of 1.5 millim. ten
sion may be considered as very closely approximating to that
of an absolute vacuum. The comparable average value of the
numbers for a hydrogen-vacuum gave                            *=454.                 Dividing

                                          am rather inclined to ascribe
this to the very great mobility of the hydrogen molecules.

   Water-vapour in vacuum, however small the quantity, ab
sorbs a considerable amount of heat, in any case more than
air of the same tension; but in air of atmospheric pressure
this                     is not very striking; in other words, rays
which are not absorbed by dry air pass to a great extent also
through moist air.
   Other experimenters have taken more or less active part in
the controversy on the magnitude of the absorptive power of
aqueous vapour for rays of low refrangibility.                  researches       ".
of H. Wild" are particularly deserving of attention.
   Wild studied carefully Tyndall's method, as well as that of
Magnus. The measurements, however, which he communi
ºated were obtained with an apparatus resembling that of
Tyndallf without rock-salt plates. His somewhat altered ar
rangement is well adapted for exhibiting toa large audience the
fact that moist               air
                       absorbs rays from          dark source better than
                                                                       a

fact; for Magnus himself had repeatedly acknowledged the

previously made                 by
                          Tyndall; for both cases the rays, before
entering the spaces saturated with moisture and reaching the
thermopile, had passed for           certain distance through the air
                                               a

absorption           by
                  air, without being able          affect the thermomulto

   As already stated, Wild also submitted Magnus's process                                                    to

   One circumstance           Wild's memoir produced doubts

                         Heat across Layers            of Gas.                           425
 extending the investigation to the second branch of the sub
ject, viz. the transfer of heat which accompanies those mecha
nical actions.
    2. When gas is in contact with a body A at a different
temperature from itself, it is a familiar fact that convection
currents rapidly set in. The first step of the process is the
almost instantaneous formation of that layer which                have             I
called Crookes's    layer—a   layer of the  gas  of varying    density
and temperature, being on one side at the temperature of the
body A, and on the other side at the temperature of the
surrounding gas.        It is because this layer has a different
density from the rest of the gas, and because of the attraction
of the earth, that those streams set in which are called con
vection currents; and accordingly, if the experiment could be
made at a station where there is no gravity, these convection
currents would not arise, although the Crookes's layer would
then also be fully developed.                It
                                      will be convenient to inquire
first what will occur under these simplified conditions, and
afterwards to take into consideration whether any modification
has to be made to allow for the effect of the neighbouring
earth. To give to the problem definiteness and the utmost
simplicity,    f will suppose that a body A at temperature 6,
presents a large flat surface to an atmosphere of gas which is
at a lower temperature 6, and exposed everywhere to a con
stant pressure, but which is uninfluenced by gravity.           Let us
 further regard this gas as a perfect non-conductor of heat.
    3.If  the excess of temperature is supposed to be suddenly
 imparted to A, there will be a brief interval of adjustment
 within the gas, after which the condition of the gas will settle
 down into the state in which the Crookes's layer will have
 been fully formed. The Crookes's layer in this case will ob
 viously consist of a flat stratum of the gas in contact with the
 hot surface of         A;
                       and within this stratum the temperature
                                                                                       61,
 will gradually decrease from within outwards, from                 the
 temperature        of   A,
                       down       6, the temperature
                                        to                    the sur         of
 rounding gas.       This gradual falling-off       the temperature
                                                                  of
 implies   a corresponding gradual augmentation           the density,   of
 since we have    supposed   the  gas        everywhere
                                                  to    be   subjected
 to  the same pressure.        the gas could" admit

   12. But the most decisive experiments were made with the
cylindrical vessel, which was the smallest of the three receivers.
In it the interval between the bulb and the walls of the
vessel was only 2 centims.
   With this vessel the rate of cooling was slower than in the
two larger receivers at all tensions from 760 millims., or the
tension of an atmosphere, down to about 45 millims. This
seems to indicate that the convection currents were impeded
by the form and small size of the cylinder; so that if the                               or
dinates of the parabola Or represent the rate of cooling which
would result from convection in a large vessel, the ordinates
of some lower curve such as Om will represent the rate due
to convection in the cylinder. The observations recorded by
De la Provostaye and Desains enable us to fix the points m, r,
and n, corresponding to the tensions 70, 45, and 15 millims.,
nearly in a horizontal line. They also state that near the ten
sion of 6 millims, the rate of cooling diminished with “exces
sive rapidity,” but that nevertheless at a tension of 2.8 millims.
it still exceeded by a large amount that which presented itself
at the same tension in their largest receiver, and which is re
presented in fig. 2. These statements indicate that the obser
vations, if plotted down, would have given a curve like the
thick line of fig. 4. It is hardly necessary to point out that

ally to a maximum at a certain tension, after which they fall
away to cipher if the exhaustion is continued indefinitely.
This description agrees with the form determined from the
observations and which is plotted down in fig. 5; so that the
comparison, though necessarily very imperfect, lends support,
so far as it goes, to the conclusion that the apparently anoma
lous escape of heat which De la Provostaye and Desains                         in
vestigated was due to penetration.

till they were fully satisfied that the existence of the increased
escape of heat was proved.
    With protoxide of nitrogen (N, O), a gas which has the
same specific gravity as carbonic anhydride, their observations
gave similar results.  Between tensions of 35 millims, and 12
millims. the total rate of cooling remained nearly constant;
and, as in carbonic anhydride, it was slightly increased by
further diminishing the tension from 12 down to 4 millims.

            dotted line of the figure.   The shaded interval between this
            dotted line and the upper line of the figure represents the
            enormous escape of heat to be attributed to the penetration of
            heat across two centimetres of hydrogen.
               16. The observations previously made by Dulong and Petit
            on the rate of cooling in hydrogen come here to our aid. The

            radiation, the rest of the escape of heat within this receiver
            charged with hydrogen was proportional to           whereas in                          p”;

            here dealing, Dulong and Petit supposed to be wholly due to
            convection; but we have now reason to suppose that, when
            the gas was hydrogen, penetration contributed largely to   and                                           it,

    the two curves is due to heat having leaked away by pene
    tration, across even so much as 12 centims. of hydrogen.
    Although we cannot assign the exact position of the dotted

    we can already see the general shape of the shaded space

    millims. the rate of cooling was “much less” than if the hy
    drogen alone had been present.         From this, and from the
    observations plotted down in fig. 8, it follows that the Crookes's

nus, and others, have been attributed to copious conduction of
heat through hydrogen.         May we not           more probability
refer them to the very remarkable power which hydrogen
            of allowing heat to leak away by penetration?
   rom the dynamical theory of gases, it seems improbable that
any gas can possess true conducting-power in a high degree;
and every observer must have been struck by the violence of the
first chilling effect in some of these experiments, and the
unflagging energy with which it is maintained, a promptness
and persistence characteristic of penetration, but quite unlike
the moderate initial effect and diminished subsequent progress
                                                            º
which we should expect from conduction.
    19. One of the most striking of these experiments is that
by Sir William Grove, which exhibits the cooling effect of
hydrogen on a wire rendered incandescent by the                     of
i.
an electric current; and according to the hypothesis here
presented it ought to be possible to repeat this experiment in
ordinary atmospherie air by bringing the incandescent wire
sufficiently close to a cool object.       #.   very instructive ex
            was  proposed   by my    son, Master Gerald Stoney, and
  as been  successfully   performed    by  him. He first passed the
wire through a glass tube drawn out sufficiently thin.            The
effect could then be seen; but it was evanescent, because the
glass became rapidly heated.          No doubt, if the tube had been
surrounded    by  a water  jacket, the experiment might have been
made in this    way  satisfactorily.    But he made it in an equally
permanent form, and with greater ease, by simply bringing the
incandescent wire close to a tin can containing water, to which
the heat leaked away abundantly from the wire when the             in
tervening stratum of air was sufficiently thin.          The effect is
best seen when the wire is of a dull red, on account of the
ease with which the eye detects the difference between dull
           .
red and darkness.       It then becomes conspicuous when the
interval is a   millimetre,  and can be perceived when the         in
terval is considerably more.         In this experiment the can was
at a slightly higher temperature than the room. On this
account,        because a small part of the radiated heat was
reflected back on the wire by the tin, the loss of heat by
radiation was less than when the can was away; moreover
the convection current was enfeebled by being both cooled and
obstructed by the neighbouring obstacle.           Hence the true loss
of heat by penetration must have been in excess of that which
              ..º,
manifested itself.
    20. Another phenomenon which admits of explanation by
the theory            ed here and in my former papers, is one
which is said to            caused the bursting of steam-boilers,

 water. And every one is familiar with them when, in some
 states of the weather, they roll about in numbers on allowing
 water to drip from an oar upon the sea. Recently they were
abundantly produced by splashing the water of a neighbouring
pond; and               f
                took advantage of the opportunity to ascertain
that the conditions required by the hypothesis were fulfilled.
The temperature of the air was about 15°, that of the surface
of the water 184°; and a very dry breeze was blowing, which
so facilitated evaporation from the drops" that they probabl
maintained a temperature as low as 10°, a temperature

    When globules of methylated spirit were formed upon a
beaker nearly full of the same liquid, which was progressively
warmed, it was found that, when the air was still, there was a
particular temperature at which the drops were most persistent.
At this temperature some lasted for as long as twelve or four
teen seconds.     As the temperature rose beyond this point, the
atmosphere of vapour impeded evaporation and the persistence
of the drops became less; but by gently blowing on the sur
face so as to accelerate the evaporation, it was found possible
to keep some of the smaller drops in existence for two or three
minutes f, during which time they very slowly dwindled away
 tillthey were very minute, and then suddenly vanished. When

of any given metals have no influence upon the position of
the lines indicative of the presence of the individual metals.”

 446             Mr.  J. Moser   on the Spectra   of
 ment whose lines we observe is at one time chemically com
bined, and at another in the free state; but these spectra do
           j
not allow us to associate the presence of a distinct compound
with a definite temperature.       If the temperatures at which
observations are made be varied, Kirchhoff's fundamental pro
position forbids us to suppose that the spectra should remain
unaltered.
    But the observation of absorption-spectra enables us, I
believe, to answer the question already proposed, and to
answer it in the affirmative.
    My experiments show that large alterations in the mass of
material and in the temperature are without material influence
upon the absorption-spectra examined by me; hence the dif
ferences          in these spectra cannot be attributed to either
of those causes.
   The question arises, whether absorption-spectra alone, with
out the simultaneous observation of emission-spectra, are suf
ficient to characterize chemical substances.         This question
may, I think, be answered in the affirmative. The molecules
of some substance, iodine for instance, may be regarded as
vibrating so as to give forth light; and at the same time they
may absorb a portion of the white light passing through them;
if the temperature be decreased a point will be reached at
which the vibrations will not be sufficiently rapid to produce
light, but the molecules will nevertheless continue to absorb
light. But it cannot be supposed that at this point Kirchhoff's
fundamental proposition should cease to hold good.
                                              jare
   The following experiments show an analogy between absorp
tion- and emission-spectra: the former behave themselves at
low temperatures analogously with the latter at high tempera
tures; changes in the intensity of the
observable   coincident with changes in mass and in tem
perature.
   The experiments were carried out with iodine, with bromine,
and with nitrogen tetroxide.      I shall first describe those ex
periments in which mass of material underwent variation.
   The apparatus was arranged so that two spectra could be
simultaneously brought into the field of vision. Thalén's ab
sorption-spectrum of iodine served as a scale with which to
            ..º.

       #.     tube 80 millims. in
was filled with bromine vapour;       no liquid bromine was pre
sent at the    ordinary  temperature.     The lines from — 1 near
 D to +23 in the greenish-blue were observable.          The tube
was warmed by means of a Bunsen's lamp: the lines —2, — 3,
 –4, to    -6   became visible; the area of total absorption ad
vanced from the blue end until it reached the line +12.        The
temperature of the bromine was determined by observing the
melting of little pieces of various metals brought into the
tube, to be about 350°. Increasing the temperature had thus
caused the lines from —2 to —6 to become visible.           I have
already stated that increasing the thickness of the bromine
layer also caused lines in the red to appear: I found by actual
experiment that an increase in temperature from 20° to 350°
was equal, in this respect, to increasing the thickness of the
layer from 15 to 16 millims.
   Analogous results were obtained with the spectra of iodine
                                        -
and of nitrogen tetroxide.
   The following observations regarding effects of increased
temperature relate to individual lines in each of the three
spectra examined: these effects were not produced by increa
sing the thickness of the absorbing layer, but only by increasing
the temperature.      The two lines referred to diminished in  in
tensity, and finally disappeared, when the temperature was     in
creased, while the intensity of the neighbouring lines, as also
that of the whole spectrum, was increased.
   Bromine, iodine, and nitrogen tetroxide were warmed in
sealed tubes 80 millims. in length and 15 millims. in width:
the following lines disappeared:—
   (1) In the bromine-spectrum.
      (a) The line +12; the space between 11 and 13 gradu

that Weiss's observations are erroneous.            If  a poor apparatus
be  employed,     the lines   already  mentioned in the spectrum of
nitrogen tetroxide appear to grow thicker when the tempe
rature is raised; the middle of the lines appears to occcupy a
new position.       But if the same experiment be made with a
superior apparatus, it is found that a number of new fine lines
have appeared, and that there has been no real alteration of

the position of the original line.
               so-called “change in the position of the lines” is
thus shown to be a phenomenon exactly similar to that which
occurs when the D line is observed through a good spectro
scope: instead of seeing one line, two become apparent.
       ese observations on absorption-spectra enable us to under
stand how valuable such spectra are in determining the che
mical nature of any substance.           Before, however, we can say
that each and       every   chemical   compound      possesses a charac
teristic  spectrum     .its   own,  it would be necessary for us to
observe a very large number of absorption-spectra.                 Much
remains to be done in this direction.            So far as experiment
goes, we know of no facts which positively contradict the
assertion that for each compound there is a characteristic ab
sorption-spectrum.         The same absorption-spectrum is said to
be common to more than one oxide of chlorine; but we really
know very little concerning the exact composition of these
bodies.                  I
            Although have endeavoured to show that alteration
in  temperature     and in mass of material produces but slight
alteration in absorption-spectra, nevertheless            I must not be
looked on as denying the possibility of several spectra being
  ossessed by one and the same element. The experiments of
  liicker and Hittorf, of Lockyer, &c. show that certain ele
ments do possess more than one spectrum. The spectra ob
tained at low temperatures may probably be regarded as caused
by the molecules of the elements, while those obtained at high
temperatures may be looked on as caused by the atoms.
   A systematic observation of absorption-spectra, with especial
reference to the course of chemical change in solutions, would
certainly be of much assistance in solving some of the problems
of physical chemistry.

THE    proper resistance of an electromagnetic receiving-instru

definite. The authors usually content themselves with saying

thick wire, while on long circuits they should be wound with
fine wire.
   Professor Fleeming Jenkin, in his ‘Electricity and Mag

instrument should not be more than a moderate fraction of the
resistance of the whole circuit.       In a footnote, he adds that
some authority (unnamed) recommends that the resistance

452               Mr. R. S. Brough on                 the best Resistance
certain constant, which may be called the “retardation                      cha
racteristic " of the line, and the expression for which is

                              RC=               log.(3);
where k is the resistance and c the capacity of the line per
mile, and l is the length of the line in miles.
   Now we see that the value of the RC increases as the square
of the length of the line; and since by increasing the resist
ance of the receiving-instrument we virtually increase the
length of the line, it is perfectly obvious that, if we make the
resistance of the receiving-instrument unduly high, we may
increase the value of the RC to such an extent as to impair
the signalling-speed of the line.
   It thus becomes clear that in the case of a very long and
highly insulated line the best resistance for the receiving
instrument, as indicated by the result obtained by examining
the problem under the first aspect only, may be so great as to
retard the speed of signalling.
   I shall here consider only the case of a perfectly insulated
liIne.
   Let l = the length of the line in miles,
       k = resistance per mile in ohms (supposed uniform),
         c                      farads (suposed uniform),
             = capacity per mile in
and   r = the resistance in ohms of the receiving-instrument.
  Then the sensibility of the receiving-instrument is
                             M=        const.     x      Vr
                                                      r-EKl'
   And assuming that the intercalation of the receiving-instru
ment of resistance r in circuit has approximately the same
influence on the signalling-speed as increasing the length of
the line     by       miles, we have
                  %
                                              kc ( l-H   £)
                   RC=                  x

   Now, if it be assumed that the efficiency of the receiving
instrument varies directly as                  its
                                 sensibility, but inversely                 as   its
retardative  influence, then we have the following expression

  LXI.   On a General Theorem respecting Electrical Influence.
                    By Professor R. CLAUSIUs".
    ERTAIN reciprocity-theorems respecting the reciprocal
       influence of two conductors of electricity have already
been  repeatedly   advanced by various authors.       I take leave
to communicate here a very general, and, so far as            know,                                  I
new theorem, from which several of those theorems result as
immediate consequences.
   Given any number whatever of conducting bodies C1, C2, Cs,
&c., which act by way of influence on each other.      These are to
be charged with electricity in two different ways.      In the first
charge     let
            the quantities                 of
                            electricity present upon the individual
bodies be
                                     Qi,            Q.,       Qs, &c.,
and   the levels       of  potential thereby produced                             on   the bodies
                                     W1,            W2,       Vs, &c.;
and   inthe second charge                   let     the quantities            of   electricity and the
potential-levels        be

*        As for the surface-element of the spherical surface, we
can replace it by the product Rºda, if da denotes an ele
ment of the solid angle at the centre of the spherical surface.
Then the factor, on both sides of the equation, with which da
under the integral-symbol is affected is an infinitesimal one of
the order
              k whence it follows that, of both integrals, the part
which refers to the spherical surface, and which is to be taken
according to a from 0 to 4T, is infinitely small and may be
neglected. Consequently the integrals in equation (2) need
only to be referred to the surfaces of the given bodies.

  We cannot from these six equations express A1, A2, B1, B2,
C1,C, in terms of the other four coefficients, because on
comparing the sums of the two sets of equations we get
E=30(A+B+C);        therefore we must seek some simple                                      rit

from which the others may be written down. The simplest
relation that suggests itself arises from adding the three differ
ences A1-A2+ B1–B, + C1-C, ; this is equal to
                 15I,(8*—y”)(y”—a”)(a”—8%)=15P.                                     .   .    (5)

and of wider applicability.

                                  in describing a modification of
Gay-Lussac’s method, says, “In spite of        the improvements              all
which have hitherto been proposed, chemists seem           prefer                                to

         On a Method of Determining Vapour-Densities.                                           463
of   the vapour-density becomes impossible in the case of a
number of bodies.
   It must appear rather surprising that no attempt has been
made to extend to Dumas's method the same artifice which
Hofmann has so successfully applied to that of Gay-Lussac—
namely, to make the determination of the density of the vapour
under diminished pressure.                    I
                                    have made such an attempt, and
                   I
                  have succeeded by very simple arrangements in
                                          :-
believe that
proving that it is possible
   (1) to make a determination of avapour-density by Dumas's
method with less than a gram of the substance;
   (2) to recover without difficulty the greater part of the
substance employed, free from impurity;
   (3) to effect the determination at a temperature which need
never exceed the boiling-point of the substance.
    In the execution of the experiments about to be described,
which were made with bodies whose boiling-points extended
up to 250°, there were needed, in addition to the glass balloon,
a moderately large thick-walled bulb-tube, an aspirator with
a mercury manometer, a thermometer, a barometer, and an
oil-bath—things, therefore, which are hardly wanting in any
laboratory.
    It is scarcely necessary to say any thing with respect to the
glass balloon; for if suitable for Dumas's method, it is equally
applicable to the modified process.          It may conveniently have
a capacity of from 250 cubic centims, to 300 cubic centims.,
although (as the examples show) it may be considerably less.
The neck of the balloon, which should previously be carefully
cleaned and dried, is drawn out to a capillary tube 2 millims. in
diameter, of suitable length, and as thick as possible in           wall.                 its

sealed up is not among the least of the advantages of my mo
dification.  On softening the glass at c by means of the blow
pipe-flame, the capillary tube immediately collapses by the
pressure of the air; and the fine glass threads formed by the
withdrawal of the bulb-tube can easily be melted before the
flame into a bead. The reading-off of the manometer needs
no particular hurry, because   itsheight

visable to make a slight alteration.
    The neck of the carefully cleaned balloon is not to be drawn
 out into a capillary tube, but simply narrowed to the dimen
º
 sions above given, and connected               with the aspirator.
 There is then no danger of the solidifying distillate stopping
 up the neck of the tube, as the solidification can only take
        in that part of the neck of the balloon which is situated
 outside the oil-bath, where the substance can easily be
 again liquefied by means of a spirit-lamp.

     Scarcely any remark is necessary respecting the calcula
 tion. Suffice it to say that, in the reduction of the volume
 from the temperature at which the sealing is made,           take,             I
 instead of the barometric   pressure, the difference between that
 and the reading of the manometer.

   Let us now consider the case in which the system formed of a
tube and a core of steel in the neutral state is magnetized by Elias's
process. If the magnetization is effected at the ordinary tempera
ture, we find that the tube and core, separated from one another,
are magnetized in the same direction; this was verified by M. Jamin
(Comptes 1&ndus, Feb. 15, 1875).             The same result is again ob
tained when the           system   is  magnetized  at a high temperature
(300–400°), and the tube and core separated immediately after the
magnetization is effected ; but when, after having magnetized the
system while hot, we leave the tube and core to cool in contact
with one another, we find, on separating them when quite cold, that
they are generally magnetized in directions the one the inverse of
the other; it is only in a particular case that they are both magne
tized in the same direction.          The sign of the magnetization varies
with the thickness of the tube, the coercive force of the steel, and
the intensity of the current used for developing the magnetization.
   I  have performed a first series of experiments, on tubes whose
thicknesses were {, }, , and 1 millim. ; each of these tubes was 10
millims. in exterior diameter, and about 300 millims. in length.
They had been drawn and manufactured, as well as the cores with
which they were supplied, of steel known in commerce under the
name of “soft Petin-Godet.”
   The following Table contains the results obtained in operating
upon the tube half a millimetre in thickness.

   The numbers in the column marked             I represent the intensities
of the current made use of to effect the       magnetization.      The letters
M and M' designate respectively the values of the magnetisms of
the core and the tube when these are measured immediately after
the magnetization effected before the cooling ; while m and m' de
note the values of the magnetisms of the core and tube respectively,
measured after the cooling of the system.           I regard as positive the
direct magnetization, and as negative the inverse.               I  call direct
magnetization that which would be communicated by the current
at the ordinary temperature, whether to the tube or to the core.
   On inspecting the Table we see that the magnetism m of the core,
at first inverse for the very feeble current I=3-4, becomes direct
when the intensity of the current augments, and that, on the con
trary, the magnetism m' of the tube, direct with the currents 34
and 7-5, becomes inverse for currents of greater intensity.
   These results may be regarded as consequences of a more
simple fact, which         I  have noticed at the commencement of this

470             Intelligence          and Miscellaneous                   Articles.
Note.     In fact, from the preceding Table it follows that the core
and the tube are magnetized in the same direction before the cooling
of the system, that the initial magnetization M' of the tube sur
passes that of the core while the current is feeble, but that the
magnetization M of the core excels that of the tube when the                                              in
tensity of the current passes a certain limit.  Accordingly it is the
magnetism of the core that will be reversed during the cooling, in
the case of feeble currents, and, on the contrary, the magnetism of
the tube that has to undergo reversal in the case of more energetic
currents.
   In regard to the different quantitative ratios which establish
themselves between the two magnetisms M and M', according as
the current is more or less intense, they are easily accounted for
by starting from the principle laid down by M. Jamin, that the
current penetrates to a greater depth the more energetic it                                         is.
   The experiments performed upon the tubes             and millim.         of   3,   #,        1
thickness gave results entirely analogous        those which     have     to                    I

 ON   THE EXACT MEASURE OF THE HEAT OF SOLUTION OF                                      SUL
         PHURIC ACID IN WATER. B.Y. M. CROULLEBOIS.
   The heat produced by the mixture of monohydrated sulphuric
acid with variable quantities of water has been already measured
by divers physicists; but their results present rather great diver
gences.   M. Pfaundler has recently resumed the investigation of
this question, and has represented by a simple formula the quan
tity Q, of heat evolved by 1 molecule of SO, H, when n molecules
of water are added. The formula is
                                  mB
                                       Q.-H.
But the work accomplished       by M. Pfaundler, notwithstanding the
progress realized, is still incomplete; for the preceding formula
does not include the temperature at which the determinations were
effected. Now M. Kirchhoff has shown, long since, that the
thermic effect is intimately connected with the tension of the
vapour of water emitted by the solution, and consequently with
the temperature.      Doubtless it is here that we must seek the ex
planation of the divergent results.       In view of these facts I shall
compare the numbers furnished by M. Pfaundler's formula with
 those which may be deduced from the relation given by M. Kirch
 hoff. This relation can be obtained in several ways, and more
 quickly than it was by the illustrious physicist in his memoir on
 the internal energy of bodies. Here we shall proceed as follows:–
    Consider two states, A and B, of the operative substance.
 the state A an indefinitely small quantity                    º          In
                                                    of water is in presence
 of the acid, at the absolute temperature t; in the state B the same
 quantity is in solution in the acid, at the same temperature.          It is
 possible to pass from one state to the other by two different paths:
 either the solution is effected directly, and the variation of internal
 energy, approacimately equal to the heat evolved, is d6); or else the
 two extreme states can be joined by moving a characteristic point
 upon three isothermal lines.
