                          as a preservation service. Particularly outside of the
                          United States, persons receiving copies should make
                          appropriate efforts to determine the copyright status
                          of the work in their country and use the work accordingly.
                          It is possible that current copyright holders, heirs or
                          the estate of the authors of individual portions of the
                          work, such as illustrations or photographs, assert copyrights
                          over these portions. Depending on the nature of subsequent
                          use that is made, additional rights may need to be obtained
                          independently of anything we can address. The digital

      DEAR SIR,
            been engaged some time since             in investigating
HAYING
   the influences of bodies on each other           in the dark, the
 results of which investigations were published under the title
of “Thermography,”              I
                           then observed many peculiar effects
which led me to believe that magnetic electricity had some                           in
fluence in determining the arrangements of molecules. From
that time until a few days since, the subject has rested with
me without any further research.        Having however put the
subject to the test of experimental examination,        am induced,   I
the results being of great interest, to transmit to you an ac
count of my experiments.      In doing this, I shall, for the pre
sent, confine myself strictly to a description of the arrange
ments used and the results obtained, reserving any theoretical
views for some future period, when by a greater number and
variety of experiments it appears probable some general law
of action may be satisfactorily deduced.
   1. I placed a concentrated solution of nitrate of silver in a
test-tube, against the poles of a permanent horse-shoe magnet,
having another tube containing a similar solution not in con
tact with  it. The crystallization commenced first          the tube       in
connected with the   magnet,  immediately       the   point opposite
                                                               at

                      the metal (Plate     fig. 1);      II.

crystal shot off from this point towards the bottom               the           of
glass, dividing the lower portion        the fluid   of   two   parts.in
Other crystals sprung off from different points above and be
                                                                                B

       II.  On certain Pseudomorphous       Crystals of Quartz.
                   By Robert WERE Fox, Esq.”
I SUBMIT            to the Society's notice some specimens of
      quartz, with pseudomorphous octahedral crystals of the
same substance, which appear to me to possess a sort of              hi
storical interest, or at least to indicate that a succession of
changes must have occurred in the condition of the mineral
vein from which they were taken. They were found by S.
Peters (dealer in minerals) in one of the heaps of vein stones,
at the Consolidated Mines, and I understand were broken from
a copper vein in “killas,” at the depth of about 160 fathoms
below the surface.         He observed that many of the crystals
contained    water,  and he secured some of it for me, by carefully
breaking some of them. This he did mostly in my presence,
and we had considerable difficulty in collecting even very small
portions of the liquid in different phials.       Two of these por
tions were    nearly   tasteless, or saline in a very slight degree,
as far as I could judge from a single drop of each.             In both
common salt was detected, and nothing else in one of the por
tions; but the other, when evaporated, left minute needle
formed crystals, which       I was prevented by an accident from
examining.      The third      portion of water was much more in

muriatic acid. The saline matter in this water (mostly sul

                                     which was not ascertained.

ceive, be accounted for but by supposing the water existing in
the fissures of the earth to have been changed by circulation
from time to time, and to have been charged with different
ingredients at different periods.
     I
     have on former occasions alluded to various causes which
would produce circulation in the subterranean waters, such as
the opening or closing of any portions of fissures; the ascent
of warm and the descent of cooler currents of water, in conse
quence of the differences in their specific gravities; or in some
instances by the pressure of the sea-water acting on the fresh *.
 Nearly two years ago I stated in this room my views in refer
ence to the operation of this latter cause on land springs, and
at the same time I attempted to show the possibility, not to                                              !
say probability, of steam existing in fissures below the water
at a very great depth. I may perhaps be permitted to refer
again to this subject, because it appears to me to be one of
some interest.         I then took it for granted that the tempera
ture of the earth increases in some proportion to the increase
of depth below            its
                          surface, and that       the ratio

gummy substance, having a composition identical with that of
gum-arabic.        This is remarkable, inasmuch as it affords an
instance of what may be called a retrograde chemical action,
the sugar being converted into dextrine,—a change similar
to that which occurs in fruits when they lose their sweetness,
and assume that condition commonly called “sleepy.” The
conversion of cellulose into dextrine and sugar seems to be a
process of continual occurrence and great importance in the
vegetable oeconomy, but we are not aware of any example of
the reverse of this action, except those instances mentioned
above; in the former of which sugar is converted by fermen
tation into a body having                     all
                                       the properties and composition
of  gum;        the
                 in  latter, the  sugar   being changed into cellulose+.

a to

with the velocity of the aether at a, and suppose that                      fis
brought to d in consequence of the difference of velocity of
the aether at a and b.   It is easy to show that      is equal and d<U+017F>
parallel to ce; so that, according to this construction, the nor
mal to the wave ought to be displaced by the motion of the
aether through the angle b d from   f               fö
                                          to d b, which is just the
contrary direction to that given by Prof. Challis's construc
tion.
   Prof. Challis seems to think that the undulatory theory of
light cannot be maintained unless it can be shown that the
law of aberration ought to be the actual law, whatever may
be the motion of the aether. But it is surely sufficient to show
that a conceivable kind of motion exists which would lead to
the observed law of aberration, provided we have no reason
for regarding that sort of motion as improbable.         Now even
                                                                                    i
were I to allow that u da + v dy-H w dºz cannot, in the case of
ordinary fluids, be an exact differential unless the motion is
rectilinear, that would not be a fatal objection. For the equa
tions of motion of fluids commonly employed are formed on
the hypothesis that the mutual action of two elements of the
fluid is normal to the surface which separates them, whereas
one of the most remarkable properties of the aether with which
we are acquainted, is the great tangential force which it is ca
pable of exerting, in consequence of which the transversal
vibrations which constitute light are propagated with such an
immense velocity.

        Philosophical Magazine for August 1834, I published
INathepaper  on the action of water and air on lead. Some of
the principal results contained in it were confirmed by Bons
dorff in two papers; he found that 7000 parts of pure water
free from access of carbonic acid dissolved one of oxide of
lead; my experiments gave Hith to mºnth. Since that time
two papers have appeared on the same subject, one by Dr.
Christisont, and one by Mr. R. Phillips, Jun.       The last
named chemist considers that the oxide of lead is not dis
solved, but merely mechanically suspended in the water, be
cause the liquid is deprived of the lead by passing it through

a paper filter.         It is to this opinion that I propose to direct
  attention in the      present   notice.
     The fact that the aqueous solution of oxide of lead would
  not pass through a filter was noticed by me in the paper                                          al
  ready referred to; but as the action of tests on the liquid was
 just what one observes with solutions; as no time allowed for
 subsidence made any difference in these appearances; as the
 liquid deposited crystals of oxide of lead not only on the lead
 but on other bodies; as when decomposed by the voltaic bat
 tery it gave metallic lead at the negative pole, and peroxide

  Such being the facts, I endeavoured to show, in the case of the
diurnal variations, that the correspondence of the phaenomena of the
temperature and gaseous pressure might be explained, in accord
 ance with principles which had been long and universally admitted
 in the interpretation of other meteorological phaenomena, by the
 suppositions,—of an extension in height and consequent overflow in
 the higher regions of the atmosphere of the column of air over the
 place of observation, during the hours of the day when the surface
 of the earth was gaining heat by radiation,-and of a contraction of
 the column during the hours of diminishing temperature, and conse
 quent reception of the overflow from other portions of the atmo
 sphere, which in their turn had become heated and elongated.
     According to this explanation there should exist, during the hours
 of the day when the temperature is increasing, -1st, an ascending
 current of air at the place of observation, of which the strength
 should be measured by the amount of the increments of temperature
 corresponding to given intervals of time; and 2nd, a lateral influx of
 air at the lower parts of the column, of proportionate velocity, con
 stituting a diurnal variation in the force of the wind at the place of
 observation, which should also correspond with the variations of the
 temperature in the epochs of                          its
                                         maximum and minimum, and inter
 mediate    gradation            of
                            strength.    The anemometrical observations                                         at
 Toronto were shown                              be
                                        agreement with the view which had

26                        Lieut.-Col. Sabine on                     some Points             in
the periodical variations in the temperate zone, and into the se
quence of natural causes and effects, in accordance with which the
annual and diurnal fluctuations of the elastic forces of air and vapour
at the surface of the earth depend on the variations of temperature:
and from these premises it was inferred, that the normal state of the
diurnal variations of the pressures of the air and vapour and of the
force of the wind, in the temperate zone, might be regarded as that
of a single progression with one maximum and one minimum, the
epochs of which should nearly coincide with those of the maximum
and minimum of temperature”.
   That exceptions should be found to this state of things in par
ticular localities in the temperate zone was far from being impro
   * Since this communication was read at Cambridge I have received from M.
Dove a copy of a paper read to the Academy of Berlin, entitled “Ueber die perio
dischen Aenderungen des Druckes der Atmosphäre im Innern der Continente,' in
which the remarkable facts are stated, that at Catherinenbourg and Nertchinsk (on
the mean of several years), and at Barnaoul (in the years 1838 and 1840), the
mean diurnal barometric curve itself exhibits but one maximum and one mini
mum in the twenty-four hours; the maximum coinciding nearly with the coldest,
and the minimum with the hottest hours of the day.             At these stations therefore,
and in the years referred to, the forenoon maximum disappeared, and the barome
tric curve assimilated in character to the curve of the dry air in other places in
the temperate zone.        These stations are situated far in the interior of the greatest
extent of dry land on the surface of our globe, and at a very great distance from an
expanse of water, from whence vapour can be supplied.              The diminished pressure
of the dry air produced by the ascending current and overflow as the temperature
of the day increases, is not therefore compensated by an increased elasticity of
vapour, and the curve of the diurnal variation of the barometer approximates to
the form assumed when the elasticities of the vapour at the several hours of ob
servation are abstracted.         This assimilation in character of the barometric and
(inferred) gaseous curves, which is thus found to take place in cases where, from
natural causes, the influence of the vapour is greatly lessened, appears a confir
mation of the propriety of separating the effects of the elastic forces of the dry
air and vapour in their action on the barometer.
   M. Dove considers that the single progression of the diurnal barometric curve,
which takes place at the three Asiatic stations referred to in this note, is character
istic of a true continental climate. It is, without doubt, characteristic of an ex
treme climate, and as such is highly instructive. There appears reason to doubt
whether an extreme climate of corresponding character exist at                    the tempe      all   in
rate latitudes of the continent of America.

       however, we examine the record           the observations made hourly

bable; it could not be expected that the influences of temperature
should always be so simple and direct as they appeared to be at To
ronto; and a more complex aspect of the phaenomena might parti
cularly be looked for, where a juxtaposition should exist of columns
of air resting on surfaces differently affected by heat (as those of
land and sea), and possessing different retaining and radiating pro
perties. In such localities within the tropics, the well-known regular
occurrence of land and sea breezes for many months of the year
made it obvious that a double progression in the diurnal variation
of the force of the wind must exist, and rendered it highly probable
that a double progression of the gaseous pressure would also be
found.     It was therefore with great pleasure that I received, through
the kindness of Dr. Buist, a copy of the monthly abstracts of the
two-hourly meteorological observations, made under that gentle
man's superintendence at the observatory at Bombay in the year
 1843; accompanied by a copy of his meteorological report for that
year, possessing a particular value, in the full account which it gives
of the periodical variations of the wind, and in the means which it
thereby affords of explaining the diurnal variation of the gaseous
pressure. This pressure presents at Bombay an aspect at first sight
 more complex than at the three above-named stations in the tempe
 rate zone, but I believe it to be equally traceable to variations of the
temperature, and to furnish a probable type of the variations at in
 tertropical stations similarly circumstanced in regard to the vicinity
of the sea.
    The observatory at Bombay is situated on the island of Colabah,
 in N. lat. 18°54' and E. long. 72° 50' at an elevation of thirty-five
 feet above the level of the sea.    In the copy of the observations re
ceived from Dr. Buist, the monthly abstracts are given separately
for each month, of the standard thermometer,-of the wet thermo
meter, and of        depression below the dry, and
                    its                                                 of

      When however we direct our attention to the gaseous pressure, we
   perceive, very distinctly marked, the characters of a double progres
   sion, having one maximum at 10" and another at 22"; one minimum
   at 4" and another at 16". The double progression is exhibited both
   in the clouded and in the clear seasons, with a slight difference
   only in the hours of maxima; the principal maximum in the cloudy
   season being at 20" instead of 22", and the inferior maximum in the
   clear season being at 12" instead of 10". The range of the diurnal
   variation, like that of the temperature, is more than twice as great in
   the clear as in the clouded season, marking distinctly the connexion
   subsisting between the phaenomena of the temperature and of the
   gaseous pressure.

       Ifwe now turn our attention to the phaenomena of the direction
   and force of the wind, we find by Dr. Buist's report, that for 200
   days in the year there is a regular alternation of land and sea breezes.
   The land breeze springs up usually about 10", or between 10" and
   14", blows strongest and freshest towards daybreak, and gradually
   declines until about 22", at which time the direction of the aërial
   currents changes, and there is generally a lull of an hour or an hour
   and a half's duration.     The sea breeze then sets in, the ripple on
   the surface of the water indicating      commencement being first ob
                                                        its
   served close    shore, and extending itself gradually out
                       in                                        sea.  The     to
   sea breeze    freshest from
                    is                4",   2"
                                          and progressively
                                                 to         declines    the            in
   evening hours.

   The diurnal variation in the force of the wind during these 200
days is therefore obviously a double progression, having two maxima
and two minima; one maximum at or near the hottest, and the other
at or near the coldest hour of the day, being the hours when the
difference of temperature is greatest between the columns of air
which rest respectively on the surfaces of land and sea; and two
minima coinciding with the hours, when the surface temperature over
the land and over the sea approaches nearly to an equality.
   In the remaining portion of the year the diurnal range of the tem
perature is most frequently insufficient to produce that alternation
in the direction of the wind, which prevails uninterruptedly during
the larger portion.    There appears however to have been only one
month, viz. July, in the year 1843, in which there were not some
days in which the alternation of land and sea breezes was percep
tible. The causes which produce the alternation are not therefore
wholly inoperative, though the effects are comparatively feeble during
the clouded weather which accompanies the south-west monsoon".

 gaseous pressure, as shown in Plate       we find    minimum       pres

causing the pressure to diminish over the land; it continues to do
so until towards daybreak, when the strength of the land breeze is
greatest, because the air over the land is then coldest in comparison
with that over the sea. As the sun gains in altitude and the tempe
rature of the day advances, the land heats rapidly; the density of
the air over the land and sea returns towards an equality; the land
breeze declines in strength, and the drain from the lower part of the
column ceases to counterbalance the overflow which the land column
is at the same time receiving in the higher regions; the pressure
consequently having attained a second minimum at or near the hour
of the greatest disproportion of temperature, again increases until
the temperature and height of the column over the sea and land are
the same, and the pressure again becomes stationary.             But now the

 verse of what it is in the lower latitudes. It appears from the meteorological ob
 servations made in 1843 by Messrs. Grewe and Cole, and presented to the British
 Association at the York meeting by Dr. Lee, that such is the case at Alten, near
 the north cape of Europe. The barometer and thermometer were observed three
 times a day, from October 1842 to December 1843 inclusive. The hours of ob
 servation were 9 A.M., 3 P.M. and 9 P.M.        No hygrometric observations were
 made, but we are able to infer the approximate tension of the vapour from the
 record of the thermometer. The quarterly means of the barometer and thermo
 meter in 1843 are as follows; the barometer being reduced to the level of the
 sea, and corrected for gravity:-

 this cause the range of the barometric curve during the year is only
0.327 inch, whilst that of the gaseous pressure is 0-650 inch.
    The analogy of the annual and diurnal variations, considered in
 respect to the explanation which has been attempted of the latter,
is too obvious to be dwelt upon. The decreased gaseous pressure
 in the hot season is occasioned by the rarefaction of the air over the
land whilst the sun is in the northern signs, and                   consequent over       its
 flow       the higher regions, producing

      IX.      On   someNew Species of Animal Concretions.
                    By THoMAS TAYLoR, Surgeon.
                           To Richard Taylor, Esq.
     DEAR SIR,
AS      the Catalogue of the Calculi belonging to the Royal
        College of Surgeons has now been published some
months, and there consequently remains no further necessity
for silence, I purpose in the following paper to redeem the
promise    I formerly made, of describing some of the more re
markable of the concretions which have been discovered du
ring the examination of that very large collection; and also
to detail the experimental proofs on which the assertions as
to their composition were founded in the short notice which
you did me the favour of inserting in this Journal in May
1844.
  I do   this the more willingly, as it was considered advisable
to omit the details of the analyses in the Catalogue.      More
over, the Catalogue having but a limited circulation, many of
the new facts that have been elicited would not otherwise be
generally known.      I shall, however, confine myself in this
paper to the notice only of such concretions as are entirely
new, or whose composition has been either imperfectly or      in
correctly described.    For the historical account of the succes
sive steps  by which our present knowledge of these bodies has
been  obtained,  and for the description of the more common
species of calculi, I must refer to the Catalogue itself.
  Urinary Calculus from the Iguana, consisting of Urate of
                                  Potass.
   Small and unimportant quantities of urate of potass may
occasionally be detected in human urinary calculi, but no     in
stance of this salt constituting an entire calculus has hitherto
been described. There are three specimens of this description
in the College collection, which resemble each other in every
respect save in size.  Two of them were described in the MS.
Catalogue of Sir Hans Sloane's collection as “Piedra de
 Yguana,” and there is little doubt but that they were taken from
the urinary bladder of some of the large Iguanas or tree lizards
of South America. The other concretion had no history, but
had been described as “a mixed calculus in which uric acid
predominates.” . Although much larger, it was so similar in
composition and general appearance to the others, that there
does not appear any reason to doubt             its
                                            having    similar ori
                                                      a
gin.  In their external characters these concretions resembled
calculi composed      the mixed phosphates, being made
                       of                                    up   of

              On       some     New Species           of Animal       Concretions.             37
concentric layers of a dirty white colour with a shade of pink.  all
They were of an ovoid figure, but                      them were remark
                                                                 of
able for being flattened               peculiar manner
                                       in    a                 one side.        on
    When heated before the blowpipe they consumed like                                         a
uric acid calculus, but left fusible salt which spread over the
                                             a
platina foil, and tinged the outer flame violet. When heated
in  a  test-tube, carbonate and hydrocyanate                 ammonia with  of
a  little empyreumatic             and water were given off. The car
                                      oil
bonaceous residue, when treated with water, gave                    solution          a
which had         a  strong alkaline reaction, effervesced with acids,
and emitted           slight odour
                       a                         of
                                         prussic acid. Tartaric acid and
chloride          of
                   platina produced         the solution precipitates indi
                                                      in
cative       of
              the   presence          of
                                   potass.
    Water digested upon the powdered calculus afforded so                                  a
lution which deposited small scales               suburate      potass upon
                                                                of               of
being evaporated; the liquor gave                                no
                                                    precipitate with      salt             a
of  lime, consequently                no
                                   soluble oxalate was     present.
    When digested with caustic potass, ammonia was freely
evolved, and the whole dissolved with the exception                     little        of  a
flocculent matter. The alkaline solution, when mixed with
muriatic acid, gave            copious precipitate
                                 a                       uric acid.   of  was             It
therefore evident that these concretions consisted chiefly                                     of
urate    of  potass mixed with urate            ammonia.   of
    The relative       proportion              of
                                        their constituents was estimated
in   the following manner:—

                                                                        212°              at
Fahr., lost 0-32 water,              1.67 per cent. The dried powder
                                       =

some light yellow flocks              animal matter, which amounted
                                            of                                                 to

     The solution from which the above precipitates had been
 separated was evaporated                dryness and the residue heated

was thrown down, which when washed with alcohol and care
fully dried weighed 10:32 grs., = 1.99 PO.
    #.   quantity of ammonia was estimated by boiling the pow
dered calculus in a solution of potass, transmitting the am
monia evolved through diluted muriatic acid, and precipita
ting it in the ordinary manner by chloride of platina.                 11:40
grs. yielded 4:57 of chloride of platina and ammonia,                a   310
per cent.      I    do not, however, place much confidence in this
mode of estimating the ammonia.                 The result of the analysis
of this calculus, calculated in 100 parts, is therefore as follows:
it is compared with an analysis of the calculus which had no
history, in which the quantity of potass is rather greater:-

    By another analysis, in which the quantity of potass was
alone estimated by calcining the                          until nothing but
carbonate of potass was left, and precipitating the dissolved
salt by chloride of platina, 10.72 per cent. of potass was found
in the first, and 13:07 in the second calculus.
    The potass in these concretions is probably derived from
the leaves and other vegetable matter on which the Iguana
partly subsists, while the carnivorous or insectivorous habits
of the reptile are indicated by the large quantity of uric acid
they contain.
 Urinary Calculus from the Sturgeon, consisting of Diphosphate

    These calculi are found by the fishermen of the Caspian
Sea and of the Volga in a species of Sturgeon (Acipenser
Huso, Linn.).            The statements of different authors as to the
situation of the stone in the fish, are very conflicting, some
describing it as occurring in the air-bladder, others in the
head and stomach.             In Schrober's Memorabilia Russico-Asi
atica; as quoted by Klaproth, it is said to be most frequently
found in a small pouch communicating with the pancreatic

40                 Mr. T. Taylor     on some
dilated ureter or from the common cloacal termination          of the
gut of the fish.
   These concretions have generally a flattened oval figure,
their centre being often depressed or slightly concave. They
vary considerably in size, but are usually about that of a hen's
egg. Their surface is unequal but quite smooth, and of a
yellowish-white colour.     When broken they present a highly
crystalline structure, consisting of fine plates or needles ra
diating from the centre to the circumference, but which are
made up of very thin concentric layers adhering firmly toge
ther.    Fragments of these calculi are translucent, and their
interior is of a pure white colour. They are exceedingly
scarce, and are highly esteemed for their supposed medicinal
virtues. Dr. Cook informs us that the powder is highly com
mended as a diuretic and lithontriptic, and that the common
people in the neighbourhood of the Volga take from ten to
sixty grains, scraped fine in a little water, three or four times
a day when the case is dangerous.
   The composition of these calculi was first determined by
Klaproth, but the earliest description of them is to be found
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1748.
   The specimen analysed by Klaproth had been received
from Prof. Pallas.     It weighed above seven ounces troy, and
consisted of albumen 1, water 24, phosphate of lime 71-50,
sulphate of lime 0:50.
   17.13 grs. of one of the specimens in this collection, previ
ously calcined, gave by solution in dilute muriatic acid and
precipitation by oxalate of ammonia, 13.87 grs. of carbonate
of lime, which is = 17:54 of the diphosphate of lime; 100 grs.
of the same calculus gave—
                                          By calculation.
      Water . . . . .          26.33          25°60 = 5 atoms.
      Organic matter . .        0-40            1-13
      Diphosphate of lime.     73-27          73°27    =  1 atom.
                              100'00         100'00
   The Beluga stones therefore consist of an atom of diphos
phate of lime combined with 5 atoms of water. The water is
necessarily over-estimated in the analysis, on account of the
organic matter being partially soluble in the diluted acid.
     y another and more rigid analysis, I found the calculus
to consist of 32.21 CaO, 40.33 POs, and 26-83 HO, which
would give 72.54 per cent. of diphosphate of lime. This cal
culus has also been analysed by Prof. Wöhler, who ascer
tained that four of the five atoms of water are driven off at
392°Fahr., while the last atom is expelled by a red heat.

The phosphoric acid is therefore in the tribasic state, and the
formula of the salt will be PO,2(CaO), HO, +4 aq.        I think
it right to state that the analysis of this concretion had been
printed  some months previous to the publication of Prof.
Wöhler's paper, and        analysis was made  its 1843.                             in

  “The      chemical characters of the constituent of these calculi
agree so exactly with those of ellagic acid procured from the
infusion of gall-nuts, as to leave no doubt of their being com
posed principally of that substance.        When heated they do
not fuse, but emit a slight balsamic odour and partially sub
lime; if more highly heated they catch fire, burn with a low
flame, give off the smell of burning wood, and leave behind a
carbonaceous ash.                 If
                           the powder of the calculus be heated
in a  glass  tube a  yellow   sublimate is produced, which con
denses in the form of     long  spear-shaped crystals of a yellow
colour, with a shade of green. These crystals do not differ
in their chemical habitudes from the powder of the calculus,
and they are identical in shape and appearance with those
procured from the ellagic acid of the gall-nut when similarly
treated.     When the calculus is reduced to powder and dif
fused   through  water, several days elapse before the whole of
the powder is deposited, and the water remains opalescent
even for weeks.     It is also difficult to separate the powder by
filtration, as the liquid passes turbid for some time.
    “Ellagic acid calculi easily dissolve, with the exception of a
few flocks, in a cold solution of caustic potass or soda.     The

Chorasmia.     Tavernier states that they likewise come from a
province of the kingdom of Golconda. The account as to the
exact situation of the stone is however not so clear.      Most
writers indicate the maw or stomach :       Kaempfer  says it is
found in the pylorus, ‘sive production quarti, quem vocant
ventriculi fundus”,” and that the natives are in the habit of
ascertaining how many stones are contained in the stomach
by feeling through the parietes of the abdomen, the value of
the animal being considerably enhanced by their presence.
When recently taken from the animal, they are said to be
somewhat soft, or of the consistence of a hard-boiled egg, and
that in order to preserve them it was customary to place them
in the mouth, and retain them there until they acquired greater
hardness.
   “The Oriental Bezoar was not however confined to the wild
goats, or to the ruminant tribes, as the Pedra Bugia or Ape
stone also consists of ellagic acid.   These concretions were
held in higher esteem than those from the Goat, and were ge
nerally included, for the sake of preserving them, in a small
cavity scooped out of two portions of a very light wood, which
were held together by hoops wove from the twigs of the Ro
tang cane.    There is in the Museum a specimen preserved in
this manner.    Kaempfer informs us that they were found in a
species of ape termed Antar by the Mongols, which he be
lieves to be the Babianum cynocephalum.        The composition
of these concretions renders their origin no  longer a matter of
uncertainty, and confirms, in a very remarkable manner, the
statements of Tavernier and Kaempfer, that they are derived
from the juices of the plants on which the animals fed.”
   MM. Merklein and Wöhler have proposed that the word
ellagic should be changed for that of bezoaric acid, partly be
cause the German word “Gall,” when reversed, is not capable
of being converted into ellagic, and partly from     want      eu        its             of
phony.  If     we
               were however, for the sake     euphony,      reject
                                                               of                   to

SCHEM<U+017F>; of Consonants.-Liquid
      that scheme which has the   authority of Messrs. Latham
and Whewell (waiving some undecided points), to which I
would make a few additions.     I denote, for convenience, the
aspirates (so called perhaps fitly, as the breathing is more
heard in them) universally by adding to the corresponding
non-aspirates a small h, which thus becomes a symbol from a
           º

I  observe that the flat consonants appear formed from the
sharp   by     an
               effort (to make their sound stronger and more
continuous), which also, being repeated, converts the flat into
the liquid. This effort has not prevented,          the flat order, the  in
introduction        of
                  the second force       aspiration    of   the sharp:         as   in
hence there     some reason
                is                conjecture that the liquids might

   Concerning the latter two, my chief difficulty                know                   is   to
whether they are simple         compound sounds; but

           groups:—
    1. Those essential to the constitution                               of the rock, or inti

  hornblende, epidote, chrysolite, leucite, specular, magnetic

  mica, quartz, garnet and pyrites. Of the second group are
  quartz, either crystallized        chalcedonic, the zeolites
                                            or                       hy                        or

50             J. D. Dana   on the  Minerals of Trap
chytes and porphyries, which consist essentially of felspar,
have proceeded, in many instances at least, from felspathic
granites; the basalts and trap from syenites, hornblende or
augitic rocks.
    A theory proposed by Von Buch supposes that the fel
spathic rocks, as they are of less specific gravity, are from the
earliest eruptions, or the more superficial fusings, while the
heavier basalt has come from greater depths.         Darwin thus
accounts for the granites of the surface being intersected by
basaltic dykes; the latter having originated from a deeper
source, where their constituents took their place at some
former period from their superior gravity. It virtually places
 hornblende rocks below felspathic granites in the interior
structure of our globe. The hypothesis is ingenious and de
 mands consideration; but it may not be time to give it our
full confidence.
     But supposing these more modern rocks to have been de
rived from the more ancient granitic—what has become of the
 quartz and mica which occur so abundantly in the latter,
 while they are so uncommon in the former? By what changes
 have they disappeared?
     In the fusion produced by internal fires, the elements are
 free to move and enter into any combinations that may be
 favoured by their affinities.  If silica, alumina, magnesia, lime,
 iron, the alkalies, potash and soda, were fused together—and
 these are the actual constituents of basalt—what result might
 we expect?      From known facts, we should conclude that the
 silica would combine with the different bases, and these simple
 silicates would unite into more complex compounds.            The
 silicates of alumina and the alkalies or lime, form thus one set
 of compounds, the felspars; the silicates of magnesia and the
 isomorphous bases, iron and lime, another set, to which be
 long augite, hornblende and chrysolite; and if much iron is
 present, we might have with the lime and alumina, the mine
 ral epidote. The experiments of Berthier, Mitscherlich and
  Rose, and the facts observed amongst furnace slags, confirm
  what is here stated.
     But not to go back to a resolution of the fused minerals into
 their elements, we may consider for a moment what changes
  the minerals themselves might more directly undergo in the
 process of fusion.
      Much of the mica in granite differs from felspar in con
  taining half the amount of silica in proportion to the bases,
  the bases in each being alumina and potash or soda. The
  change then in the conversion of the mica into felspar would
  require an addition of silica, which might be derived from the

                                   and the allied Rocks.                                                         51
free quartz of granite.        Other varieties of mica contain mag
nesia, which would go towards the formation of some mineral
of the magnesian series. It is possible that trachytes and
porphyry have thus been made from granite; but trap rocks
could not have been so derived, as they contain from 10 to
 25 per cent. less of silica.
    Again, hornblende and augite are so nearly related, that
 they have been considered by Rose the same mineral, the dif
 ferent circumstances attending the cooling giving rise to the
 few peculiarities presented.      There can be no difficulty there
 fore in  deriving  augite   by fusion from liornblende rocks. This
moreover has been actually confirmed by experiment.

to view.      We do not attempt to explain why in these modern
fusings, mica should not have remained mica, and the quartz
still free uncombined quartz. The facts prove some peculi
arity of condition attending the formation of the granitic rocks.
Of this condition we know nothing certain, and can only
suggest the common supposition of a higher heat and slower
cooling, attending a greater pressure and different electrical
conditions, and the same circumstances may have existed
during the granites of different ages.
    With these brief suggestions I pass to the second division
of the subject before us.

of sources, and even at the present time there are various opi

Any deduction, therefore, respecting quartz, holds equally for
the associated minerals.
   How a cavity coated with a deposit of chalcedony can still
be afterwards filled up with other minerals, has been deemed a
mystery in science, but the possibility of it is now not doubted.

     4.Zeolites, moreover, have been found forming stalactites
in  basaltic caverns,          as
                            was observed         the writer by      some                   in      of

   These facts favour throughout the view                  urge, that the    we
amygdaloidal minerals have             general resulted from infiltra
                                             in

erupted rock.

 to contain at the time of ejection any of the zeolitic minerals.
 The zeolites of Vesuvius are known to occur only in the older
 lavas, and afford no evidence against our position.               The
cavities in   lavas, as far as   observed,  are  empty  as  they  come
 from the volcanic fires, with the exception of those containing
sparingly some metallic ores which are condensed within them.
 Considering the fusibility of the zeolites and their easy destruc
tion by heat and by volcanic gases, sulphureous and muriatic,
we should d priori say that they could not be formed under
such circumstances.
    6. Besides, as we have stated, none of the proper consti
tuents of trap or basalt—or the minerals disseminated through
these rocks,—contain water. They are                anhydrous.   all

such a forcing power above, can we set limits to the depth to

was observed by Dr. Jackson at Keweena Point, Lake Su
perior.     The datholite is often found there in veins with na
tive copper, and is associated in some places with a curious
slag of boro-silicate of iron and copper.              Sometimes the cry
stals of   datholite,  as well as the      prehnite    and calc-spar, con
tain scales or filaments of native copper.                 These very im
portant observations seem to establish the same origin for the
three minerals, for Dr. Jackson states that they appear to be
contemporaneous; and if calc-spar has been deposited from
a solution, the same holds true of the others.                They have all
been formed subsequent to the copper filaments of the cavities,
for they were deposited around them; yet may have been the
next to form during the cooling of the rock. The boro-sili
cate of iron and copper has resulted from the same causes.
    Analcime approaches the zeolites in composition, but like
the prehnite and datholite it contains less water, and is very
different in      its
                    crystallization.        We have less evidence                       as   to
the heat necessary for                 formation; yet

this association of the lime zeolites with a large supply of lime  If
in the vicinity are common. When there is little or no lime,
or only the results proceeding from the decomposing rock,
the other zeolites are formed—the hydrous silicates of alumina
and potash or soda, occasionally with some lime.          But if a
salt of baryta or strontia is present, the decomposition of the
silicates of the alkalies takes place as by the lime, and the
mineral harmotome or Brewsterite is produced.
    In the above explanations we have scarcely appealed to one
source of amygdaloidal minerals admitted in the outset—their
proceeding from vapours rising with the erupted rock; for it
seems to be of but limited influence.      Besides the arguments
already brought forward, we state that the vapours which rise
at the moment of eruption are insufficient. They inflate the
rock or blow up the cavities; but the little vapour required
to open the cavities most assuredly could not afford by con
densation the mineral matter necessary to fill them,--to pro
duce stalactites, stalagmite and successive layers of minerals.
The vapours then, if the source, must have continued to rise
for some time afterward. But is it possible that vapours should
rise up through the solid rock? Such does not happen in
the case of recent volcanoes; for fissures are first opened and
then the vapours escape. And could it happen with the water
above pressing down into the rock with the force of an ocean
even a mile deep?
    There may be instances of this mode of formation; but that
it should be the usual mode is irreconcilable with the many
facts stated. The form and condition of quartz or chalcedony
in geodes, as well as the vast amount of this mineral in some
cases,—the relative positions of the zeolites, and their occur
rence as incrustations on rocks, or as fillings of cavities or
seams, and never in disseminated crystals through the texture
of the rock,-the green coating of the nodules, which is some
times a carbonate of copper when there is native copper in
the rock to undergo alteration,-the correspondence between
the elements of the minerals and the composition of the in
cluding rock, and at the same time their contrast in being
hydrous while the constituents of the latter are anhydrous,
and the known formation of zeolites in caverns,—these various
facts appear to establish infiltration as the principal means by
which amygdaloidal minerals have been produced.

      THEmust
          remarks in No. 44. related to a difficulty which
              arise if we can, as seems to have been proved,
succeed  in tracing the equation for W to a class of equations
of the sixth degree, the solution of which can be effected.  I
have lately reconsidered the subject of that number, and the
exact nature of the difficulty in question will, I think, appear
from what follows.

 Nov. 27, “                        Researches in Electricity." By
  1845.          Michael Faraday Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c. Nine
teenth Series. Section 25: On the Magnetization of Light, and the
Illumination of Magnetic Lines of Force.
      For a long time past the author had felt a strong persuasion, de
  rived from philosophical considerations, that among the several
  powers of nature which in their various forms of operation on mat
  ter produce different classes of effects, there exists an intimate rela
 tion; that they are connected by a common origin, have a reciprocal
 dependence on one another, and are capable, under certain condi
 tions, of being converted the one into the other. Already have elec
 tricity and magnetism afforded evidence of this mutual convertibility;
 and in extending his views to a wider sphere, the author became con
 vinced that these powers must have relations with light also. Until
 lately his endeavours to detect these relations were unsuccessful;
 but at length, on instituting a more searching interrogation of na
 ture, he arrived at the discovery recorded in the present paper,
 namely, that a ray of light may be electrified and magnetized ; and
 that lines of magnetic force may be rendered luminous.
     The fundamental experiment revealing this new and important
 fact, which establishes a link of connexion between two great de
 partments of nature, is the following.              A ray of light issuing from
 an   Argand    lamp   is first   polarized  in the horizontal plane by reflexion
 from a     glass   mirror,     and then made to pass, for a certain space,
 through glass composed of silicated borate of lead, on                  emergence                  its
 from which         it viewed

terms the dimagnetic,              placed between the two poles
                                      is                                   powerful                 ofa

takes place will, of course, be reversed by reversing either the
course of the ray or the poles of the magnet.                Hence it follows that
the polarized ray is made to rotate in the same direction as the cur
rents of positive electricity are circulating, both in the helices com
posing the electro-magnet, and also in the same direction as the
hypothetical currents, which, according to Ampère's theory, circu
late in the substance of a steel magnet. The rotatory action was
found to be always directly proportional to the intensity of the
magnetic force, but not to that of the electric current; and also to
be proportional to the length of that portion of the ray which re
ceives the influence.        The interposition of substances which occa
sion no disturbance of the magnetic forces, produce no change in
these effects. Magnets consisting only of electric helices act with
less power than when armed with iron, and in which magnetic ac
tion is consequently more strongly developed.
   The author pursues the inquiry by varying in a great number of
ways the circumstances in which this newly-discovered influence is
exerted ; and finds that the modifications thus introduced in the re
sults are       all
                 explicable       referenceby     the general law above stated.

wanting for the appliance of these powers to the investigation of
this and other radiant agencies.       The phenomena thus brought to
light confirm the views entertained by the author relative to the con
stitution of matter as being spheres of power, for the operation of
which the conception of a solid nucleus is not necessary; and leads
to the presumption that the influence of magnetism on bodies which
exhibit no magnetic properties consists in producing in them a state
of electric tension tending to a current; while on iron, nickel, and
other bodies susceptible of magnetism, currents are actually esta
blished by the same influence.

these inquiries.
    “On the Action of the Rays of the Spectrum on Vegetable
Juices:" being an Extract from a Letter by Mrs. M. Somerville to
 Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., dated Rome, September 20, 1845.
 Communicated by Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., F.R.S.
    In the experiments of which the results are here recorded, the solar
spectrum was condensed by a lens of flint glass of seven inches and
a half focus, maintained in the same part of the screen by keeping a
pin-hole or pencil-mark constantly at the corner of the red rays,
which were sharply defined by being viewed through blue spec
tacles; and the apparatus was covered with black cloth in order to
exclude extraneous light. Thick white letter-paper, moistened with
the liquid to be examined, was exposed wet to the spectrum, as it
was found that the action of the coloured light was thus rendered
more immediate and more intense, than when the surface of the
paper was dry.
    The action of the spectrum at the junction of the lavender with
the violet rays was found in some cases to be different from what it
is with either of these colours separately, indicating a break in the
continuity of action, and suggesting the idea of a secondary spec
trum. In many instances the yellow and green rays exert a power
ful influence on vegetable substances, an influence apparently un
connected with heat; for the darkening is generally least under
the red rays and immediately below them, where the calorific rays
are most abundant.        The action, in a great number of cases, pro
duces insulated   spots   in different parts of the spectrum, but more
especially in the region of the rays of mean refrangibility, in which
neither the calorific nor the chemical powers are the greatest. The
point of maximum intensity is sometimes altered by the addition
of acids, alkalies, or diluted alcohol. But altogether, as the author
states, the action of the different parts of the spectrum seems to be
very capricious, the changes of colour produced being exceedingly
irregular and unaccountable.

ample, is treated by the acid.
   About 4300 grains of wax were boiled with rather less than two
pints of common nitric acid for about two hours, and the mixture,
allowed to cool, became a solid mass; this was perfectly dissolved
by carbonate of soda, with the production of slight effervescence.
On cooling the whole became one mass; the wax was unctuous and
of an apricot colour. After twenty-four hours' ebullition, the greater
part of the wax was dissolved in the nitric acid; an oily substance,
having the smell of rancid butter, floated on the solution; this was
entirely dissolved by potash; this         was acid, and could notoil                                        be

  ANALYSIS           OF    PHOSPHATE OF ALUMINA.                                      B.Y.    M. A. DELESSE.
   M. Danhauser discovered at Bernay, near Epernay, a white sub
stance, considerably resembling alumina dried on a filter; it invested
a gangue coloured by the oxides of iron and manganese, and ap
peared to belong to the plastic clay formation.          Several collections
in Paris contain specimens of                         it,

  The Astronomer Royal has forwarded to the Times newspaper
the following letter from Prof. Encke of Berlin, relating the disco

Mr. Hencke's new planet, accompanied with a statement on the part
of Mr. Hind, that he could not find any star answering the descrip

   Professor  Airy  says,  there  appears to be no reasonable doubt that
the object to which the foregoing relates is a new planet.
   Mr. Hind has since observed the new star: At 0 h. 20 min. 15 sec.,
sidereal time, on Wednesday evening, the right ascension of the
new planet was 4 hs. 8 min. 17-58 sec., and the declination 12° 45'
32"-6, north.    He was enabled to establish its motion in R.A. from
the observations made at Mr. Bishop's Observatory, Regent's Park.
on that evening.     The planet has the appearance of a star of the
ninth or tenth   magnitude.—Literary      Gazette, Dec. 27.

    NOTICE OF AN AURO RA BOREALIS SEEN AT MANCHESTER.
       To the Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
   I will thank you to record in your Philosophical Magazine, &c. an
aurora borealis which was seen at this place on Wednesday evening,
the 3rd instant.      It was first seen as a luminous arch about six
o'clock; at half-past six the arch was complete throughout, from
the eastern to the western horizon, with a span of upwards of 100°.
The arch of light was perfectly steady and of an unusual breadth,
much broader indeed than any I have before noticed.          The altitude
of the arch also was unusually great. a Ursae Majoris, then near
the meridian beneath the pole, was within the lower margin of the

                          Meteorological Observations.                               71
luminous band, whose highest point was about the meridian of
a Draconis. From the upper edge of the western limb sprang seve
ral extensive streamers; but the light of the moon (then about four
days old) prevented their being very brilliant.                 Shortly after seven,
heavy clouds completely covered the aurora, showing their distance
to be less than that of the luminous meteor which they obscured,
and which, by their long continuance, they finally closed.
     We had some very heavy hail showers during the day, and a per
fect gale of wind the previous night. The same day a terrific thunder
storm visited a great part of Wales, killing several head of cattle and
doing other serious damage to property.
                                             I am, Gentlemen,
                                                    Your obedient Servant,

 XVI.    On the Application of the Photographic Camera to Me
     teorological Registration.     By HENRY ColleN, Esq.”
                            [With  a Plate.]
 INofApril     1844, Mr. Ronalds applied to me for the purpose
         obtaining some photographic representations of figures,
 forming “a sort of pictorial register of atmospheric electri
 city” upon glass plates coated with Canada balsam, which
 figures had been executed at the Kew Observatory by means
of his electrograph, described in the Fourteenth Report of the
                                                    i.
 British Association. The desired result was quickly obtained
by the usual photogenic process, and also by           camera; the
latter being found however, as was to be expected, the greatly
superior mode. Several other impressions were afterwards
made from figures on coated metallic plates, some of which
were shown attached to Mr. Ronalds's report to the meeting
at York. The sharpness and delicacy of the positive impres
sions thus obtained gave rise to some experiments, made by
us conjointly, for the purpose of applying the photographic
camera to the registration of Volta's electrometer, the ther
mometer, and the siphon barometer. The projection of sha
dows on photographic paper, which, by the way, had been
already proposed and tried by several persons, was at once
objected to by Mr. Ronalds, whose knowledge of the delicacy
required in observing and registering the various instruments
at the Observatory, made him fully aware of the necessity of
obtaining as perfect definition as the best optical arrange
ment would produce; an excellent compound lens, made and
kindly lent to us by Mr. Ross, was therefore used, and has
been employed on each of the instruments, i. e. the electro

XVII.    On Fresnel's Theory of the Aberration of Light. By
    G. G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Cam
    bridge*.
      theory of the aberration of light, and of the absence
THEof any influence of the motion of the earth on the laws
of refraction, &c., given by Fresnel in the ninth volume of the
Annales de Chimie, p. 57, is really very remarkable.           we                                           If
suppose the diminished velocity of propagation of light within
refracting media to arise solely from the greater density of the
aether within them, the elastic force being the same as without,
the density which it is necessary to suppose the aether within
a medium of refractive index u to have is u%, the density in
vacuum being taken for unity.          Fresnel supposes that the
earth passes through the aether without disturbing            the                                          it,
aether penetrating the earth quite freely. He supposes that
refracting medium moving with the earth carries with                                                         it   a a
quantity         of
             aether,    density w”–1, which constitutes the ex

           in            He  supposes   that  light   propagated                             is
through this aether,       which part       of
                                           moving with the earth,        is

P.
On account of the smallness of the coefficient of aberration,
we may also neglect the square of the ratio of the earth's ve
locity to that of light; and if we resolve the earth's velocity in
different directions, we may consider the effect of each resolved
part separately.
   In the ninth volume of the Comptes Rendus of the Academy
of Sciences, p. 774, there is a short notice of a memoir by M.
Babinet, giving an account of an experiment which seemed to
present a difficulty in    explanation. M. Babinet found that

uninfluenced by the motion of the earth. The method which                                                                I

employ will, hope, be found simpler than Fresnel's; besides
it applies        to the most general case.    Fresnel has not
given the calculation for reflexion, but has merely stated the
result; and with respect to refraction, he has only considered
the case in which the course of the light within the refracting
medium is in the direction of the earth's motion. This might
still leave some doubt on the mind, as to whether the result
would be the same in the most general case.
     If the aether were at rest, the direction of light would be
that of a normal to the surfaces of the waves.              When the
motion of the aether is      considered,  it is most convenient to de
fine the direction of     light   to be that of the line along which
the same    portion   of a wave moves relatively to the earth. For
this is in           all
                 cases the direction which        ultimately observed                 is
with       telescope  furnished with cross wires.      Hence,                                                   if

XVIII.      Observations on the Development and Growth of the
     Epidermis.    By ERAs MUs WILson, F.R.S., Lecturer on
     Anatomy and Physiology in the Middleser Hospital".
IT the
   is the commonly received doctrine at the present day, that
        cells of the epidermis and of epithelium in general,
originate out of materials furnished by the liquor sanguinis or
plasma of the blood.       In order that this purpose may be ef
fected, the liquor sanguinis is conveyed by endosmosis through
the walls of the capillary vessels and through the peripheral
boundary of the surface, the “basement membrane” of Bow
man.      Having reached the exterior plane of the latter, the
changes commence which result in the development of gra
nules in the previously fluid liquor sanguinis, or rather,
perhaps, in the aggregation of the molecules of the organi
sable material or blastema, which was previously held in inti
mate suspension or solution by the liquor sanguinis.          Out of
the body an action of this kind would be termed coagulation,
and where inorganic matter is concerned, crystallization. The
process to which I am now referring, though taking place
within the body, is analogous to these phaenomena, with the
difference of being controlled and directed by the power of
life, of being, in point of fact, a vital coagulation or crystal
lization.    Indeed, coagulation, although occurring out of the
body, and sometimes after the lapse of a considerable period,
may be regarded as the last act of vital existence, or as a vestige
of the atmosphere of life with which the coagulating fluid was
previously charged in abundance.
    As regards the tissue under consideration, there is every
ground for belief, that the organisable material or blastema of
the liquor sanguinis is appropriated by the epidermis the very
instant it reaches the exterior plane of the “basement mem
brane;” some portion of                        it,
                                 and the greater part      the serum             of

menced, is next to impossible; and in the living state of the
body, separation never takes place until the mutual connexion
between the layers has been destroyed by the effusion of fluid.
The microscope gives additional weight to this evidence.              I
have observed that the cells of the deep surface of the epider
mis are in immediate contact with the boundary limit of the
dermis, and that moreover it is frequently difficult to deter
mine the exact line between them. I have also made the fol
lowing experiment:-I cut very thin vertical slices of the skin,
at daily periods, from the moment of death until decomposition
had become established, and submitted them to the action of
the compressor on the field of the microscope, but in every
instance, while fresh, the two tissues yielded to the pressure
in equal proportion without any separation occurring.               As
soon, however, as decomposition had commenced, separation
was produced, and in the early stages took place with diffi
culty.    This experiment proves that the firm adhesion sub
sisting between the epidermis and dermis is not alone due to
the numerous inflexions of the former into the latter, which
take place at the sudoriferous tubes, hair tubes, and sebaceous
ducts, although these inflexions must co-operate powerfully in
the result.
    Being desirous of examining the under surface of the epi
dermis with the higher powers of the microscope, and failing

   2. The aggregated granules, measuring about Tºnnth of
an inch in diameter, are minute masses, composed of four, five
or six of the preceding, or as many as can be aggregated with
out leaving an unoccupied space in the centre of the mass.
With an imperfect focus, these granules have the appearance
of possessing a transparent globular nucleus, but this appear
ance ceases when the focus is perfect, and then the compo
ment granules are quite obvious, and the centre becomes a
dark point, namely, the shadow caused by the meeting of the
primitive granules.

the granules asunder equally                               on   all

addition of a transparent border to the last-described nucle
ated granule.        The periphery of this transparent border is
            by a dark interstitial substance, which gives the bor
der a defined outline; and in the latter situation I imagine a
cell-membrane to exist.                   I
                                     am not satisfied, however, that
this is the  case;    and the   di<U+017F>ficulty  of isolating these cells, and
their roughness of outline when separated, serve to prove that
if a membrane be really present, it must be exceedingly thin
and easily torn.         Assuming therefore, from analogy rather
than from demonstrative evidence, that there exists a boun
dary membrane to the bodies I am now describing,                          have         I
termed them “cells;” the cavity of the cell I apprehend to
be the “transparent border,” the “nucleated granule” is the
nucleus of the cell, the “aggregated granule” of the latter
the nucleolus, and the entire body a “nucleolo-nucleated
cell.”
    Before quitting the structure of the “nucleolo-nucleated

much interest to be mentioned with regard to                 which     it, that         is,

86                  Mr. E. Wilson's            Observations       on the
a belief in the formation of the “aggregated granule” by the
aggregation of primitive granules, the idea which prompted
me to give them that name, and the formation of the aggre
gated granule by the cleavage of a primitive granule.       If this
question related merely to the formation of the “primary ag
gregated granule,” it would be unimportant, but it has a more
extended application.      The outermost layer of the nucleus is
composed, as I have shown, of “aggregated granules,” and
so also is that layer which alone forms the space in the nu
cleolo-nucleated cells.     To them the hypothesis of cleavage of
a  simple  granule    would be most suitable, and this theory
would   explain  better than any other, changes which remain to
be described in the further growth of the epidermic cell.        In
the second place, the relation of cell and nucleus is a question
on which       I
             feel considerable doubt.    The process of develop
ment   appears   to consist in the successive production of gra
nules, one layer of granules succeeding another, so that if the
organisable principle exist in each separate granule, the or
ganisable force may be supposed to be more and more weak
ened in successive formations, until the moment arrives when
it ceases entirely.    Is that which I have described as a nu
cleolo-nucleated cell really a cell or still a nucleus? The only
solution of the question that occurs to me        determining the is,
presence      ofcell-membrane,

 secondary cells measuring Ts'onth, others measuring rººm th;
  and in the interstices, primitive granules, aggregated granules,
  and nucleated cells.
    My observations, it will be seen, have been chiefly directed
 to the epidermis, and    I  am prevented at present from carry
 ing them further, but I have no doubt that the epithelium will
 be found to be identical in the phaenomena of development
 and growth with the epidermis.         I have observed the same
 structure in the epithelium of the mouth and fauces, and also
 in that of the bladder and vagina. Incomplete epithelial cells,
 measuring 737th and rºoth of an inch from the <U+017F>auces, pre
 sented a very remarkable appearance; they had a rounded
 lobulated border, evidently composed of a row of secondary
 cells and a depressed centre, as though the action were sub
 siding in the latter, while it was progressing in the circumfe
 rence.
    Another illustration of the structure now described, I found
 in the cells of melanosis, and in the pigmentary cells of the
 choroid membrane of the eyeball. I am induced to believe
 that the same structure will be discovered more extensively
 than at present can be anticipated.      The corpuscles of mela
 nosis, according to my observations, are parent-cells, having
 an average admeasurement of rºot<U+017F>th of an inch, containing
 secondary cells and nucleated and aggregated granules, as
 well as separate primitive granules.       The “aggregated gra
 nules” measured from      Trångth   to yºunth  of an inch, and the
 primitive granules about goingth.
    There is another feature in the history of development of
 the epidermic cell, which    I  regard as peculiarly interesting.
 This relates to an   organic  change   taking place in the assimi
lative  powers   of the  primitive  granules,  by which the latter
are altered in their colour, in short, are converted into     “pig
ment granules.”       Pigment granules appear to differ in no   re
spect from the “primitive granules,” excepting in that of co
lour, and perhaps also in chemical composition.          They have
the same globular form, the same size, and occupy the same
position in the cell, being always accumulated around the nu
cleus, and dispersed less numerously through the rest of the
cell. The nucleus of the cell in the epidermis of the Negro
appears to consist wholly of pigment granules, while in the
European there is a greater or less admixture of coloured and
uncoloured granules.        The central granules are generally
lighter in tint than the rest, and give the idea of a colourless
nucleolus, while those around the circumference are deeper
coloured.     Besides a difference in the depth of colour of the
separate granules entering into the composition of a single

cell, there is also much difference in the aggregate of the gra
nules composing particular cells.     For example, intermingled
with cells of a        hue, there are others less deeply tinted,
which give the tissue in which they are found a mottled ap
pearance. This fact is well-illustrated in the hair, and also
in the nails, in which latter it is no uncommon thing to find
an isolated streak produced by the accumulation of a number
of cells containing coloured granules, in the midst of colour
less cells.
    When pigment granules are examined separately, they
offer very little indication of the depth of colour which is pro
duced by their accumulation.                    I
                                     have observed some to have

 the epidermis in the Negro, is evidently due to the composi
 tion of that layer of these granules,        the grayness of the
 superficial layers of the same tissue results not merely from
 the desiccation of these granules, but also from the fact of
 those subsequently produced being less strongly coloured, and
 also from the addition of a colourless cell-membrane.

WHEN             a
           taining the double phosphate of ammonia and magne
sia, and traces are made upon it by any hard body, it is
known that they become visible                 afterwards by the salt
being precipitated upon them. Berzelius, who mentions this
test in his Elements of Chemistry, states that Wollaston pro
posed to make use of this fact as a test of the presence of
                                                   j
magnesia in solution, which has since been frequently adopted.
According to Berzelius, “the cause of this property is of a
mechanical nature, probably from the glass being covered with
microscopic crystals, the facets of which take a different posi
tion on the traces, for some reason which is not easily ex
plained.”      More recently, Prof. Liebig has alluded to this
subject in his Vegetable Physiology, S 157.              These effects
are referred by him to a state of unstable equilibrium of the
various particles which compose the liquid,                is destroyed
whenever a      dynamical    action is created   sufficiently  powerful
to overcome the feeble      attractions,  or the inertia of the mole
 cules in solution.     He ascribes to the same cause the sudden
 solidification of water, which had remained liquid when below
 the freezing-point, upon being agitated; the precipitation of a
 mixture of potash and tartaric acid; also the detonation of
 fulminating powder from the contact of any solid body.
 Neither of these eminent observers mentions having submitted
 these traces to microscopic examination, although that is the
 only manner to test the hypothesis advanced by Berzelius.
    On the present occasion it is my intention to describe some
 observations I have made, in order to elucidate the influence
 of molecular action on the precipitation of saline bodies, si
 milar to that observed in the double phosphate, and to show
 that a similar influence is exerted over bodies in a gaseous
 state and in a state of vapour, and afterwards to point out
 some phaenomena hitherto unexplained, such as the fixation
 of the mercurial vapours in the Daguerreotype for instance,
 which evidently depend upon a like cause.
    In order to obtain the double phosphate, I have generally
 used a solution containing about ten grains of phosphate of
 soda with about three of carbonate of ammonia in an ounce
 and a half of water. I have preferred this mixture, because
 the ingredients are more easily procured, and are less acted

The magnesian solution was generally a few grains of sulphate
of magnesia to the same quantity of water as above.
            º
    A small quantity of the first mixture is poured on a piece
of glass,        to this are added a few drops of the magnesia in
solution; if it be allowed to remain undisturbed, in a few mi
nutes the surface of the liquid becomes covered with a thin
film, and on the glass appear minute shining crystals; but if
before these crystals have time to form, any solid substance,
as a glass rod or an empty pen, for instance, is passed over
the glass through the liquid, the course it follows becomes
visible shortly after. The images which are thus formed are
double, and may be termed the upper and lower images.
   I  will first describe the upper images:—They appear on the
surface of the liquid itself, when the film would otherwise have
been formed.        They are seen immediately after the passage
of the    pen   through   the liquid, whereas the lower ones only
become     apparent    a few moments after.      Being formed on a
moveable surface, they are not perfect representations of the
traces that have been made, and are changed and distorted
by any movement of the liquid.            When the solution of the
salt is weak, they frequently disappear a few moments after
their formation and are redissolved in the liquid; when the
liquid is more concentrated, they likewise disappear, owing
to the formation of the film on the surface. The production
of these images appears to be independent of the chemical na
ture of the body used for tracing.        They may be obtained                 in
dependently of the lower ones, by drawing a thread gently
over the surface of the liquid, without              its

with the surface   of   the glass,
   The lower images are formed             on

under the     upper  ones.   A    few seconds after the    tracing  has
been made upon the glass, they begin                appear, and gra
                                                     to

                                                          time which
elapses before their appearance depends upon the strength                      of
the solution. When       is
                        it    strong they appear quickly, and when
weak   they   take several minutes before they are visible.
   To cause the formation         ofany images, the tracing must al

point     ofcontact between the two solids (see Plate                  fig. 2).           III.
 These lines are composed               very minute and confused cry

    The second class, or the liquid globular vapours or fumes,
which, as we have said, cause those accumulations known
under the name of fogs, clouds, or mists, are those which I
intend at present to examine, as they comprehend the theory
of the fixation of the mercurial vapours in the Daguerreotype.
It was formerly believed that vapour or mist was composed of
minute spherules or globules of liquid water, and in Newton's
works we find evidence that such was his opinion. According
 to another view, first advanced I believe by De Saussure, these
 vapours were composed of vesicles or very minute bubbles,
 exactly resembling, on a small scale, the common soap-bubble.
 This opinion has received the assent of Fresnel and Berzelius,
 and at present obtains general credence. The proofs on which
 it is considered to be founded, are principally the observa
 tions of De Saussure, who asserts that on high mountains, or
 in the clouds, he has been able to detect these air-vesicles
 with the naked eye, and has seen them burst as they came in
 contact with each other.     Berzelius recommends the exami
 nation of the vapour of water over a dark surface, such as that
 of ink, with a lens of a short focus.       He says, that vesicles
 may be detected in this manner, varying in size from 13 ºn to
 grºwth of an inch, which occasionally burst as they touch
 each other.    The suspension of clouds is also used as an ar
 gument in favour of the vesicular theory, as it is contended
 that liquid spherules would descend to the ground by their
 specific gravity in such situations. Fresnel indeed compares
 the globules to small balloons, which dilate or contract, accord
 ing to the temperature of the air they contain.
     A few days’ stay at the convent of St. Bernard gave me an
 opportunity of repeating the observations on the clouds, as
 mentioned by De Saussure, which may be also made in this
 season on our London fogs. Globules of various sizes in these
 circumstances are frequently discerned by the naked eye float
 ing in all directions.    Ihave endeavoured        toascertain their
 vesicular structure, but have been unable     to  do    so
                                                         from direct
 observations.   It   isfrequently   a  most difficult point,   inmi
 croscopic investigation,  to decide upon the existence        of
                                                                athin
 transparent membrane.     It   isstill more so   topronounce upon
 the vesicular  or  spherular  structure  of globules     inconstant
 agitation; and I   believe that if minute spherules and vesicles

 100                   Dr. A. Waller's Observations                          on certain
could be mixed together, we do not possess any means at                                                     pre
 sent of distinguishing them.
     Ihave never been able to detect that appearance of burst
 ing of the globules mentioned by De Saussure, but sometimes,
 when the agitation of the air is slight, two of the larger glo
 bules may be seen floating towards each other, and afterwards
disappear suddenly, which may be explained, if we admit that
it is caused by the union of the two spherules into one, which
is too heavy to remain any longer in suspension, and whose
rapid deposition conceals it from the sight.
   There may be urged as objections to the vesicular theory,
that if the pellicle become extremely thin, the vesicle would
no longer be perceived any more than the apex of an air
bubble before bursting, or the central black spot of a system
of Newton's coloured rings. It will be seen below that the
globules of vapour possess the power of depositing themselves
in a crystalline form, which requires a tranquil deposition of
particles, such as could scarcely be deemed possible, if the air
contained in each had to escape at the moment of          crystal                            its
lization.

seen at a short distance the fumes of the salt, which at the
end of a few hours are found to have condensed into a thin
snowy pellicle, completely obturating the mouth of the bottle.
This partition is so delicate, that the slightest agitation will
cause it to fall into the liquid.
     In all these cases it is found that the fumes possess the
 power of remaining suspended a much greater length of time
 than would be expected from the difference of their specific
 gravity with that of air, which is also the case with the fumes
 of other substances, and smoke in particular.             This can only
 be accounted for by the continual state of           agitation  of the air,
 even within an enclosed space, and by the elasticity of the
 solid and liquid particles.         In the case of solid particles this
 can be     readily admitted,     but with regard to liquid globules,
 there is   probably   some action similar to that which takes place
 on the impinging of solid elastic balls, which after becoming
 flattened rebound in virtue of their tendency to recover their
 original shape.
     The causes which act in fixing different vapours and fumes
  are the same as those which determine the precipitation of solid
  particles in solution, such as for instance, sharp points of any
  kind, minute filaments, and more especially the existence of a
  crystalline particle to act as a nucleus. Non-conducting sub
  stances, as woollen cloth, the nap of a hat, the web of the spider,
  &c., are covered with aqueous globules when no rain has fallen,
  and when polished surfaces near present no such deposition.
      Having now shown the existence of a crystalline power in
  vapours, we shall proceed to prove the influence of a force
  which disturbs this equilibrium in the same manner as in the
  saline solutions above mentioned. The friction of a solid body
  on glass will leave traces which are invisible until breathed
  upon.
  are added to those of physiology.    This tendency of the mind, of which
                                                                       ..i.
  a good account has been given by Müller in his Elements of Physiology,
  is so strong, that where groups of globules are concerned, I
  always advise their being mapped down under the microscopic camera
  lucida, and put by for some time for future inspection.       I shall have
  occasion to advert to this subject more fully hereafter.

  102         Dr. A. Waller's Observations on certain
     Many bodies possess this property, but the mineral steatite,
  or soap-stone, produces the effect better than any other I know.
  A  considerable degree of friction may be used over the traces
  thus produced by steatite, without affecting the appearance of
  the traces when breathed upon repeatedly.        The glass may
 even be heated considerably without affecting them.       By ex
  amining with the microscope the parts that have been traced
  upon by steatite, we are unable, any more than with the naked
  eye, to detect any material cause for the deposition of vapours
  in these places, as it probably depends upon the transparency
  of the mineral, which being so attenuated is unable to affect
  the rays of light. When the traces have been brought out by
 breathing upon them, they must be covered with another piece
 of glass, which impedes the evaporation of the water and allows
 them to be submitted to the microscope. The parts untouched
 by the steatite present the appearances that have been already
 mentioned.     On the lines created by the mineral, the drops
 of water are differently disposed, their long diameters being
 parallel to the direction of the lines. These minute drops
very much resemble the globules of gas deposited from a
 liquid, the only difference between the two consisting in the
 deviation from the globular form in the liquid traces, which
evidently arises from the power which the water possesses of
 wetting glass.
    It is evident, therefore, that the secondary cause of these
images is a difference in the position of the minute drops of
water, reflecting the light differently from the other drops,
which are irregularly disposed on the other parts of the glass.
    There exists another method of fixing vapours, which has
been long known, and to which I believe attention was first
directed by Prof. Draper.        It consists in merely placing a
body on a plain surface, such as that of a metallic speculum,
or even of glass; after a short time it is found that simple
contact, such as this, has caused some molecular action, as the
spot occupied by the object will become apparent by breathing
on it in the same way as with the images of steatite. This
observation is the more interesting, as it serves as a connect
ing link between the effects of mechanical power and those
caused by other agents.
    The experiments of Mr. Hunt have shown the influence of
heat in causing the fixation of vapours.
    An image of this sort formed on glass by the breath, when
examined under the microscope, presents exactly the same ap
pearance as those formed by steatite.      The same difficulty is
experienced in bringing out, by mercurial vapours, the ther
mographic images on glass, as is found with the traces of

          Molecular Actions                  of Crystalline Particles,            &c.      103
steatite, which possess but in a very slight degree the power of
fixing mercurial         vapours.       It appears therefore that the
power which water has of wetting glass, causes it to have a
greater tendency to deposit than mercury, which does not wet
glass. The cause of the production of thermographic images
is evidently similar to that which causes the deposition of a
solid body from a solution.
     The fixation of the mercurial vapours in the Daguerreo
type process, which has excited so much interest, and for
which so many theories have been advanced, is but another
example of the force which causes the deposition of solid and
gaseous particles from a liquid, and which produces so many
other effects.        In this case the chemical rays of light act in
 the same manner as mechanical action and caloric in causing
 a certain molecular disturbance. By the discoveries of Moser,
 it is shown that these rays possess the power of acting upon
 almost any body, in such a manner as to render it capable of
 fixing the particles of various vapours. Thus simple minerals,
 glass, &c. may be made to fix the mercurial vapour.
     It appears however that silver, gold, copper, &c., which form
 amalgams, or in other words, are capable of being wetted by
 mercury, possess this property in a greater degree than any
 other bodies which are incapable of being wetted by                                      it;   in
 the same way            as   we
                              have seen that glass has the greatest
 power        fix the vapour         water. Admitting the truth

  theory       the   Daguerreotype       process,  we are  naturally    led                     to
 inquire whether the same agent may not likewise cause the

are very beautiful*.               I
                         have applied this property to the con
struction of an instrument for measuring the chemical rays of
light. As the details respecting this would be foreign to our
present subject, I will defer them to another occasion, and con
fine myself now to prove that these phaenomena are indepen
dent of the deposits caused by radiation.
   1st. The crystals are formed on the side exposed to the ac
tion of direct or diffused light.
   2nd. They are not formed during the night, when the ra
diation from the earth is sufficient to cause the deposition of
Water.
   3rd. Green glass, which retards photographic action, like
wise impedes this deposit.
   In an experiment which is now going on, a bottle of pale
green common glass is exposed to the north, while another of
white glass is placed in a southern aspect.     The first became
covered with minute crystals, in size averaging about a milli
metre, which have remained stationary for a week; the second
is covered with arborescent ramifications, which are daily                                      in
creasing.
   Several familiar, but hitherto unexplained phaenomena,
may in my opinion be easily accounted for by these molecular
actionS.
   The formation of hail I consider to be an instance of an
action precisely similar to that which causes the deposition of
the solids of gaseous and liquid particles.      we admit the    If                             in
fluence of this force on the globular vapours of water, it is not
at   all

when these vapours may                    be
                              much more liable      this influence       to
than we find them        our imperfect experiments.

   The method for obtaining the moment of inertia of a solid
of revolution contained in equation (3.), appears to have been
inapplicable to the case of the internal spheroid of the earth

observed, as it seems to me, other mistakes in this volume, on
points of scientific history, which, venial as they are in one
who cannot be supposed to have devoted much of his valuable
time to these umbratile studies, are yet such as ought not to
pass without some notice.
     Imust begin, however, my criticisms on your historical
chemistry, by repeating the grounds on which I deemed it
needful to controvert #. statements of M. Arago respecting
the discovery of the composition of water.                 “The éloge of

108    Rev. W.V. Harcourt on Lord Brougham's statements
éloge 2   “ Whether or not Mr. Cavendish had heard of Mr.
 Watt's theory previous to drawing his conclusions, appears
more doubtful: the supposition that he had so heard rests on
the improbability of Sir C. Blagden and many others know
ing what Mr. Watt had done and not communicating it to
Mr. Cavendish, and on the omission of any assertion in Mr.
Cavendish's paper, even in the part written by Sir C. Blagden
with the view of claiming priority as against M. Lavoisier,
that Mr. Cavendish had drawn his conclusion before April
1783.     Mr. Watt's theory was well known among the mem
bers of the Society some months before Mr. Cavendish's state
ment appears to have been reduced into writing, and eight
months before it was presented to the Society. That the first
letter of April 1783 was for some time, two months as appears
from the papers of Mr. Watt, in the hands of Sir Joseph Banks
and other members of the Society during the preceding
spring, is certain from the statements in the note to p. 330 ;
and that Sir C. Blagden, the Secretary, should not have seen
it seems impossible, for Sir Joseph Banks must have delivered
it to him at the time when it was intended to be read at one
of the Society's meetings (Phil. Trans. p. 330, note); and as
 the letter itself remains among the Society's records in the
 same volume with the paper into which the greater part of it
 was introduced, it must have been in the custody of Sir C.
 Blagden.     It is equally difficult to suppose that the person
 who wrote the remarkable passage already referred to respect
 ing Mr. Cavendish's conclusions having been communicated
 to M. Lavoisier, should not have mentioned to Mr. Caven
 dish that Mr. Watt had drawn the same conclusion in the
 spring of 1783, that           April
                               is,   in    the latest; for the con

 let me first venture to answer for M. Arago, that if he has
 “read the fac-similes” of Cavendish’s notes, you will not find
 him at the same loss as yourself to discover the inferences of
 the experimental philosopher in the steps of his investigation;
 he will not join you in propounding, “that in                 Cavendish's  all

before he rejoins you in the advocacy of any part of the sup
posed claims of your client, or thanks you for classing him
with yourself as still cherishing the conviction that “Mr.
Watt had, unknown to Cavendish, anticipated his great disco
very.”
   ºil.   which renders the self-devotion of this knight-errantry
complete, is the singular fact that you are fighting for Watt
against himself.     I had formerly come to the conclusion that
he never thought of claiming the discovery in the sense which
you suppose, nor in any other respect than as regards the
theory of the extrication of heat and light from the combining
gases; and a circumstance has lately been pointed out to me
by a friend, which establishes this conclusion.
   The edition of Robison's Mechanical Philosophy, published
by Sir D. Brewster, was revised by Watt himself. In that
revision we find him by no means indifferent to his own just
fame. Writing to the Editor he says,        “I  have carefully per
used my late excellent friend Dr. Robison's articles, “Steam
and Steam-Engines, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and have
made remarks upon them in such places, where either from the
want of proper information, or from too great a reliance on
the powers of his extraordinary memory at a period when it
probably had been weakened by a long state of acute pain,
and by the remedies to which he was obliged to have recourse,
he had been led into mistakes in regard to facts, and also in
some places where his deductions have appeared to me to be
erroneous.     Dr. R. qualifies me as ‘the pupil and intimate
friend of Dr. Black :’ he afterwards, in his dedication to me
of Dr. Black's Lectures upon Chemistry, goes the length of
supposing me to have professed to owe my improvements upon
the steam-engine to the instructions and information I had re
ceived from that gentleman, which was certainly a misappre
hension; as thou    i. I always felt and acknowledged my obliga
tions to him for the information I had received from his con
versation, and particularly for the knowledge of the doctrine
of latent heat, I never did nor could consider my improvements
as originating in those communications.        He is also mistaken
in his assertion,  p.  8 of the preface  to the above work, that  I
had attended two courses of the Doctor's lectures; for unfor
tunately for me, the necessary avocations of my business pre
vented me from attending his or any other lectures at College.”
Mr. Watt then quotes        #.  these lectures a passage in which
Black is made to       say, “My    own fortunate observation of
what happens in the formation and condensation of steam, had

112     Rev.      W.W. Harcourt on Lord Brougham's                                          statements
suggested to my friend Mr. Watt his improvements in the
steam-engine,” and remarks, “it is very painful to me to con
trovert any assertion or opinion of my revered friend; yet in
the present case              I
                        find it necessary to say that he appears to
have fallen into an error *.”
   But in revising the article on Steam, and making remarks
on those places in which Dr. Robison had been led into mis
takes, Watt makes no remark on the following very decisive
passage:—“We know that in vital or atmospheric air there is
not only a prodigious quantity of fire which is not in the vapour
of water, but that it also contains light, or the cause of light, in a
combined state.        This is fully evinced by the great discovery of
Mr. Cavendish of the composition of water: there we are taught
that water, and consequently                             its
                                          vapour, consists       air from                        of
which the    light   and  greatest   part      the fire have been sepa
                                                                    of
rated; and the subsequent discoveries             the celebrated Lavoi   of
sier show that almost all the condensable gases with which we
are acquainted, consist either           airs which have lost much
                                                        of                                                      of
their fire, and  perhaps    light too,        matters          or   of
                                                          which we have
                                                                                    in in

supposed facts; and you have in consequence entirely mis
stated the nature of Cavendish's experiments. Where, allow
me to ask, do you find in his paper, or his notes, any such
matter as this? “He then weighed accurately the air of both
kinds, which he exposed to the stream of electricity; and he
afterwards weighed the liquid formed by the combustion: he
found that the two weights corresponded with great accuracy”
(Life of Cavendish, p. 433): and again, “Water equal to the
weight of the two gases taken together remained as the produce
of the combustion.” Cavendish made no such experiments; as
you will find whenever you take the trouble to read either the
documents themselves”, or my account of themf. I have
already stated that this method of determining the composition
of water, which is attended with great practical difficulties, was
tried indeed at a later time by the French philosophers with
such accuracy as it admits               of,
                                   but that Cavendish, with his usual
sagacity, had taken          easier and more certain road having
                              an                                                    ;

                                                                          of he
to   substitute the method                of
                                    volume for that           weight;                          he
found that about two volumes            hydrogenof   and one      oxygen,           of
 when burnt      together,   entirely   disappeared      without loss                          of
 weight, and that pure water was the result. To draw from
 these premises the obvious conclusion, there was                  need             no         to
 weigh  or  compare the weight           the   airs,

                                                     did not compare                           it.

was now received and adopted by almost every chemist.”                                                 A
 detailed account is then given of Cavendish's experiments;
 and it is added, “these experiments were made in 1781, and
 they are undoubtedly conclusive of the composition of water.
 It would appear that Mr. Watt entertained the same ideas on
 this subject.       When he was informed by Dr. Priestley of the
 result of these experiments, he observed, Let us consider
 what obviously happens in the deflagration of oxygen and hy
 drogen gases,” &c. “Thus it appears that Mr. Watt had a
just view of the composition of water, and of the nature of the
process by which            its
                           component parts pass          liquid state from
                                                                    to

 that of     anelastic fluid.”
   In   this account the ideas entertained                     by
                                                   Mr. Watt obtain more
 notice  perhaps     than would have been accorded          them          to              by     an    in
 different historian; but the statement          the discovery

                                       several suppositions:–1st, that
 Priestley had converted water into atmospheric air; 2nd, that
 he   had obtained         weight
                            a                 of

 carbon, combined            in certain proportion with oxygen, con
 stitutes water. All these suppositions agreed perfectly with
 the opinions which Watt really expressed, that water was
                                                                                                       an of

 them   is consistent with the opinions attributed               him           to              by by
 erroneous translation              of
                                 his words, that water      formed       the

    such feelings, as he ought always to have been above their influ
    ence, that may be said without offence of which he so disliked
    the mention; he had the honour of raising himself to the highest
    place among the chemical philosophers of the age, emerging by
    his merit alone from an obscure condition.” A simple anecdote
    may suffice to set his feelings on this subject in a more favour
    able light. When Davy was exhibiting to myself and three
    others the discoveries which he had then recently made rela
    tive to his safety-lamp, and when those present, among whom
    were the Hanoverian minister and the late Lord Lonsdale,
    were highly admiring the beauty of his experiments, with still
    higher admiration I heard him reply, “Yes, I have some rea
    son to be proud of them, for my experiments on flame were
    first made with a tallow candle in an apothecary’s shop.”

                                            is one other scientific
    subject besides the discovery of the composition of water, on
    which you appear to have bestowed some consideration,
    namely,–the first discoveries of the gases. Here Cavendish
    is still out of favour with you. You pluck another feather
    from his wing; and having made a present of the discovery
    of water to Mr. Watt, dispense that of hydrogen gas to Dr.
    Black.

116     Rev. W.V. Harcourt on Lord Brougham's statements
 sentaient à l'esprit de Cavendish.          Ceci doit étre regardé
comme une très        grosse omission (a most material omission*).”
 Nothing indeed can be more unfounded than this animadver
sion. In the passage to which you refer, the words of Caven
dish are these:–“ All the foregoing experiments on the ex
plosion of inflammable air with common and dephlogisticated
                                        ††,
airs, except those which relate to the cause of the acid found
in the water, were made by me in the summer of 1781, and
mentioned by me to Dr.                      who in consequence of it
made some experiments of the same kind, as he relates in a paper
printed in a preceding volume of the Transactions.”         Now you
need   only   have referred to the volume of the Transactions
which Cavendish quotes, to have found the “ epoch” which you
wanted.      Priestley's paper was printed in March 1783; and
therefore Cavendish's communication of his “conclusive” ex
periments was anterior to Watt's speculations in April, as well
as to Lavoisier's experiments in June of the same year.
    But though this “most material,” or in M. Arago's transla
tion, this “grosse” omission turns out to be none, you ought,
I  repeat
            of it, have remembered your own demand for pre
                     to
ciseness       dates,   when you ascribed      Black prior know
                                                       to               a

                                                  hydrogen gas.                                 In
proof that Black knew before Cavendish that this gas             “so                  is
much   lighter  than   atmospheric  air,” you allege, that “as  early
as  1766     heinvented the air-balloon, showing        party      his  a              of

dish's  paper?      Professor Leslie tells the    story     the balloon of
somewhat differently from you. “The late most ingenious
and accurate Mr. Cavendish,              1766, found, by
                                             in               most nice     a

   If  you are dissatisfied with Leslie's version of your anecdote,
let me refer you to other authorities. In one of those articles
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica which are stated to have been
º
composed or revised by Professor Miller, Dr. Muirhead, and
Sir David Brewster, the circumstance is thus narrated:—“In
the year 1766 Mr. Henry Cavendish ascertained the weight
and other properties of this gas, determining it to be at least
seven times lighter than atmospheric air. Soon after which
it occurred to Dr. Black that perhaps a thin bag filled with
              gas might be buoyed up by the common atmo
 sphere.”
   I   hope I have now illustrated sufficiently the value of the ca
 non of criticism which you have laid down for these delicate       in
 quiries,—that nothing is so necessary as to “préciser l'époque.”
     “Cavendish,” you say, “only more precisely ascertained
 the specific gravity of inflammable air; and showed, what
 Black could not be ignorant of, that it is the same from what
 ever substance it is obtained.”    Now, in the first place, inflam
 mable air is not the same from whatever substance it is obtained.
 This was the error into which Priestley fell when he attempted
 to repeat the experiments by which Cavendish had discovered
 the composition of water; this was the error under which
  Watt laboured till after the publication of Cavendish's paper
  in 1784, and which nullified the researches of the one and
  the speculations of the other.      But supposing you to mean
  “that inflammable air is the same, whether obtained from zinc
  or iron,” why do you say that Black could not be ignorant of
 that ?    How do you think he was to know it? How did
  Cavendish know it? He tells you that he learnt it by having
 ascertained by experiment that the specific gravity of the gas
  from either material was the same.         Had Black ascertained
 this? Had he     any  test whatever  by  which he could know that
  these gases were the same 2
     But Cavendish “only more precisely ascertained the specific
 gravity of inflammable air.”       Ifany person conversant in the
  history of pneumatic discoveries were to be asked to enume
  rate the most important of the early advances in that branch
  of science, he would certainly name—1st, the discovery of the
  weight of the air by Galileo; 2nd, the discoveries of       its law
 of   compression, and    of  the factitious gases,  byBoyle;    3rd,
 the theory   of  the fixation  of  gases  by  chemical attraction,
 propounded     by  Newton; 4th, the discovery       ofspecific and
 elective affinities in   one  of those gases,  by  Black; 5th, the

118      Rev. W.V. Harcourt on Lord Brougham's statements
 discovery of the difference of specific gravity in several gases,
 by Cavendish.
    You do not distribute their honours to any of these great
 discoverers with a severe attention to matter of fact; but I
 must do you the justice to own that you preserve a principle
 of equity in your adjudications. You omit, it is true, to dwell
 upon, or even to mention, the main point of novelty in the re
 searches of Black; but then you give to Black the discoveries
 of Boyle and Cavendish, and make it up to Cavendish by allow
 ing him a slice of the merit which belongs to Galileo.
      or Cavendish you say, “He carried his mathematical
 habits into the laboratory; and not satisfied with showing the
 other qualities which make it clear that these two aeriform sub
 stances are each sui generis, and the same from whatever sub
 stances, by whatever processes they are obtained,—not satis
 fied with the mere fact that one of them is heavier, and the
 other much lighter than atmospheric air,” (a previous ac
 quaintance with           all
                        which facts you have taken care     ascribe                      to
     Dr. Black) “he inquired into the precise numerical relation
 of to
     their specific gravities with one another and with common
 air, and first showed           an
                           example                 of

                                                   to
 this  respect  air with water.         however sufficiently clear
                                                It     is
 that neither      of
                   these experiments gave the relative measure                                        of
 one air with    another;  nor indeed could they       said   com               be         to
 pare common air with either mercury          water, although theyor
 certainly showed the relative specific gravity    the two bodies,        of
 taking air for the middle term                        or   common measure                 of      their

gases approached too nearly to common air in that respect to
enable the experimenters to establish a distinction.              An at
tempt too had been made by Greenwood, a Professor of
Mathematics at Cambridge in New England, to ascertain the
specific gravity of the deleterious air in a well, which was
doubtless chiefly carbonic gas; but the method employed by
him was not sufficiently delicate to show a difference of den
sity. Such was the state of knowledge, or rather ignorance,
on this subject previous to the experiments of Cavendish.
We have not the least reason to believe that any one had
observed the different weights of the different kinds of air.
Dr. Mayow” indeed about a century before had supposed
his “nitro-igneous aura,” to the combinations of which he
ascribed the phaenomena of acidification, combustion and                                                          vi
tality, to be heavier than the residual air from which it is
separated in those processes; and this opinion, which proved
to be correct, he entertained so distinctly, as to represent the
specific lightness of the vitiated air, after it had served                                                        its

was, that the elasticity  of the air had been destroyed. Dr.
Hales, dissatisfied with so loose an explanation, accounted for
the loss, which in the case of nitrous acid he first observed,
after the following manner:—“When fresh air is           into the                                       let

tell us that Black “<U+017F>ound this gas incondensable,” but he has
nowhere told us as much himself; and you might with more
safety have presumed the contrary; the true statement being,
that he and his predecessors had found it condensable, and
that Cavendish found the conditions under which it is not
condensed.

124      Rev. W.V. Harcourt on Lord Brougham's statements
scientific men at the period immediately preceding Black's dis
coveries. The article “Air,’ in the French Encyclopédie, was
published in 1751, and written by D'Alembert himself. It                                                  is,
as  might       be
                 expected, able, clear and elaborate. He assumes
                       of
                                                                   of be
the substance           the atmosphere                        to

name     of air, and        to    be
                              the foundation             other permanently all
elastic bodies. When D'Alembert wrote this article,                      gave                    he
the doctrine then        universally   received,   that      the other kinds     all
of air were only impure, and that this fluid alone was perma
nently elastic,        all
                        other vapours being only like steam, tempo
rarily acriform.         Once the truth was made known, that there
are other gases             nature, only careful observation was re
                            in

    It was       December 1659 that Boyle published his “New

Physico-mechanical           Experiments,” among which                                       is     to    be

bodies, which              he

just  as Mayow identified with it the gas from saltpetre.
   In giving to the gases which he discovered the title of
                                                       ..
“factitious airs,” Boyle did not confound them with common
air. The extracts which I have given sufficiently show that
he used the word air generically, in the sense
                                                   I
                                                       he assigns
to it in the following passage:—“If were to allow acids to
be one principle, it should be only in some such metaphysical
sense as that wherein air is said to be one body, though it
consist of the associated effluviums of a multitude of corpus
cles of very different natures that agree in very little, save in
their being minute enough to concur in the composition of a
fluid aggregate consisting of flying parts+.”
    It would indeed be a great mistake in the history of science,
 to suppose that the notion of the air being a simple element
 prevailed among philosophers down to the days of Black.
 From the time of that remarkable revolution in the scientific
 mind of Europe which attended the revival of the mechanico
 corpuscular philosophy, when the phaenomena of nature were
 accounted for no longer by forms and qualities, but by the
 sizes and motions, the cohesions and disjunctions of the par
 ticles of bodies, the atmosphere came at once to be conceived
 of as a miscellaneous aggregate of the molecules of a variety
 of heavy substances thrown into an elastic state, or floating in
 an active medium of a still finer and more divided consistence.
     “Tout corps invisible et impalpable,” says Descartes, “se
 nomme air, à savoir en sa plus ample signification<U+017F>.”       “By
 air,” says Dr. Wallis,      “I
                              find Mr. Hobbs would sometimes
 have us understand a    pure aether, ‘aerem ab omni terrae aquae
  que effluviis purum, qualis putatur esse aether,’ to which                 I
  suppose answers the materia subtilis of Descartes, and M.
  Hugens's “more subtile matter’ than air: on the other hand,
  M. Hugens here by air seems to understand that feculent mat
  ter arising from those the earth's and water's effluvia, which
 and the loss of weight came to ºrd part of a grain.      May 30,—I endea
 voured to burn the same minium again, but such plenty of air was pro
 duced, that the glass broke into a hundred pieces.”
    * “At the same time that I got the air above-mentioned from mercurius
 calcinatus and the red precipitate, I had got the same kind from red lead
 or minium.     In this process that part of the minium on which the focus of
 the lens had fallen turned yellow. The experiment with red lead con
 firmed me more in my suspicion, that the merc. calcinatus must have got
 the property of yielding this kind of air from the atmosphere, the process
 by which that preparation and this of red lead is made being similar.”—

 130          Rev. W.V. Harcourt on Lord Brougham's statements
are intermingled with this subtle matter. We mean by air the
aggregate of both these, or whatever else makes up that hete
rogeneous fluid wherein we breathe, commonly called air, the
purer part of which is Mr. Hobbs’s air, and the feculent of it
 is   M. Hugens's air”.”
      It
      is curious to trace the fortunes of this materia subtilis,
from the naked condition in which it was first ushered into
notice, to the figure which it now makes in the speculations of
Sclence.
   l)escartes was undoubtedly the first who formed the idea of
a liquid medium grosser than heat, but more subtle than air,
extending from the heavenly bodies to the earth, filling the
aërial interstices with a continuous series of molecular globules,
pervading the pores of glass, diamond, and the densest sub
stances, without interruption, and propagating, by communi
cation of impulses from one molecule to another, the move
ment, or rather the pressure without locomotion, simple and
compound, which he considered as constituting lightt and
colours.
   This was a grand conception, for which the philosophy of
optics is under an obligation to the inventor greater perhaps
than has been confessed. But the range of Descartes's views
in physics was too limited to admit of his turning such a con
ception to                its
                full account.    He seems    have had no idea                         to                             of
intermittent      elastic forces, and did not even endow either

his filaments of air, or his aethereal globules interposed between
them, with attractive or repulsive powers.
   The genius of Hook, so comprehensive of clear physical
notions, soon lent to this luminiferous aether the mechanical
attribute which it needed, and added the notion of vibratory
pulses,—a notion which was instantly reduced by Newton to
the form most competent to account for the phaenomena”,
and on which Huygens founded, and Young with his illus
trious coadjutors have gone far to finish, the mathematical
fabric of the undulatory theory of light, as it is now commonly
received.
   So necessary indeed to any account of the phaenomena of
light and colours did the admission of such a medium appear,
that Wallis, who not only rejected the use which Huygens and
others proposed to make of it in explaining the extraordinary
height at which mercury, purged of air, may be suspended in
a tube, but denied it the properties of elasticity and weight,
nevertheless did not scruple to say, “That there is in our air
 a body more subtle than the fumes and vapours mixed with it
 in our lower region is very certain: but whether that subtle
 body be, as Dr. Garden seems to suppose, much heavier than
 our common air, I much doubt, and rather think it is not, not
 having hitherto had any cogent experiment either to prove it
 heavy or elastic; but it may, for aught I know, be void as
 well of weight as spring, and what is found of either in our
 common air may be attributed to the other mixtures in itt.”
le mouvement des corps lumineux ne peut passer jusques à nos yeux, qu'il
ny passe quelque chose de matériel qui sorte deces corps; car je ne fais en
ces deux pages qu’expliquer la comparaison d'un aveugle, laquelle j'ai prin
cipalement apportée pour faire voir en quelle sorte le mouvement peut passer
sans le mobile; et je ne crois pas que vous pensiez lorsque cet aveugle touche
son chien de son báton qu'il faille que ce chien passe tous le long de son
bâton jusque a sa main, afin qu'il en sent les mouvements.         Mais afin que
je vous reponds in forma, quand vous dites que le mouvement n'est jamais
 sans le mobile, distinguo; car il ne peut véritablement étre sans quelque
 corps, mais il peut bien Étre transmis d'un corps en un autre, et ainsi passer
 des corps lumineux vers nos yeux par l'entremise d’un tiers, a savoir, comme
je dis en la page 4, par l'entremise de l’air et des autres corps transparents,
 ou comme j'explique plus distinctement en la page 6, par l'entremise d'une
 matière fort subtile qui remplit    lespores deces corps et  s'étend depuis les

XXIV.     On Fresnel's Theory of Double Refraction.   By R.
     Moon, M.A., Fellow of Queen's College Cambridge, and of
     the Cambridge Philosophical                     Society.

        proving, as he imagines, the existence of the three
AFTER
   axes of elasticity, Fresnel enters into the most elaborate
calculations as to the motion of the originally disturbed par
ticle, and then proceeds to discuss the laws according to which
the disturbance is transmitted from it to the rest of the ine
dium. His labours in this respect are perfectly futile. The
 motion of the original particle, which is of the most simple
 character, is altogether different from what he supposes; and
 as to the laws according to which the disturbance is commu
nicated from it to the rest of the medium, no disturbance what
ever can be propagated.
    As to the first point, Sir John Herschel proceeds: —“Sup
pose now any molecule set in vibration,” in a plane passing
through the centre of the surface of elasticity, “then at any
 period of        its       will not     urged directly

                 of                        the least diameter ofof

palpable.   We may resolve the actual force         the particle               on

disturbance communicated in the direction of the greatest,
and then of another communicated in the direction of the least

                            2 = Ancos (ct + Bil),
where AA, Am. B B, Bn are constants to be determined from
the initial circumstances of the motion of the particle.       From
these equations, coupled with the fact which Fresnel assumes
in his demonstration of the axes of elasticity, viz. that the
change of position of the surrounding particles from the state
of rest does not affect the forces upon the disturbed particle,
we gather, that (1) without some special interposition of pro
vidence directed to each individual particle, it would never
move at all, whatever might be the state, whether of rest or mo
tion, of the other particles around it; and (2) that once in motion,
it would vibrate for ever without the least reference to or influ
ence upon the other particles. In my former paper, I said that
Fresnel was driven to make an assumption as to the velocity
of propagation, which rested only on the analogy of a case
most widely differing from that under consideration.          I now
show that it is futile to talk of the velocity of propagation,
when on his own showing no wave whatever can be propa
gated.
        I
     purpose, in a future paper, to consider Fresnel's expres
sions for the intensity of the reflected and refracted rays when
polarized light is incident on a surface.

                                    in this Journal some months ago, upon
                             co and cos co, I entered upon the discus
sion        of the value of the series 1–1 + 1–1 +&c. continued to
infinity, which         I
                        then showed to be 1 or 0 indifferently, in
opposition        to the commonly received opinion, which would
make it equal to            #.      Prof. Young appears to be partly of
my opinion in this respect, but seems to think   have made a           I
mistake in supposing this to hold in    cases; for    all
                                                      appears                   he

     Itis somewhat difficult to conceive how, by considering the
 series 1      –
              1 + 1 — &c. as the limit of another series, or by
 considering it in any other point of view, we can make                                                                                      its
 value different from what                 the limit   the series is.       If   it

  Prof. Young appears to be haunted by the ghost of an ar
gument, and it is somewhat difficult for others whose rest is
not scared by the same phantom, to tell what he is driving at;
but it appears to me that his difficulties, whatever they may
be, arise from an inaccurate mode of expression which has
crept into use, and of which he has not perceived the impro

I would observe that the expression, the limit of the series

the series tends, when the difference between A and 1 gra
dually diminishes; and from which value (or rather quantity)
it can be made to differ by a quantity less than any that can
be assigned. But there is no propriety in the expression, “the
limit of the series when A = 1.” The phrase should be, the
particular value of the series when A = 1. It is perfectly true
that so long as the difference between A and 1 is an actual
magnitude (which phrase                      I

       The Professor begins, “The general expression for the
 sum     of the infinite series

 profess to understand. But it appears to me that

 and          I   am induced to think that Prof. Young himself will come
 to be of the same opinion when he again undertakes to exa
 mine the subject.
    It is unnecessary for me to reply to the argument of the
 present paper, which appears to rest upon one of Prof. Young's
 previous fallacies which I have elsewhere exposed.        I shall
 merely advert to the conclusion at which he ultimately arrives,
 “that it is indisputably true that the extreme of the convergent
 cases of the above series S, usually written in the form
                      1   1 + 1 - 1 + &c.    –
...       1                                                                             -
 is     a         and that the extreme                               of       the divergent cases, usually
        ,
 written     the same form,
                      in         really infinite,    stated is  his                                 as                   in
 former  paper.”
  I   am afraid that Prof. Young will         apt    mystify both                       be          to
 himself and his readers                           by
                             talking about “the extreme         the                                                      of
 divergent cases” and “the extreme         the  convergent  cases.”                 of
    these “extremes” are usually written under the above form,
I If                               “extremely” improper. But
   can only say that such usage                                          is

dium in a     crystallized   body    is resisted by different elastic
forces according to the different directions in which the dis

   This is not a mere speculative hypothesis, but is based on
experiment.      It is found that glass, possessing only the power
of single or ordinary refraction, may be made by the applica
tion of heat, or by mechanical pressure, to possess that of
double refraction.
   It is further supposed that the medium is symmetrical with
respect to three rectangular axes in space, but, in general, not
symmetrical with respect to any other axis through the same
origin. These axes are called the axes of elasticity. It is
then proved, that if any particle of the aether be suddenly dis
placed, the other particles remaining quiescent, the force of
restitution developed by such disturbance will not in general be
in the direction of the displacement, but only when such dis
placement is in the direction of the aforesaid axes of elasticity.
The elegant demonstration of Smith, quoted by Mr. Moon,

                      Remarks on            Mr. Moon's Papers.                                             14.5
of so great an analyst, is surely no slight recommendation of
the theory.
  Mr. Moon subsequently gives a quotation from Airy's
Tracts, concerning which he is by no means sparing in arro
gant and supercilious criticism... But is it likely that Airy
would make such a fool of himself as Mr. Moon earnestly en
deavours to represent?          It must be remembered, that at the
time  Airy's   Tracts were     published,   very little of the undula
tory theory was studied or known in Cambridge.
   It was the part of this philosopher, therefore, to put every
thing as much as possible in the clearest and most simple point
of view. That there are, and will perhaps long continue to
be, difficulties in the undulatory theory, none of           supporters                 its
                                                                 glossed                      or
                            of of
will deny.     None       those difficulties are shirked
over  in  the Tract     Airy;         plainly   he
                                              acknowledges    each                                         as

   Does Mr. Moon know anything           analysis?  He was          of

  146              Remarks on    Mr. Moon's    Papers.
 tures on the writings of another distinguished mathematician, besides
 the reply to Mr. Young which they now publish.
    In the admission of mathematical articles, the Editors are obliged
 to consult both quantity and character, as follows:—
    It is not in their power to admit any very great quantity of pure
 mathematics.     The majority of the readers of the Magazine are
 more interested in other sciences, and the Magazine would soon
 cease to exist if it were more than sparingly supplied with articles
 on lofty mathematical subjects.
    As to the character of their mathematical articles, the Editors are
 placed in a peculiar position.   They do not themselves profess to be
 so conversant with the higher mathematics as to rely entirely on
 their own judgement.     In the articles which they insert, they must
 be guided by opinions. If they occasionally insert an article in which
 the general opinions of mathematicians are controverted, it is because
 they feel that mathematicians themselves would occasionally like to
 see the manner in which dissent from generally received principles
 manifests itself; and because they know that such occasional inser
 tion will not, in the eyes of those same mathematicians, make them,
the Editors, appear to be assuming a side in controversies of the me
rits of which they are not sufficient judges.
    But if the Editors were to lend their Magazine to an extensive
 system of attack upon any usual results and methods of mathema
tics, either pure or mixed, they feel that they could not escape the
charge of presumption. Whatever might be thought of an occasional
paper, they feel sure that a series of such papers would cause them
to be considered, and justly considered, as expressing an opinion on
matters in which their knowledge is but limited.     They would make
just the same answer to a proposition for as extensive a system of
defence to be inserted in their Magazine.      They would suggest to
both assailants and defendants to carry their communications to
quarters in which they will find more competent judges. The pages
of the Philosophical Transactions, of the Memoirs of the Royal Irish
Academy, of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, of the Cambridge
Mathematical Journal, &c., are much fitter vehicles for extensive ma
thematical discussion than those of the Philosophical Magazine.
    As to one point, however, the Editors feel that a responsibility
rests upon themselves, namely, as to the tone and temper in which
controversial communications are expressed. They are persuaded
that the differing opinions of men of science upon difficult subjects
may be fully conveyed without any deviation from the respect and
courtesy with which public discussion ought to be conducted :-and
they feel regret when anything which is objectionable in this respect
obtains a place in their pages.

    Thus it appears that different bodies are acted upon by the mag
  netic forces in two different and opposite modes; and they may ac
 cordingly be arranged in two classes; the one, of which iron is the
 type, constituting those usually denominated magnetics; the other,
 of which bismuth may be taken as the type, obeying a contrary law,
 and therefore coming under the generic appellation of diamagnetics.
 The author has examined a vast variety of substances, both simple
 and compound, and in a solid, liquid, or gaseous form, with a view
 to ascertain their respective places and relative order with reference
 to this classification.     The number of simple bodies which belong
 to the class of magnetics is extremely limited, consisting only of
 iron, which possesses the magnetic property in an eminent degree,
 nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium, cerium, titanium, palladium,
 platinum and osmium. All other bodies, when either solid or liquid,
 are diamagnetic ; that                        is,

Of these phenomena, the diamagnetic are the most important, from
their extending largely, and in a new direction, that character of
duality which the magnetic force was already known, in a certain

the following characters:    it has the form of small crystalline laminae,
usually radiating from a centre; it is sometimes separated from dis
thene by a thin stratum of yellowish oxide of iron, evidently result
ing either from the recent decomposition of disthene, or of the rock
in which it occurs. In fragments, the substance is yellowish-white,
and translucent; is cut by the knife, and formed by the agglomera
tion of a multitude of small laminae, indicating a radiated structure;
these laminae are perfectly transparent, but have no crystalline form.
   The cohesion of this substance is slight, but still it is difficult to
reduce it to a fine powder.      When pulverized it has the appearance
of small scales of a shining silvery-white colour, with a pearly lustre;
it is soft to the touch, but not unctuous like talc; it is harder than
talc, for it scratches it; but it is not so hard as fluor spar; its den
sity is 2:792; after drying at 212° and heated in a tube, it yields
 water; when dried over sulphuric acid in vacuo, it loses only a few
 thousandths of                its
                      weight, and retains        water, which       conse      its                          is

    Twenty grains of this mineral in very fine powder, were fused
with four times their weight of carbonate of potash; the mass was
treated with muriatic acid, and no smell of chlorine observed.                                                            Si

by ammonia was dissolved in muriatic acid, the solution boiled
 with excess of potash which took up the alumina, and the matter
left by this alkali was dissolved in muriatic acid; to this solution
tartaric acid and ammonia in excess were added, and a current of
sulphuretted hydrogen, passed into                                it,

ANALYSIS OF METEORIC IRON FROM BURLINGTON, OSTEGO
      COUNTY, NEw York.  BY MR. C. H. Rockwell.
   In the year 1819 two or three masses of native iron, as it ap
peared to be, were procured from the farmer who first turned it over
with his plough, in a field near the north line of the town of Bur
lington, Ostego County, New York. These consisted of remnants of
an entire mass originally supposed to weigh between one and two
hundred pounds, and found several years before. It had been in the
forge of a country blacksmith, and the whole heated in order to en
able him to cut off portions for the manufacture of such articles as
the farmer most needed.
   The mass was divided by broad laminae, crossing each other at
an angle of 60° and 120°, cutting up the surface into triangular and
rhombohedral figures.          It broke with a hackly fracture, and only
with the    greatest  difficulty  on the thinnest edges.

 COMPOSITION OF PHOSPHATE OF AMMON IA AND MAGNESIA.
                  BY M. Fr.ESENIUS.
  The erroneous statements contained in chemical treatises with
respect to the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate have given inaccurate

ON SEVERAL NEW SERIES OF DOUBLE OXALATES.                                                                  BY M. REES

   These salts were discovered in investigating the action of alkaline
and earthy bases on the oxalates of the sesquioxides.
   It is well known that the salts of lime produce but a slight pre
cipitation of oxalate of lime in a moderately concentrated solution
of the oxalates of the sesquioxides of iron and chromium, &c., and
none in a very dilute solution of oxalate of chromium and potash, a
salt discovered by Prof. Gregory, and in which there are 3 equiv.
of oxalic acid combined with the alkaline base. A concentrated
solution of the same salts gives rise to an abundant precipitate,
which has been considered as oxalate of lime, but in which I found
a considerable proportion of chromium. These were the facts which
led me to pursue this inquiry.
   The combination by means of which I have prepared the double
salts which are the objects of this memoir, is an oxalate of chromium
and ammonia, having the same formula as the salt of Mr. Gregory;
but it is preferable to this on account of     great solubility.                its

oxalate. The salts of chromium however behave differently towards
ammonia, which does not throw down the oxide of chromium, even
when the barytes has been separated by sulphuric acid.
   The iron salts are decomposed by the solar rays, with an abundant
disengagement of carbonic acid, even when the crystals are dry.
   I shall conclude this summary of my investigations by drawing
attention to the importance of these salts in analysis; the more so as
it was with this view I undertook them.
     I
     think that I have succeeded in explaining the fact, long since
known, of the solubility of the oxalate of lime in solutions of the
sesquioxides.   Iron, aluminum and chromium are always separated
from their ores as sesquioxides; lime and strontia, in the state of
oxalates; but we know that lime cannot be separated from the solu
tion of the sesquioxide; this circumstance is owing to the formation
of a double salt, of which the oxalate of lime forms a part. It is
therefore necessary to precipitate the sesquioxide by ammonia, which
leaves the lime free in the solution, and it is therefore difficult to pre
vent      its
          being thrown down by the carbonic acid                 the atmosphere,        of

      EXPERIMENTS         ON  THE YOLK OF EGGS.     BY M., GOBLEY.
     The author remarks, that a German chemist of the name of John
 was the first who carefully examined the yolk of the egg, the
 chemists who preceded him regarding it merely as consisting of
 water, albumen, oil, gelatine and colouring matter.    John concluded
 from his experiments, published in 1811, that the yolk of egg was
 composed of water, a sweet yellow oil, traces of free acid, which he
 presumed to be the phosphoric, a small quantity of reddish-brown
 matter, soluble in aether and in alcohol, gelatin, much of a modified
  albuminous substance, and sulphur.
     In 1825, Prout found the yolk to be composed of 54 water, 17 al
 bumen, and 29 oil; and that it contained besides sulphur, phospho
 rus, the chlorides of sodium and potassium, the carbonates of potash
 and soda, lime and magnesia, partly in the state of carbonates.
     Chevreul was of opinion that the orange colouring matter of the
 yolk was due to the combination of two colouring principles, one
 yellow, approximating that of the bile, and the other red, resembling
 that of the blood.
    Lastly, in 1829, M. Lecanu discovered in the oil of the egg, a fat,
 crystallizable, unsaponifiable matter, which he considered to be
 cholestrine.
     Such, says M. Gobley, was the state of our knowledge respecting
 the yolk of the egg when he began his experiments; he states that
 the substances which he obtained from the yolk are,
      .   Water.
       .  Albuminous     matter or vitelline.
      .   Oleine.

   In the opinion of Berzelius, the yolk of egg contains some volatile
fatty acids, on account of the facility with which the yolk becomes
rancid; M. Gobley has not been able to discover them, nor any ge
latine, and sulphur was met with only in the albuminous matter.—

XXX.     On the Determination of the Temperature and Con
  ducting Power of Solid Bodies.   By CHR. LANGBERG of
  Christiania *.
                          the important progress which
NoTWITHSTANDING
   has been made in the mathematical theory of the phae
nomena of heat by the analytical researches of Fourier, Pois
son and others, it is not to be denied that the influence which
these have exerted upon the extension of our physical know
ledge of the phaenomena is very limited, and that only a few
of the results obtained from mathematical theory have been
demonstrated and proved by experiment. The reason of this
is in a great measure owing to the want of accurate modes of
ascertaining changes of temperature in solid bodies, without
militating against too many of the conditions required by the
mathematical theory.
    Thus we are taught by mathematical analysis that one of the
most important elements in the theory of heat, namely the con
ducting power of solids, can be ascertained by placing in con
nexion with a constant source of heat the end of a long, thin,
homogeneous, cylindrical or prismatical rod, composed of the
substance to be examined, and observing the temperature of
this rod at different distances from the heated end; the differ
ence between the observed temperatures on the rod and that of
the surrounding air decreases in geometrical progression when
the points of observation are at equal distances from each other.
    For establishing these laws experiments have been instituted
by Biott, and more lately by Despretz f ; those of the latter

162      M. Langberg               on the Determination                 of the         Temperature
 however, as far as they have been made public, appear to me
 to prove exactly the converse of what they are intended to do,
 as the temperatures observed decrease in a much quicker ratio
 than the geometrical progression would require, and the dif
 ference between the calculated and observed values is too con
 stant to admit of the supposition that it is solely due to errors
 of observation. One source of the difference may probably
 arise from the Newtonian law of cooling having been made
 the basis upon which to found the mathematical deduction of
 the law in question.         According to Newton's law, a heated
body cools with a rapidity proportional to the degree of tem
perature to which it has been raised above that of the air sur
rounding           it,
                 and applies with correctness only            very slight              to

                   temperature.       [In the   experiments

tween the temperature of the rod and the surrounding air as
would come with accuracy within the scope of the Newtonian
law of cooling, and this must be done with rods of indefinitely
small diameter, having their continuity unimpaired by any
holes bored into their substance. The thermo-electrical battery
appeared to me to be an instrument admirably adapted for
this purpose; and arranged in the manner which I shall pre
sently describe, I hope that it will be found a much more ac
curate measure for observing uncombined heat in solid bodies
than any other means that have yet been applied to that
purpose.
    The experiments were performed in the laboratory of Pro
fessor Magnus, who was kind enough to lend me the necessary
apparatus, and to whose friendly guidance the successful re
sult of the experiments is chiefly to be attributed.
  I   found by several preliminary experiments, that the same
divergence in the needle of the multiplier was always attained
when the end of a thermo-electrical battery, consisting of but
few alternations, was connected in a similar manner with a
body of constant temperature, and pressed against it with the
same amount of force. It was always 2 to 2% minutes before
the needle of the multiplier became stationary; the connec
tion might then be continued for an indefinite time without
perceptibly affecting the position of the needle.      In order to
secure perfectly uniform contact, which is hardly possible
                                                        I
with a battery composed of many alternations, had one con
structed of only two elements, bismuth and antimony, having
therefore but one soldered point of contact at each end. The
ends were filed off presenting facets, so that each presented a
rectangular surface of 1.7 millimetre in length and 0.7 milli
metre in breadth. The whole length of the bars was 36-8
millimetres; each bar was very thin, being 1.7 millimetre in
width and 1.0 millimetre thick.
    On a strong horizontal board, on which divisions had been
 marked, three uprights were erected, bearing each a forked arm
 in which were fixed two perpendicular glass rods drawn out
 to a point and placed opposite to each other, between which
 the metallic bars to be examined were clamped parallel to the
 horizontal divided board, and at about 24 centimetres above it;
 a fourth upright at the end of the board served to           fix
                                                         securely,

that part of the rod to be examined were effectually protected
from the radiant heat of the boiling vessel.             The support of
the battery was screwed to a sledge which could be moved alon
the edge of the horizontal divided board in a direction
with the metallic rod, by which means the relative distances
                                                                                 ...i
of the points to be examined on the rod and their tempera
tures could be easily ascertained.          In order that the battery
should    press with  equal     force each time against the rod, a
spiral spring was so placed in the support of the battery as
to force it upwards against the under side of the rod; or it
could be brought into contact with the rod in a direction at
 right angles to      it.
    The observations were made               the following manner:—

 having noted the divergence, removed the battery. After each

portion of the semi-diurnal movements of the barometer which
occur in that country; but these causes are not sufficient to
produce the diurnal fluctuations in other places, such as Bom.
bay, Calcutta and La Guayra. And there can be little doubt
that the real causes, whatever they may be, which give rise
to the double undulations in these tropical parts, produce them
in places where they are less extensive, although the opera
tion of the causes in the latter places may be weaker and
more difficult to trace.
     I
    have shown in my “Atmospheric Changes” that there is
no reason to believe that the daily warming of the atmo
spheric gases by the direct influence of the sun produces any
appreciable alteration in their pressure on the mercury of the
barometer, as the effect of that warming on the whole column
in the locality is so small, as to prevent much disturbance of
atmospheric pressure; yet great influence has been attributed
to solar heating near the surface in producing the semi-diurnal
fluctuations that take place.
   Colonel Sabine, in his Report on the Meteorology of
Toronto at the meeting of the British Association in 1844,
gives an explanation of the daily oscillations. He says, “As
the temperature of the day increases, the earth becomes warmed
and imparts heat to the air in contact with            and causes    it,                          it
                                                                                                  to
ascend. The column                      of
                                air over the place          observation    of
thus warmed      rises,  and    portion     a
                                                       of
                                                diffuses itself
                                                       it             the                    in
higher regions         of
                        the atmosphere, where the temperature                                      at
the surface      less. Hence the statical pressure
                  is                                        the column        of
                    On the other     hand,           temperature   falls,

is diminished.                                 the
the column    contracts,   and receives         turn   inportion      air a                  of
which passes over          the higher regions from spaces where
                               in
higher temperature prevails; and thus the statical pressure                                        is a
augmented.”

               of                   Colonel Sabine therefore, after
having examined Dr. Buist's meteorological registers, retains
the opinion that the semi-diurnal alterations               the gaseous       of
pressure are produced           alterations by   temperature,of     that                     as

  names.    I shall therefore call the Colonel’s “the temperature
  theory,” and the other, “the condensation theory.”       Both of
  these rest on alterations of temperature; but the former de
  pends on the temperature found by thermometric measure
  ment near the earth's surface, and the latter on the temperature
  which must be produced by condensation of vapour in a
  higher part of the atmosphere, of which we have no direct
  measure.
     The semi-diurnal fluctuations of the barometer are the
  greatest within the tropics; and as details of those at Bombay
  have not yet been published, we will proceed to examine ac
  counts furnished by Kaemtz in his valuable work on Meteo
  rology. In page 248 of that work we have the following tables
  of the hourly heights of the barometer:—

  fluctuations are the greatest, within the tropics, and they
  diminish, though not invariably, with the increase    latitude.                                                                                      of

    The first column exhibits the fluctuations at          the equator in
the    great ocean. The        range extends   beyond    two millimetres,
and the descent from 9 in the morning till 4 in the afternoon
gives the whole extent of the range.
    The two next columns show the alterations at Cumana and
La Guayra, both above 10° north latitude, and the ranges are
nearly equal to that at the equator.
    The fourth column shows the changes at Calcutta to be
nearly as great as in the preceding places, but both this and
the La Guayra columns exhibit singular irregularities in the
earlier parts of the mid-day descents.
    In the Padua column, 45° north, the fluctuation is much
reduced in the extent of                    its

   As however the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere presses
on the mercury of the barometer separately and independently,
it has been attempted to be shown that the variable pressure
of the vapour arising from difference in the quantity in the
atmosphere at different periods of the day, combined with
change of the gaseous pressure resulting from alteration of
surface temperature, and that the two causes acting together
produced the double undulation of the barometer;                            to this
view therefore we will direct our attention.
   The temperature near the surface of the earth at Plymouth,
as well as at the other places, rises from about 5 in the
morning till about 2 in the afternoon; and when the wet
bulb, as well as the dry thermometer, is used, as it was at
Plymouth, it is seen that the temperature of the latter rises
more than that of the former, or of the dew-point, and eva
poration must consequently become progressively more active;

there must therefore be successively more water evaporated
and thrown into the atmosphere to be added to              weight.                                  its

  Those who advance the temperature theory,                                                     say that the

 these two influences still acting together cause the barometer
  to fall!    This      attributing opposite effects
                            is                                     the same                 to

shown by the ordinary thermometer; the second, the tempe
rature of the wet-bulb thermometer, as kept down by the cool
ing influence of evaporation; and the third gives the differ
ence between the two first. Now as this difference arises from
the extent of the evaporation, the numbers of the difference
may be taken to express the force and amount of evaporation,
and to indicate the additional vapour that is discharged into
the atmosphere.    This force or amount at 5 o'clock in the
morning is 1°:21, from which time it increases to 3°39 at 10
o'clock. So that during this time, five hours, the increase in
the force of evaporation is 2° 18; and this in the temperature
theory must be held to be sufficient to overcome the lightening
effect of a rise of 5°86 of temperature, and also to raise the
mercury of the barometer to the full extent of the morning
rise ! After this time, from 10 to 1 o'clock, the temperature
rises further from 52°84 to 55°83 or 2°-99; and during the
same period the force of evaporation increases 1°89, that                                                     is,

      HE   aberration of light having been brought before the
       notice of the readers of this Journal by several recent

out saying a few more words respecting the principles to be
applied in the explanation of the phaenomenon, which possibly
may appear, after                  all
                       that has been said,      involved     un               to   be                  in

The difference, or aberration, is readily calculated from know
ing by observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, the
ratio of the earth's velocity to the velocity of light. Being so
calculated the amount is found to be the same as the amount of
 aberration independently determined by astronomical observa
 tion.    It follows from this accordance, not only that the aber
 ration of light is entirely accounted for on these principles,
 but also, as a corollary, that the direction of the progression
 of light from a star, as it enters the eye, is the true direction of
 the star.     Whether it be the star, or the terrestrial object
 to which it is referred, that is seen in        true place,      its

180                      Prof. Draper on the Cause of the
fibrine from the vegetable world. During the incubation of
an egg we see this substance arising from albumen, and the
analogy is probably continued in higher forms of existence.
Neither is it by any means certain that fibrine exists in a state
of solution in the blood. But, as we shall presently see, the
probabilities are that it coagulates as it is produced by the
 metamorphosis of the blood, that metamorphosis being ori
ginally due to the act of respiration.            Under an accelerated
respiration, the discs oxidize with corresponding rapidity and
the amount of fibrine increases; but if the supply of oxygen
be limited, there is a restraint on the change of the discs, and
 the amount of fibrine declines.
    The ultimate products of these metamorphoses include of
course     allthe results             of
                                the intervening stages, and those                                       ul
timate products are chiefly water, ammonia and carbonic acid.
We are justified therefore these physiological discussions

    Erplanatory Remarks on the Coagulation of the Blood.—
 When blood recently drawn is kept in a vessel for a space of
 time it spontaneously separates into two well-defined portions,
 the one liquid and the other a soft solid—the serum and the
clot.
    Physicians generally regard this as due to the death of the
 blood.    Whilst it is in the system it is under the influence of
 the vital force; but when removed it spontaneously undergoes
the change in question, and, unable to keep                primitive con                              its
 dition, coagulates and dies.          Accordingly this partial solidifi

   In a paroxysm of asthma the lungs become obstructed with
mucous secretions, and the rapidity of oxidation is therefore
interfered with. Under such circumstances the passage of the
blood is retarded, as is shown by the great dilatation of the
jugular veins.
    Whatever therefore deranges the process of oxidation de
 ranges the flow of the blood. In violent expirations, such as in
 coughing, the observations of Haller show that the blood
 moves tardily in the lungs, and in delicate persons       retar                                   its

    In    a violent and continuous explosion                 laughter, the          of

                   Resino-bezoardic Acid Calculi.
      ERY    shortly   after commencing the examination of the
       calculi in the College collection, my attention was drawn
 to several concretions which possessed the easy fusibility and
 general characters of a resin, and which were described in
 the MS. Catalogue as “false West Indian Bezoars,” on the
 supposition that they were artificial compounds. The peculiar
 characters however of the resin of which they consisted, and
 their finely laminated structure, which it would be impossible
 to imitate, left no doubt on my mind of their being genuine
 bezoars, and in January 1841 I described them to the
 Museum Committee as consisting of a vegetable resin, derived
 most probably from the resinous juices of the plants on which
 the wild goats of the East had fed.          In the same year a very
 interesting paper appeared in the Annalen der Chemie und
 Pharmacie, by M. Goebel, describing a new species of calculus
 which he had found in the Zoological Museum at Dorpat,
 and to which, on the supposition of              being      biliary con
                                                            its
 cretion,   he gave the name             of
                                   litho<U+017F>ellinic acid.       similar calAa
 culus from the Pathological Museum             Göttingen was shortly

which have induced me therefore               place the calculi among

194                  Mr. T. Taylor        on some
    Resino-bezoardic acid calculi are usually of an oval figure.
Their external surface is smooth and polished, and has gene
rally a greenish yellow, green, or a light brown colour. They
are made up of thin concentric layers, which are frequently
of a deeper tint than the exterior. In the centre of the cal
culus some foreign body is invariably found which forms the
nucleus.       These calculi are exceedingly brittle; the fracture
is conchoidal, and has a resinous lustre. They vary con
siderably in size, but are usually larger than the ellagic acid
species. One specimen in the Museum measures nearly ten
i.
inches in circumference,         They melt like resin in the flame
of a candle, and when more highly heated, give off white va
           which have an aromatic odour, catch fire, burn with a
   rilliant flame, and leave behind a small shining carbonaceous
ash.
     Resino-bezoardic acid calculi readily dissolve in alcohol,
 with the exception of a small quantity of flocculent matter.
 The alcoholic solution varies in colour in different calculi, but
 is usually of a red or greenish-red tint. The solution gradu
 ally deposits small crystals, which, when examined by the
 microscope, are seen to consist of low six-sided prisms with
 flattened extremities.       When the alcoholic solution is mixed
 with water the resin is thrown down. The precipitate appears
 under the microscope in the form of small crystalline tufts.
     Digested in solution of potass these calculi readily dissolve,
 the solution is of a brownish green colour, and when neutral
 ized by an acid, a thick curdy precipitate is produced, which
 by agitation adheres together, and while warm may be kneaded
  between the fingers or drawn into threads like cobbler's-wax.
  The viscidity of this precipitate is owing to another resinous
  matter which the calculi contain; for the pure resino-bezoardic
  acid similarly treated forms an amorphous precipitate which
  cannot be made to adhere together.            They dissolve in solu
  tions of ammonia and      itscarbonate.      concentrated sulphuric
                                                In

                                                        red colour, and

        About 400 grains were reduced      fine powder, mixed

liquid was quite transparent, and possessed the peculiar aro
matic odour of the calculus, but no volatile oil could be de
tected. The powder was separated from the rest of the water
by filtration, and dried at 200°Fahr.      It was dissolved in
twelve ounces of    boiling alcohol.   The solution was of a
bright red colour when viewed by transmitted light, and had
a greenish tinge by reflected light; with the exception of a
small quantity of flocculent matter it was quite transparent.
   In order to separate the insoluble matter, the liquid while
still hot was filtered, and the matter on the filter washed with a
fresh portion of alcohol and dried. This matter was of a dirty
brown colour, with a shade of green.         It was when quite dry
rather soft, so as to admit of being moulded between the fin
gers.    When heated on platina foil it did not fuse, but soft
ened, caught fire, and burnt briskly, emitting at the same time
the odour of heated Indian rubber. It was insoluble in water,
either hot or cold.
   That this substance was not caoutchouc, was shown by                                                 its

   The mother-liquor was mixed with water, when a precipitate
separated which by agitation was converted into a viscid tur
pentine-looking substance that adhered to the sides of the
glass. When a drop of the mother-liquor was evaporated on
a glass plate, very few crystals could be detected, but a great
number of thick, viscid oily-like drops: by heating the glass
vapours arose, and a hard uncrystalline resin was left. When
the alcoholic solution of the crystals was mingled with water,
a crystalline precipitate was thrown down, which beneath the
microscope appeared in the form of small irregularly-shaped
prisms, arranged in stellate groups.         This difference in the
character of the two precipitates appeared to indicate that the

 ever inclines me to believe that the true Occidental Bezoar con
 sisted of diphosphate of lime, and that these concretions, which
 Kaempfer states were termed in Persia Lapis Bezoar Occiden
 talis, on account of their similarity to the concretions brought
 from South America, were so called from their exterior pos
 sessing the same smooth polished exterior as the diphosphate
 of lime concretions. The concretions described by Kaempfer
 under the name of Coagulum Resinosum Bezoarticum, are evi
 dently identical with resino-bezoardic acid calculi; for he says
 that the Swedish ambassador, on his departure from Ispahan,
 purchased some specimens, which, when thrown upon burning
 coals, melted and gave out an aromatic odour like that of co
 lophony or olibanum.        In the work of Clusius there is a
 figure of the occidental bezoar which is quite characteristic of
 this calculus, and Monardes asserts that they were taken from
 the wild goats of Persia. It is not however probable that any
 particular species of concretion was confined exclusively to
 the animals of one or the other hemisphere, since the resinous
 and bitter juices from which the concretions are formed exist
 in the plants of both divisions of the globe.

       GENTLEMEN,
YoutakeR anmeteorological     readers, and especially those who
                interest in the law of storms, will, I am sure, be
glad to have their attention drawn to a second memoir by
Professor Loomis of New York, on the phaenomena of the
great storms which are experienced in the United States du
ring the winter months. In this memoir (Art. IV. of vol. ix.
of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society)
two storms are investigated, one of which occurred about the
3rd of February, 1842, and the other about the 15th of the
same month of the same year. The method of investigation is
the same which Professor Loomis adopted in his account of the
great storm of December 20th, 1836, viz. the assemblage in
one view of the atmospherical circumstances simultaneously
observed over the whole extent of the United States, both
during the continuance of the storm and for one or two pre
ceding days. It is by this path that we may confidently hope
to attain to a knowledge of the causes which produce these
great atmospherical derangements; and, thanks to the spirit

                                    of the United              States.                                        201
of co-operative labour which distinguishes the present time,
we have every prospect of seeing this path successfully pur
sued.    Although the memoir itself is not very long, the illus
trations which accompany it are many, and          republication                    its

the phaenomena of the storm are swept onwards, and trans
ferred successively from the middle to the eastern states, and
thence to the sea, with a velocity which in different instances
has been noted to vary from about twenty to thirty-six statute
miles an hour. The maximum of the thermometer and mini
mum of the barometer coincide generally (and with great
exactness in the eastern states) with the change of the wind,
the derangement of the temperature being so great as 20° and
even occasionally 30° above                  its

   “The principal characteristics were           follows:—After as                           a
cold and clear interval with barometer high, the wind com

                 their  explanation.
    When        itremembered that the temperature
                     is                                    the sur             of

south-eastern states conveys heated water into parallels where
its relative difference from the ordinary ocean-temperature                                  is
even greater than        the Gulf

easterly winds should be extremely humid as well as warm;
whilst the normal westerly wind, which has crossed the rocky
mountains as well as a wide extent of continent, must be ear
tremely dry as well as cold.  Now the warm and moist air
being once conveyed to the previously cold and dry localities
where the storm appears to originate, the subsequent order
and succession of the phaenomena are sufficiently intelligible.
The fact of which it seems most difficult to render an explai
nation, and to which therefore attention may be profitably
directed, is that of the apparent tendency of the south and
south-easterly winds to insinuate themselves in the lower
stratum of the air, and to prevail over the regular and normal
west wind, whenever the latter has moderated after its tem
porary violence. The phaenomenon is confined to the lower
stratum of the air, as the direction of the upper clouds is pre
served steadily from the west. Mr. Loomis suggests in ex
planation that the momentum which the westerly wind ac
quires at     itsperiod       of
                            violence causes           overblow itself,

XXXVII.         On the Anthracite and Bituminous Coal-Fields                 in
       China.      By Rich ARD CowLING TAYLoR, F.G.S.*
  W;         have seen the recent announcement of the sailing,
        from hence, of a vessel containing 308 tons of Pennsyl
vania anthracite, destined for Hong-Kong in China. Some
very natural speculations have arisen from this circumstance,
as to the probability of that remote country furnishing a market
for American anthracite. As no details accompany the state
ment alluded to, we are not in possession of any material facts
whereby an estimate can be formed of the probable success of
the undertaking, in a commercial sense; and we are not sure
but the coal may have been employed for convenience merely,
as ballast.
    In the East Indies various depots of European coal have
been established, for the service of the British government
steamers.      This fuel, for the most part, it is understood, con
sists of the anthracitous and partially bituminous coals of
South Wales, of course obtained at great expense. It appears
that 5000 tons of English coal, at a freightage of about £2 per
ton, are annually imported into Bombay, for the Company’s
steamers.       Bituminous coals have been derived from much
less distant sources; among which the Burdwan coal-field, in
the vicinity of Calcutta, may be named.               Mergui Island, also,
in the    Bay  of   Bengal,  has lately  furnished some steam coal to
Singapore.        The steam ships on the China seas, during the
war with that vast country, were supplied from these various
SOurces.
    I do not propose to discuss the profitableness, or otherwise,
of a Chinese market for our American anthracite. But as
during the process of collecting statistical information for a
proposed volume on “The Geological and Geographical Dis
tribution of Coal and other Mineral Combustiblest,” some

              and Bituminous Coal-fields in China.             205
notes reached me, of an interesting character, which are not
generally accessible to the majority of readers, with relation to
the Chinese coal-fields, it has struck me that a portion of these
details, in an abridged form, might be just now acceptable,
particularly as the intercourse with that country is on the     in
crease.    I venture even to omit, for the present, the author
ities for the facts I shall have to communicate; reserving
them in detail for the volume adverted to. It must, neverthe
less, be premised that to the Jesuit Fathers, the French Mis
sionaries who were permitted to reside at Pekin during the
 18th and preceding centuries, we are indebted for details of the
highest interest, not alone on this subject, but on many other
objects of philosophical inquiry in that little-known region.
    It is probable that coal was discovered, and was in common
 use in China, long before it was known in the western world.
 It is mentioned by a noble traveller of the 13th century, as
 abounding throughout the whole province of “Cathay,” of
 which Pekin is the capital, “where certain black stones are
 dug out of the mountains, which stones burn when kindled,
 and keep alive for a long time, and are used by many persons,
 notwithstanding the abundance of wood.”
    The good missionaries were fully capable of describing the
 coals which were supplied to Pekin, since they there erected
 a furnace or stove, in which they experimented on the proper
 ties of those combustibles; particularly with reference to the
 ordinary domestic uses, and for the warming of apartments
 and the purposes of their laboratory.
    Among the people of Pekin three kinds are in use.
    1. That employed by the blacksmiths.      It yields more flame
 than the other qualities; is more fierce, but is subject to de
 crepitate in the fire; on which account, probably, the black
 smiths use it pounded in minute particles.
    2. A harder and stronger coal, used for culinary purposes,
giving out more flame than the other sorts so employed; it is
 less quickly consumed, and leaves a residuum of gray ashes.
There are several gradations of these. The best are hard to
break, of a fine grain, a deep black colour, soiling the hands
less than the others.     It sometimes is sufficiently siliceous to
 give fire with steel.    Others have a very coarse grain, are
 easily broken and make a bright fire, leaving a reddish ash.
 Another species crackles or decrepitates when first placed on

206                     Mr. R. C. Taylor         on the   Anthracite
ously mentioned.   It is commonly this description which,
being mixed with coal-dust and a fourth part of clay, is em
ployed to form an artificial is oeconomical fuel. This being
moulded in the form of bricks and balls is sold in the shops
of Pekin.       ,   Wagon-loads of coal-dust are brought to that city
for this sole purpose.
   The coal merchants have also an intermediate quality                               be
tween the classes 2 and 3.
   We cannot in this place recite the numerous details which
are furnished by these intelligent Fathers.       Suffice it to add,
that nearly the whole of the properties and applications are
now in every-day use in the United States, and are familiar to
all. They are, in fact, the natural results suggested by quali
ties possessed in common by the combustibles of remote parts
of the same globe. Even the modern method of warming all
the apartments of our dwellings, which we view as the result
of superior practical and scientific investigation, was in use,
with very little deviation, centuries ago by the Chinese. Many
a patented artificial fuel compound both in Europe and Ame
rica, has been in practical operation in China at least a thou
sand years.
   4. ANTHRACITE.-Another description of coal abounding
about thirty leagues from Pekin, but which was not then in
such general use there as the other kinds, is called by the
Chinese Che-tan.        Che means a stone, but tan is the name
they give to wood-charcoal.        Therefore, according to the ge
nius of the Chinese     language,  this compound word signifies a
substance resembling or having the common properties of
stone and charcoal. There can be little difficulty here in re
cognising the variety of coal which in our day has been de
nominated anthracite, a compound word of similar meaning.
   The Chinese glance coal forms a remarkable exception to
the unfavourable conclusion prevailing against Oriental coal;
and, according to more recent authority than those we before
cited, deserves to rank at the head of the list, in respect of                        its
purity     as   coke, although        specific gravity

thick beds of coal occur. They appear to be of various qua

210    On the Anthracite and Bituminous Coal-fields in China.
  To the coals and combustible minerals of China, I cannot
further adverthere. But what a conviction irresistibly presses
upon the mind, as to the incalculable utility of the railroad
system,  and coal-mining improvements, in such an empire
If ever there   were concentrated at one point all the circum
stances especially  and unequivocally favourable to that system,
and imperiously calling for improvements of the character
suggested, it seems to be presented in the case of the city of
Pekin. Here, with its enormous population of 1,500,000
souls, it is situated only at a day's journey—computed at
thirty miles—from an immense region of coal, comprising
several varieties.     Yet its inhabitants cannot purchase the
best  qualities of this coal, brought from the mountains on the
backs of mules and camels, under & 1 1,60 per ton, and the very
worst for less than & 7,75 per ton.
   Without making unnecessary or invidious comparisons, it
might not unreasonably be suggested, that a Pekin railroad,
in connection with the coal mines, would be a far more profit
able enterprise in      its
                       results, than the transportation      Ame                 of
rican coals to China.
I    will only add one circumstance, which had nearly escaped
me. Borneo, “the largest island         the world,” which
                                                    in        only                   is

                                 coal which     contains, not only
                                                                 it
accessible    ships
                to  along  the  coast, but  extensively  occurring
in the mountains of the interior. Much information has also
been acquired from the natives; and the facts which are al
ready elicited are regarded               as   of
                                     considerable importance,                             in

XXXVIII.    On the Conversion of the solid Ferrocyanide of
  Potassium into the Sesqui-ferrocyanide. By C. F. Schoºn
  BEIN   +.
      a former      notice     I              shown that a solution                 of the
INyellow prussiate of potash in water, placed in contact with
                                   have
an atmosphere  of ozone, instantaneously destroys the latter,
and is converted into the red sesqui-ferrocyanide. Since that
communication       was made            I    have      ascertained that even the
solid yellow salt very readily absorbs ozone and is changed
into the red one. # a crystal of the common prussiate is
suspended in a balloon containing an atmosphere strongly
charged with ozone, and kept in that state by means of phos
phorus and water, it will soon assume the colour peculiar to
the red cyanide, just in the same way as it would do when
held in air containing chlorine.  The surface of the crystal,
after having  remained in the ozonized air for about twelve
hours, is changed into the red salt, which may be easily se
parated from the yellow nucleus by mechanical means. A
crystal of about a cubic inch in bulk appeared after thirty
six hours’ suspension in ozonized air covered with a crust of
the red cyanide, at least one line thick; and in another
case I  saw a smaller crystal of the yellow salt entirely con
verted into the red one.            I
                              hardly need say that by changing
the yellow compound into the sesqui-ferrocyanide, the cohe
sive state of the former undergoes a material alteration. The
red crust surrounding the yellow nucleus is rather brittle,
and consists of a heap of small crystals of the sesqui-ferro
cyanide.    It is worthy of remark, that under the circum
stances mentioned the yellow prussiate becomes moist, and
exhibits in that state a very strong alkaline reaction.

212               Prof. Potter on Physical Optics.
 a reddish yellow sediment subsides, which seems to be
the peroxide of iron.           The decomposition of the cyanide
takes place much more rapidly when strips of filtering paper
 or linen are immersed in a solution of the salt and exposed
 to the action of solar light.        In a very short time that part
 of the strip turned towards the sun becomes yellow, whilst
the opposite side remains colourless, or nearly so.            If strips
 of  paper  moistened with the solution of the common         prussiate
 of potash are closed up in glass bottles containing air, they also
 turn yellow by exposure to the sun, and a strong smell of
 prussic acid is perceptible in the vessels after a short time. In
 the shade no such action takes place. A large piece of linen
 cloth drenched with a solution of the yellow salt, after having
 been exposed in the open air to the action of solar light for
thirty-six hours, had turned deeply yellow, and yielded, when
treated with distilled water, a deep yellow solution, which on
 being filtered and heated to boiling became turbid, and depo
 sited flakes of peroxide of iron. The same solution exhibited
 a stronger alkaline reaction than the solution of the common
 prussiate does.      From the facts stated, it appears that the
yellow ferro-cyanide is decomposed by light into prussic acid,
 oxide of iron and potash, and a compound formed yielding
 with water a yellow solution.          Is that compound carbonate
 of  potash  and  peroxide    of iron;   and do the constituent gases
 of the  atmosphere    take   part  in the decomposition besides the
solar light?      Further experiments must answer those ques
tions.    A   limpid   solution of the red cyanide also becomes
turbid when      exposed   to the action of solar light, prussic acid
being evolved and peroxide of iron thrown down.

                    the   slightest wish to interfere in the contro
WITHOUT   versies of others, I    now beg to refer the readers of the
Philosophical Magazine to my papers in the Magazines for
January 1840 and May 1841.               In the former, at page 20,    I
have shown Mr. Green's formula for the intensity of reflected
light to fail entirely as a representation of nature; and in the
latter  I  have shown the peculiar refraction near the optic axes
of biaxal crystals not to be represented by Sir William Ha
milton's analytical deductions from Fresnel's equation to the
wave surface in biaxal crystals.

the readers of the Magazine where they will find the discus

through my short papers, was precisely that of which he ob
viously stood in need. Instead of accepting this with thanks,
he ungratefully turns round and bites the hand that brings
him aid; and, not content with this, he is ungenerous enough,

Double Refraction is based.                              It       rests on a lower level still.
The true basis of the theory                                is,  that the aethereal medium
consists             of
         particles separated                             by    finite intervals (to use well                 a
known, but improper mode                               of     expression), and acting upon
each other                 by
                   their mutual attractions.         From this principle,

   1846.     ON    James D. Forbes, Esq., F.R.S. &c. Part II*. “An
attempt to establish by observation the Plasticity of Glacier Ice."
    The two first sections of the present memoir are occupied with a
critical examination of the theory advanced by De Saussure to ac
count for the progressive motion of glaciers, which he considered as
formed of masses of rigid and inflexible ice, and with the further
explanations of that theory given by Ramaud, Bischoff, Agassiz, and
Studer.    The author, on the other hand, regarding these masses as
possessing a considerable degree of plasticity, explains on that sup
position the phenomena they present; and, in the third section of
the paper, he relates a series of experiments which he carried on in
the Mer de Glace, near Chamouni, in the summer of 1844, with a
view to determine by direct measurement the relative motion of
different parts of the glacier.      This he accomplished by selecting a
spot on the western side of the Mer de Glace, between Trelaporte
and l'Angle, where the ice was compact and free from fissures, and
erecting on the surface a row of posts at short distances from one
another, in a line transverse to the general direction of the moving
mass.    He was thus enabled to discover by trigonometrical observa
 tions the movements of different points in this line; and he ascer
tained that they advanced more and more rapidly in proportion as
 they were distant from the sides of the glacier; and that when not
 under the influence of neighbouring crevasses, these motions were
gradual and uninterrupted ; as was shown by the lines carried
through the posts forming, after the lapse of a few days, a continuous
 curve, of which the convexity was turned towards the lower end of
the glacier.

   January 22–" On the Supra-renal, Thymus and Thyroid Bo
dies."   By John Goodsir, Esq.      Communicated by Richard Owen,
Esq., F.R.S. &c.
   In this paper, the author enters on the developement of the theory
he advanced two years ago with regard to the origin and nature of
the supra-renal, thymus and thyroid bodies, and the correctness of
which, with certain modifications, he has been enabled to confirm by
subsequent observation and reflection.    His hypothesis was that the
three organs in question are the remains of the blastoderma; the
thyroid being the developement of a portion of the original cellular
substance of the germinal membrane grouped around the two
branches of the omphalo-mesenteric vein; the supra-renal capsules,
the developements of other portions grouped around the omphalo
mesenteric arteries; and the thymus, the developement of the inter
mediate portion of the membrane arranged along the sides of the
embryonic visceral cavity.    He has since ascertained, however, that
the thyroid body derives      origin    its
                                         portion     the included mem

brana intermedia remaining       connexion with anastomosing vessels
                                              in
between the first and second aortic arches,     carotid and subclavian     or
vessels.   He considers these organs       essentially similar    their
                                                                in as

nourishment for the embryo, but absorbs         also from without, that   it

considerable; but as they are not greater than would probably arise
 from ordinary barometric measurements, and as there is a close ac
cordance between his results and the determinations on which the
greatest reliance can be placed, he concludes that the results are on
 the whole satisfactory.       Considering                it,

of the Liver."    By C. Handfield Jones, M.D.              Communicated by
Sir   Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
  The author is led by his researches into the minute structure of
the liver, to results which confirm the view of Mr. Bowman, in op
position to those of Mr. Kiernan on this subject: and particularly
with regard to the absence of real tubercular ducts from the interior
of the lobules. He concludes that the secreting process commences
in the rows of epithelial cells surrounding the central axis of the
lobule, and that the fluid there secreted is transmitted to the cells
forming the margin of the lobule, where it is further elaborated,
and, by the bursting of these cells, is conveyed into the cavity of the
surrounding duct. A few diagrams are annexed, illustrative of the
descriptions of microscopic structure given in the paper.

 Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
    Grass grown on a parallelogram of land, fifty-five yards long by
 twenty-two yards wide, enclosed by underground wires, was found
 to be much more abundant than in any other part of the field;
 especially in a plot “upwards of fifty yards long, whose breadth was
 within the wires, and nearly at right angles to the axis of the paral
 lelogram.”    This plot of grass was principally on the western side
 of the wires, and extended but a very little way on the eastern side.
 The axis of the wire-enclosed parallelogram was in the magnetic
meridian.

 Communicated     by  Charles  Terry, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author   gives a series of observations, accompanied by a dia
 gram, made by him at Auckland, in New Zealand, on the comet of
 1844–45, which there appeared on the 20th of December 1844 and
 disappeared on the 30th of January following, having been visible
 forty-two days. Its most remarkable feature was that during                         its
 greatest brilliancy, the nucleus was not surrounded                 by

                                        “Starfield, Liverpool, 10th June, 1845.
      “I

 late solar eclipse and transit Mercury, for which the weather was,
                                       of
 in some respects, but very unfavourable.

  serve the first contact of the solar eclipse, by placing that part of the
  sun's limb (then very indistinct) which the moon would first touch,
  between the parallel threads of the micrometer, applied to the nine
  feet equatoreal, with a power of ninety-six times.
     “As the time of contact approached the sky somewhat cleared,
  and the moon's first impression took place at 23° 14" 37*8 sidereal
  time, or 20, 18" 24*17 mean time at the observatory.         During the
  greatest part of the obscuration the sky was very cloudy, but towards
  the end it cleared, and the last contact was well observed at 1* 33"
  48*9 sidereal, or 22° 37" 12" 45 mean time. No phaenomena be
 yond what is usual occurred; nor was there, to my senses, any per
  ceptible diminution of light on the landscape.
     “May 8. For the transit of Mercury the appearances a short time
 before it began were still more unpromising.         During the forenoon
 we had several     showers, with a most    gloomy  sky;  and even as late
  as half-past three P.M. we had a smart shower of close, small rain.
  A little change for the better occurred shortly before four, and I had
 just time to set the micrometer by the sun's limb after he became
 visible, and get settled at the telescope, when the first notch was cut
 out by the planet. The sun's limb was beautifully sharp, but occa
 sionally obscured by passing clouds.         From the time, however, of
 the first impression until the planet had advanced about two of its
 diameters upon the disc of the sun, it was generally unclouded, and
 the atmosphere remarkably tranquil.         The first contact took place
 at 7" 13" 36°3 sidereal time, or 4h 8m 125-36 mean time. The           in
 ternal contact, or complete immersion of the planet, took place at
  7" 16” 48*7 sidereal, or 4" 11m 24*24 mean time. Both times were
 carefully and, I believe, accurately noted. Whilst the planet was
 traversing the edge of the sun, an apparent distortion took place, the
 parts of the sun's edge, or limb, in contact with the planet, appear
 ing rounded off; and a moment or two before the complete immer
 sion of the planet, an appearance analogous to Mr. Baily's beads
 took place,—the planet apparently breaking contact two or three
times with the sun's limb before the final separation occurred. Mer
cury had also, to my eye, somewhat of a pear-like shape previously
 to his entering quite within the sun's disc. When he had advanced
two or three of his diameters, the clouds rapidly thickened, and 1
saw him no more.
     “I  take this opportunity of stating, that a late redetermination of
the longitude of my Observatory depending upon the lately deter
mined longitude of the Liverpool Observatory, inclines me to adopt
finally 11" 47°34 as my longitude west of Greenwich, which differs
scarcely a quarter of a second from that given in my paper contained
in the forthcoming volume of the Society's Memoirs.
    “The latitude I have also redetermined lately by transits of seven
stars over the prime vertical, giving 53° 25'3".5 as the mean re
sult.”

visible, and the discs of both the sun and Mercury were most beauti

131 books not bound or catalogued; and that 6 volumes were yet
to be delivered : that the Council had this day determined to com
plete the deficient sets of the most valuable works, to rearrange the
library, and to prepare a new catalogue, uniting the books of the two
societies as early as possible.
    It was then moved by the Rev. R. Sheepshanks, seconded by Mr.
Drach, and resolved unanimously, that the warm thanks of the meet
ing be given to Mr. Stratford, for the trouble which he had taken in
behalf of the Society, in carrying into effect the resolution of the
last meeting with regard to the Mathematical Society.
    Sir  J.  Herschel exhibited to the meeting a model of the surface of
 the  moon,    constructed by Frau Hofräthinn Witte, a lady resident in
 Hanover, from her own observations made with an achromatic tele
 scope by Fraunhofer, placed in a small observatory on the roof of her
 dwelling-house, in that city. The model is composed of a mixture
 of mastic and wax, forming a globe 12 inches S. lines, Paris measure,
 in diameter, on which the positions and general outlines of the
 craters, and other remarkable features of the moon's surface, were
 in the first instance laid down from the latitudes and longitudes
 given by Messrs. Baer and Mädler in their work entitled Der Mond,
 and from their chart of the moon, and the modeling performed (with
 the aid of a magnifying-glass)        from the actual appearance of the
 objects as presented in the telescope above mentioned.          The globe
 in question is the ten millionth part of the actual diameter of the
 moon, in which proportion, therefore, the horizontal linear dimen
 sions of the several mountains, &c. are laid down.         But, in respect
 of the height, a double proportion is adopted, since otherwise the re
 lative heights would have been with difficulty distinguishable on so
 small a model.       Sir J.  Herschel having explained the nature and
 mode of construction of this admirable work (of which only one other
 exists, now in the Royal Museum of Berlin—both being originals,
 and attempts to multiply copies by taking plaster casts having
 hitherto failed), pointed out several of the principal craters, and ex
 plained the nomenclature adopted by Messrs. Baer and Mädler in
 their work referred to, in describing the several characteristic pecu
 liarities of the moon's surface. The model was, on the breaking up
 of the meeting, submitted to the closer inspection of the members.

 of a Comet by Three Observations.          By  J.J. Waterston, Esq.

to do so affords an expression for the ratio of the distances at the
first and third observations on the usual assumption that the chord
is divided in the ratio of the times.
    “This expression may be converted into the elegant form given
by Olbers, so that it is identical with the value of M in his formulae,
and is expressed in terms that are likewise required in drawing the
line on the constant curve.
    “An example is given from the Trevandrum observations of the
great comet of 1843. The formulae are also applied to Göttinger's
observations of the second comet of 1813. A copy of the constant
curve is given upon a separate sheet, and the lines of these examples
drawn.      The co-ordinates of the curve consist of the cotangent and
cube of the sine. It is easily constructed by the common tables. If
drawn with ordinary care, it will give the reading of the angle at the
 comet to greater nicety than even the best observations can afford.
     “I have appended a modification of Olbers's formulae for the radii
vectores and chord adapted to equatoreal positions, and involving the
 use of the angular quantities already computed for the use of the con
 stant curve. The additional work of computation does not appear to
 be so great as that which is required to convert the right ascension
 and declination into latitude and longitude; and, besides, it is easier
 to compare observations with the computed elements when the latter
 are referred to the equator.        The inclination of the orbit and posi
 tion of the nodes are transferred to the ecliptic by the solution of one
 spherical triangle.
     “In the recent improvements which Olbers has made in his me
 thod, by expanding Euler's formula into a series and reversing, the
 means are afforded of constructing a small table which shortens con
 siderably the process of finding the distance by trial and error.      An
 other  improvement     consists in the new  expression given  for the chord
 being more favourable to accurate computation.           I have included a
 form of the same kind in terms of the right ascension and declina
 tion which is almost wholly made up of angular quantities that have
 already been prepared and used with the constant curve.
     “In the last part of the paper an expression for the angle at the
 comet is given to be used with the differential method which, in sol
 ving by trial and error, requires only five tabular references.”

     “Being on the subject of the satellites of Saturn, I will mention
 here a singularity which, though obvious enough, has not (so far as
 I  am aware) been noticed before, viz. that the periodic time of the
 first satellite (first in order of the ring) is precisely half that of the
 third, and the periodic time of the second precisely half that of the
 fourth.    This is far too remarkable and close a coincidence to be
 merely casual, and (the second satellite being a certainty) the exten
 sion of the law to the first (a law so out of the way and unlikely)
 would of itself be evidence of its real existence, even had it not been
 (as it now certainly has been) re-observed.         If such atoms perturb

                 EXPERIMENTS ON THE SPOTS ON THE SUN.
A*       the meeting of the American Philosophical Society, June 20,
         1845, Prof. Henry of Princeton, U.S., made the following
communication of a series of experiments made by himself and Prof.
Alexander relative to the spots on the sun.
    His attention was directed to this subject, by an article in the Sep
tember number of the Annales de Chimie, by M. Gautier, upon the
influence of the spots on the sun on terrestrial temperature.               It is
well known that Sir William Herschel entertained the idea, that the
appearance of solar spots was connected with a more copious emis
sion of heat, and that the seasons during which they were most abun
dant were most fruitful in vegetable productions;              and pursuing this
idea, he was led to trace an analogy between the price of corn and
the number of solar spots during several successive periods. The
result of this investigation, so far as it was extended, seemed to fa
vour the views of this distinguished philosopher.              A mode of inves
 tigation of this kind, however, is not susceptible of any great degree
 of accuracy; the price of corn is subject to so many other causes of
variation besides that of solar temperature, that little reliance can be
 placed on       it.
    M. Gautier has attempted             investigate the influence
                                                  to                    the solar        of
 spots     onterrestrial   temperature,                     by
                                                comparing the temperature                                 of
 several places        the earth's surface, during the years
                           on                                         which the         in
 spots were most abundant, with those                which the smallest number
                                                                  in
 were perceptible.       From               all
                                      the observations collected,       seems            it               to
 be  indicated, that during the years          which the spots were the great
                                                            in

cated      Prof. Alexander, who readily joined
           to                                         the plan for reducing   in
it     practice.
      to              was agreed that they should first attempt
                            It                                        settle                    to

 readily daguerreotyped, had the telescope been furnished with an
 equatorial movement.     The form of the penumbra of the spot, as it
 appeared on the screen, was that of an irregular oblong, about two
 inches in one direction, and an inch and a half in the other. The
 dark central spot within the penumbra was nearly square, of about
 three-fourths of an inch on the side, and a little larger than the end
 of the thermo-pile.
    The method of observation consisted in first placing, for example,
 a portion  of the picture of the luminous surface of the sun in con
nexion with the face of the pile, and after noting the indication of
the needle of the galvanometer, the telescope was then slightly moved,
so as to place the dark part of the spot directly on the face of the
pile, the indication of the needle being again noted. In the next set
of experiments the order was reversed; the picture of the spot at the
beginning of the experiment was placed in connexion with the pile,
and afterward a new part of the luminous portion of the disc was
made to occupy the same place.
t The thermo-electrical apparatus used in these experiments was
made by Ruhmkorff of Paris; and in order to render the galvano
meter more sensitive, two bar magnets, arranged in the form of the
legs of a pair of dividers, were placed with the opening downwards,
in a vertical plane, above the needle, so that, by increasing or dimi
nishing the angle, the directive power of the needle could be increased
or diminished, and, consequently, the sensibility of the instrument
could be varied, and the zero point changed at pleasure.
   In the present experiments, in order to mark more definitely the
difference in temperature, after the needle had been deflected by the
heat of the sun, the magnetic bars above mentioned were so arranged
as to repel it back to near the zero point, so that it might, in this
position, receive the maximum effect of any variation in the electri
cal current.
   Twelve sets of observations were made on the first day, all of which,
except one, gave the same indication, namely, that the spot emitted
less heat than the surrounding parts of the luminous disc.  The follow
ing is a copy of the record made at the time of the observations.
The degrees are those marked on the card of the galvanometer, and
are of course arbitrary.

   The change in the temperature during the intervals of observation,
is due to the variations in the temperature of the room differently
affecting the two extremities of the pile.
   In consequence of cloudy weather, another set of observations were
not obtained until the 10th of January, and at this time the spot had
very much changed                   its
                          appearance; the penumbra, while             retained                                it

the dark part was separated into two small ones; also the sky was
not perfectly clear, and therefore the results were not           satisfactory                           as

          ON    THE DOUBLE SALTS OF THE MAGNESIAN GROUP.
  M.      J.Isidore Pierre has paid particular attention to the salts of
this  group,   including those of magnesia, oxide of copper, zinc, nickel,
cobalt, manganese and iron.
    The author observes, that it is well known that Prof. Graham has
stated, with respect to the sulphates of the above-named bases, that
one of the equivalents of water cannot be eliminated, except at a
much higher temperature than is required for the others; that this
equivalent may be replaced by an equivalent of a salt, so that the
double salt formed contains one equivalent less of water than if each
of the two simple sulphates had brought                     water      crystalliza
                                                                                 all   its                  of

cooling.     The crystals of this salt are hexagonal tables. They are
very deliquescent, very soluble in weak alcohol, less so in absolute
alcohol, and insoluble in aether. They lose no water at 212°Fahr.
   Adopting with M. Pelouze 400 as the atomic weight of phospho
rus, M. Wurtz gives as the formula of this salt,
                     PO, KO, 2HO = PH2O", KO.
   Hypophosphite of Ammonia.—This salt was prepared like           the pre
ceding.      It crystallizes in large irregular hexagonal laminae; it is
less deliquescent than the salt of potash, and unalterable at 212°
Fahr. At about 394°Fahr., it fuses into a transparent liquid with
out losing water, and becomes a crystalline mass on cooling.             It
does not decompose under 464°Fahr., at which temperature, like
other hypophosphites, it disengages a little water and spontaneously
inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen.           Its formula, as determined
by analysis, appeared to be
                   PO, H3N 3HO = PH2O3, NH4O.
   Hypophosphite of Strontia.-This salt was prepared like that of
barytes, by boiling a solution of sulphuret of strontium with phos
phorus, and decomposing the excess of sulphuret by carbonate of
lead, or by sulphuric acid added in sufficient quantity to render the
liquid slightly acid. By evaporation the hypophosphite of strontia
crystallizes in the mammillated form by the juxtaposition of small
laminae round a common centre.         These crystals are unalterable in
the  air, and lose no water at 212°. They are very soluble in water,
and insoluble in alcohol.      The formula of this salt is
                      PO, SrC), 2HO = PH2O3, Sr.O.
   Hypophosphite of Magnesia.-This salt was prepared by double
decomposition with sulphate of magnesia and hypophosphite of ba
rytes; it crystallizes, as stated by M. H. Rose, in very brilliant
regular octahedrons, which effloresce in dry air.         The formula of
the crystallized salt is PH2O3, MgO + HO +5Aq; of the salt dried
at 212°, PH, O, MgO + HO; and lastly, the formula of the salt dried
at 360°Fahr., is PH2O, MgO.
   Hypophosphite of Zinc.—This salt was obtained of two different
forms.     It crystallizes sometimes in very efflorescent regular octa
hedrons, and sometimes in small rhombic crystals unalterable in the
air. When a moderately concentrated solution of this hypophos
phite is submitted to spontaneous evaporation, the first-mentioned
crystals are usually formed. They are so efflorescent, that they lose
water during pressure between folds of paper, previous to analysis.
The formula of the rhombic crystals is
                           PH2 O3 ZnO, + HO.
   Hypophosphite of Iron.—This salt crystallizes       in large green   oc
tahedrons, which effloresce by exposure to the         air and   become  a
white powder. When exposed to the air, the             moist salt absorbs
oxygen from it rapidly.        The formula of the     crystallized salt is
PH2  O3,  Fe0 + 6HO.
   Hypophosphite     of Chromium.—This     salt was prepared by double

238            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
decomposition by mixing solutions of sulphate of chromium and hy
pophosphite of barytes.       By evaporation there was obtained an
amorphous, cracked mass of a very deep green colour.          This salt
loses water by drying when it has been heated to 39.2°Fahr. ; it is
not soluble either in water or dilute acids. The formula of this salt
is 2PH2 O3, Crº O3 + 4HO.
    Hypophosphite of Manganese.—The crystals of this salt are of a
rose colour, brilliant and unalterable in the air.    They do not lose
water at 212°      Fahr., but at about 302°Fahr.    they part with one
equivalent.     The formula of this salt is PH. O', MnO + HO.
    Hypophosphite of Cobalt.—This salt forms large crystals of a deep
red colour, which effloresce in the air.    At 212°Fahr., they lose six
equivalents of water of crystallization, and become a pale rose-red
powder.      The formula of this salt, which agrees with that of M. H.
 Rose, is PH2O3, CoO + 6HO.
    Hypophosphite of Nickel.—The crystals of this salt are regular oc
 tahedrons, and smaller than those of hypophosphite of cobalt. When
 the aqueous solution is evaporated at the temperature of 212°Fahr.,
 it is partially reduced to metallic nickel with the disengagement of
hydrogen.      This reduction takes place perfectly when the crystals
 of this salt, broken and slightly moistened, are exposed to the air at
 a temperature of 248°Fahr.       The formula of this salt is PH; 0°,
NiO + 6HO.
   Hypophosphite of Copper.--The solution of this salt is readily pre
pared by decomposing sulphate of copper with hypophosphite of ba
rytes.   It is not a permanent salt. At about 140°Fahr. it becomes
turbid, and deposits hydrate of copper.    By evaporating the solution
in vacuo, small blue crystals of this salt were once obtained. These
                                      -
crystals decompose quickly, and with projection of the entire mass
when heated to 149°Fahr. ; and phosphuret of copper is formed.
The formula of this salt is PH" O’, CuO.—Ann,                    de Ch. et de        Phys.,

   N   order to illustrate and confirm the views          I have before
      advanced in this Magazine (vols. xx. and xxiii.), on the
connexion between the direction of the currents of the atmo
sphere and the oscillations of the barometer, I have endea
voured to make a direct application of them to the explana
tion of the various phaenomena presented by the winds in
this country during a great portion of the month of Novem
ber 1842, that month including an extremely unsettled and
stormy period of weather.            For this purpose, I have col
lected observations showing the state of the wind and the ba
rometer in various parts of this kingdom, and also at Chris
tiania in Norway, and at Paris; and exhibited the direction of
the wind on diagrams, with the variations of the barometer in
hundredths of an inch annexed.              The data from which the
diagrams are constructed, and which are given p. 262, with
the exception of those for North Shields, the place of my own
register, are extracted from the Shipping and Mercantile Ga
zette Newspaper; a newspaper containing daily reports from
most of the parts of Great Britain and Ireland, of the state of
the wind and weather, on which nautical men are accustomed
to rely for that kind of information; and the accordance of the
observations at places situated near each other is sufficiently
marked to confirm their general correctness, and thus give
confidence in those of more isolated localities.
   The barometrical observations have been collected with

published, was written soon after this period.

great care: those for London and the Orkneys are taken from
the tables published in the Philosophical Magazine and Athe
naeum, and those for Paris from the Annales de Chimie; but
in general         I
                  have been indebted for them to the kindness of
the observers themselves.            I sought those from Christiania,
which are from the         register   kept under the superintendence
of Prof. Hansteen, in order to enlarge the field of the observa
tions; it appears however from them that their locality is too
far to the west to throw light on those of this country, except
 in a few instances; for this reason they are placed at the foot
 of the columns, contrary to the general order of the positions
 of the observations; and when reference is made to the ob
 servations as a whole, they are never included, except when
 specifically mentioned.
      The whole of the facts brought to light by this investiga
 tion may, I think, be resolved into this general principle;

      It is not meant however in the foregoing paragraph that
     3.
the greatest depression of the barometer throughout the course
with regard to temperature and the quantity of aqueous vapour they con
tain; and hence the true nature of the connexion between the occur
rence of rain and a falling barometer, both consequences of one common
cause.
  The phaenomena attending the fall of rain are extremely dependent on
geographical position, and are by no means sufficiently known to enable us
fully to carry out these principles to the explanation of them, although                           I
am firmly persuaded that when better known we shall be able to do so.     I
will however just refer to a few cases similar to that mentioned, of which
they do give a sufficient explanation, and which are notorious weather
laws:—the occurrence of rain ; –just before a change of the wind, or at
the time of the change, whether it be from north to south, or from south
to north, though the most conspicuous in the former case; during a north
east wind with a falling barometer (§ 5), and with a south or south-east
wind (occasioned by the junction of a north-east and south wind, see S 11).
The last of these is the most conspicuous in the portions of storms to which
§ 16 refers, which in those parts where the wind is from south to south-east
are always accompanied by abundance of rain. It may be thought that our
dry winds from north-west (also formed by a north and south wind (§ 1 1))
are an exception to these results; but it is by no means necessary that rain
should always occur at the meeting of these currents, for if the lower cur
                         §
rent greatly predominates in dryness or in quantity, then it is evident that
there need be no precipitation of vapour in the form of rain.           But there is
another reason           these winds should be in general free from rain. The
occurrence of rain in showers with squalls of wind, when the other portions
of the day are fine, is a case to which the principle before us strikingly ap
plies, for these squalls almost always blow in a direction somewhat different
from that of the wind in the intervals between their occurrence; thus
showing that they arise from an immediate onset of one or other of the op
posite currents: now it is very easy to conceive that two bodies of air may
meet so as to produce rain, although their relative temperatures and quan
tities of vapour may be so adjusted, that the resulting temperature is suffi
cient to maintain the same quantity of vapour; for if the collision be sud
den, by the law of the diffusion of gases and vapours the vapour of the
 warm air will rush at once into the cold air, not waiting for the mixture to
take place; and hence, being subjected to          temperature,its      immediately
                                                                                 it   is

to the storm               *.
     This is more conspicuous in storms of temperate regions
than in those of the tropics, because the former consist, as it
were, of one deep wide depression of the atmosphere, the pro
gressive motion of the storm being, so far as regards the
movement from north to south, apparently in great measure
an enlargement of this depression southward, whilst the latter
occasion a much smaller one.

may cause a wind in any direction, according to their force
and their inclination to one another; if it be on the eastern
side from any point of the compass between a north-eastern
point and some point between south and west, it will be very
liable to change; for winds from these points being produced
 by the direct collision of the descending current with that
from north-east, when the latter is blowing on the surface of
 the earth from some more northern station, require the conti
 nuance and stability of a current whose direction, inasmuch
as it is from east, depends upon                           its

 agreeably with this, we find that the direction of the wind in
 such cases is generally at first from S.S.E., but as the storm
 continues, it changes to S. or S.W.; according to the explana
 tion given of the lateral motion of the receding wind (one por
 tion removing the opposition for that behind).                 Therefore let
 us suppose the direction of the advancing air to be from due
south or along the line A B; then a, b, c will be stations at
which it arrives in           progress; butits     the time      reaches any

 are influenced by geographical situation, have their position,
 with regard to colder, constantly on the equatorial side of
 them, both in winter and summer; but in tropical regions
 these positions in summer are reversed by the change in the
 point over which the sun is vertical; hence the currents also
 are either permanently reversed during this season, as in the
 monsoons of the Indian ocean; or, as in the “trade winds,”
                                                                       ;
 their position is altered and their constancy interrupted, and
 sometimes at least their direction reversed”; thus the tropical
 hurricanes of the Atlantic, which occur only during summer,
 and the storms of the Indian ocean, which occur during the
 same season, that is when the south-west monsoon is blowing,
 have their relative parts precisely the reverse of those of
latitudes, the descending current being from north, from which
quarter the storm commences, and the returning one from
 south, whilst the progressive motion is towards north-west.
     These storms visit only the western parts of the Atlantic, a
 fact which, on the supposition of their origin being the descent
 of the upper current, is readily explained by a glance at the
 position of the continents of Africa and America; the western
 part of the Atlantic having the latter stretching out on the
 north of it and radiating the heat of the summer's sun, whilst
 the former extends on the south of the eastern parts, having
 only the waters of the ocean on the north.              But these storms
 near the boundary of the tropics change their directiont and
 pass along the eastern coast of North America and parts ad
jacent, and present phaenomena different from those of storms
 which take their rise in extra-tropical latitudes, but to which
 the explanation given in the foregoing paragraph of the phae
 nomena of the advancing portion of storms in the longitudes
 of Europe, may with some modification be applied. In my
 paper on the Storms of the Tropics,              I  have referred to two
storms of this kind, which advanced along the coast of the
 United States in a direction from S.S.W. to N.N.E., of which
the data collected by W. C. Redfield are given in Col. Reid's
work on Storms.          As a general explanation only was before
given of their phaenomena, it may now be proper to give one
    * For a particular explanation of the phaenomena of these storms I must
refer the reader to my essay in this Magazine, vol. xxiii.    I may observe
here, however, that the identity of the phaenomena of the storms of the
Atlantic and Indian ocean is sufficient evidence of the same condition of
the currents in the former as in the latter at the time of the occurrence of
the hurricane; but in the western part of the Atlantic, which is the loca
lity of the hurricanes, the south is the prevalent wind in summer. (See

it is the same in both, the second being selected merely be

suppose A the station at which the storm first arrives after the
change in the direction of the atmospheric currents, the upper
one being now S.W., the rarefaction of the atmosphere is first
produced here by the flowing of the air from it towards south,
according to the recession of tropical storms, and into this
rarefaction the south current descends, but instead of restoring
the atmospheric pressure, it still further increases    diminu                                          its

changes the wind at both places to north-west, whilst the phae
nomena previously in existence at those stations are removed
to others further north.    Now it is obvious that whilst at a
station C,  fig. 4, where the wind is north-east, it may change
directly to north-west, at another, E, more to the east, it will
change first to south-east if the south wind has the greatest
force; but if the north-east become the strongest, which at
any particular spot may be the case, the wind in the first part
of the storm from south-east may change to north-east before
changing to north-west, as shown by some of the data;-a
particular instance may be given.
   From the data of the hurricane of 1821 (Law of Storms,
p. 17), “At Cape Henlopen, Delaware, the hurricane com
menced at 11% A.M. from E.S.E.; shifted in twenty minutes
to E.N.E. and blew very heavy for nearly an hour.            A
                                                           calm
of half an hour succeeded, and the wind then shifted to the
W.N.W. and blew, if possible, with still greater violence.”
“At Cape May, New Jersey” (a little to the north-east of the
previous locality), “commenced at N.E. at 2 P.M. and veered
to S.E.” Thus it appears that at two stations situated with
regard to each other as A and E, the phaenomena were as
follows:–At A the storm arrived at 11% A.M., and blew as
an E.S.E. wind, but about 12 P.M. the north current had                 in
creased in force and the wind changed to E.N.E., from which
point it blew for an hour, or till 1 P.M. All this time it ap
pears there was no storm at E., but the N.E. wind had re
ceded to it at 2 P.M., and began to blow at that time, but the
S. wind soon arrived with greater strength and the wind
changed to S.E. But if this be the true explanation of the
action of these storms, then according to that given of the mode
of progression of receding storms, they ought to increase on
the western side towards north-west by the recession of the
north-east current; and on the south-west towards south-east
by the recession of the south wind.        Now with regard to the
increase on the west   side;   as the direction of the north wind
is opposed to that of the upper current, it is evident that by
extending itself to the west, it cannot extend the rarefaction;
and this being produced in a direction from south-west to
north-east by the flow of the upper current, the resistance on
the west side would soon overcome the advance from east :
moreover, the north-east wind is not caused simply by            re
                                                               of its

north-east,--a change from south-west to south-east in this
case, in the southern localities, being almost impossible whilst
the wind continues to blow on the south-east side of the
locality which the storm has left.    Now it is matter of general
observation that the wind   very   seldom changes in this direc
tion, or from south-west to south-east, being indeed termed
by nautical men “backing”; there is however a particular
case in which the wind sometimes changes from S.W. to
S.S.E. in the northern or central portions of a space occupied
by a storm; and that is in the occurrence of a storm as that
of § 16, the circumstances of which fully explain the excep
tion, for the change is the consequence of the collision of the
currents by which the S.S.E. wind is produced, and hence it
takes place at what for the moment is on the northern verge
of the south wind, where of course a change produced by a
north-east wind meeting it may make it south-east”.
   Having carried out thus far the results of the principles
stated at the beginning of this paper, I may now proceed to
give the observations which I have collected, and first those of
the wind, extracted from the Shipping Gazette.

    The first very conspicuous atmospheric phaenomenon is an
elevation of the barometer, which at Orkney reached the
highest point at the P.M. observation of the 4th, and advanced
                                                                          s
towards south. Its maximum was in the north and north-west,
affording an excellent illustration of § 7; for on the 4th, the
day on which the principal rise took place, we find the col
lision of the currents on the western and south-western side
of the chart: thus at the Irish ports and the Scilly islands the
wind was south-east, whilst in England and               and at
Paris it was north-east.               Hence at the Orkneys the barometer
stood at 30:54 and at Belfast 30°57, these places being situated
in the line of the meeting currents; whilst at London, which,
so far as the observations go, was in the line of the north-east
current moving freely, the barometer reached an elevation of
only 30:19; the advance of the north wind and of the eleva
tion of the barometer likewise accorded with each other, both
being from north to south.
      The observations of the 1st are particularly illustrative of
§    5 and $ 8; in them the opposition of the southern current is
seen only in the extreme south, where it is blowing with some
strength, causing a fall of the barometer in the south, where
the north wind is blowing immediately in front of the south
wind (§      and 5),  slight rise    the north       the arrival    by

not subside till the approach of a storm from south-west

 7th, was blowing at the island of Mull on the 8th, and arrived
at Glasgow at 6 P.M. of the same day; in the north of Ireland
(Donegal) at 8 P.M.; and at North Shields (a little to the
north of Donegal in latitude, but on account of                          more                              its

     of the barometer at 9 A.M. was 29:30 inches, and at Orkney
     the wind is from east, hence at the same distance on the west
     of these islands the barometer is probably below this.        we         If
     now  suppose,  whilst the wind is blowing  as shown   by the dia
     gram, the point C of fig. 3, by the motion of the line A C
     (§ 16), to move considerably northwards, and to be a little
     to the north of Holyhead, where the wind is strong from
     north-west, the phaenomena will be simply a particular case
     of the general result of the paragraph, for the wind is strong
     from north-west on the localities in the direction which
     would be that of the line CA, and variable between west and
     north-west at Flamborough-head,       and west-north-west and
     very light at North Shields, places, which with regard to the
     figure would be nearly on a horizontal line with the point C;
     and in the north, but not extending to Orkney (where the ba
     rometer is just beginning to rise), the wind is variable between
     south and west, and extremely light; but at the locality near
     est to Orkney, Greenock, it appears to change to north-east
     in the latter part of the day. This however is the extreme
     portion of the storm, and accordingly, soon after this, the
     north wind sets in briskly from north-east instead of from
     north-west.
..      It may be observed that in the south the rise of the baro
     meter ceases at Cork whilst it continues at Plymouth; the
     phaenomena of the next day (13th) however, explain this, for
     by the setting in of the current from north-west on the south
     west, which opposing the south wind blowing in the more
     southern parts, causes a very rapid rise of the barometer in
     the south, but more especially in the south-west, a dispro
     portionate pressure there is again produced, and the conse
     quences are in some degree the same as before; for on the
      13th, although the barometer rose rapidly at the Orkney
     islands, and the north-east wind fully set in in Scotland, the
     south wind blowing previously only in the extreme south,                        in
     creases in strength and becomes prevalent in            all

of $2, because of the blowing of both currents being so fully
pointed out, that I cannot pass it over. We see that on
the south the south wind is prevalent and strong, and the
north is blowing as a fresh breeze in the north, the two cur
rents meeting and balancing one another a little to the north
of the centre of the field of observation, and yet in this
place the barometer falls, the fall increasing towards south
on account of the greater height of the barometer there at
in its
    commencement; but                                    rise takes place

      Mr. W. Brown                on the oscillations                   of the Barometer.                       279
although in the south during the blowing of a south wind (§6).
On the remaining days of this series the north wind continues
on the whole to gain in predominance over the south, and to
cause the barometer to rise, not however without a check in the
south, where the south wind again increases in strength for a
time, and causes a slight depression of the barometer on the
14th and 15th, which has its limit northward in the north of
England or south of Scotland, where the force of the wind is
balanced by the opposite current, repeating the phaenomena
of the 13th, though with this difference, that on the 15th the
north wind prevails to a greater degree than on the 13th, so
that at North Shields the north-east wind itself is blowing;
still however there is a slight fall of the barometer (§ 5). On
the 16th the south wind has greatly decreased, and serves only
to produce the great comparative rise of the barometer at Ork
ney (§         7),
             where    attains     height considerably above the
                                 it            a
mean. On the      17th, the  day                       on
                                     which the barometer attains
its maximum elevation, we have very little indication            the                                       of

south wind blowing          the south;        however blowing     it    is

the north-west and extending itself towards the south-east;

elevation differs from that       the 4th, during which also the

   Having now given a detailed explanation of the several
phaenomena of the preceding observations, it will be sufficient
to give a very general account of those of the succeeding ones;
they are however of great interest. The first in occurrence,
whose approach is indicated by the P.M. observation of the
barometer at the Orkneys on the 17th, is a depression of the
barometer by a south wind of just sufficient strength to be
called a storm, and         subsequent rise; both progressing from
                                     its
north-west       south-east.

    for different things.   For example, the original English sense
    of the word   square  applies to an angle, not a figure; a right
    angle is a square corner; and to this day the carpenter's right
    angle is called a square.      But I could name half-a-dozen
    writers of the end of the sixteenth century who use the two

    the latter for the carpenter's instrument.

    XLVII.      Reply to the Observations of M. Pierre, on the Pro

    the Oxides of the Magnesian Group, of which an abstract is

    zine, containing statements which demand some remark from
    myself.    It presents new analyses of the sulphate of magne
    sia and potash, and other double sulphates of the same type,
    from which the author infers that these well-known double
    salts possess seven atoms of water crystallization, and not six
    atoms, as resulted from my own analyses and the analyses of
     allother chemists who have                   of

   The experiment obviously indicates six and not seven equi
valents of water. The slight excess of 0.86 per cent. of water
is not more than is usually found in crystallized salts, arising
from the difficulty of divesting them entirely of water me
chanically interposed between the plates of the crystals. The
peculiarly high disposition of this particular class of salts to
retain mechanical water, has been noted by Mitscherlich, my
self, and almost every one else who has made them the                                               sub
ject of investigation.    It has probably been the cause of the
error into which M. Pierre has fallen, in over-estimating their
 proportion of water.
    Although it is scarcely necessary to extend the inquiry to the
 other double salts of the class, which being isomorphous with
 the last have necessarily the same proportion of water, still I
 may be allowed to avail myself of a series of five analyses of
the double sulphate of copper and potash lately executed in
the laboratory of my friend Prof. Fownes, and which he has
kindly communicated to me.

     It  is sufficiently evident, therefore, that sulphate of zinc,
 which is admitted by M. Pierre to contain seven equivalents
 of water, retains one equivalent of water by a stronger affinity
 than the other six, contrary to his observation; while, more
 over, this strongly retained atom of water is absent in the
 double sulphate of zinc and potash, the last containing only
 six atoms of water—the experimental data on which the view
 of the constitution of these salts controverted by that chemist
 is founded.
 XLVIII.       On the Cohesion of Liquids and their Adhesion to
     Solid Bodies.       By M. F. DoNNY, Agrégé à l’Université de
     Gand, Préparateur du Cours de Chimie.
    To  the  Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
                               volume of your valuable Magazine
THE(p.twenty-sixth
               541) contains an account of two communications
made by Prof. Henry to the American Philosophical Society,
on the 5th of April and 17th of May 1844, both relative to
the cohesion of liquids.
     I have been investigating the same subject from the begin
ning of 1841 to the end of 1843, when I gave a full descrip
tion of my experiments on cohesion and adhesion in a written
communication addressed to the Académie Royale de Brux
elles. The reception of this memoir is recorded in the Bul
letin de la Séance du 2 Décembre 1843 (tome x. p. 457), and
the memoir itself is printed in the Mémoires Couronnées et des
Savants Etrangers, tome xvii.            I beg leave to direct your at
tention to the contents of this communication.
     Having discovered, in 1841, as Prof. Henry did in 1844,
that the cohesion of liquids is a powerful attraction, entirely
misrepresented in the works on natural philosophy,                   I en
deavoured to find out the cause of this misrepresentation.
With this object I constructed a very simple instrument, which
enabled me to observe accurately how the separation of water
from water is effected, in the well-known experiment of a
                                     X   2

292             M. Donny        on the Cohesion  of Liquids,
plate suspended from a scale-beam over a vessel of water.
The use of this new instrument convinced me immediately
that there is no similitude whatever between the rupture of a
solid body and this mode of separating water from water.                    I
perceived plainly that such a separation was the final result
of a series of successive transformations undergone by that
portion of the liquid which is lifted up during the ascension
of the plate; which transformations ultimately reduce the thin
nest part of that ascending liquid to so small a diameter, that
it gives way, even without any further exterior exertion. The
first experimenters, not being aware of this mode of acting,
considered the separation of water from water as if it were
similar to the rupture of a solid body; they made their calcu
lations accordingly, and so doing, reduced to the lowest pro
portions that very strong molecular attraction which fixed my
 attention in Europe and Prof. Henry's in America.
     The learned Professor has proved the magnitude of this
 molecular attraction by observations on soap-bubbles.                  I fol
 lowed quite a different course, and arrived at more extensive
results.
     I constantly employed liquids placed in glass tubes, whose
 interior diameter measured from eight to ten millimetres (from
 three-tenths to four-tenths of an English inch).                 In similar
 circumstances, two distinct molecular forces are acting,                 the
 attraction of water for water, or cohesion; and the attraction
 of water for glass, or adhesion.         In my experiments, both co
 hesion and adhesion appeared very weak when the liquid was
 not deprived of that portion of air which it usually contains;
 and, on the contrary, proved very powerful when air was ex
 cluded.
     In order to exhibit this power of attraction in airless liquids*,
 I   have made use of two different disjunctive forces; that of
 mechanical traction in my first two experiments, and that of
 repulsive caloric in the other.
     My first experiment was made on sulphuric acid deprived
 of air by means of a very powerful air-pumpt.                  In that case
 molecular attraction proved to be superior to the weight of a
 column of acid, whose height was 1250 millimetres (more than
 4 English feet).
    * By airless liquids, I mean liquids deprived of air by one of the pecu
 liar processes described in my memoir.     In this sense, distilled water, al
 though containing    less air than common water, is far from being an airless
 liquid.
   º   This pump, constructed on a
                                      ...<U+017F>º     without either cock or valve,
 was described in 1841. It is recorded in the Rapport du Jury et Docu
 ments de l'Exposition de l'Industrie Belge en 1841, p. 161.

       The second experiment was made on airless water, and the
    molecular force exceeded the weight of one atmosphere.
       The third experiment proved the molecular attraction of
    airless water to be superior to the weight of three atmospheres,
    and exhibited very curious phaenomena. The liquid had been
    placed in such circumstances as to be free from any pressure

 tion*. In modern times the proofs of their convertibility have
 been accumulated to a very considerable extent, and a com
 mencement made of the determination of their equivalent
 forces.
       2147.   This strong persuasion extended to the powers of
 light, and led, on a former occasion, to many exertions, ha
 ving for their object the discovery of the direct relation of
 light and electricity, and their mutual action in bodies subject
jointly to their powert; but the results were negative and
 were afterwards confirmed, in that respect, by Wartmannf.
    2148. These ineffectual exertions, and many others which
 were never published, could not remove my strong persuasion
 derived from philosophical considerations; and, therefore, I
recently resumed the inquiry by experiment in a most strict
and searching manner, and have at last succeeded in magne
tizing and electrifying a ray of light, and in illuminating a
magnetic line of force. These results, without entering into
the detail of many unproductive experiments,      will describe I
as briefly and clearly as I can.
   2149. But before I proceed to them, I will define the mean

ing connect with certain terms which shall have occasion to
use:—thus, by line of magnetic force, or magnetic line of force,
or magnetic curve, I mean that exercise of magnetic force which
is exerted in the lines usually called magnetic curves, and
which equally exist as passing from or to magnetic poles, or
forming concentric circles round an electric current.                  By line
of electric force, I mean the force exerted in the lines joining
 two bodies, acting on each other according to the principles
of static electric induction (1161, &c.), which may also be
either in curved or straight lines.   By a diamagnetic, I mean
a body through which lines of magnetic force are passing, and
                                                                      .

state of iron or loadstone.
   2150. A ray of light issuing from an Argand lamp, was po
larized in a horizontal plane by reflexion from a surface of
glass, and the polarized ray passed through a Nichol's eye
piece revolving on a horizontal axis, so as to be easily exa
mined by the latter.    Between the polarizing mirror and the
eye-piece, two powerful electro-magnetic poles were arranged,
being either the poles of a horse-shoe magnet, or the
poles of two cylinder magnets; they were separated from eac
other about two inches in the direction of the line of the ray,

portion to the extent of the diamagnetic through which the
ray and the magnetic lines pass.        I preserved the strength of

I  could judge           by

this power of magnetism over light as exercised, not only in

transparent bodies possess the power of exhibiting the action,
they have it in very different degrees, and that up to this time
there are some that have not shown it at all.

ingly different to each other in chemical, physical, and me
chanical properties, develope this effect; for solids and liquids,

 of action on the ray, neither did smaller crystals, nor cubes
 about three-fourths of an inch in the side, which were so cut
 as to have two of their faces perpendicular to the axis of the
 crystal (1692, 1693.), though they were examined in every
 direction.
    2179. Iceland spar exhibited no signs of effect, either in
 the form of rhomboids, or of cubes like those just described
 (1695.).
    2180. Sulphate of baryta, sulphate of lime, and carbonate of
soda, were also without action on the light.

not however say there is none, for the effect of water in the

made the observation very difficult.

and, that by using long helices, substances may be submitted
to this         examination which could not be placed in suf
ficient length between the poles of magnets (2150.).
   2203.        A
             tube of water as long as the Woolwich helix
(2192.), but only 0.4 of an inch in diameter, was placed in
the helix parallel to the axis, but sometimes in the axis and
sometimes near the side. No apparent difference was pro
duced in these different situations; and I am inclined to be
lieve (without being quite sure) that the action on the ray is
the same, wherever the tube is placed, within the helix, in re
lation to the axis. The same result was obtained when a
larger tube of water was looked through, whether the ray
passed through the axis of the helix and tube, or near the
side.
   2204.        If
             bodies be introduced into the helix possessing,
naturally, rotating force, then the rotating power given by the
electric current is superinduced upon them, exactly as in the
cases already described of magnetic action (2165. 2187.).
   2205. A helix, twenty inches long and 0.3 of an inch in
diameter, was made of uncovered copper wire, 0.05 of an inch
in diameter, in close spirals. This was placed in a large tube
of water, so that the fluid, both in the inside and at the out
side of the helix, could be examined by the polarized ray.
 When the current was sent through the helix, the water within
it received rotating power; but no trace of such an action on
the light was seen on the outside of the helix, even in the line
 most close to the uncovered wire.
    2206. The water was inclosed in brass and copper tubes,
 but this alteration caused not the slightest change in the
effect.
   2207. The water in the brass tube was put into an iron
tube, much longer than either the Woolwich helix or the
                                      W.h
brass tube, and quite one-eighth of an inch thick in the side;
yet when placed in the                  helix (2192.), the water
rotated the ray of light apparently as well as before.
   2208. An iron bar, one inch square and longer than the
helix, was put into the helix, and the small water-tube (2203.)

          it.                        nuch action
                                       as          on the light as
before.
   2209. Three iron tubes, each twenty-seven inches long and
one-eighth           of
                   inch   an     in
                            thickness     the side, were selected
                                            in

supplied with glass ends and filled with water; and being
placed      in
            the axis      the Woolwich helix, had
                                of                      a  certain

second tube was then placed over this, so that there was now
a thickness of iron equal to two-eighths of an inch between
the water and the helix; the water had more power of rota
tion than before. On placing the third tube of iron over the
two former, the power of the water fell, but was still very con
siderable.    These results are complicated, being dependent
on the new condition which the character of iron gives to                                             its

   2219. A polarized ray and electric currents were combined
in every possible way in electrolytes (951–954). The sub
stances used were distilled water, solution of sugar, dilute sul
phuric acid, solution of sulphate of soda, using platinum elec
trodes; and solution of sulphate of copper, using copper elec
trodes; the current was sent along the ray, and perpendicular
 to it in two directions at right angles with each other; the ray
 was made to rotate, by altering the position of the polarizing
 mirror, that the plane of polarization might be varied; the
 current was used as a continuous current, as a rapidly inter
 mitting current, and as a rapidly alternating double current of
 induction; but in no case was any trace of action perceived.

 magnetic lines of force, were directed in every possible way
 through dilute sulphuric acid and solution of sulphate of soda,
 but still with negative results, except in those positions
 where the phaenomena already described were produced.             In
 one arrangement, the current passed in the direction of ra
 dii from a central to a circumferential electrode, the contrary
 magnetic poles being placed above and below; and the ar
 rangements were so good, that when the electric current was
 passing, the fluid rapidly rotated; but a polarized ray sent

vided into two classes, the one including air, gases and vapours,
and the other rock crystal, Iceland spar, and certain other
crystalline bodies.          As regards the latter class,           shall give,            I
in  the next series          theseofresearches,   proofs   drawn from phae

  tion of matter, that we ought not too hastily to assume that
  the substances which, in the solid and liquid state, possess
  properties even general in character, always carry these into
  their gaseous condition.
      2238. Rock-salt, fluor-spar, and, I think, alum, affect the
  ray of light; the other crystals experimented with did not;
  these are equiaxed and singly refracting, the others are un
  equiaxed and doubly refracting.          Perhaps these instances,
  with that of the rotation of quartz, may even now indicate a
  relation between magnetism, electricity, and the crystallizing
  forces of matter.
      2239. All bodies are affected by helices as by magnets,
  and according to laws which show that the .causes of the ac
  tion are identical as well as the effects.    This result supplies
  another fine proof in favour of the identity of helices and mag
  nets, according to the views of Ampère.
     2240. The theory of static induction which            I
                                                      formerly ven
  tured to set forth (1161, &c.), and which depends upon the
 action of the contiguous particles of the dielectric intervening
  between the inductric and the inductedus bodies, led me to
 expect that the same kind of dependence upon the intervening
 particles would be found to exist in magnetic action; and
 I   published certain experiments and considerations on this
 point seven years ago (1709–1736). I could not then dis
 cover any peculiar condition of the intervening substance or
 diamagnetic; but now that I have been able to make out such
 a state, which is not only a state of tension (2227), but de
 pendent entirely upon the magnetic lines which pass through
 the substance, I am more than ever encouraged to believe
 that the view then advanced is correct.
     2241. Although the magnetic and electric forces appear
 to exert no power on the ordinary or on the depolarized ray
 of light, we can hardly doubt but that they have some special
 influence, which probably will soon be made apparent by ex
periment.       Neither can it be supposed otherwise than that
 the same kind of action should take place on the other forms
of radiant agents as heat and chemical force.

phaenomena presented by           will,

  “If   the explanation of the apparently very unusual facts ob
served by Dr. Franklin in 1776, and by the Iphigenia in 1822,
be correct, how highly curious is the connexion thus traced
between a more than ordinary strength of the winds within
the tropics in the summer, occasioning the derangement of
the level of the Mexican and Caribbean seas, and the high
temperature of the sea between the British Channel and Ma
deira, in the following winter'
   “Nor is the probable meteorological influence undeserving
of attention, of so considerable an increase in the temperature
of the surface water over an extent of ocean exceeding 600
miles in latitude and 1000 in longitude, situated so import
antly in relation to the western parts of Europe. It is at
least a remarkable coincidence, that in November and Decem
ber 1821, and in January 1822, the state of the weather was
so unusual in the southern parts of Great Britain and in
France, as to have excited general observation; in the meteo
rological Journals of the period it is characterized as ‘most
extraordinarily hot, damp, stormy, and oppressive; it is stated,
‘that an unusual quantity of rain fell both in November and
December, but particularly in the latter;' that “the gales from
the west and south-west were almost without intermission,”
and that in December, the mercury in the barometer was
lower than it had been known for thirty-five years before*.”
   * “The following description of this very remarkable winter is extracted
from Mr. Daniell's Essay on the Climate of London (Meteorological Essays.
London, 1823, pages 297 and 298), and becomes highly curious when
viewed in connexion with the unusual temperature of the ocean in the                     di

322     Lieut.-Col. Sabine on the Cause of Mild Winters
    It is impossible to read this description of the winter of
 1821-1822 without being struck with the many features which
it has in common with that of the present year. The excess
 of heat in both amounted to several degrees, and continued
 through several months.         There were similar floods in many
parts of England in the early part and middle of this winter;
 and these were not confined to England only, but extended, as
 in 1821–1822, to many of the rivers of western Europe. The
 tension of the vapour conveyed to the shores of the British
 Channel in December, January and February last, was nearly
 3rd part greater, as appears by the Greenwich Observations,
 than in the same months of the preceding year; although in
 consequence of the much higher temperature, the humidity of
 the air, or the ratio of the humidity to saturation, has been
less. This was also the case in 1821–1822. We have had
 an unusual prevalence of westerly and south-westerly winds
 at the season when they are ordinarily replaced in a much
 greater proportion by the dry and cold winds which come to
 us from the interior of the great continents of Europe and
 Asia.    If in the southern parts of Britain, and on the shores
 of the British Channel, we have been less severely affected by
 storms and extreme barometrical depressions than was the
 case in 1821–1822, we may possibly owe the comparative ex
 emption to the fact that the excess of heat above the mean
 has been greater in the winter of 1845–1846 than it was in
 1821–1822; whence we may infer perhaps that the conflict of
 the opposing currents of the atmosphere has been removed in
 the present year further to the north and north-east than on
 the former occasion; it is at the limits which are reached by
 the warm and humid current proceeding from the south-west,
 and in the localities where it encounters the dry and cold
 stream pressing from the east and north-east, that the greater
atmospherical derangements are produced, and these have
been experienced in the northern parts of Britain.
    The similarity of the two winters having thus been shown,
 and specially their agreement in those features in which they
differ from ordinary winters, it will naturally be asked, what
evidence we have to prove or disprove an extension of the Gulf
the mean temperature, but the rain, as if exhausted in the preceding month,
fell much below the usual quantity in this. There was not one day on
which the frost lasted during the twenty-four hours.
   “‘Serious apprehensions were entertained, lest the wheats, drawn up as
they had been by the warm and moist weather, without the slightest check
from frost, should be exhausted by excessive vegetation, and ultimately be
more productive in straw than corn.
   “The month of February, still 5° above the mean temperature, ended a
winter which never has been paralleled.”

in 1821. To this it must be replied, that strange as it may
appear, this remarkable phaenomenon may take place in any
year without our having other knowledge of it than by                                                                 its

    As soon as the current passes, one of the halves of this

  there had been interposed, without magnetic action, a lamina

   turning to the right in the first case and to the left in the
  second, it is certain that the equality of the tints would have
  been re-established by the same movements of the compen
  sator. Now, it is known that the effect produced by such a
  lamina of quartz would have been to turn the plane of pola
  rization from right to left, whence it seems very natural and
  legitimate to conclude, that the flint-glass subjected to the
  magnetic action has produced the same effect as this lamina
  of quartz, that is to say, that it has also turned the plane of
  polarization to the right for one direction of current, and to

that the total effect obtained by passing from the magnetic
action which is exerted in one direction to that which is ex
erted in the other, is equal to that which would be produced
by a plate of quartz four-tenths of a millimetre in thickness.
Such, up to the present time, is the maximum effect which
I have been able to obtain. As we have now a means of com
paring the intensities of this force, it will be very easy to see
how it will be modified by the different relative positions of
the electro-magnet and of the piece of flint-glass.

 to enter successively in the two directions, we shall see, in
 the first case, the effect to the right, and in the second the
 effect to the left, which establishes, as Mr. Faraday has pointed
 out, a difference, at least apparent, between the substances
 which have the permanent property of turning the planes of
 polarization and those which acquire it by magnetic action.
    In the second place it results, that on experimenting in this
 way care must be taken to give to the pieces subjected to the
 electro-magnet a length greater than the distance of the axes
of the two arms; for the portions which would exceed those
axes would receive similar modifications among one another,
 and opposed to that which the central portion would receive;
 it may even be presumed that the compensation might obtain
 exactly, so that with a connecting piece exceeding the breadth
 of the magnet, the action might be perfectly null. This re
 sult seems to me opposed to that which is pointed out by
 Mr. Faraday, namely, that the effect is proportional to the
length of the piece subjected to the experiments.
    It results, lastly, that in order to obtain a greater effect, two
electro-magnets, opposed to one another, may be presented
 to the piece of flint-glass, so that the poles of the same name
 face one another. This I have verified, and it is even by the
 assistance of two electro-magnets thus opposed that I have
 obtained the maximum effect of which I have spoken above.
 By placing thus several similar systems in succession on the
 same pencil, the effect would be, without doubt, tripled, &c.
    It has appeared to me very important to examine whether
 the position of the plane of polarization, with relation to the
 horizontal plane of the electro-magnet, had any influence on
 the energy of the action; but whether the plane of polariza
 tion be itself horizontal, vertical or intermediate, the results
 appeared to me to remain perceptibly the same.
     I have hitherto spoken only of flint-glass, but I have sub
jected to experiment         allthe other solid transparent bodies
 which       have been able         procure; for instance, various
                                   to
 kinds   of Iflint-glass, and doubtless      of
                                              different composition,
 crown-glass, and glass        of    kinds, coloured with copper,
                                    all
gold, chromium, &c., and also rock-salt.            All these bodies
present, although with less intensity, the same phaenomena
as   the flint-glass; unfortunately the samples        of crown-glass
are sometimes      so annealed     asmodify
                                        to   the  colours,  and which
does not allow         oftheir being compared with other bodies;
nevertheless, after the attempts which        I   have been able       to
make      on some less imperfect specimens,       I am led    to think
that the action    of  the crown-glass  has   anintensity   comprised
between the half and the two-thirds          of
                                              that    of

The chloride of sodium has an action very analogous to that
of the flint-glass.
    I have also subjected to experiment some transparent or
coloured liquids; these experiments were made in a trough
formed of parallel glasses, having a length of thirteen centi
metres, equal to the distance of the axes of the electro-mag
nets, a breadth of three centimetres, and a depth of five centi
metres. The trough being empty, and the electro-magnets
being in action, no sensible effect was produced by the pa
rallel glasses which formed the extremities.

 circle, like the magnetic metals, it forms two concentric
 circles, leaving thus a narrow white band, in the very place
 where the other metals form a circle, as if it were repelled
 by the more lively action of the iron armature of the magnet.
 The effect is so marked, that on mixing, for example, some
 sesquichloride of chromium very finely pulverized with some
 bismuth, likewise in very fine powder, the violet circle of the
 chloride is seen, and the two circles of the bismuth which are
 separate from them, although very near. Amber seems to
 give the same appearances as the bismuth, though in a much
 weaker degree.
    No attractive or repulsive effect is observed by this means,
 either on very pure antimony or on the other metals, binary
 or other compounds (among the rare metals,                have only  I
 experimented on tellurium and the uranium of M. Peligot),
 nor on the alkalies, sulphur, iodine, charcoal, and diamond.
I  regret that I had not at my disposal either cerium or any
 of its compounds.

rated with more delicate means        or  with more energetic mag
 nets.I     merely  mention them here      topoint out the easy pro

which are not magnetic after the manner of iron, are diamag
netic or magnetic after the manner of bismuth, we should be
led to conclude immediately that the optical action being con
comitant with a certain mechanical action, it is at least pre
sumable that this action is exerted upon the bodies, and not
directly and immediately on the light which passes through
them.

                                        as
relative weakness of my magnets or from the imperfection of
the methods which I have employed, or from other causes—
if it happens that the various kinds of glasses, distilled water,
the fatty bodies, &c., which are so sensitive to the optical
action, are nevertheless insensible to the mechanical action
of the magnetism, it would not be a reason to conclude that
magnetism acts directly upon the light itself; a conclusion
which, moreover, would only have a precise meaning in the
system of emission, for in the undulatory theory, which
seems at present so completely demonstrated, it is the aether
of the body submitted to the experiment which would be
modified by the magnetism, and it would doubtless be very
difficult to recognise whether it is modified without any par
ticipation of the ponderable matter of the body with which
it is so intimately connected.

phaenomenon which we understand by the term “aberration
of light.” When the position of a star has been corrected for
refraction, precession, and nutation, and proper motion if it
has any, lets be             its

is evident that what Prof. Challis means by aberration, is the
circumstance that s, is displaced from s, through the angle

own   confession, does not explain  aberration in the sense in
which I used the word; for he says that it follows from ob

                      ANALYSIS OF DIASPORE FROM SIBERIA.
                               BY M. A. DAMOUR.
rTh;  remarkable characters of diaspore have frequently attracted
   the attention of mineralogists, and have been extremely well de
scribed and analysed by MM. Children, Dufrenoy, and Hess.                   The
author observes, that he should therefore have abstained from re
ferring to them, if he had not had occasion lately to observe a sin
gular property of this mineral which had not been previously noticed.
The diaspore is a well-known hydrate of alumina.               It is shown by
the   experiments   of M.  Dufrenoy,    that this   mineral,  even when long
boiled in   sulphuric  acid, not  only  resists its action,  but retains      its                all
water.     M. Damour, on repeating this experiment, obtained the
same result; but         afterwards found that the diaspore, when de
                             he
prived  of      its
                water           by

an alcohol eolipyle.    The crucibles were cooled in a receiver with a
glass stopper, containing fragments of chloride of calcium.       When
perfectly cool they were again weighed, and the difference between
the first weighing and that after calcination was attributed to the
quantity of water disengaged, and was 14.97, 1496, and 14.90 in
three experiments.
   In order to act upon the diaspore deprived of water, hydrated sul
phuric acid was poured upon the mineral remaining in the crucible
in which it had been calcined. The whole was heated in a sand
bath so as to volatilize the greater part of the sulphuric acid; when
the matter had become of a pasty consistence, water was added,
which dissolved a great quantity of sulphate of alumina; the solu
tion was poured off, and more sulphuric acid was added, and this
operation was repeated five times. The aluminous solution was                                         fil

this, which had resisted the prolonged action of sulphuric acid, still
contained much alumina; when moistened with nitrate of cobalt
and heated to redness, it acquired a very decided blue tint, and rea
dily dissolved in the salt of phosphorus.
   The solution of sulphate of alumina was supersaturated with car
bonate of ammonia; the alumina was collected, washed and heated
for a long time to strong redness.    It was very white, and nitrate of
cobalt gave a fine blue tint to                   it.

At about 230° the distillation was stopped                             to
                                                    cohobate the distilled

boracic acid, burnt with a perfectly green flame, and yielded abun
dant white fumes of boracic acid.                                      -
   The semi-solid mass remaining in the retort was bruised and       di
gested during twenty-four hours in anhydrous aether, which com
pletely disintegrated it; the aethereal solution, when clear, was
poured into a retort placed in an oil-bath, and fitted with a conden
sing apparatus.      It was requisite to employ a temperature of about
392°Fahr. to obtain the last traces of aether and of alcohol. There
remained in the retort a large quantity of a viscid liquid, of a slight
amber colour, yielding at 392°Fahr. thick vapours in contact with
the air, and which became solid on cooling.
   The author considers this product as boracic aether, and it ap
proximates in physical properties to boracic acid and the borates,
which are well-known to assume the vitreous state by fusion. It is in
fact a true transparent glass, but one which is rather soft at common
temperatures; at about 104°Fahr. it may be drawn into fine threads.
It has a weak aethereal odour and burning taste; when applied to
the skin, it occasions a strong sensation of heat, and is converted
into a white powder, which is hydrated boracic acid; the same effect
is produced by the contact of air with the boracic aether, but when
the fragments are of considerable size, it takes place slowly, eventu
ally however they become quite opake. When boracic aether is tri
turated with water, it is very rapidly decomposed with the extrication
of much heat; alcohol is reproduced and may be obtained by distil
ling the aqueous liquid.
    Boracic aether is volatile, but not distillable; at about 392°Fahr.
it emits thick vapours into the air; but when distillation is attempted,
it is decomposed, leaving a considerable residue of fused boracic
acid. When it is dissolved in absolute alcohol and the mixture di
stilled, the alcohol volatilizes such a quantity of boracic aether, that
on the addition of water it becomes almost a solid mass.
    It is combustible, and burns with a white smoke and a fine green
flame, leaving a residue of fused boracic acid. It is soluble in aether
and alcohol in all proportions, and retains these fluids with great
affinity, for it is requisite to heat them to 392°Fahr. to remove the
last traces of them; these solutions become solid masses by the ad
dition of water.
   When boracic aether is heated, it first fuses, then decomposes,
swells, and becomes less and less liquid.       There are simultaneously
disengaged alcohol, which retains a large quantity of boracic aether,
and a colourless gas which burns with a green flame before it is
washed in water.       After having been passed through water, the gas
burns with a bright flame, and possesses all the properties of olefiant
gas. The residue of the decomposition is but unmixed anhydrous
boracic acid, much swelled with carbonaceous matter; it is requisite
to heat it to redness for a long time to expel the inflammable gas.
   Great difficulty attends the analysis of boracic aether; it was ef
fected by converting the boracic acid, first into borate of ammonia,
and afterwards into anhydrous boracic acid. The mean of several
experiments gave—

on A simple          METHoD of PROTECTING FRom LIGHTNING,
      BUILDINGS WITH METALLIC ROOFS.                  BY PROF. HENRY.
     On the principle of electrical induction, houses thus covered are
 evidently more liable to be struck than those furnished either with
 shingle or tile.      Fortunately, however, they admit of very simple
 means of    perfect protection.   It is evident, from well-established prin
 ciples of electrical action, that if the outside of a house were encased
 entirely in a coating of metal, the most violent discharge which might
 fall upon it from the clouds would pass silently to the earth without
 damaging the house, or endangering the inmates.            It is also evident,
 that if the house be    merely  covered with a roof of    metal, without pro
jecting chimneys, and this roof were put in metallic connexion with
 the ground, the building would be perfectly protected. To make a
 protection, therefore, of this kind, the Professor advises that the me
 tallic roof be placed in connexion with the ground, by means of the
 tin or copper gutters which serve to lead the water from the roof to
 the earth.      For this purpose, it is sufficient to solder to the lower end
 of the gutter a riband of sheet copper, two or three inches wide, sur
 rounding it with charcoal, and continuing it out from the house until
 it terminates in moist ground. The upper ends of these gutters are
 generally soldered to the roof; but if they are not in metallic contact,
 the two should be joined by a slip of sheet copper. The only part
 of the house unprotected by this arrangement will be the chimneys;
 and to secure these, it will only be necessary to erect a short rod against
 the chimney, soldered at its lower end to the metal of the roof, and
 extending fifteen or twenty inches above the top of the flue.
     Considerable discussion in late years has taken place in reference
 to the transmission of electricity along a conductor; whether it
  passes through the whole capacity of the rod, or is principally con
 fined to the surface. From a series of experiments presented to the
  American Philosophical Society, by Professor Henry, on this subject,
  it appears that the electrical discharge passes, or tends to pass, prin
  cipally at the surface; and as an ordinary-sized house is commonly
  furnished with from two to four perpendicular gutters (two in front
  and two in the rear), the surface of these will be sufficient to conduct,
  silently, the most violent discharge which may fall from the clouds.
     Professor Henry also stated, that he had lately examined a house
  struck by lightning, which exhibited some effects of an interesting
  kind. The lightning struck the top of the chimney, passed down the
  interior of the flue to a point opposite a mass of iron placed on the
  floor of the garret, where it pierced the chimney; thence it passed
  explosively, breaking the plaster, into a bedroom below, where it
  came in contact with a copper bell-wire, and passed along this hori
  zontally and silently for about six feet; thence it leaped explosively

dow, breaking the sash, and scattering the fragments across the
street.    It was evidently attracted to this point by the upper end of
a perpendicular    gutter, which was near the window. It passed silently
down the     gutter,  exhibiting scarcely any mark of            passage until               its
it arrived        at

      OBSERVATIONS ON CAPILLARITY.                  BY PROF. HENRY.
     In1839, the author presented the results           some experiments on       of
the permeability        lead    mercury; and subsequent observation had

   Professor Henry suggested that the silver, instead of evaporating,
merely sunk into the pores of the copper, and that by carefully re
moving the surface of the latter by the action of an acid, the silver
would reappear. To verify this by experiment, Mr. Cornelius heated
one end of a piece of thick plated copper to nearly the melting-point
of the metal; the silver at this end disappeared, and when the metal
was cleaned by a solution of dilute sulphuric acid, the end which had
been heated presented a uniform surface of copper, whilst the other
end exhibited            its
                       proper coating                       of

 LIV.    Thoughts on Ray-vibrations.        By Michael FARADAY,
         Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., Fullerian Prof., &c. &c.
                     To Richard Phillips, Esq.
      DEAR   SIR,
AT of that which
        your request I will endeavour to convey to you a notion
                        I ventured to say at the close of the last
Friday-evening Meeting, incidental to the account I gave of
Wheatstone's electro-magnetic chronoscope; but from first to
last understand that I merely threw out as matter for specula
tion, the vague impressions of my mind, for I gave nothing
as the result of sufficient consideration, or as the settled con
viction, or even probable conclusion at which          I had arrived.
    The point intended to be set forth for the consideration of
the hearers was, whether it was not possible that the vibrations
which in a certain theory are assumed to account for radia
tion and radiant phaenomena may not occur in the lines of
force which connect particles, and consequently masses of
matter together; a notion which, as far as it is admitted, will
dispense with the aether which, in another view, is supposed to
be the medium in which these vibrations take place.
                                                    I
   You are aware of the speculation* which some time since
uttered respecting that view of the nature of matter which
considers its ultimate atoms as centres of force, and not as so
many little bodies surrounded by forces, the bodies being con
sidered in the abstract as independent of the forces and capa
ble of existing without them. In the latter view, these little
particles have a definite form and a certain limited size; in
the former view such is not the case, for that which represents
size may be considered as extending to any distance to which
the lines of force of the particle extend: the particle indeed is

346          Dr. Faraday's Thoughts on Ray-vibrations.
supposed to exist only by these forces, and where they are it
is.   The consideration                       of
                                    matter under this view gradually
led me     to look           at
                        the lines       force      of
                                                   being perhaps the seat
                                                                  as
of the vibrations              of
                          radiant   phaenomena.
   Another consideration bearing conjointly                   the hypotheti           on
cal view both         matter and radiation, arises from the compari
                         of
son of the velocities with which the radiant action and certain
powers       matter are transmitted. The velocity              light through
         as is, is
                                                                                       of
space      about 190,000 miles              second; the velocity          elec                        of

of miles apart; further, atoms which, to our knowledge, are
 at least nineteen times that distance, and indeed, in cometary
 masses, far more, are in a similar way tied together by the
 lines of force extending from and belonging to each. What
 is there in the condition of the particles of the supposed aether,
 if there be even only one such particle between us and the
 sun, that can in subtilty and extent compare to this?
     Let us not be confused by the ponderability and gravitation
 of heavy matter, as if they proved the presence of the abstract
 nuclei; these are due not to the nuclei, but to the force su
 peradded to them, if the nuclei exist at all; and, if the aether
 particles be without this force, which according to the assump
 tion is the case, then they are more material, in the abstract
 sense, than the matter of this our globe; for matter, accord
ing to the assumption, being made up of nuclei and force,
 the aether particles have in this respect proportionately more
of the nucleus and less of the force.
    On the other hand, the infinite elasticity assumed as be
longing to the particles of the aether, is as striking and posi
tive a force of it as gravity is of ponderable particles, and pro
duces in         its
                 way effects        great;    as                in

apt than air or water.

I   had to appear suddenly and occupy the place of another.
Now that      I  have put them on paper, I feel that          I ought to
have kept them much longer for study, consideration, and,
perhaps, final rejection; and it is only
to   go  abroad in one      way  or  another,  in

utterance on that evening, that I give them a shape, if shape
it may be called, in this reply to your inquiry. One thing is
certain, that any hypothetical view of radiation which is likely
to be received or retained as satisfactory, must not much
longer comprehend alone certain phaenomena of light, but
must include those of heat and of actinic influence also, and
even the conjoined phaenomena of sensible heat and che
mical power produced by them.                 In this respect, a view,
which is in some degree founded upon the ordinary forces of
matter, may perhaps find a little consideration amongst the
other views that will probably arise.            I think it likely that I
have made many mistakes in the preceding pages, for even to
myself, my ideas on this point appear only as the shadow of
a speculation, or as one of those impressions on the mind
which are allowable for a time as guides to thought and re
search. He who labours in experimental inquiries knows how
numerous these are, and how often their apparent fitness and
beauty vanish before the progress and development of real
natural truth.

                 LV.    On the War     of the  Chamaerops.
                    By  J. E. TeschEMAcHER, Esq.”
ABQ."           three millions of palm leaves are annually imported
        into the United States of America, for the purpose of
being manufactured into hats.           They come tied in bundles,
called in   Spanish     Esteras,  each estera weighing from 50 to 60
pounds; these are the palmate part of #. leaf with a small
portion of the petiole; this last weighs one-eighth of the leaf.
The palm from which the leaves are cut in Cuba and other
parts of the West Indies for this purpose is a Chamaerops, a
low-growing species, not differing I believe from the C. hu
milis of the southern sections of the United States, except in
being much more robust in habit.                The C. humilis P the
United States is too soft and yielding for this manufacture.

                         War of the Chamaerops.                                     351
 I have    cultivated the plant from Cuba for five or six years,
 and was unable to discover any difference in foliage; but                            I
 have never seen the fruit of either. The leaf of the Chamaerops
 spreads out nearly horizontal with folds, precisely like those of
 a lady's fan. On opening these folds, when they arrive in the
 United States in their dried state, there is a quantity of white
 flaky powder, under this is the bright varnish which covers
 the whole surface of the leaf; both these are true vegetable
 wax.     From one of these palm leaves I obtained, by passing
 the thumb down the folds, 90 grains of the white wax in pow
 dery flakes, and by boiling the leaf, after cutting in pieces, in
 alcohol, 300 grains more of a grayer coloured wax.
    At the manufactory the leaves are often bleached by the
 fumes of sulphurous acid gas, and then split by machinery into
 very thin strips; this division cracks off of course a large por
 tion of the brittle varnish, which, together with the white pow
 der, falls to the ground, is swept together and burnt or thrown
 away. The weight of this substance destroyed annually pro
 bably exceeds one hundred thousand pounds.
    On treating this substance with a small quantity of boilin
 alcohol, it may, like other wax, be separated into cerine an
 myricine.
    The powdery flakes first obtained contain about 80 per
cent. myricine and 20 per cent. cerine, but the wax obtained
from boiling the leaf in alcohol contains scarcely any myricine.
This is easily accounted for; the flakes, being the brittle and
more resinous part, break off readily; while the alcohol, which
acts on the leaves, dissolves only the cerine, leaving the myri
cine undissolved; this might no doubt be obtained by increa
sing the quantity of alcohol and continuing the process, if it
were desirable.       In bees' wax the proportions of these two
substances     vary  also,  the cerine from 70 to 90 per cent.,
myricine from iO to 30 per cent. ; and it is probable that the
more or less brittle quality of        all
                                       wax depends     the relativeon
quantity  of   these two  ingredients.
    The wax    of  Ceroxylon andicola,     very lofty palm, found
                                                 a

of the wax and resin from the produce of Ceroxylon, there
remains in the alcohol a bitter yellow substance, supposed to

be a vegetable alkaloid. This yellow substance separates also
from the wax of the leaf of Chamaerops, but I think it is not
an ingredient in the wax, but of other parts of the juices dis
solved by the alcohol.
     The production from the juices of plants by a purely vege
 table function of wax scarcely differing from that deposited
 in their hives by bees is                  to throw light on the ques
 tion of the formation of this substance by these insects, and
 also merits the careful examination of those who are entering
 into the study of the various transformations of the vegetable
juices at different periods of their progress towards maturity.
      LVI.    Analysis  of a Cobalt Ore found in Western India.

        EING
         Western  #.
                engaged in analyses of the metallic ores of North
                            with a view to the ascertainment of the
  constitutions of those most remarkable among them, and also
  with the hope of detecting others whose existence in the
  country has not heretofore been even suspected,              I am desi
  rous of   submitting    to the Chemical     Society  the results of my
  inquiries whenever they appear to me of sufficient interest to
  justify my troubling them with them. I may mention, that
   should the Society desire any information from me on this
   or any other subject that I may be qualified and in a position
   to furnish, I shall most gladly meet their wishes.
      The hilly districts of "Rajpootanah are remarkably prolific
   in metallic ores, many of these, too, exceedingly rich and
   abundant. Within a narrow compass in the independent state
   of Syepoore, are to be found the following minerals:—
      Sulphuret of copper, sulphate of copper, sulphuret of co
   balt, alum.
      The native method of mining for the first of these ores, and
   which is the same as that adopted for the others, may be
   interesting to some of your members.
      “The mine of copper is very deep, and difficult of access.
   The miners enter with burning lamps on their heads and with
   chisels, iron hammers, and baskets in their hands. They dig
   out the ore with their chisels by the light of their lamps, and
   bring it up with great labour and difficulty to the surface.
   They then pound and grind it small in a miil, after which

they mix it with moist cow-dung, and this mixture being made
into balls is placed in the sun to dry. When this has been
accomplished the lumps are burnt, after which they are not
broken up, but being mixed with an equal quantity of char
coal and as much iron filings, are put into a crucible, and a
strong heat kept up

                             blowing with a leathern bellows till
the dross separates and the copper settles at the bottom in
 the form of a solid disc. This product is again heated with
 charcoal until perfectly pure copper is produced *.”
    The mineral possessing greatest interest amongst those
 above enumerated is the sulphuret of cobalt.         It is found in
 the  copper mines in considerable   abundance,    and exists in a
 primitive schist in the form of bands and disseminated grains,
 the colour of which is a steel gray inclining to yellow.       The
 grains appear to be crystallized, and are probably the cube
 and   its
         derivatives.   What      particularly remarkable
                                                    is           this                              in

     LVII.     On the Structural Relations                                 of   Organized Beings.

       PROPOSE                  to   make       a   few observations on the Relations

                                         structure are not similar,
but identical; and secondly, the relations between        organized                            an
being and the external circumstances         soil, climate,    food,      of                         or

                    Relations of Organized Beings.            355
in the structure of an individual organism, but in the mutual
relations of those organisms, the due combinations of which
constitute the Natural Systems of Botany and Zoology.
   When the human mind first began to observe and to com
pare the structures of organic life, to generalize the points of
agreement, and thus to lay the foundation of the Science of
Natural History, no inherent principles of classification were
even suspected to exist, characters were compared and gene
ralized at random, and the arrangements which resulted were
of the rudest and most unphilosophical    kind. The most su
perficial and arbitrary characters were selected as the basis of
classification, and no man was able to give a reason why one
mode of arrangement should not be as correct and as true to
Nature as another. Thus we find the older naturalists class
ing Lizards, Tortoises and Frogs with terrestrial Mammalia,
under the name of “Four-footed Beasts,” while Serpents
were made into a distinct Class; and Whales, whose physio
logical organization is as highly developed as in any other
Mammal, were dismissed among the cold-blooded Class of
Fish, into which the humble Lobster and the Oyster entered
from the other side to keep them company. By some authors
we find the Echinus and the Hedge-hog approximated, be
cause both are covered with spines; the Ammonite and the
 Rock-crystal were described in the same chapter “de lapi
dibus”; Shrew-mice and Spiders were classed together, be
cause both were supposed to be venomous; Bats were referred
to Birds, Corals to Plants, and so on.
   In the course of the seventeenth century, the few who cul
tivated natural science began to be conscious that these crude
arrangements were not satisfactory, or consistent with the
realities of Nature; and in the works of Ray and of Lister, we
perceive many instances of an instinctive preference for essen
tial instead of arbitrary characters.   But it was Linnaeus who
first pointed out in express terms the great principle of the
Subordination of Characters. This principle teaches us to give
to each point of structure      its
                                 due weight, and        to
                                                     attach more
value     those peculiarities whose immediate influence
         to                                                  on
                                                              the
mysteries      of
               Life often renders them the most difficult for our
         toappreciate, than     those external characters which,
                                to to
senses
though most conspicuous          the eye, are but remotely con
 nected with the real Essence  the creature. This principle
                                    byof
 has been further developed   later naturalists, especially       by
 Cuvier, and accordingly we now find that      the modern sy
                                                   in
 stems   of   Zoology the primary divisions  the Animal King
                                              of
 dom are based       on
                   characters derived chiefly  from the nervous
 system,      as
           being the most important feature        organization,

356          Mr. H. E. Strickland       on the Structural
the secondary subdivisions are grounded on the organs of re
spiration, groups of a lower rank on the digestive system, and
so on, the most superficial peculiarities, such as external form
and colour, being reserved to characterize the ultimate groups
of genera and species. These improved principles of classi
fication are gradually bringing the systems of Zoology and
Botany into a state of permanence, consistent with Nature,
and satisfactory to that Truth-seeking Instinct which is inhe
rent in the human mind.
   A further advance of philosophical Classification has shown
that the characters of organized beings require not only to be
subordinated according to their importance, but subdivided
according to their kinds.        There are many instances of cor
respondence of structural characters in organic beings which
can never by any process of subordination become elements
in a natural classification, and it is important to distinguish
those which can from those which cannot be so employed.
Zoologists had long been aware that certain sets of characters
produced an arbitrary or artificial method if employed for
classification, while others seemed to lead to a natural system,
but the question was involved in obscurity till the time of
MacLeay, who was the first to give us clear definitions on the
distinction between AFFINITY and ANALogy.                   He applied
his views indeed in support of a theory, the Quinary System,
which few naturalists are now disposed to support, and with
which we are not now concerned; but his elucidation of Affi
nities and Analogies is not the less valuable on that account.
Although     I  am not disposed to take the same view of these
principles as that of Mr. MacLeay, yet as the principles them
selves are at the foundation of all sound classification, whether
in Zoology or Botany,       I may be allowed to make a few further
remarks upon this subject.
    It appears to me that the instances of resemblance or agree
ment of structure between any two species of organized beings
should be reduced, not into two, but into three distinct classes,
Affinity, Analogy, and a third, for which I propose to adopt
the name of Iconism *.
   I. The highest class of these structural agreements is that
of Affinities, which appear to be the direct result of those
 Laws of Organic Life which the Creator has enacted for his
own guidance in the act of Creation.            Affinity consists in an
essential and    physiological    agreement     in the corresponding
parts of organic beings, resulting from a uniformity of plan
   * This term, suggested by the Rev. Dr. Ingram, President of Trinity
College, appears preferable to Mimesis, which I had originally proposed to
use.

which pervades the System of Nature”.                     These essential
agreements of parts consist rather in a similarity of organic
composition and of relative situation, than of form.              A micro
scopic examination of the primary tissue, or a chemical ana
lysis of      its
              substance, will often demonstrate the true affinities
of a   structure when         external form would only mislead us.

            real horns, but correspond                                                            of

          358              Mr. H. E. Strickland        on the Structural
          between two organic beings is merely a corollary deduced
          from an observed affinity between the corresponding organs
          in each; and though it is not usual to apply the term affinity
          to the similarities between parts, yet as the similarity between
          the wholes results from the similarities of their parts, the word
          affinity may be as correctly applied to the one as to the other.
          In works of comparative anatomy it is customary to speak of
          those members which are essentially equivalent in two organic
         beings as analogous organs, but we shall soon see that the
         word analogy has a very different sense; and as the relation
         between equivalent organs is one of real affinity, and forms
         the sole ground on which we assert the affinity of the whole
         beings, we may introduce the adjective affine or homologous
         in place of analogous, when referring to structures which es
         sentially correspond in different organic beings.
             When we say that Affinity consists in an essential agree
         ment of structure resulting from a fixity of purpose in the
         mind of Creative Wisdom, it must not be supposed that all.
         affinities are equally strong, direct, and palpable. Any agree
         ment, however slight, or however concealed by more palpable
         differences, which forms part of the plan of organic existence,
         is a true affinity; and the principle of subordination of cha
         racters before referred to is merely the arranging of these affi
         nities in the true order of their proximities.                  #.   proximity
         of affinities is in the inverse ratio of their essential importance,
         the most important agreements of characters being those which
         have the widest extent, and which therefore form affinities be
         tween the remotest points in the System of Organized Beings.
         We will illustrate this by an example showing the successive
         series of affinities which the same species bears to others, com
         mencing with the most remote, and proceeding to the closest
         affinity which can subsist between two distinct species. We
         will take as an example the species Raven (Corvus coraa).

sively as we proceed from the remotest organism to the ap

possess that superficial resemblance of form which constitutes
their generic character, but they have in addition     the other                            all

                     Relations        of Organized     Beings.                        361
phant, endowed in one respect with an analogy to the Ox,
and in another respect to Man, yet having no immediate
affinity with either.
    As then Analogy consists in an agreement of function, and
only of form so far as it tends to discharge that function, it
follows that real and genuine Analogies may take place be
tween the works of Nature and the works of Man, while no
such relation of Affinity can possibly exist. When, for                               in
stance, the inventive powers of Man are called upon to imi
tate any of the operations of Nature, the external matter to
be acted on being in both cases the same, a similar arrange
ment of form is adopted by both.                       If
                                                  the problem be to
make a      floating   body   adapted   for  rapid   motion through
water, Man either by practical experiment or mathematical
calculation produces the form of a boat, and thus uncon
sciously imitates the structure of the Whale and Seal among
Mammals, the Penguin among Birds, the Ichthyosaurus and
Turtle among Reptiles, the Fish among Vertebrata, the Dy
tiscus among Coleoptera, the Notonecta among Hemiptera,
Sepia among Mollusca, Physalia among Acalephae, &c. &c.
Nor is the analogy between a ship and a Fish confined to the
external form only; the keel of the one represents the spine
of the other, the “ribs” of both agree in name as in nature,
the rudder coincides with the tail, the oars with the fins, the
masts with the spinous processes, the running rigging with
the tendons, the seamen with the muscles, the look-out man on
the forecastle with the eye, and the captain in the cabin with
the mental faculties in the Fishes' brain. Again, what can
be more striking than the analogy between a locomotive
steam-engine        .# a living Animal?      We see in both an ana
logous respiratory and digestive system, the same necessity for
food and drink and oxygen to sustain that internal combus
tion which is the source of the vital action, the same obedience
of the organs of motion to the impulse of the governing mind,
and the same wear and tear of the system, terminating in old
age and sudden or gradual death. Yet in                     all
                                                      these cases there

tificial and natural productions, as between one object of the

Analogies ought to stand in our estimation than Affinities.
 The latter form an essential part of that magnificent plan of
 Creation, which notwithstanding the amount of attention

of essence           or   of
                   function.    Such, for example, are the resem

ceus   to Campephaga phaenicea.      Many errors of classification
 have been caused by mistaking these similarities for true affi
 nities.
    Not only are such cases of external resemblance uncon
 nected with any agreement in the essential structures of the
 bodies compared, but there is no conceivable similarity in the
 functions which they are created to discharge.        think thereI
 fore that it is not going too far, nor departing from that vene
 ration which the true naturalist will always feel for Nature's
 God, to call such superficial coincidences of form accidental.
 They seem to arise from the exuberant variety of the works
 of Nature which causes an occasional recurrence of similar
 forms, without any express design for such coincidences.
 Nothing can be inferred from such resemblances, either as to
 essential affinity or functional design; and they would almost
 have been beneath our notice, were it not that some authors
 have regarded them as examples of real analogies.         The ad
 vocates of the Quinary theory of classification, who regard
 Analogies to be as important an element in the Natural System
 as Affinities, often speak of these mere resemblances in the
 light of true Analogies, and appeal to them in confirmation of
 their views.     Regarding however, as             I
                                             do, those views to be
 erroneous, I think it important that the distinction between
Junctional Analogy and mere resemblance should be clearly
 pointed out; and to render the distinction more marked,                             I
 would distinguish the latter by the new term Iconism.
    We must beware indeed of too hastily pronouncing an                         in
 stance of resemblance to be an Iconism, merely because we
 cannot immediately detect any functional analogy.          There
 may be real reasons for these resemblances, real agreements in
 the functions to be discharged, which we have not yet de
 tected, and perhaps may never discover.          A person might
 say, for instance, that the species of Mantis called the “walk
 ing leaf” presents a mere Iconism or accidental resemblance
 to true leaves; whereas it is highly probable that this very re
 semblance is given to the animal to enable it to remain con
 cealed from   its  foes amid the verdant foliage.   Such     least    at
is  undoubtedly the intention          of
                                     numerous instances      which    in
 animals present      ananalogous colour     the surrounding sur

   The foregoing results give a mean temperature of 67°46:
as however the observations at 4 and 8 P.M. give higher re
sults than would have been afforded if the observations had
been made at 3 and 9 P.M. instead, and as we are without
observations at 3 A.M.,                 I
                           consider the foregoing temperature
about 2°3 above the true mean, which in this case will be
about 65° 14.
   Circumstances have prevented my making many compari
sons between the indications of the thermometer in the shade
and when exposed to the direct action of the sun's rays.    In
the following instances, however, the instrument was suspended
at about three feet above a surface of newly-turned garden
mould, of a deep red colour.

LIX.  On Pegmine and Pyropine, animal substances allied to
  Albumen.   By Robert D. THoMson, M.D., Lecturer on
  Practical Chemistry in the University of Glasgowº.
THIS  paper was written for a government report, detailing
   the results of an extensive series of experiments made
on the influence of different kinds of food in feeding cattle
during the course of 1845.
   The report was drawn up last year, but has not yet been
published.    In reference to the reducing powers of the ani
mal system, it is remarked that “there is only one instance
with which physiologists are at present acquainted that could
be adduced as evidence in favour of any substance being ren
dered more complex in the animal system, viz. the production
of fibrine or flesh from curd or caseine. So far as chemical
experiments carry us, we are not in a condition to affirm that
no fibrine exists in milk; but it must be admitted that none has
as yet been detected.       these be correct, then it would ap

on land, the higher subsist on the lower animals, because the
latter consist of the same materials of which the higher systems
are composed. Without the lower animals, therefore, it is ob
vious the larger could not exist, and hence we may infer that
the inferior organizations first peopled the earth, an argument
opposed to the idea of some geologists, that animals have not
been developed in succession.        As it is well known that
oysters serve as food for larger fishes, and these again for
more powerful species, experiments were made to deter
mine the composition of oysters, herrings, and haddocks,
since it is highly probable that these prey on each other.
 Portions of these fishes were well-washed in water, to remove
the oil and soluble matters; the white residue was then treated
with alcohol and repeated digestions in aether. The resulting
matter, which was considered to be pure fibrine, was found to
have the following composition in the three species of fish
when burned with chromate of potash:—                          -

acuminated as they recede from the fiftieth degree of longi

most important, will  found their origin be

 Meteorological Reductions*, that they may be produced by
 the crossing of two large atmospheric waves moving in differ
 ent directions.  Some interesting evidence of the existence of
such atmospheric waves has been brought forward at late
 Meetings of the British Association.          This evidence rests
entirely on the barometric affections of the atmosphere over a
large tract of country.       In order, therefore, to extend our
knowledge of the rotatory gale (Redfield) or the centripetal
hurricane (Espy), especially with regard to the desiderata
above-mentioned, I apprehend it will not only be important,
but absolutely necessary to accompany            the observations    all                              of

 passage    in   a later  writing   (the   Responsorum     liber   octavus,   pub
 lished  in    1593) which     might    have left the above      impression                                  on
 Delambre's mind.            Here Vieta distinctly names and objects
 to    the words tangent and secant, and proposes                        call the            to
 former     prosines         or
                           amsines,    and the latter transsinuous lines.

   The first after Finck who used the words tangent and se
cant was the celebrated Jesuit Clavius, whose edition of Theo
dosius *, with trigonometry and tables attached, was published,
according to Lalande, in 1586. Blundeville, who copied these
tables into his Evercises, and who                far    is,can find, the
                                                                as        as I
first  Englishman       who   gave  complete   trigonometrical     tables,
cites this date. These tables                       of
                                         Clavius are those         Finck,                of
with the use               of
                      the terms tangent and secant; but Finck's
name     is entirely  suppressed.     Clavius does not mention the
name of the condemned Protestant Rheticus:                       not sur
                                                                                it

prising that               he
                       should have served the other Protestant,
                                                 as do
Finck,        the same way.
             in                        not suspect Clavius

montanus and Purbach freely enough, and excludes none but
persons whom             reputable Jesuit could not name,

testants and      Copernicans.      But     proceed  I    make  good   my to
assertion.
    The tables of Clavius are                       to
                                        the same radius and interval
 as those      ofFinck. The sines are avowedly from Regiomon
tanus: the latter gave differences            every ten seconds; Cla
                                                         to
vius does the same.          But Finck gave no differences: Clavius
gives     no differences      his tangents and secants.
                                     to                        the tables           In
of  this  period,   the  tangents  and secants      the last degree were
                                                                of in
often very wrong, having hardly one                what we call the de
 cimal   places   right.    Clavius  agrees  with Finck       every deci        in
 mal   place,    and differs from Vieta and what had then been
 published           by
                    Rheticus.     For instance, we take the tangent
 and secant of 89° 50'.
                                          Tan 89° 50'.         Sec. 89° 50'.              Date.

       Clavius      ...............       343.7829002          343.7843546                 1586
      And               throughout: whenever Finck differs
                                                                                                  in in
             it   is      the same
two     or
        three decimal   places from Rheticus,   does Clavius              so
the same manner.      And whereas Vieta and Rheticus have the
semiquadrantal form, Clavius agrees with Finck        retaining                      in
the quadrantal  form.
   There       particular reason why Finck should differ from
                  in is
                     a
Rheticus     the secants.    The former used the reciprocal                                       of
the cosine carried      more figures than
                                 to           would give truly;      it
the latter demonstrated the formula

tables which Ralph Handson had published in his translation
of the Trigonometry of Pitiscus (of the first edition of which
I  have not found the date). The first sines actually published,
as far as   I can find, were those at the end of Thomas Fale's
Horologiographia, first published in 1593; they are to minutes,
with a radius of 100000. The first complete canon which I
can find is that of Blundeville, in his Exercises, first published
in 1597. They are taken from Clavius, and are to every
minute, with a radius of ten millions.         These Exercises went
through seven editions at least, and were latterly corrected
from Pitiscus.      John Speidell, well-known afterwards for his
logarithms, published a small table in 1609, to every ten mi
nutes, and to a radius of 1000.        Briggs began his calculation
of sines about    1600,  in ignorance,   we may suppose, of the ap
pearance of the Opus Palatinum four years before.             This is

is by Frobesius, and was printed at Helmstadt about 1750;
but I cannot find any copy of this work in London.
          LXIII.    Complete Collection    of Kepler's  Works.
                        By Dr. J. LHoTsKY,”
                      Frisch of   Stutgardt    has recently published
 PROFESSOR
        a programme     of his intended    collection of the works of
                                         J.
 the great German astronomer and hilosopher, which, like a
 splendid luminary, will enliven the
              Considering    Kepler
                                               polygraphy of the pre
 sent  age.                           as the real founder of modern
 astronomy, the collecting of his works (many of them very
 rare) is a tribute most due to such great merit.         Our present
 epoch seems especially adapted to such an undertaking. Mo
 numents are everywhere raised to the honour and memory of
 men who have deserved well of humanity or of their country,
 in one or another department of human knowledge or enter
 prise.    In following up the track marked out by Kepler, in
 astronomical science, a degree of accuracy and perspicuity has
 been acquired, which is one of the proudest trophies of the
 human mind.        In such a time, it is impossible that the claims
 and memory of Kepler could be kept in abeyance any longer.
 He, the modest searcher and deep thinker, ought to obtain
 his share of attention and general recognition, so long with
                      * Communicated   by the Author.

 388                Dr. Lhotsky    on the Complete
 held from him, whose discoveries have been confirmed in so
 splendid a way.
    Something, it is true, has been done in the way of atone
 ment towards his long-neglected memory; and it is now
thirty-seven years since over his grave at Regensburg (his
native city), the image of the great man was placed under the
cupola of a monument, on the anniversary of his birth-day,
 amid the roar of cannon.         It cannot, however, be said that
 this slight token of gratitude could suffice to the memory of
 one whom his coevals left in misery and distress, while occu
pied with the examination of the very innermost secrets of
science; while at the same time the produce of a painful and
thorny life, his splendid works, remained unknown and for
gotten.    It is true, his name is on the lips of every astronomer
and   philosopher;    the three great Keplerean laws are yet the
main basis of the knowledge of the heavens; still his works
moulder in dust and oblivion.          On the other hand, it must
be acknowledged that the present position of mathematical
science is far different from what it was in the seventeenth
century; and problems are now solved with facility and speed
which then occasioned much labour; and many a deep axiom
and saying of Kepler will be more easily appreciated if pre
sented to the reader in a more modern garb.             But it is not
merely the contents, but even the form and style of the im
mortal astronomer's works, which imparts value to them; and
it requires but little attention to become familiar with that
form, albeit hidden and enigmatic.
    There are two reasons, however, which have hitherto pre
vented the greater spread of Kepler's works,—their rarity
and their external appearance. There is hardly a library in
Europe where all the works of Kepler are to be met with, and
many where even the most important are wanting. The cause
is obvious. In the then condition of typography and publish
ing, only a few copies could be printed, and of those many
were lost in conveying them about the country and by other
accidents. Thus, for instance, Kepler's Harmonie and Astro
nomia Nova are so scarce, that only the largest libraries can
boast of their possession. The next cause of the neglect of
our author's works, is the wretched type, bad paper, and
the improper size of many of them. The figures, moreover,
are so badly designed, and the letters thereon so indistinct,
that they cannot be read without difficulty.          These reasons
will be deemed sufficient     for  making   a  collection of Kepler's
works.    It was the late Prof. Pfaff at   Eslingen,   who, in 1810,
first conceived this    design, which,   however,   did not come to
maturity. Still, constant communications with this gentleman

                  Collection of Kepler's  Works.             389
kept the conviction of the importance of such an undertaking
alive, and a further investigation of the great work increased
the interest for the old astronomer and philosopher.         The
present editor, however, Prof. Frisch, did not long enjoy the
assistance of either Pfaff, or of the great philologist, Prof.
Kopp, both being carried off by premature death. The
labour was subsequently much aided by the head librarians of
Stutgardt and Tubingen, who defrayed the preparatory ex
penses of the undertaking.      Of especial use also was the    li
brary of Reitlingen, which contains a very complete collec
tion of the mathematical works of the sixteenth century. All
this must of necessity have led to the inquiry after the original
MSS. of Kepler, a notice of which is to be found in Murr's
Journal für Kunstgeschichte und allgemeine Literatur, vols. iii.
and xvii. It is to the following effect: –Kepler's son Ludwig,
who died in 1663, had preserved the MSS. of his father with
the intention of publishing a selection from them. In fact, there
appeared in 1634, through his endeavours, a work which, how
ever, the father had prepared for the press, viz. Somnium sive
de Astronomiá lunari. All the rest remained unused, most pro
bably because Ludwig, who was a physician, could not under
stand the problem of his great progenitor. From him the
 MSS. went to the celebrated Selenographer Hevel, and thence
to his son-in-law, the common-councilman Lange at Dantzig.
Of Lange they were bought in 1707 by the Leipzig mathe
matician, Hansch, for 100 florins. They consisted of twenty
two folio volumes, which, besides the drafts of several works
already printed (for instance, the Harmonie, the Rudolphine
Tables, &c.), contained the correspondence of Kepler with
many distinguished personages, several astronomical works
merely begun, and a host of miscellaneous notices.        Hansch
intended to publish these MSS. in a splendid form, but was
only able to begin this undertaking (too costly in the form he
had projected it), and the Epistolae ad Keplerum scripta,      in
sertis ad casdem responsionibus Keplerianis, which was patron
ized by the emperor Charles     VI,   was the only result he ever
achieved.    The MSS. thus     published,  are to be found in the
Imperial Library of Vienna. As Hansch fell into poverty,
he was obliged to pledge the MSS.; and as he could not
redeem them, one Etringer, of Frankfort on the Maine, re
deemed them for 128 florins.      Thence they came (probably
by inheritance) to a Mrs. Trümmer at Frankfort, where they
remained unknown until 1770, when Christopher de Murr, a
man deserving well of literature, called attention to them.
 For the purpose of recovering them from oblivion, he ad
dressed himself to several astronomers, as Mayer, Bernouilli,

890                            Dr. Lhotsky               on the Complete
Kästner, &c.; but besides laudatory commendations on his
undertaking, they could not afford any substantial aid. Con
sequently Murr sent the catalogue of the MSS. to St. Peters
burg, and solicited Euler for his intercession.            On the re
commendation of the latter and other savants, they were pur
chased in 1774 for the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy.
The academicians Euler, Krafft, and Lexell received orders
to peruse the MSS. and to select those worthy of publication.
Lexell began the revision of a nearly completed work of Kep
ler's, on the motion of the moon, entitled Hipparchus; but
there it ended, and neither the work nor the promised com
pletion ever saw the light. These MSS. have ever since re
posed, as Prof. Krafft writes, “an ornament of the Peters
burg Library,”—useless, unknown.             Prof. Frisch took great
pains to obtain these MSS. Introduced by Baron de Regen
dorff, Russian Minister at Stutgardt, and Prof. Schelling, he
addressed himself to the imperial government, and received
the assurance that the use of them would be granted to him;
and from the known scientific munificence of the Petersburg
cabinet, it is to be hoped that his further request for the loan
of the MSS. will be shortly granted.
   As to the plan on which the works are to be edited, Prof.
Frisch makes the following statement:—The original text
will remain unchanged, except where palpable error has
crept  in,    as    intended that Kepler shall appear throughout
                     it   is
in  his truest form. The notes will be as few and concise as
possible,     in
              order not        increase the bulk
                                          to           the work; they          of
will treat either              on
                        historical points,       explain difficult pas
                                                                     or
sages.     As most               of
                          the works        Kepler are       Latin, the

adoption      of
               that  language    for the notes has been deemed ex
pedient. The introduction which will precede the whole                                              is
                                                                                                    to

at  St. Petersburg may contain materials for the elucidation                                         of

in which Kepler  composed  and  published  them. But those

phine Tables, and the work         Logarithms, will form the last
part  of  the collection. Prof. Frisch concludes his programme
 by calling upon       friends all

communication made to him will be received with thanks,
The owners of MSS. of Kepler especially might greatly assist
the undertaking by the loan of them, or the transmission of
accurate copies. Even of the printed works of Kepler, Prof.
Frisch has not been able to see the following:—
   1. Almanack of the Year 1594 *.
   2. De Fundamentis Astrologiae, Prague 1602.
   3. Epistola ad rerum caelestium amatores de Salis deliquio,

are at hand.]
     5. Responsio ad Epistolam Bontschii, Sagan 1609.
  In conclusion, Prof. Frisch requests the loan, or offers the
purchase of any of these works of Kepler.

 ever  be  considered the most complete.              The extract from

see whether some                    of the works of Kepler, which Prof. Frisch
 could not discover in Germany, might not be found in our
 libraries, which certainly are surpassed by the richness of
especial departments of those of the respective countries; and
none would expect, for instance, to find more Austrian Incu
 nabula in English libraries than there are in Vienna, &c. But
taking the biographical opulence at a fair average, the balance
will not be unfavourable for this small and insulated empire.

the matter had acquired over light. The phaenomena now to

senting on a sudden this remarkable property, and it is strange
to find a piece of wood, or beef, or apple, obedient to or re
pelled by a magnet.        If
                            a man could be suspended, with suf
ficient delicacy, after the manner of Dufay, and placed in the
magnetic field, he would point, equatorially; for          all

difficult to perceive that comparatively large masses would
       as readily as small ones, because in larger masses more
  ines of magnetic force would bear in their action on the body,
and this was proved to be the case.             Neither was it long be
fore it evidently    appeared    that the form of a plate or a ring
was   quite  as  good   as that of a cylinder or a prism; and in
practice it was found that plates and flat rings of wood, sper
maceti, sulphur, &c., if suspended in the right direction, took
up the equatorial position very well.                              If
                                                       a plate or ring of
heavy glass could be floated in water, so as to be free to move
in every direction, and were in that condition subject to mag
netic forces diminishing in intensity, it would immediately set
itself equatorially, and if                  its
                                    centre coincided with the axis                                      of

because, as will be seen hereafter, iron is always and in almost
all states magnetic. But in respect to this point it may be
observed, that the ordinary magnetic property of matter and
this new property are in their effects opposed to each other;
and that when this property is strong it may overcome a very
slight degree of ordinary magnetic force, just as also a certain
amount of the magnetic property may oppose and effectually
hide the presence of this force (2422.). It is this circumstance
which makes it so necessary to be careful in examining the
magnetic condition of the bodies in the first instance (2250.).
The following list of a few substances, which were found
slightly magnetic, will illustrate this point:—Paper, sealing
wax, china ink, Berlin porcelain, silkworm-gut, asbestos, fluor
spar, red lead, vermilion, peroxide of lead, sulphate of zinc,
 tourmaline, plumbago, shell-lac, charcoal.              In some of these
cases the magnetism was generally diffused through the body,
in other cases it was limited to a particular part.
    2286. Having arrived at this point,                          I
                                                    may observe, that we
can now have no        difficulty   in  admitting    that the phaenomena
abundantly establish the existence of a magnetic property in
matter new to our knowledge.                Not the least interesting of
                                                       it,
the   consequences     that flow from             the manner
                                                      is          which              in        it
disposes     ofthe assertion which has sometimes been made, that
all  bodies are magnetic. Those who hold this view, mean
that   all bodies are magnetic          iron   as          is,
                                                  and say that they point
between the      poles.    The new facts       give  not    mere negative   a
to  this  statement,   but   something      beyond,   namely,     affirma            an
tive  as   tothe existence         of
                                 forces          ordinary bodies, directly

the opposite        those existing
                    of                     magnetic bodies, for whereas
                                                in
those   practically   produce     attraction,   these produce repulsion;
those set    a body        in
                         the axial    direction,   but these make     take                it

THEThe noble        President stated that the two Royal Medals had
been adjudged by the Council to the Astronomer Royal, for his                                     In

Investigation of the Nerves of the Uterus *; and the Copley Medal
to Prof. Schwann, for his valuable work On the Analogies of Vege
tables and Animals.
   After presenting the Medals, the President proceeded to the bio
graphical notices of some of the deceased members, from which we
select the following —
   DR. WILLIAM HEBERDEN, the son of the eminent and accom
plished author of the ‘Commentaries on the History and Cure of
Diseases,’ was born in London in the year 1767. At the early age
of seven, he was sent to school at the Charter House, and appears to
   * The report of the Committee of Physiology on the claims of Mr. Beck's
paper to the award of the Medal, is as follows:–
   “The paper of Mr. Beck contains the result of an elaborate anatomical
investigation of the Nerves of the Uterus, together with observations on
the structure and connexions of the sympathetic nerve.
   “By his researches the author has cleared up various points concerning
the nerves of the uterus which have hitherto been doubtful or misunder
stood.     He has determined more precisely than heretofore the source and
mode of distribution of these nerves, and the real extent to which the organ
is supplied with them. The true nature of the nervous ganglia at the neck
of the uterus, and of the plexuses formed by the sympathetic and sacral
nerves in the same situation, is also satisfactorily made out, as well as the
fact that the branches derived from the sacral nerves are not destined for
the uterus, but are distributed to adjacent organs.
   “With regard to the sympathetic nerve, it is shown that there are both
grey and white separate branches of communication between that nerve and
the spinal nerves. This important fact has, it is true, been already pointed
out in the recently published work of Todd and Bowman, but the author
of the paper has nevertheless the merit of arriving at it independently, by
his own observations.        He has further shown that the white and grey con
stituents of the nerve keep distinct from each other, not only in the so
called trunk of the sympathetic, but also in               its
                                                     primary branches,     far       as           as
the visceral ganglia, beyond which the white and grey parts become inter
mixed  in   the nerves distributed       the viscera. The precise mode
                                           to                               con       of
nexion   of  the white and grey communicating branches with the spinal
nerves  is  also carefully investigated.    These observations appear important
as  tending      throw light     on                   the sympathetic nerve and

this Society. On the 13th of March 1845, after delivering his usual
lecture at King's College, apparently in perfect health, he attended
the Council Meeting of this Society, and shortly after making some
observation upon the business of the meeting, was seized with sym
ptoms indicating an attack of apoplexy.      Several medical men who
were present hastened to his relief, and he was immediately bled;
not the slightest benefit, however, attended this measure, and in five
minutes he was a corpse. The shock occasioned by this melancholy
event, may be easier imagined than described, and cast a wide
spread gloom over the extensive circle of his friends and acquaint
ance. As a mark of respect to his memory, the Noble President
postponed the ordinary meeting of the Society, which was to have
 been held that evening.      His remains were interred at Norwood,
 Surrey, where during the last ten years of his life he had resided.
     Mr. Daniell survived his wife eleven years, and left a family of
two sons and five daughters to deplore his loss.       High as were his
scientific  attainments, he possessed others of a still loftier and more
enduring character; to the sterling qualities of a vigorous under
standing, and a kind and benevolent heart, he united the humble
and unobtrusive piety of a sincere christian.
    Mr. GeoRGE BAssevi, an architect of distinguished reputation.
    JAQUEs Dominique CAssiN1, Compte du Thury, was elected a
 Foreign Member of this Society in 1789, and at the time of his
 death had attained the extraordinary age of 97 years: he was the
 fourth in direct descent of a family which, during a period of nearly
two centuries, has been singularly illustrious in the history of the
 sciences, and more particularly of astronomy.        His great grand
 father, Jaques Dominique Cassini, one of the greatest astronomers
 of his age, was born in 1625, and was invited by Louis XIV.
 from Italy to France, to preside over the magnificent Observatory
 of Paris, which was built under his directions: his first successor in
 the direction of this establishment was his son Jean Jaques, an
 astronomer not less eminent than himself; the second his grandson,
 more commonly designated as Cassini de Thury, so well known by
  his great Geodetical Survey and Map of France; and the third his
 great grandson, the subject of the present notice, who was displaced
 from it by the troubles of the Revolution, which involved him, at
 least for a time, in the common proscription of the aristocracy of
 France.     The shock of these sad events seems to have diverted his
 mind from scientific pursuits, for we find his name connected with
 no research in astronomy or geodesy during the last half-century.
     The Comte de Cassini completed the celebrated map of France
 which had been begun by his father.      He published an account of
 voyages which he made in 1768 and 1769, for the trial of the
 marine chronometers of Le Roy, and a memoir “Sur l'influence de
 l'équinoxe du printemps et du solstice d’été sur les déclinaisons et
 les variations de l'aiguille aimantée :” he superintended and pub
 lished an account of the observations which were made in 1789, by
 a commission appointed for that purpose, for the junction of the
  Observatories of Paris and Greenwich, with a special reference to

                              Royal Society.                            413
the connection of the Geodetical Survey of France which had been
made by his father, with the corresponding Survey of England which
was at that time in progress under General Roy: he was the author
likewise of “Mémoires pour servir à l’Histoire des Sciences et à
celle de l'Observatoire Royal de Paris, suivis de la Vie de Jaques
Dominique Cassini, premier du nom."
   With him have terminated the honours of the house of Cassini,
though he was not the last of his race who distinguished himself in
the career of the sciences; his son, Henri Cassini, an upright and
enlightened judge in the Cour Royale and the Cour de Cassation,
and one of the most learned botanists of his age, fell a victim to the
cholera in 1833, and with him died the last stay of the old age of
his father: he was the fifth of his family who had been elected a
member of the Académie des Sciences. He was a boy at the break
ing out of the Revolution, and was compelled, from a regard to his
personal safety, to live in the strictest retirement at his father's domain
of Thury; a circumstance which turned his attention to the cultiva
tion of Natural History and Botany, and diverted him, as he was
accustomed to lament, from those studies and pursuits which formed,
as it were, the proper and hereditary honours of his family.
    Théodore DE SAUssure was born in Geneva the 14th of Octo
ber, 1767. His father, known throughout the civilized world as the
geological explorer of the Alps, who first reared observatories on
heights almost inaccessible, and who inscribed his name on the
eternal snows of the loftiest mountain in Europe, was by profession
a physician.    Being animated with an ardent love for science, which
he cultivated most assiduously, it is not a matter of surprise that after
entrusting his son for a short time to a private tutor, he should have
undertaken personally his education, so far as to enable him to enter
the Academy of Geneva, where young De Saussure soon distin
guished himself.      Previously to this period, his father had caused
him to study medicine, mineralogy, and natural history; and had
also inspired him with a taste for experimental chemistry, which he
constantly required for the analyses of minerals.           By degrees the
son became associated with the scientific labours of his father, who
records that when he resolved upon attempting the ascent of Mont
Blanc, in August 1787, his son, then nineteen years of age, expressed
the strongest desire to accompany him; but being apprehensive
that he was not sufficiently strong, he was unwillingly obliged to
leave him at the Priory at Chamouni, where he made with great
care meteorological observations, simultaneously with those carried
on at the summit of Mont Blanc.            In the month of June of the
following year, Théodore de Saussure accompanied his father in
the laborious and hazardous expedition to the Col du Géant, where
they remained for seventeen days, during which time young De Saus
sure rose every morning at four o'clock, to commence the meteorolo
gical observations, which he continued with unremitting diligence
until ten o'clock each night; and so thoroughly did he enter into the
scientific pursuits of his parent, that he almost importuned the latter
to extend the period of his sojourn amidst those splendid scenes;

 414                          Royal Society.
 which was however effectually prevented by the guides, who, alarmed
 at the idea of a longer stay amidst those icy heights, destroyed all
 the remaining provisions, necessarily compelling the De Saussures
 to descend to Cormayeur.
     From this period we find Théodore De Saussure always accom
  panying his father, who was not slow in availing himself of the great
  advantages derivable from his son's labours.        In 1789, they made
 the very difficult tour of Monte Rosa, it being the first time that
  the gold mines of Macugnaga were visited by men of science. It
  was during this excursion that young De Saussure restored by experi
  ments that confidence in the accuracy of the barometer for measu
  ring heights, which the assertion of Bouguer had tended to weaken.
  He made seventy experiments at different heights, and in calculating
  the results, was always careful to make the necessary corrections
  for temperature and humidity, which Bouguer appears to have neg
  lected. The enthusiasm and physical energy of young De Saussure
  were almost too great for his father, who was now aged, and weak
 ened by various illnesses, and consequently we often find the latter
 compelled to resist his son's desire to prolong their arduous excur
 SIOnS.
     The storms of the Revolution, more powerful than those of the
  Alps, at length put an effectual stop to these useful scientific excur
  sions, which had been continued for so many years. Théodore de
  Saussure, in common with many men of his age, was compelled to
 leave his country.     He visited this country with Alexander Marcet,
 who many years afterwards became his colleague in the Academy at
  Geneva.     After travelling over England and Scotland, he returned
 to Geneva, and resolved henceforth to devote his life to scientific
 pursuits.    The taste which he had acquired for chemistry under his
 father's tuition, had been strengthened in England and in France,
 where that science was eagerly cultivated; and on his return to
 Geneva, he determined to select the vegetable kingdom for the field
 of his researches, and zealously applied himself to discover by ex
 periments the influence of the atmosphere and of soils upon plants,
 and the various chemical changes which they undergo.           With the
 exception of some few accessory labours, M. de Saussure spent a
 long life upon this branch of science; and it may be truly said that
he has done more to advance the knowledge of vegetable physio
logy than any other person. It is worthy of remark that he laboured
 seven years silently, before publishing the results of his investiga
tions. These were comprised in his work entitled “Recherches
 Chimiques sur la Végétation,” which appeared in 1804. He sub
sequently published in the Annales de Physique et de Chimie, the
results of his investigations into the action of the petals of flowers
upon the atmosphere. The great importance which he attached
to the nutritive power of carbonic acid upon plants, directed his
attention to the proportion of this gas in the atmosphere.       In 1816,
he   published,  in the first volume of the   Bibliothèque    Universelle,
some researches      on this subject, which being greatly extended,
formed afterwards a paper which was published in 1830 in the

                                             Royal Society.                                              415
  Mémoires de la Société de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle de Ge
 nève, under the title of “De l'action des huiles sur le gaz oxygène
 à la température atmosphérique.”            After examining the action of
 the  green  portions   of plants,  roots and flowers upon the atmosphere,
 M. de Saussure carried his       investigation   to the same parts of fruits.
 The result was a     long   paper   published   in 1821, in the Memoirs of
 the same   Society,   entitled “Influence des fruits verts sur l'air, avant
leur maturité.”      He shows in this paper, that unripe fruit exercises
 the same influence as leaves upon the air.
    Independently      of his vegeto-physiological researches, M. de
 Saussure   published    some papers descriptive of minerals in the Jour
 nal de   Physique.       These are entitled, “Analyse du Sappare,"
“Sur une     hydrophane      imbibée de cire,” “Analyse de la Dolomie,”
 and “Sur le    Sappare    dur.”
    M. de Saussure was of a most reserved habit, the result probably
of his solitary education : it is recorded of him that he seldom de
sired to converse with his friends on the scientific subjects occupy
ing his attention; and so far did he carry this reserve, that even his
most intimate acquaintances were generally ignorant of the nature
of the papers which he proposed reading before the Society of
 Natural History. The same disposition prevented him from acting
 as Professor in the Academy of Geneva, though appointed to the
 Chair of Mineralogy and Geology in the year 1802. It was found
impossible to overcome his repugnance to give the usual courses of
lectures, though at the same time he gave evidence of his warm
interest in the Academy by constantly attending                meetings.        its                      In
1814,        he
           was elected        member

  NOTE BY MIR. T. HOPKINS ON HIS PAPER ON THE SEMI-DIUR
               NAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE BAROMETER.
                          To Richard Taylor, Esq.,
       SIR,
    N looking    over my paper, inserted in the Philosophical Magazine
      for March, “On the Causes of the Semi-diurnal Fluctuations
 of the Barometer,” I discovered that a mistake had been made in put
 ting down the figures in the Plymouth table, which express the tem
perature at 1 P.M. The mistake arose in this way.          In the tables,
 as inserted in the Report of the British Association for 1839, the
 temperature for 1 P.M. is entered 45'83.      This appeared a typogra
 phical error, and in order to correct it a 5 was substituted for the 4,
 leaving the numbers 55-83. This temperature of the dry thermo
 meter was then compared with that of the wet-bulb thermometer,
 and the influences of temperature and evaporation as thus exhibited
 were inferred and remarks were made upon them in the paper. But
 an examination of other parts of the Plymouth report now shows
 that the figures 45 in the thermometric column should have been
 transposed, when the temperature at 1 P.M. would have been found
 only 54.83 instead of 55-83, making the rise of temperature from
 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. only 1-99, whilst the force of evaporation is only
 0.89. The tabular statement of the rise of temperature and the force
 of evaporation at the two periods would then be from                  -
                     5'86 of temperature and
         5 to 10                                caused a rise,
                   { 2:18 of evaporation

                           of evaporation   “)  caused a fall.
    Wishing to be correct in my statements, I have to request that
you will insert this letter in the next Number of your valuable pub
lication.

      ON SOME NEW COMPOUNDS OF PERCHLORIDE OF                  TIN.
                                 BY M. LEWY.
    The author remarks, that although the perchloride of tin has been
the object of numerous researches, the compounds which           it forms

with basic chlorides and organic matters                       have not hitherto attracted
much attention.
   Compounds with Water.—It is well known that when a small quan
tity of water is added to perchloride of tin, the whole becomes a
crystalline mass; on adding more water, the hydrate thus formed
dissolves, and yields fresh crystals by slow evaporation; the form of
these could not be ascertained on account of their extreme deliques
cence. Their formula appeared to be SnCl2 +5HO, or to consist of .

  When these crystals are exposed in vacuo over sulphuric acid,
they lose a certain quantity of water of crystallization, and eventually
a hydrate remains containing only two equivalents of water.
   Compounds with the Chlorides.—It is well known that perchloride
of tin possesses properties analogous to those of acids; it combines
with basic chlorides to form double chlorides, the greater part of
which crystallize very readily; they                    all
                                           contain equal equivalents                      of
perchloride    of
                tin and basic chlorides.

   It appears to crystallize in rhombohedrons of about 125°. This
measure is however only an approximation to within one or two de
grees; it was impossible to obtain a more accurate one, on account
of the extreme deliquescence of the salt.

   This salt is still more deliquescent than the preceding;                  the form
of the crystal appears at first to                be a cube, but on measuring the  an
gles by the goniometer, one was found of 84° to 86°, and the other
of 94° to 96°. It is therefore probable it also crystallizes in rhom
bohedrons.

compounds of bichloride of tin with sulphuric aether, alcohol, hydro
chloric aether, and pyroxylic spirit; and M. Lewy combined it also
with oxalic aether, benzoic aether, benzoate of methylene, acetic aether,
acetic acid, benzoic acid, oil of bitter almonds, urea, camphor, ethal,
&c. The greater part of these compounds formed very fine crystals,
but their ready alteration in the air, and even in vacuo, as well as
the difficulty of purifying them, have hitherto prevented an exact
analysis of them; M. Lewy therefore endeavoured to verify the opi
nion of M. Kuhlman as to the composition of the compounds which
he had formed.
   Compound of Perchloride of Tin and Sulphuric AEther.—This forms
crystals of very great beauty; it is obtained, as shown by M. Kuhl
man, by mixing the two bodies either in the state of liquids or va
pours. The crystals have the form of rhomboidal tables of a bril
liant aspect and perfect formation.       They are volatile without de
 composition, dissolve readily in excess of aether, and decompose in
 contact with the air. This compound appeared to be formed of—

     The  ashes were similar           in composition to those of the Commelina
 Skinneri.      They   contained no alumina, and had a perceptible quan
 tity of phosphoric acid. It is probable therefore that the alumina in
 the first analysis is accidental.

             ANALYSIS OF CERADIA FURCATA RESIN.
                 By Robert D. THOMson, M.D.
   The plant from which this resin exudes, presents the appearance
of coral, and is a native of the coast of Africa, opposite the island of
Ichaboe.
   The resin possesses an amber colour, and an odour similar to that
of olibanum.    It partially dissolves in alcohol, and is precipitated
by water.   Caustic ammonia produces no precipitate in the alcoholie
solution.  The alcoholic solution possesses a slightly acid reaction,
and is not precipitated by nitrate of silver.  Specific gravity 1 197,
determined by my pupil, Mr. Hugh B. Tennent.
   Analysis gave the following results:—
   19-9 grains lost by exposure to the temperature of 212° for some
days 2: 11 grains. During the whole of the period       peculiar odour       its

LXX.         Researches on the Functions of Plants, with a view of
     showing that they obey the Physical Laws of Diffusion in the
     Absorption and Evolution of Gases by their Leaves and
     Iloots.    By D. P. GARDNER, M.D., Member of the Lyceum
     of Natural History, &c.*
1.
      I   CONCEIVE    a plant to be a porous system, contain
       ing an internal mixture of gases, or plant atmosphere,
and lying in contact with common air on the one side, and
with the gases dissolved in the fluid of the soil on the other.
My object in the following remarks is to show that the plant
atmosphere is of a fluctuating nature, and depends on the
chemical action taking place; and that whatever gases are
absorbed or evolved by leaves or roots, depend upon the nature
of the internal atmosphere at the time. To place the evidence
of these conclusions before the reader, I propose to examine
the subject under five heads:—
   1st. The epidermis or bounding membrane of plants is po
TOuS.
        The constitution of the internal gas of plants.
     2nd.
  3rd. The action of roots on the gases of the soil-fluid.
  4th. The absorption of gases by plants is a consequence of
their porosity.
  5th. The action of plants on artificial atmospheres.
I.   The Epidermis or Bounding Membrane of Plants is Porous.
      The object in this place is to show, that the epidermis is
     2.
not  merely capable of transmitting particular gases, but that
it obeys     all
             the laws           of
                           porous system.
                                  a           this         If
                                                      found true   be
for the bounding membrane,       will necessarily
                                         it          true for the  be
internal cellular structure.

    3. Experiments were planned for the purpose of determi
ning whether carbonic acid would penetrate into a vessel con
taining common air through a barrier of vegetable epidermis,
and secondly, whether an inclosed mixture of gases of a theo
retical composition would solicit the passage of both carbonic
acid and oxygen, and at the same time evolve nitrogen.
    4. A tube, five inches long and a third of an inch in bore,
with a flattened and ground end, was closed by a piece of
epidermis obtained from the leaf of the Madeira vine (Basella
lucida). The tube was then immersed in a mercurial trough
and filled to within an inch of the membrane; on suspending
it by a wire it did not leak, though there was a pressure of
three inches of mercury.      Clear lime-water was admitted to
displace the mercury, and the arrangement covered by a small
bell-jar containing atmospheric air with 10 per cent. carbonic
acid.    In five hours the lime-water exhibited a distinct pel
licle of carbonate of lime. The same result was obtained in
more or less time with the epidermis of the cabbage, Alanthus
alata, Chenopodium album, and several species of Sedum. Some
specimens, as that from the balsam, leaked so fast as not to
sustain any mercurial column, whilst others maintained four
inches for thirty hours and more.
    5. A similar tube was closed with epidermis, and contained
an atmosphere of nitrogen 87, oxygen 13 per cent. over mer
cury, and was covered with a bell-jar as above. The included
volume increased during nine hours from 400 to 433 mea
 sures, and on analysis consisted of N 76, O 17, CO., 7 per cent.
 Hence the membrane comported itself as a simple porous
tissue, allowing nitrogen to pass out and admitting oxygen
and carbonic acid. This experiment was also repeated with
 the foregoing specimens of epidermis, and no absolute varia
 tion perceived.
       II. The Constitution of the Internal Gas of Plants.
    6. The observations hitherto made on the included gases
of plants by Davy, Payen, Calvert and Ferrand, and others,
cannot be quoted here, because the disturbing effects of light
 and other causes have not been sufficiently considered.         It is
not   merely  the gas of a cavity which is  required,  but the com
position of that which permeates the interior during the vigo
 rous state of the vegetable in sun-light.
    7. For the purpose of obtaining this, I transplanted in the
May of 1845 a number of plants of Datura stramonium and of
blue grass (Poa pratensis) into tumblers, and allowed them to
grow for several weeks before use.         Having completed my
arrangements for analysing minute quantities of gas by a sliding

              Dr. Gardner's                 Researches on the Functions                        of Plants. 427
    rod eudiometer, I proceeded as follows:—The                   plants when
    wanted were obtained in a            perfect   state  by  immersing      the
    tumbler in a tub of water, and removing the garden-mould by
    agitating the fluid; they were thus procured without the
    slightest mutilation.        The plant was then transferred to a
    convenient      pneumatic     trough, closed from adherent air and
    broken under a small receiver.            This was done uniformly at
    11 o'clock A.M. and as quickly as possible; the gas was im
    mediately analysed,
       8. Binoxide of nitrogen was the only substance which could
    be used to estimate the oxygen, and if properly prepared,                                                          is,
        my experience, equal         the most intricate apparatus. Thus,
    in in

servation, that plants grown in darkness do not become green
in light unless oxygen be present, is accounted for by the
fact that chlorophylle is an oxidized product.
    19. The movements occurring during light owe their con
tinuance to             its
                   action. The gases absorbed are destined                                              to
equilibrate the internal atmosphere, but cannot effect this ob

                            Ozone to        Hyponitric Acid.                          433
appears to me probable that besides hydrate of nitric acid a
peroxide of nitrogen and hydrogen is formed when water acts
upon hyponitric acid. Agreeably to my view, the presence
of NO3 + HO, in the acid mixture, is the cause why the
latter decomposes iodide of potassium, &c.
    I  think it cannot be denied that aqueous vapour will act
upon vaporous hyponitric acid as liquid water does upon the
liquid acid.     Such being the case, and supposing that in the
latter case two compounds of the formulas NO, + HO, and
NO2+HO, are produced, it must then be admitted also that
the same compounds are formed when the vapours of hypo
nitric acid are mixed with moist atmospheric air. Now if the
peroxide of nitrogen and hydrogen (the first of these compounds)
 should happen to be a volatile substance, it follows further
that in a bottle containing moist air, to which vapour of hypo
nitric acid had been added, an atmosphere must be produced
containing some NO, + HO, and possessing the property of
causing the reactions above mentioned.         The peroxide of
hydrogen contained in NO. 4 HO, would be the oxidizing
 agent, decomposing e. g. iodide of potassium, &c.
    For various reasons I am inclined to consider ozone as
 HO, i.e. a compound isomeric with Thenard's peroxide of
 hydrogen. Now if this conjecture should be true, and if there
 should exist a compound of NO, + HO2, moist atmospheric
 air being charged with vapour of hyponitric acid would owe
 its reactions     the presence
                      to                         of
                                   ozone. How far such      con                  a

 434              Dr. Schoenbein on the relation   of
 The bottom of a spacious bottle was covered with this mix
 ture, and then a large piece of carbonate of ammonia suspended
 within the vessel.    After the atmosphere, standing over the
 acid liquid, had assumed the power of colouring rapidly blue
 a strip of reddened litmus paper, it continued to possess the
 following properties:—
     1. Strips of paper charged with paste    of starch containing
 some iodide of potassium were coloured      blue.
    2. Strips of paper drenched with an      alcoholic  solution of
guaiacum assumed a blue colour.
    3. Strips of paper coloured blue by      a solution  of indigo
 turned white.
    4. Strips of paper to which sulphuret of lead had been at
 tached, by means of nitrate of lead and sulphuretted hydrogen,
gradually turned white.
    5. Strips of paper charged with a solution of the common
prussiate of potash became deeply yellow.
    6. Crystals of the yellow prussiate, after having been sus
pended for twenty-four hours within this atmosphere, were
covered with a crust of the red sesqui-ferrocyanuret of potas
Sluin,
    From the facts just stated, it appears that the atmosphere
in question acts exactly in the same way as ozonized air does,
and from the circumstances under which those reactions took
place, it follows that the latter could not proceed from free
hyponitric or nitrous acid, these acids not being able to co
exist in a state of isolation with the vapours of carbonate of
ammonia. We must therefore conclude from these facts, that
there was a principle present, in the atmosphere mentioned,
which acted after the manner of ozone, and conducted itself,
in spite of the presence of ammoniacal vapour, as a highly
oxidizing agent.
    But if neither free hyponitric nor nitrous acid were the
cause of the reactions mentioned, nor nitrite of ammonia, what
then is the substance to which the oxidizing powers are to be
ascribed 2 I can answer that question only by supposing that
the peroxide of nitrogen and hydrogen is that agent. Before
passing to another subject, I take the liberty to mention a
circumstance which seems to bear upon the matter in ques
tion, and merit some attention.      On breathing strongly ozo
nized air three or four     times, a disagreeable and strangling
sensation will be experienced near the throat and in the chest.
This sensation is very similar to that caused by inhaling air
which has stood for some time over a mixture of hyponitric
acid and water, and this is the case even if the air happens
to be charged with ammoniacal vapours.           We observe also
in such an atmosphere a peculiar and disagreeable odour,

                  Ozone to Hyponitric Acid.                   435
which is similar to that of common aquafortis, and slightly
analogous to the smell of chlorine. It is likely that the odour
mentioned belongs to the vapour of our supposed peroxide
of nitrogen and hydrogen, and that it is that compound which,
if inhaled, causes the sensation before mentioned. With re
gard to the subject under discussion, it seems to me that the
way in which the mixture, formed from hyponitric acid and
water, acts upon a solution of the yellow prussiate of potash,
offers peculiar interest.
   My experiments having demonstrated that the salt just
mentioned (be it solid or dissolved in water) is readily trans
formed into the red cyanuret by ozone, and considering the
acid mixture before alluded to as an aqueous solution of nitric
acid and peroxide of nitrogen and hydrogen, what must happen
if that mixture be put together with a solution of the yellow
prussiate of potash P Supposing 1 equiv. of the said peroxide
and 1 equiv. of nitric acid in the acid mixture to act upon 2
equiv. of the yellow cyanuret, we must obtain from such a re
action 1 equiv. of nitrate of potash, 1 equiv. of the red sesqui
ferrocyanuret of potassium, 1 equiv. of deutoxide of nitrogen,
and 2 equiv. of water, for
(NO,4-HO)+(No.4 HO)+2(2P Cy-Fe Cy)=PONO,
      +   (3P Cy-F Fe, Cyg) + NO, +2HO.
If a glass tube, open at one end, be half-filled with our acid
mixture and half with a dilute solution of the yellow prussiate,
on mixing the liquids together a lively disengagement of gas
takes place; and if the open end of the tube be put into a ves
sel holding water, a colourless gas will fill the upper part of
the tube. On adding oxygen or atmospheric air to the gas
disengaged under the circumstances mentioned, the latter will
turn brownish red and exhibit all the properties of deutoxide
of nitrogen. As soon as the acid mixture comes in contact
with the nearly colourless solution of the common prussiate of
potash, the latter turns deeply yellow, and it is very easy to
ascertain that the coloured fluid contains nitrate of potash,
sesqui-ferrocyanuret of potassium, and no trace of the yellow
prussiate, provided a sufficient quantity of the acid mixture
had been employed.      The reactions indicated are therefore
such as they ought to be,     if,
                              according   toour supposition, the
acid mixture contains nitric acid and peroxide      nitrogen and
                                                    of
hydrogen.    I need hardly say that the  disengagement   of deut
oxide  of nitrogen and the transformation      ofthe yellow cya
nuret into the red one, which take place under the circum
stances mentioned, cannot originate  in the nitric acid contained
in the acid mixture, for it   well known that dilute pure nitric
                              is

436 Dr. Schoenbein on the relation                   of Ozone to Hyponitric Acid.
 acid does not give rise to the reactions described. The cause
 of those effects must therefore be sought in another substance,
 and both hyponitric and nitrous acid not being able to co
exist with free water, we are not allowed to consider either
 the one or the other of those acids as that cause.      As I have
already remarked, the reactions in question can, according to
my opinion, only be accounted for in a satisfactory manner
by admitting the presence of NO, + HO, in the acid mixture
so often mentioned.        My experiments have further shown
that iodide of potassium, be it solid or dissolved in water, is
readily decomposed by ozone, iodine being eliminated.           In
putting our acid mixture to a solution of the salt mentioned,
deutoxide of nitrogen is abundantly disengaged, iodine preci
pitated, and nitrate of potash formed.        As pure nitric acid
containing as much water as the said acid mixture, does not
act upon the solution of iodide of potassium, it cannot be the
nitric acid of our mixture that causes those phaenomena, nor
can they, from reasons already stated, proceed from hypo
nitric or nitrous acids.                       -
     Ifwe admit that there         besides nitric acid, some NO,
                                          is,
 +HO, present          the acid mixture,
                          in                 think we may easily
                                                       I
account for those reactions.       HO2 oxidizes the potassium                        of
the  iodide,  nitric acid unites with the base thus formed, and
NO, set free.

LXXII.     On the Composition of the Fire-Damp of the New
  castle Coal Mines. By THoMAs GRAHAM, Esq., F.R.S.*
Sºº           years ago     I   examined the gas
    the same result as Dr. Henry, Davy and Dr. Turner had
                                                              of    these mines, with
previously obtained, namely, that it contains no other com
bustible ingredient than light carburetted hydrogen. But the
analysis of the gas of the coal mines in Germany, subsequently
published, showing the presence of other gases, particularly
of olefiant    gas, has rendered a new examination                          of the gas of
the English mines desirable. The gases were, 1, from a seam
named the Five-Quarter seam, in the Gateshead colliery,
where the gas is collected as it issues, and used for lighting
the mine; 2, the gas of Hebburn colliery, which issues from
a bore let down into the Bensham seam—a seam of coal which
is highly charged with gas, and has been the cause of many
accidents; and 3, gas from Killingworth colliery, in the neigh
bourhood of Jarrow, where the last great explosion occurred.
This last gas issues from a fissure in a stratum of sandstone,
and has been kept uninterruptedly burning, as the means of
lighting the horse-road in the mine, for upwards of ten years,
without any sensible diminution in        quantity.     its

of manganese and sulphuric acid, oil of bitter almonds was
immediately evolved, and on boiling a second portion with
hypochlorite of lime, the very peculiar chlorinated oil de
scribed in a former paper was also abundantly produced, thus
clearly indicating the presence of cinnamic acid. A third
portion of the crystals was dissolved in alcohol and left to
spontaneous evaporation; it yielded after some time the fine
rhombic prisms so characteristic of cinnamic acid when it is
crystallized out of alcohol, mixed however with some lon
acicular crystals, having    the appearance all  benzoic                        of               .#

  . The quantity of carbazotic acid which Botany Bay resin
yields when treated with nitric acid is so great, and it is so
easily purified, that this resin seems likely to prove the best
source of that substance.       When the resin is subjected to
destructive distillation in an iron or copper retort, it yields a
                                                                         is oil

giving unsatisfactory results when submitted                  mathematical

                                                                  a
what analogous           Mr. Laming's, though essentially different
                        to
in   respect       the assumption
                   to                     solid atoms. As we know
                                               of
 matter   only   by     its
                        properties,     certainly
                                              it     seems more rational
to  call those properties themselves matter, than                 invent               to                      an
 imaginary substance with inseparably attached attributes.
     In  Mr. Laming's theory           can seeI        vindicationno       the                           of
 theory    ofsolid atoms, because            not necessary for them
                                               it    is                                                        to
 be   admitted.      He might consider the term “atom”                signify                   to
 nothing more than “centre                    of
                                       attraction.”       With this quali
 fication  I agree    with him,   that different atoms are naturally
 associated with different quantities                   of
                                               electricity; arising, how
 ever, from different degrees          power  of   the atoms,in       centres                  or
of   attraction. An      objection  apparently    arises,      limine,      hisin                         to

 evidenced.     Hence we have     just grounds   for the  assumption
 that the atoms       bodies are both attractive and repulsive
                        of                                                                                     of

explain the effects which appertain to the action of bodies in
general on each other, as well as those which are produced by
the agency of electricity.
   We assume, then, that the atoms of matter are mutually
repulsive of each other, but attractive of those of electricity;
and that the atoms of electricity are in like manner self-re
pulsive and attractive of those of matter. This hypothesis is
not new, it was invented long ago to satisfy the Franklinian
theory of electricity; but                    its
                                application has not,   my know
ledge, been successfully made. My object here           briefly                  is to             to
show        its
           consistency  when  rightly  applied.
   Suppose the centres                     of
                              matter far more powerful and less
numerous than those         electricity. ofEach atom     the com                  of
pound will thus consist                    of   an
                                 atom (in the sense before stated)
of  matter surrounded with          atmosphere (so  an  speak)                   to                of
electricity,           of
                 variable density,       somewhat similar manner

none can exist                   in
                         connexion with the atom.          Accordingly
every particle              of
                      matter will     appropriate      itself     definite to        a

and matter in the atoms. This has been merely hinted at, not
for explanation, but to show that the theory gives the property
referred to, to inherent powers in bodies themselves, and not
 to the space in which they are situated, and by which they are
 surrounded.    My reasons for considering the atoms of bodies
 as mere centres of force, have not been given, as they are con

gave an account of some experiments he had made with a view
to test    capabilities for exciting electrical currents.

   Two kinds          of
                    revolving armature occurred               worthy      to   us   as

  Having placed the two straight steel magnets (each of which
was 4 feet 4 inches long, 4 to 5 inches square, and had poles
of 7%   square inches surface) side by side, in a horizontal
position, and with two of their poles connected by a suitable
 armature, we placed the hollow electro-magnetic armature on
 the axis of a revolving apparatus, in such a position that the
 poles of the armature could revolve at the distance of about
 #th of an inch from the poles of the steel magnets. The coils
 were arranged for quantity, and connected by means of a
 proper “commutator” with platinum plates (each exposing
 an active surface of 5 or 6 square inches) immersed in a dilute
 solution of sulphuric acid.     The maximum amount of decom
 position was effected when the armature revolved 500 times
 per minute. At this velocity ºths of a cubic inch of the mixed
 gases were collected per minute.
    Having removed the hollow armature, we now fastened the
jlat semicircular armature upon the axis. When this arma
 ture, with     its
                four coils arranged for quantity, was rotated                                       at
 the rate  of 500 revolutions per minute, we collected          much                      as

                    rotation, two inches                 of                                    of

square feet, and the amalgamated zinc plate a surface of £rds
of a square foot. A pretty correct galvanometer, consisting
of a circle of thick copper wire and a magnetic needle 3 inches
long, was employed for measuring the currents of electricity
which were transmitted by the battery through the revolving
armatures.      The tangents of the deflections of the magnetic
needle, corrected by a small equation, indicated the absolute
quantities of transmitted electricity.           The quantity of zinc
consumed in the battery was deduced from the deflections of
the needle; the data of the calculation being derived from
previous experiments on the quantity of mixed gases evolved
from acidulated water by a current capable of producing a
given deflection of the needle.
   Our first experiments were made with the flat semicircular
revolving armature,              its
                              four coils being arranged for quantity.

start amounted           64°, which indicated

calling the current corresponding             45°, 1000. The engine,

 140 revolutions     per    minute.   The needle was then observed
to  stand steadily          43°, indicating
                            at                   current  a     920. The   of
consumption           of

    Taking the mean of the two experiments, we have for the
 theoretical duty 95.3, and for the actual performance 98-3.
 Here, therefore, in apparent contradiction to what we have
just said, the actual exceeds the theoretical duty. This cir
 cumstance is however partly explained by the fact that the
 solution of sulphuric acid employed in charging the battery
had been mixed immediately before the experiments were
made, and was in consequence considerably heated; for
Daniell has shown that the intensity of his battery increases
with    its
          temperature, and       evident that
                                          it   isincrease    the      of an        of

 be productive      of   an
                      increased oeconomical effect.
   The next two experiments were made with the hollow re
volving armature,             its
                        two coils being arranged for quantity.
In  these and the    subsequent  experiments, the battery was
charged with     cold solution.

the straight electro-magnets which were distant from the large
steel magnets.        The coils were arranged for quantity.

 be

    The mean of the six experiments gives a theoretical duty of
 785, and an actual duty of 65-6. But, making allowance for
 the hot solution employed in the first two experiments, we
 may state that the actual was in general about ºths of the theo
 retical duty.
     Upon the whole we feel ourselves justified in fixing the
 maximum available duty of an electro-magnetic engine worked
 by a Daniell's battery at 80 lbs. raised a foot high for each
 grain of zinc consumed*, or, in other words, at about half the
 theoretical maximum of duty.
     Before we leave this part of the subject, we may state that
 the above experiments fully bear out the idea expressed by
    * Dr. Botto states that 45 lbs. of zinc consumed in a Grove's battery are
 sufficient to work a one-horse power electro-magnetic engine for 24 hours.
 The intensity of Daniell's battery being ºths of that of Grove, it follows
  that 75 lbs. of zinc would have been consumed had Dr. Botto employed a
  Daniell's battery, a result not widely different from our own.

     454        Powers      of Electro-Magnetism,                              Steam, and Horses.
     Dr. Scoresby in his “Magnetical    Investigations,” that steel
     magnets on his construction may be employed in the stationary
     part of the electro-magnetic engine with much greater advan
     tage than electro-magnets.   We have already adverted to the
     imperfect construction of the magnetic apparatus employed
     in the above experiments; had we employed one of equal
     weight, but constructed of thin plates of hardened steel, and
     furnished  with armatures and batteries in proportion, we
     think it highly probable that a power equal to that of one
     horse might have been attained, the whole weight                                                         of the            ap
     paratus being considerably under half a ton.
*
       Having thus determined the capabilities of electro-magne
    tism as a first mover of machinery, it will be interesting and
    instructive to compare it with two other sources of power, viz.
    steam and horses.                                                                                    -

   Prof. Magnus of Berlin, has endeavoured to prove that the
oxygen which an animal inspires does not combine chemically
with the blood, but is merely absorbed by it”. The blood thus
charged with oxygen arrives in the capillary vessels, where
the oxygen effects a chemical combination with certain sub
stances, converting them into carbonic acid and water.         The
carbonic    acid,  instead of oxygen,   is then absorbed    by  the
blood, and thus reaches the lungs to be removed by contact
with the atmosphere. Adopting this view, it becomes exceed
ingly probable that the whole of the vis viva due to the oxida
tion or combustion of the “certain substances” mentioned by
Magnus is developed by the muscles. The muscles, by their
motion, can communicate vis viva to external objects; and,
by their friction within the body, can develope heat in various
quantities according to circumstances, so as to maintain the
animal at an uniform temperature.            these theoretic viewsIf
be correct,  they  would lead to the interesting conclusion (which
is the same as that announced by Matteucci from other con
siderations) that the animal frame, though destined to fulfill so
many other ends,                  is,        an
                                engine, more perfect

I think, for   the advantage of the inquiry, that       should con         I
sider them in a section apart by themselves.         Further,     any                    if
other metals appeared to be magnetic, as these are, it would
be right and expedient to include them in the same class.
   2289. My first point, therefore, was to examine the metals
for any indication of ordinary magnetism. Such an examina
tion cannot be carried on by magnets anything short in power
of those to be used in the further investigation; and in proof
of this point I found many specimens of the metals, which
appeared to be perfectly free from magnetism when in the
presence of a magnetic needle, or a strong horse-shoe magnet
(2157.), that yet gave abundant indications when suspended
near to one or both poles of the magnets described (2246.).
   2290 My test of magnetism was this.                 a bar of the   If
metal to be examined, about two inches long, was suspended
(2249.) in the magnetic field, and being at first oblique to the
axial line, was upon the supervention of the magnetic forces
drawn into the axial position instead of being driven into the
equatorial line, or remaining in some oblique direction, then
I  considered it magnetic.      Or, if being near one magnetic
pole, it was attracted by the pole, instead of being repelled,
then   I concluded it was magnetic.      It is evident that the test
is not strict, because, as before pointed out (2285.), a body
may have a slight degree of magnetic force, and yet the power
of the new property be so great as to neutralize or surpass                                   it.
In  the first case,   might seem neither      have the one property
                                                        to
nor the   other;      in it
                      the second   case,   might   appear free from
                                                   it
magnetism, and possessing the special property                 small            in   a
degree.
   2291.    I obtained the following metals,        that when exaso
            above,
           as       they did not appear           magnetic; and be                            in

certain and wavering.            If
                                 the angle with the radial line were
less than that above, the bar          would move into parallelism
 with the radius and      go  inwards: if the angle were greater, the
 bar would move until perpendicular to the radial line and go
 outwards.      If the centre of the bar were still further out than
in the last   case,  or down by the side of the core, the bar would
always place itself perpendicular to the radius and go outwards.
 All these complications of motion are easily resolved into their
 simple elementary origin, if reference be had to the character
of the circular angle bounding the end of the core; to the                     di
rection of the magnetic lines of force issuing from it and the
other parts of the pole; to the position of the different parts
of the bar in these lines; and the ruling principle that each
particle tends to go by the nearest course from strong to
weaker points of magnetic force.
   2301. The bismuth points well, and is well repelled (2296.)
when immersed in water, alcohol, aether, oil, mercury, &c.,
and also when inclosed within vessels of earth, glass, copper,
lead, &c. (2272.), or when screens of 0.75 or 1 inch in thick
ness of bismuth, copper or lead intervene.               Even when a
bismuth cube (2266.) was placed in an iron vessel 23 inches
in diameter and O. 17 of an inch in thickness, it was well and
freely repelled by the magnetic pole.
   2302. Whether the bismuth be in one piece or in very fine
powder, appears to make no difference in the character or in
the degree of    its  magnetic property (2283.).
   2303.  I   made many experiments with masses and bars                        of
bismuth    suspended,   or   otherwise circumstanced,                to

of                  repulsion, whilst jointly under the influence

    attraction  or
the   magnetic    forces,  but   Icould not find any indication
such mutual action:       they  appeared       to     be
                                                 perfectly indifferent
one  to   another, each tending only            to  go
                                                    from stronger               to
weaker    points of   magnetic   power.
   2304. Bismuth,      in   very fine powder, was sprinkled upon
paper, laid over the horizontal circular termination           the ver

tical pole (2246.).    If   the paper were tapped, the magnet not
being excited, nothing particular occurred; but              the magif
netic power were on, then the powder retreated                both  in         di
rections, inwards and outwards, from           circular line just over

no particular result; but when the magnetism was on, such an
operation cleared the powder from every point which came
over the cone, so that a mark was traced or written out in
clear lines running through the powder, and showing every
place where the pole had passed.
   2306. The bar of bismuth and a bar of antimony was found
to set equatorially between the poles of the ordinary horse
shoe magnet.
   2307. The following list may serve to give an idea of the
apparent order of some metals, as regards their power of pro
ducing these new effects, but I cannot be sure that they are
perfectly free from the magnetic metals. In addition to that,
there are certain other effects produced by the action of mag
netism on metals (2309.) which greatly interfere with the re
sults due to the present property.

muth by a magnet has been observed and published several
years ago.                       If
                 so, it will appear that what must then have
been considered as a peculiar and isolated effect, was the con
sequence of a general property, which is now shown to belong
to all matter *.
     2309.              I
            now turn to the consideration of some peculiar
phaenomena    which are presented by copper and several of the
metals when they are subjected to the action of magnetic
forces, and which so tend to mask effects of the kind already
described, that if not known to the inquirer they would lead to
much confusion and doubt.      These I will first describe as to
their appearances, and then proceed to consider their origin.

LXXVII.             On the Equations applying to Light under the
  action       of   Magnetism.  By G. B. AIRY, Esq., Astronomer
   Royal.
  To   theEditors of the Philosophical º Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
BY observe
    the indulgence of Dr. Faraday, I have been able
           in the most satisfactory way the phaenomena
                                                                                                   to
                                                                                                   of
the rotation of the plane of polarization of light passing
through boracic glass and other media under the action of
magnetic currents passing nearly in the direction of the light.
And in particular I have verified the very remarkable fact that,
upon passing the light successively in opposite directions
while the magnetic adjustments remain the same, the plane of
polarization undergoes the same change of position in regard
to space, or undergoes opposite changes of position in regard
to the expression of “rotation to the right,” or “rotation to
the left,” as referred to the eye of the observer.
    On reflecting upon the important fact that this change is
not produced except there be an intermediate diaphanous
body, it seems impossible not to conceive that the effect on
the light is produced mediately by the action of the magnetic
forces on the diaphanous body.             The object of this commu
nication is to point out what, as                       I
                                            conceive, must be the form
of the mathematical       equations    existing  among the movements
 of the  particles   of the   glass,  &c. or                     its
                                                   contained aether,                               in
order      explain the phaenomena

     In order     justify
                    to     my  intruding    upon  you with suggestion               a

470        The Astronomer Royal               on the Equations
by showing that mechanical laws may be able to explain effects
never before ascribed to mechanical laws. As regards the
progress of intellect, it has been very important to show that
variation of velocities, as depending on the period of the oscil
lations, is mechanically possible; it has been very important
to show that transversal vibrations are mechanically-possible;
it has been very important to show that crystalline separation
of differently polarized rays is mechanically possible. It is
not that I believe completely in any one of the mechanical
explanations which have been given, but that a priori difficul
ties have been removed, and that it may now be considered
that there is a fair chance of reducing the whole to mechani
cal explanation.           -
   In some cases the mechanical theory has stopped at the
first step, as for instance in the very remarkable equations in
dicated by Prof. MacCullagh as competent to represent some
of the characteristic phaenomena of quartz. It was here an
important matter to show that there was opened even a possi
bility of reducing these anomalous facts to mechanical laws.
   The suggestion, which it is the object of this paper to lay
before you, is of the same kind as that made by Professor
MacCullagh.
     Inorder to reduce the rotation of the plane of polarization
to laws, I shall follow the example of Fresnel in assuming
that plane-polarized light may be considered as compounded
of two beams of circularly-polarized light, one right-handed
and the other left-handed, and that the rotation of the plane
is produced by a difference of the velocities of the two circu
larly-polarized beams.     And this, I take this opportunity to
observe, is actually the simplest way of conceiving the change,
at least in instances like that of quartz, &c., and like that be
fore us, when the same change is produced whatever be the
position of the plane of polarization (a fact which, at my re
quest, Dr. Faraday has very carefully verified).       Although
the  conception  of a plane  vibration is easier where the plane
of vibration has immediate reference to the plane of reflexion,
&c., yet the conception of two circular vibrations is easier
where the plane of the compound vibration has no reference
to any plane in the apparatus, and is in fact perfectly arbi
trary.

LXXVIII.    Letter to Henry Lord Brougham, F.R.S., &c.,
  containing Remarks on certain Statements in his Lives of
  Black, Watt and Cavendish. By the Rev. WILLIAM VERNoN
  HARcount, F.R.S.                  &c.
                               [Continued from p. 131.]
THERE          are few things more remarkable in scientific                                        hi
   story      than the manner in which Newton may be ob
served to have dealt with the conjectural part of philosophy.
He never speaks of hypothetical speculation but in terms im
plying somewhat of disdain. And yet in all his works, from
the announcement to the Royal Society of his first discoveries
respecting light to the last revision of the Optics and Prin
cipia, an hypothesis of the highest generality holds a conspi
cuous place.
   This apparent inconsistence is however easily explained:
he doubtless was deeply impressed with the error into which
his predecessor Descartes had fallen, in building a system of
philosophy on superficial analogies and precarious conjec
tures, and looked with some dissatisfaction at the pretension
of his cotemporary Hook to set aside the inductive analysis
of light, on the faith of a conjectural standard of his own.
With Newton the imagining hypotheses was but as child's-
play compared with the labour and importance of those severe
and sure processes, inductive and deductive, to which he had
devoted    allthe efforts           of
                               his mind.    He held cheap the exer
cise  of that great   faculty            of
                                  imagination   from which the inex
haustible riches         of
                          his philosophical invention flowed with

482    Rev.   W.V. Harcourt             on       Lord Brougham's                   statements
 sumed greater repulsion of the larger particles of aether from
 their pores. In this letter he made a comprehensive conjectural
 effort to reduce the whole system of the laws of nature,
 whether bearing the aspect of impulse or attraction, under the
 dominion of two kinds of repulsive force, the one of mutual
 repulsion between the particles of aether, the other of repul
 sion between the particles of aether and those of ordinary
 matter.
    In the edition of his Optics which he printed nearly forty
years afterwards, in 1717, he deliberately delivered, when in
 full possession of the laws of gravity, another hypothesis on
this subject, taking for his fundamental assumption this fact
presumed from the phaenomena of light, that a subtle and
elastic fluid, within bodies and without them, follows some law
of density which increases from their centre indefinitely into
space, and merely representing the force by which they gra
vitate as repulsive. Further he has not explained himself; and
it may perhaps be inferred from his subsequently omitting in
an edition of the Principia the mention of gravity when he
enumerates, at the end of that work, the other phaenomena of
molecular attraction and cohesion, electricity, light, heat, mus
cular motion, and nervous sensation, which he attributes to
the force of “a very subtle spirit,” pervading and lurking in
dense bodies, but not yet sufficiently manifested by experi
ments, that he was dissatisfied with his own conceptions of
its gravific action, and had never reduced them into               mathe                    a
                                                                           of be

remark,       deserving perhaps the attention
             as                                           those who may
follow Vince and Playfair          discussing the possible sufficiency
                                       in
of  Newton's   hypothesis—that         the Optics
                                             in           alleges reasons  he
for  supposing   the elastic force               of
                                         aetherial    particles         in                  to      be

to  believe that with the supposition                   of

as they embraced, and embodied, real facts and accurate      con
ceptions of phaenomena.                 -
   The subjects on which in this point of view the above-men
tioned hypotheses, taken together with the questions in the
Optics, threw the most important light, were the phaenomena
of colours, and of chemistry.      I  shall confine myself to his
speculations on the latter subject, which lead directly to the
question at issue—namely, what were the ideas of philosophers
before the time of Black respecting the nature of air, and
whether the unity of the aerial element was any part of their
belief.
   Most remarkable, among the divinations of Newton, is his
introduction of the doctrine of chemical affinity in the optical
queries, where he connects the phaenomena             of chemistry
with those of   electricity, as both due to molecular forces acting
at insensible distances. He enumerates electricity among those
“attractions which reach to sensible distances, and so have
been observed by vulgar eyes;” he then suggests, that “there
may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto
escape observation,” and adding that “perhaps electrical at
traction may reach to such small distances, even without being
earcited by friction*,” goes on to couple it with the phaeno
mena of chemical affinity, as produced by the same species of
force.   What is this, if it be well weighed, but the principle
of all that experience has since brought to light in respect to
galvanic and electro-chemical forces? here was the prophet's
eye, anticipating the progress of science and the actual indi
cations of the kind of force which he surmised.
   That which follows on the point of chemical affinity itself
is equally  remarkable.       For observe how, guided in this  in
stance by the few obscure phaenomena before him, he deals
with the molecules which represent this peculiar form of at
traction: they are not elementary molecules, nor molecules of
equal magnitude, but compound particles whose force of affinity
is in the inverse ratio of their composition—“the smallest par
ticles cohering by the strongest attractions, and composing
bigger particles of weaker virtue, and many of these cohering,
and composing bigger particles whose virtue is still weaker,
and so on, for divers successions, until the progression end in
the biggest particles on which the operations of chemistry,
and the colours of natural bodies depend, and which by co
hering compose bodies of a sensible magnitudet.”           Have we
not, in this conception of chemical affinity as depending on
the successive addition of units of force, the principle of multi
ple proportions, of which the experimental demonstration was

bodies, and describing a pressure of elastic forces, which vary
ing   with the distance produces cohesion at small distances,
and repulsion at greater, he deduces among other conse
quences this—“that the particles of vapours, exhalations, and
air, do stand     at a distance from one another, and recede as
far from one     another as the pressure of the incumbent atmo
sphere will let them: for I conceive,” he says, “the con
fused mass of vapour, air, and exhalations, which we call the
atmosphere, to be nothing else but the particles of                 sorts                    all             of

which nature has            “transmuting gross compact substances

        In
      these views the new discovery of the various permanence
and condensability of the gases has a conspicuous place: “On
the same difference of size,” he says, “may depend the more
or less permanency of aerial substances in their state of rare
 faction.” “This may be the reason why the small particles of
 vapours come easily together and are reduced back into water,
 unless the heat which keeps them in agitation be so great as
 to dissipate them as fast as they come together, but the grosser
particles of exhalations raised by fermentation keep their
aërial form more obstinately, because the aether within is
 rarer.   Nor does the size only, but the density, of the parti
 cles also conduce to the permanency of aerial substances: for
 the excess of density of the aether without such particles above
 that of the aether within them is still greater: which has made
me sometimes think that the true permanent air may be of a
metallic original, the particles of no substances being more
dense than those of metals.                               I
                                   This think is also favoured by
experience: for I remember I once read in the Philosophical
 Transactions how M. Huygens at Paris found, that the air
made by dissolving salt of tartar would in two or three days'
time condense and fall down again; but the air made by dis
solving a metal continued without condensing or relenting in
the least.    If you consider then how by the continual fermen
tations made in the bowels of the earth there are aérial sub
stances raised out of          kinds all  bodies,     which together
                                                     of                    all

    These extracts show that Newton considered the hydrogen

which Huygens had obtained from copper,                  consisting             as                          of

  This supposition, that the most permanent airs are of a me
tallic origin and nature, representing hydrogen for instance
as ferreous gas, was set aside by the experiments of Cavendish,
which proved that the gas from iron is identical with the gas
from zinc, in specific gravity, in explosive power, in the quan
tity in which it combines with oxygen, and in the result of the
combination: they went also, as far as our experiments reach,
to invalidate the general supposition that the repulsive force
of the particles of matter is in proportion to their weight and
density; since they proved that hydrogen         both        elastic                      is,             in    its

this dissolution is fire, adding that this was done by a nitrous
substance inherent in, and mixed with, the air.”
    Here was the first distinct conception, and evidence, of the
composition of the atmosphere. The French physician Rey
had before proved that air enters into fixed combination with
solid matter: his proof rested on a capital observation which
he quotes from the Basilica Antimonii of Hamerus Poppius:
thischemist, “placing,” says Rey, “a burning glass in the sun's
rays, directed their focus on the apex of a cone of antimony,
till the whole becomes white, when the calcination is complete.
It is a wonderful thing, Poppius added, that although in this
                                                                                    its                           by
calcination the antimony loses much of                 substance         the
vapours and fumes which exhale copiously, yet                                                           so   it   is,   its
weight increases instead          diminishing”.” The philosophical

         a candle in a glass vessel over water, and observed that
 it raised the water in proportion to the quantity of air, en
 closed in the vessel, which was consumed and burnt; for
 “air,” he adds, “nourishes fire, and in nourishing consumes
 it.”   This sounds like the truth which Hook announced: but
 Fludd had no distinct idea of the weight of air, or of the great
 principle which led that plailosopher to predict, and observe,
ponderable products from                      its

 sick, and when he was thought near dying, the bottle was un
 stopped, that the streams and supposed air that had been shut
 up in it during the operation might have liberty to expand
 themselves in the receiver for the refreshing and recovering
 of the animal: but here it succeeded not; in so much that
 though the bird was taken out of the receiver and exposed to
 the fresh air, yet it recovered not.”
    “The other experiment was made with a kitling after the
 manner of the former, only that instead of distilled vinegar
 was employed aquafortis, whereof the success was, that the
 air being drawn out till the cat had done struggling, and was
 upon the point of expiration, and the bottle being unstopped
 to emit the streams and supposed air into the receiver, the
 cat did soon begin to recover, whereupon the animal had

in an equal volume of common air”.      But he advanced little
beyond his predecessor in demonstrating the air to be a com
pound.   It is not to be supposed he says that that acrial sup
porter of combustion is the whole air, but only a part of                                            it,
which   is more active and subtle than the rest; since               light                 a

                      a       expires, even whilst the vessel still con
tains abundance            of
                         air: for        cannot believe that the par

nor yet dissipated; since they cannot pass through the glass.”
But this reasoning, though probable,             not conclusive; since
                                                           is

weight disappears, analysis is impossible. So he left the com
position of the atmosphere to be demonstrated by those who
believed, with Mayow, that elastic fluids cannot penetrate
glass, and who took the pains to weigh both the air and the
substances by which it was diminished; whilst he went on pur
suing the phantom of his imaginative genius to the examina
tion of imponderable essences and the great discovery of the
chemical forces of light, and of the distinctions between the
heat of contact, and the heat of radiation *.

the principles of Mayow? Priestley—who many months after
he is said by you, and others, to have discovered oxygen gas,

of   Mayow's mice, which convinced him that this air was
longer respirable than common air; but his ideas                            were                 of
less accurate than      Mayow's,     for instead         considering of     with                     it, it

    You now see the error into which you have fallen when
you represent Priestley             discovering before Lavoisier that

in  condemning           “an unworthy and lamentable proceeding”
                             as
on Lavoisier's part,         the intruding himself into the history of

repeated, with a small variation of circumstances, and with
 almost the same result.”           He takes no notice of the distinc
 tion established in Cavendish's paper between “fixed air,”
 and “common air in which candles have burnt or which has
 passed through the fire;” and so entirely does he misunder
 stand, or disregard, Cavendish's intimation of the relative
 levity of the latter when purified from fixed air by caustic
 potash, as to “conclude, after making several trials, that the
 air in which candles have burned ” (without having been sub
jected to such purification) “is rather lighter than common
 air”;” whilst with regard to the lost air, which the paper
 communicated to him described as “absorbed by the fumes of
 the burning charcoal,” he represents Cavendish as having
 ascribed that loss to the “destruction of common air.”
 º
     Though Priestley however here proves himself not to have
 been, as you imagine, the discoverer of nitrogen, this indi
 stinct, but fruitful, experimenter gave in the same document
 three original and pregnant notifications; for he announced
 in it—1. the effect of vegetables in restoring the respirable
 quality of the air; 2. the application of the known absorbing
 power of nitrous gas, as a test of that respirable quality;
 3. his observation that candles burn with an enlarged flame
 in the gas produced by the distillation of nitre+. This ob
 servation it is from which those who call him the discoverer
 of oxygen should date the discovery: for he knew as much
 of the gas from nitre in 1772 as of that from minium in 1774;
 and it was the application of nitrous gas here stated, which
 led, in 1780, in the hands of Cavendish, to the first accurate
 analysis of the atmosphere, and in 1781 to the solution of the
                             becomes of the air lost in the combustion
 of hydrogen gas 2
      In scientific value doubtless there can be no comparison
 between the experimental inductions of Cavendish, or La
     *  “I could not find any considerable difference in the specific gravity of
 the air in which candles or brimstone had burnt out.      I am satisfied how
 ever that it is not heavier than common air, which must have been manifest
 if so great a diminution of the quantity had been owing, as Dr. Hales and
 others supposed, to the elasticity of the whole mass being impaired.     After
 making several trials for this purpose I concluded that air thus diminished
 in bulk is rather lighter than common air."—Phil. Trans. 1772, p. 164.
     t  “All the kinds of factitious air on which I have yet made the experi
 ment are highly noxious, except that which is extracted from saltpetre or
 alum; but in this even a candle burned just as in common air. In one quan
 tity which I got from saltpetre a candle not only burned, but the flame was
 increased, and something was heard like a hissing, similar to the decrepita
 tion of nitre in an open fire; this experiment was made when the air was
 fresh made, and while it contained some particles of nitre which it would
 probably have deposited afterwards.”—Phil. Trans. 1772, p. 245.

Mayow's deductions from the assumption, on probable grounds,
that there exists in the atmosphere a gas which in the act of
combining with other bodies produces the phaenomena of com

production of that salt, and from the sameness of           effect                        its               in

up with the air.     Nor can we wonder that such an air, filled
 with miasmata, if breathed by animals, cannot keep them alive,
especially when it is obvious that the spirit of nitre, and the
globule of iron, used by the distinguished author, abound in
many impure and poisonous particles, which if introduced into
the system in breathing, may well corrupt the mass of the
blood and induce death. If instead of the spirit of nitre he
had chanced to use another acid liquor of a more benign qua
lity, for instance the spirit of vitriol, and instead of a globule
of iron, had taken one of an earthy kind, as in my experi
ment, the animal doubtless would not have perished, or at
least would have lived longer.         So that we may collect from
this, not that the air, as air, destroyed the animal, but only
incidentally, so far as it abounds with particles of a different
kind and unfit                 for

 I   have before noticed that we owe to him the discovery of a
  fact in gaseous chemistry, the consequence of which it is im
  possible to overrate—the condensation of atmospheric air by
  nitrous gas, in such a manner that the two gases were observed
  by him to occupy the same space.               He first also determined
  with numerical exactness, and by very ingenious methods, the
  volume of air absorbed in a variety of chemical processes, and
  stated in the clearest terms the chemical nature of that ab
  sorption,-a statement adopted, as I have shown, by Caven
  dish, and strangely misconstrued by Priestley.                  “They were
  changed,” he says, “from a repelling elastic to a fixed state
  by the strong attraction of other particles which I call absorb
  ing.”    He taught the chemists of the succeeding generation
  how to procure almost                         all
                                    the gases which formed the sub

   But we are by no means to conclude from hence that Hales
had any doubt of the plurality of elastic fluids; on that point
he quotes, as at once the foundation and the result of                      his                 all
inquiries, the opinions expressed               Newton      by

strong attraction, and are therefore not separated                    rarefied            or
without fermentation, those particles receding from one an
other with the greatest repulsive force, and being most dif
ficultly brought together which upon contact are most strongly
united.”       “Dense bodies                     by

Hales adds, “we have proof from many                     the following ex  of

                                                  ends: for having again
repeated the same quotation from Newton,                  closes his “ana  he

                      drawing this general inference from                   his                 all

                                                      to         your state          of
ment, that “when D’Alembert wrote the article “Air'                         the                 in
Encyclopédie          1751,                he
                                   gave the doctrine then universally
received, that           allin
                        the other kinds         air were only impure at

mospheric air, and that this fluid alone was permanently elas
tic?” You tell                   us
                            elsewhere that D'Alembert disregarded
inductive     philosophy,     and professed himself ignorant              che                  of
mistry; and thus should have accounted for his ignorance
on   this point,         if   I I
                           had not found                          on

lembert says indeed, that some                         of
                                             the ancients considered the
air  asa   simple element, but remarks with truth, that they did
not attach the same sense                       to

   Mr. Macauley considers the credulity of those whom he
calls “the dupes of Mesmerism,” as due, not so much to
neglect of these laws of evidence, as to want of natural saga
city; but the history of science by no means justifies this view
of unfounded opinions: the truth       that                is,
                                              sciences, except         all

 where they contained any, mystified and confused.
    This was the state            of
                                  science when Bacon appeared.            The
 master science          of
                          evidence,   like  every  other   science,   requires
 for  its perfection both rules and examples.               Bacon gave the
 rules.     Ithas been observed                 by

such course of    research,  whatever offers itself fortuitously   is
observed by an eye which is on the watch for the appearance
of the laws, known or assumed, that fill its meditations; and
the whole design with which each experiment is instituted, is
to test the applicability of those laws, and to try the validity,
or the accuracy, of principles which have more or less the
character of foregone conclusions.
    This is experimental philosophy : this is the science of ob
serving, interrogating, and interpreting, nature—apart from
that faculty of catching far analogies on the wings of a lively
and just imagination, which constitutes perhaps the highest
part of the genius of a philosopher, though we should be much
in error, if we regarded even this high gift of Heaven as inca
pable of being improved by rule, example, and use.
    Thus it was that Black, under the guidance of the light
which a clear conception of the laws of affinity shed over #.

 518     Rev.       W.V. Harcourt                on   Lord Brougham's                    statements
 into sulphuric acid: he negatived by conclusive experiments
 these three suppositions of condensation: at this crisis of his
 inquiry Warltire burnt inflammable gas and common air in a
 vessel which he imagined to be close, and finding a very sen
 sible loss of weight, concluded, with Scheele, that ponderable
 matter had passed through the vessel's pores in the form of
 heat: at the same time he repeated an observation, made also
 by others, that in the combustion water was deposited from
 the air, in which he supposed it to have been contained: to
 the mind of Cavendish, deeply meditating what might be the
 form of matter into which the lost airs could have been con
 densed, this inaccurate experiment immediately suggested the
 light for which he was watching. Such is his own descrip
tion of the manner of the discovery; and the course of expe
riments recorded in his note-book leave no shadow of a doubt
 that he has described it with truth.
    In the progress of these experiments, that is to say, in his
fourth experiment of exploding the gases, in an apparatus like
 Warltire's but really close, on the 5th day of July 1781,
 Cavendish arrived at the eract volume of hydrogen which de

 philosophic character           venture  to upon         the inference that
 water was not simple element, but

ter acquainted with sciences not peculiarly his own: but
though the subject is chemistry, though you have attended
Black's lectures, and though Black's own discoveries are in
question,         I
             greatly fear that on almost every point in which
you differ from Cuvier you are yourself in the wrong.
   Thus, you are certainly wrong in denying Cuvier's asser
tion—that permanently elastic fluids were measured by Hales;
and you have only to consult the ‘Analysis of the Air,’ to be
convinced of your mistake.
   Again, you are wrong in denying Cuvier's assertion, that
“no one before Cavendish had distinguished fixed air as a
separate aëriform substance:” and you need only look at
Black's treatise to assure yourself that he declined to decide,
for want of evidence, whether it was an aériform substance,
or not; and left it among the class of “bodies of which it is

announce the astonishing novelty—that the exhibition of sul
phur to sulphuric acid reduces that acid, and restores it to                                                     its

parts of the body, to different animals; but I have been in the
habit for some years past, of expressing this kind of analogy
by the term “homology;’ and I heartily join in the recom
mendation of your ingenious correspondent, that all writers
on comparative anatomy and zoology should use the word in
that sense, whether it be or be not coupled with the likeness
of function performed by such parts; to signify which rela
tion alone, the term “analogy’ should be restricted.    As in
stances of parts both homologous and analogous, may be
cited the pectoral limb of the Porpoise and that of the Fish:
they are homologous as being constituted of essentially the
same or corresponding parts; they are analogous as having
the same relation of subserviency to swimming.              So likewise

of solution,  that is to say, the increase in volume which the
water in which they are dissolved undergoes.               Their me
thod consists in    introducing   a determined    weight  of salt into
water contained in a glass bulb, capable of holding 1000 to
4000 grains of water, surmounted by a graduated stem, in
which they measure the increase in volume of the water after
the solution of the salt. The same apparatus served to mea
sure the volume of the salts in the solid state, either by employ

were insoluble, such as the            turpentine.oil   of

equivalent    of any salt whatever in solution in water, is always
an exact multiple of the number 9 representing the atomic
volume of water.
   It is difficult to conceive whence this simple relation be
tween the volume of the salts and the volume of the water
arises; nevertheless, if by adopting this hypothesis we were
led to represent by similar formulae the volume of analogous
compounds this law would be interesting, but the following
examples will suffice to show how many anomalies we meet
with.    We will here compare the number of volumes of water

inscribed    the second column, because these alone satisfied
                  in
the law which they wanted     prove.    For other bodies, how
                                                      to
ever, they have admitted experiments made        low tempera                          at
 tures; thus for the alums                           of
                                                    iron and chromium the                                experi
 ments were made                     at   23°, for the sulphate   alumina       of                      at   10°.

530 Prof. Marignac on Messrs. Playfair and Joule's Memoir
   When it is         seen that the atomic volume                          of sulphate of pot
ash and magnesia may vary more than 10 between 0° and
27°, it will readily be conceived that it will never be a diffi
cult task to make the volume of each compound an exact
multiple of 9; for this purpose it is merely requisite - to make
the experiment at a suitable temperature.
   The relative proportions of water and of salt likewise cause
the volume occupied by the latter in solution to vary, Messrs.
Playfair and Joule are fully aware of this; they made experi
ments on the very subject, and proved this influence by the
following results relative to the volume occupied by an equi
valent of sugar in solution in different quantities of water:—
      Relative proportions of Temperature.
                                  p                            Volume of one equivalent
          sugar and water.                                       of sugar in solution.

   The difference          between the first number and the following
would have been still greater if the experiments had been
made at the same temperature.
  What then are the relative proportions of salt and water
which should be employed in order that the results may be
capable of comparison?     We know not, and the authors leave
us in total ignorance of the subject; we only find that in their
experiments they have not restricted themselves to uniform
conditions; thus they employed
                                                                     Salt. Water. Proportion.

Evidently,     under such circumstances they have found
                 if                                                                              an

these circumstances cause the volume          vary within consider

able limits.  As  long      these influences are neglected,
                                        as                       we                        or
do not operate     that they act
                      so                       in       all
                                                 the same manner,
                                                                   in in

the results obtained cannot        compared   be  any possible way
with one another.
   Let us now pass        the atomic volume of the salts
                                   to                           the                    in
solid state.    Messrs. Playfair and Joule have advanced for
these the   following  law —The atomic volume       any salt                      of

            on Atomic Volume and Specific       Gravity.            531
whatever (anhydrous or hydrated) is a multiple of 11, or of a
number near to 1 I, or a multiple of 9-8 (the atomic volume of
ice); or again, the sum of a multiple of 11 or of 9-8.
    This law appears to us to resemble very much the prece
ding, except that the indecision as to the choice between the
multiples of two different numbers renders it still less pro
bable.
    We do not in this case meet in the same degree with the
objections above set forth for the case of dissolved salts; the
temperature cannot cause any great variation in their density,
and the experiments were made at temperatures varying too
little to have any separate influence,—if it be admitted, which
 however is far from being proved, that with respect to the
 solid bodies their densities should be compared at the same
 temperatures.
     We will however make one remark relative to the process
 by which the densities were determined; it appears to us little
 suited to give accurate results.      It is not stated what was the
 volume of the liquid to which the salt whose density was to be
 determined was added; but as it was the same apparatus which
 had served for the preceding experiments, we may suppose
 that it contained at least 1000 grains of water. The quantity
 of salt employed in each experiment was from 40 to 60 grains,
 and there thence resulted an increase in the volume of the
 liquid corresponding to about 20 to 40 grains of water; in a
 great number of cases indeed we find an increase of only 10
 to 20 grains, that is to say, of from 1 to 2 per cent, of the total
 volume.     It is evident that by this process it is extremely dif
 ficult to avoid serious errors produced by the slightest varia
 tions of temperature, which tend to alter the volume of so
 large a liquid mass, and of errors probably still more import
 ant, which might result either from the solution of a portion
 of the salt in the liquid, if this was not accurately saturated,
                                      j.
 or from the precipitation of a portion of the salt contained in
 the liquid, if it were more than saturated. The experiments
 of Gay-Lussac prove indeed that both these circumstances
 may readily occur.
     These causes of error might              be neglected if the vo
 lume of the liquid were very inconsiderable; but when, on the
 contrary,  its  proportion      solarge relatively     the solid salt,
                                                      be to
                            is
  they become too serious for any confidence     to      placed    on
                                                                    the
 densities obtained   by  this process.
     We should add, that         on reviewing the formulae which
  Messrs.  Playfair  and Joule have established, based         the pre
                                                              on
                    do
                                      to
 ceding law, they       not appear    us
                                      to       indicate any very great
 probability for this law. Along with certain analogies which

532              The Astronomer Royal's Remarks
do not surprise us, for they result simply from the fact of the
equality of the atomic volumes with respect to the isomorphous
compounds, we meet with a number of most striking anomalies.
For the chlorides of calcium, strontium and magnesium, the
atomic volume is equal to 11 multiplied by 6, i.e. the number of
equivalents of water of crystallization of those salts, but for the
alums it is 11 x 25, while there are only 24 equiv. water. For
the sulphate and borate of soda with 10 equiv. water the vo
lume = 11 x 10, but for the pyrophosphate with 10 equiv.
water it is 11 x 11; and for the carbonate likewise, with 10
equiv. water, it is 9.8 x 10; for the anhydrous carbonate of
soda the factor 11 is taken, and for the hydrated carbonate
9.8; on the contrary, for the anhydrous sulphate of soda the
authors prefer 9.8, and for the hydrated sulphate 11. The bro
mide of potassium = 4 x 11, the bromide of sodium = 5 × 11,
the chloride of potassium = 4 x 9.8, the chloride of sodium
 = 3 x 9’8.
    These instances we think will suffice to show that the hy
pothesis of Messrs. Playfair and Joule is not confirmed by an
analogy of formulae such as ought to be expected, and that
the coincidence which does exist between the calculated and
the observed densities merely result from the easy way in which
the authors select at will the factor 9.8 or the factor 11, or
even of combining them for one and the same body, as they
have done in a large number of cases.
 LXXXI.      Itemarks on Dr. Faraday's Paper on Ray-vibrations.
            By G. B. AIRY, Esq., Astronomer Royal.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
THEbefore  communication which accompanies this was sketched
                 my attention was called to Dr. Faraday's leading
 paper in your Number for the present month.         I need not to
 say that I read that paper with great interest and great plea
 sure. Yet     I will ask your indulgence, and I am sure that     I
 shall receive the forgiveness of Dr. Faraday, while    I comment
 on the principal points of that paper somewhat critically.       I
 am desirous of examining, or of suggesting grounds for exa
 mination by others, as to how far the fundamental supposi
 tions of Dr. Faraday are necessarily limited by recognised
 phaenomena, and as to how far the subject is metaphysical or
 physical.
                     I
    The paper, as understand, treats of two subjects:—
    1. The possibility of explaining phaenomena of radiation,

               on    Dr. Faraday's Paper                    on Ray-vibrations.                      533
more especially of light, by supposing that when there is no
body obviously occupying the path of the light, &c., the vibra
tions which are assumed as the foundation of the undulations
producing the phaenomena are transmitted on the lines of force
by what (for want of a received term) may be called lateral
shakes.
  2. The possibility of removing the idea of substance and
substituting for it that of centres of force.
   I shall treat of these in the order in which have written                     I
them above.
   1.   With regard to the transmission of light through the
planetary spaces.
   Dr. Faraday and myself agree in receiving the undulatory
theory of light with transversal vibrations, as applicable to
those phaenomena which present themselves in ordinary optical
experiments.    Without any wish therefore to dogmatize on
this matter,            I
               shall assume the undulatory theory in         the                                all
following remarks.
  It    admitted that vibrations forming progressive undula
        is
tions are required for the explanation      certain crystalline       of
and other phaenomena.        But     must claim somewhat more.
                                                  I
Progressive undulations (leaving the nature        their vibrations        of
undetermined) are     required     explain the phaenomena
                                                  to            dif:                            of
fraction; and these progressive undulations must not                                                be   of
the nature              of
                  radial shakes, where each shake derives its
virtue     existence from the momentary influence
           or                                               the dis                       of
tant  origin, but  they must     true waves,   be

ceeding” not being confined                            to

whatever, but being such that the motion            particles may      of                                be

               a                           defy any one     I put to                       to

large solid angle. Now the consequences            this are very            of
important.    Diffraction takes  place     air; therefore  the viin
brating medium exists      air, and the undulations are trans

time of   changing   the direction of progress    in a degree exactly

   This speculation,                         its
                               general character, differs little from
                                      in
the celebrated inquiry regarding Substance and Accidents.
In  the latter the question                         is,
                                   whether, when we have found                                              a
lump       of
           matter       possess certain form, colour, weight, and
                                to
other properties, we can satisfy ourselves              saying that this        by
lump       of
          matter        combination
                             is

such    weight,
          a       &c.;     And the answer has          usually  been that
the mind         not satisfied unless we describe the lump
                      is                                                                                    of

                 as                                         such    form,            of           a

                                                                   before
us, the question                  is,
                          whether instead          matter which exerts    of
certain actions upon other matter, we may assume that there
is nothing but       number  a    centres        force producing these
                                                   of                of
actions?       think that most persons would say that the mind
                  I
is  not satisfied with this assumption, and that             requires the             it

But this question,          my opinion,        purely      metaphysical
                                                                     is              a
question, entirely removed from the province                  the natural             of

   To great extent           am willing       admit that the supposito

scarcely scruple to admit that there is no substance.          While
the resistance to force   remains, it seems  scarcely    possible  to
get rid of the idea of substance.
   Perhaps it may be said that even inertia may be represented
by centres of force, only supposing the development of the
force to be dependent in some way upon time.            Such, how
ever, is not the character of forces that we know best; and
the introduction of this idea appears to give greater complexity
to the force-centre-theory than is given by the idea of sub
stance in the material theory.

538            Mr. R. Mallet      on the Vorticose Movement,
earthquake at Boston, in New England, of November 18th,
1755, communicated by John Hyde, Esq., F.R.S.              He says,
“the   trembling   continued about two    minutes;   near one hun
dred chimneys were levelled with the roofs of the houses, and
many more shattered. Some chimneys, though not thrown
down, are dislocated or broken several feet from the top, and
partly turned round as on a swivel.       Some are shoved to one
side horizontally, jutting over, and just nodding to fall,” &c.
This author does not seem to have been struck with this odd
circumstance of the twisting round of the chimneys, and offers
no explanation.      The next instance that                I
                                                 have found is in
the account of the great earthquake of Calabria, in 1783, as
recorded by the Royal Academy of Naples, quoted by Mr.
Lyell, in his Principles of Geology, vol. i. page 482. After
describing several other remarkable phaenomena, tending to
show the great velocity of the shock, such as that many large
 stones were found, as it were, shot out of their beds in the
 mortar of buildings, so as to leave a complete cast of them
 selves in the undisturbed mortar; while in other instances
 the mortar was ground to powder by the transit of the stone,
he says, “Two obelisks (of which he has given figures)
placed at the extremities of a magnificent façade in the con
vent of St. Bruno, in a small town called Stephano del Bosco,
were observed to have undergone a movement of a singular
kind. The shock, which agitated the building, is described as
having been horizontal and vorticose. The pedestal of each
obelisk remained in        original place, but the separate stones
                            its
above were turned partially round, and removed sometimes
nine inches from their position without falling.”       This                    is   all
that Lyell says upon the subject;           contents himself appa

   The church        La Morceda,
                     of               Valparaiso, built
                                           at               burnt          of
bricks, stood with        its
                        length north and south. [The houses
are built      of
               adobes,          or
                            sun-dried bricks.]     “The church
tower, sixty feet high, was levelled; the two side-walls, full                       of
rents, were left standing, supporting part     the shattered roof,
                                                       of
but the two end-walls were entirely demolished. On each
side    the church were four massive buttresses, six feet square,
         of
of good brickwork; those             on
                                 the western side were thrown
down and broken         pieces,
                          to          as
                                   were two                on
                                                 the eastern side.

               assumed to accompany                  Earthquakes.        539
 The other two were twisted off from the wall in a north-east
 erly direction, and left standing.” The direction of the shocks
 was thought to be either from the south-west, or from the
 north-west.                                             -
      We shall see hereafter evidence in the twisting of the two
  remaining buttresses, that the former was the real direction
  of the shocks, and that there was no vorticose motion, (indeed,
  the idea of two vortices, with centres only a few feet apart, is
  absurd upon the face,) but that the twisting of the buttresses
  is accounted for simply by a straight line movement, in con
  nection with the attachment of the buttresses at one side, to
  the flank wall of the church.
     The last instance I shall quote is from the pages of the able         º\
  and delightful Darwin, in his Journal of a Naturalist's Voy
  age (Colonial Library, edit. p. 308), in describing the effects
  of the great earthquake of March 1835, upon the buildings
  in the town of Conception; and after noticing, also, the evi
  dences of immense velocity in the shock, by which the pro
                                                                                   |   -
 jecting buttresses from the nave walls of the cathedral had
  been cut clean off close to the wall, by their own inertia, while
 the wall, which was in the line of shock, remained stand-                     |
 ing; he proceeds,-‘‘Some square ornaments on the coping
 of these same walls were moved by the earthquke into a dia
 gonal position.     A similar circumstance was observed after,
 an earthquake at Valparaiso, Calabria and other places,                 in
 cluding some of the ancient Greek temples" (for which he
 quotes Arago, in L’Institut. 1839, p. 337, and Miers's Chile,
 vol. i. p. 392).                                                   -
     “This twisting displacement,” he proceeds, “at first ap
 pears to indicate a vorticose movement beneath each point,
 thus effected; but this is highly improbable.        May it not,”
 he adds, “be caused by a tendency in each stone to arrange
 itself in some particular position with respect to the lines of
vibration, in a manner somewhat similar to pins on a sheet of
paper when shaken?”
     The sagacity of Darwin at once showed him that the vor
ticose hypothesis was most improbable, and that in order to
                     of be all
its  being able at               to
                            account for the phaenomenon,      sepa  a
rate vortex must         admitted for every separate stone found
twisted, the axis      rotation            of
                                   the vortex having been coinci
dent with that  of  the stone: besides this paramount improba
bility, therefore, little further reflection would have led either

elegant statement of words; and to render the matter quite
familiar, have prepared a model of one of the Calabrian                                                         pe
destals, figured by Mr. Lyell, which will exhibit to the eye all
the phaenomena already adverted to, by giving by the hand
a rectilineal horizontal motion to the base”.
    I  have now proved that no vorticose motion is requisite to
account for the twisting of obelisks, &c., as observed in earth
quakes, and that nothing more than a simple horizontal rec
tilineal motion is demanded; but, it may be asked, if this rec
 tilineal horizontal motion in earthquakes be an alternate one
also-if the earth shake both back and forwards—how is it
 that these and other displaced bodies are not moved back into
 their places again by the reverse motion, by the same sort of
 motion, acting in the contrary direction?
     This question                 is,

546         Mr. E. F. Teschemacher                   on various Substances
and of various scientific men, that the prolonged passage of
the electricity by metallic wires alters essentially their tena
city. It seemed to me very probable that the elasticity of wires
subjected for some time to the intermittence of currents which
renders them sonorous, must be altered in a permanent man
nel",
   Since the experiments just mentioned were made, M.                         Wer
theim has published * a very interesting note, in which he de
scribes a process of observation analogous to mine, although
less delicate, and indicates the causes to which he attributes
the sounds produced.         Although I agree with him on most
points, I differ from him both as to what relates to the attrac
tion exerted from the two sides of the centre of the helix, an
attraction which he does not mention, and in the explanation of
the case in which the wire is directly traversed by the disconti
nuous current. The skilful experimentalist whom I have just
named attributes the sound produced to the heat engendered
by the current.      Nevertheless my wire indicated no percep
tible heat.    It results from the experiments of M. de la Rive
and my own, that the sonorous state continues with more than
600 interruptions a second. How shall we admit that the ele
vation of temperature and the diminution of elasticity which
accompany it can disappear in rinth of a second? The cur
rent of a pile of eleven pairs certainly does not alter the ther
mical state of a bar of a centimetre square in section, as                          I
have directly established t: nevertheless, if it is discontinuous,
it renders it sonorous.. I may add, finally, that this heating
does not take place when the reel is employed, as any one
may convince himself by placing a bismuth and iron pair in
its hollow, connected with       very delicate rheometer. Never
                                       a
theless the sonorous      property may      the same    bewith the       as
wire  directly  subjected         to
                              the current.

of  Guanite, this name being derived from the circumstances
and locality          of   its
                     formation.
   The source from which the first two substances, namely,
the phosphate              of
                     ammonia and the bicarbonate          ammonia,                       of

      jound in       the          Guano Deposits and in their Vicinity. 549
are derived, is clearly the percolation of water through the
guano beds dissolving out these salts, which running into lower
situations may be detained in lagoons and hollows of rocks,
where being subject to the high temperature of the climate
they would be evaporated down, leaving these salts in the
crystalline state described.  As guano contains abundance of
these two salts, it is possible there may exist considerable
masses of them; should this be the case, it is evident that to
the chemist in particular it would be of great interest as an
additional source of these valuable salts.
   The chance of finding any considerable quantity of guanite
in the state of crystals is not great, but as it forms one of
the ingredients of guano it is a substance of some import
ance. The application of it as a manure in combination with
other ingredients is likely to be highly beneficial, it being a
compound containing two important substances in an insoluble
state, namely, ammonia and phosphoric acid; these may be
taken up by plants only as they may be required, and not be
liable to be dissolved out of the soil or evaporated like other
ammoniacal salts.

 not answer to operate on a much larger scale; it is better to

    Let us now consider the productiveness of this method.                        I
have already stated my average of former results to have been
90 per cent. of                alloxan, exclusive of the mother
liquid, which corresponded to one-tenth more. As the pro
cess now stands we have—1. The first crop of crystals of                         al
loxan, varying with the proportion of water used to dissolve
the anhydrous alloxan.      2. The second crop of the same cry
stals.  ,3. The alloxantine from the mother-liquid converted
into alloxan, or calculated in that form.       I take no account
of the parabanic acid.
   Experiment 1–Uric acid 2600 grains; alloxan, first crop,
1950 grains, second crop, 550 grains; alloxantine, 200 grains,
equivalent to alloxan, 290 grains. In all, therefore, from 2600
grains of uric acid, 2790 grains of hydrated alloxan, or 107
per cent. nearly.
   Experiment 2–Uric acid, 1130 grains; alloxan, first crop,
 800 grains, second crop, 140 grains; alloxantine, 80 grains,
equivalent to alloxan, 116 grains. In all, therefore, 1056 grs.
of alloxan from 1130 of uric acid, or 93 per cent.
   Experiment 3.-Uric acid, 1500 grains; alloxan, first crop,
 1150 grains, second crop, 270 grains; alloxantine, 120 grains,
 equivalent to alloxan, 174 grains.       In all, therefore, from
 1500  grains of uric acid,  1594  grains  of alloxan, or 106 per
Cent.

alloxan,   were obtained without     difficulty.  Indeed the only
delicate  point  in the process is the attention necessary to avoid
too great a rise in temperature, alloxan being decomposed by
heat even when simply dissolved in water, but still more when
acid is present. A little experience however makes this quite
easy; and besides, this difficulty attaches equally to Schlieper's
new method, as we shall see.
   The formula of uric acid being Clo Na H, Og, while that
of hydrated alloxan is Cs N, H. Olo-F 6 aq, it is obvious that
100 parts of uric acid can produce about 128 of alloxan.          It
is not likely  that we shall ever obtain the full  proportion with
out loss, but I consider my process, simple as it                 is,
                                                            furnish     to
a  very satisfactory approximation, considering the impossibi

                           ON CHLOROAZOTIC          ACID.
M      •
          BAUDRIMONT remarks, that Mr. Edmund Davy published
            his researches on aqua regia in 1831, and concluded from
them, that what he terms chloronitrous acid is composed of equal
volumes of chlorine and nitric oxide gases, which combine without
 alteration of volume.
    According to M. Baudrinaont, the presence of [uncombined]
chlorine in the product obtained by Mr. Davy prevented the product
from being properly examined, and he therefore undertook fresh re
searches on the subject.
    In order to prepare the active product [chloroazotic acid) of aqua
regia, M. Baudrimont mixed three parts, by weight, of nitric acid,
of specific gravity about 1-314, with five parts of hydrochloric acid,
of specific gravity 1-156; this mixture yields a colourless liquid,
which after an uncertain time becomes red, according to the tempe
rature of the air and the intensity of the light to which it is exposed.
If, however, the mixture be heated, it becomes red at about 187°
Fahr., and yields vapour of the same colour; the temperature gra
dually increases to nearly 230°Fahr., and then remains so invariably
during the whole time of the operation.
    If the product of the distillation be received in a vessel properly
cooled, a red liquid is obtained; but if the neck of the retort be
simply passed into a receiver, a red vapour is formed which does
not condense, and a colourless liquid is condensed.
    This experiment shows that this distillation yields two distinct
products—a red vapour which is very volatile, and a colourless pro
duct which is more fixed.          It shows also that the temperature of
230°Fahr. does not indicate a boiling-point, but a fixed point of
decomposition.        By adopting the requisite arrangements, the red
vapour may be condensed in tubes in the state of a red liquid, which
boils at a very low temperature; it can be preserved only in tubes
hermetically sealed. This is what the author terms chloroazotic
acid; the properties of which are as follows:—                                    •
    At a   sufficiently low   temperature     it is a red   limpid   liquid, sur

from it.
    The extreme volatility       of  chloroazotic acid presented almost         in
surmountable difficulties       to  the determination       of    principal pro

p erties.
   The elements      of  chloroazotic acid reduced          tovolumes, and the
volumes    multiplied     bythe  corresponding     specific gravities,   give the
following results:—

  One experiment on the specific gravity of chloroazotic acid gave

   Thus the 9 volumes of elementary gases which form chloroazotic
acid are condensed into 6 volumes, and one volume of the acid con
tains 3rd volume of nitrogen, 3 of oxygen, and 3rds of chlorine. The
specific gravity of the liquid acid was found to be l'3677.

  NOTICES OF NEW Local ITIES OF RARE MINERALs, AND REASONs
     FOR UNITING SEVERAL SUPPOSED DISTINCT SPECIES.                       By
     FRANCIS ALGER, MEMBER of THE Boston society of NATU
     RAL HISTORY”.
                         Phacolite from New York.
    This rare mineral, which     comes to us principally from Bohemia
 and   Ireland, I have discovered among a suite of specimens of various
 kinds found on New York Island, near Harlem, by Messrs. Mathews
 and Johnson, of New York city. The specimens, which eventually
 proved to be this mineral, were labelled stilbite; but their appear
 ance was so peculiar, that I questioned at the time whether they
 had been correctly designated, and determined to examine them
 carefully at my earliest convenience.        I have since received two
 other specimens, better characterized than the first, from Mr.
 Johnson. The crystals are in a geode form, implanted on calcareous
 spar, and associated with silver-coloured mica and a few scales of
 oligisto-magnetic iron ore. They are of a wax or honey-yellow co
 lour, have a waxy lustre, and the smallest individuals are translucent.
They are brittle, breaking with an uneven fracture, have none of the
foliated structure of stilbite, and afford no indications of cleavage.
 Hardness superior to that of stilbite, and equal to that of chabasite.
Their surfaces are roughened or pitted, so as to reflect no image by
which they could be subjected to measurement by the goniometer.
Before the blowpipe, a fragment of the mineral swells and intumesces
slightly, like the Bohemian and Ferroe chabasite, and fuses into an
opaline, blebby bead; at the moment of ignition, in the outer flame,
it gives out a beautiful green phosphorescence, which I have also
noticed, in a less degree, in the phacolite from Ireland.      It is soluble
in hydrochloric acid. The crystals, at first sight, appear to be
rounded, and to have no determinate form; but, on closer examina
tion, some of the smaller and more isolated ones are found to be
nearly perfect double six-sided pyramids, precisely similar to the
phacolite from Bohemia, differing from it only in colour and lustre.
I cannot doubt that, like that mineral, they are secondaries to a pri
mary rhombohedron, probably of the same measurements, and are
also identical with it in composition.       The absence of well-defined
cleavage is unfortunate, but this is a defect which applies equally to
the foreign mineral.      Nor is the rhombohedral cleavage of ordinary
chabasite, of which phacolite is by many supposed to be only ava
riety, by any means easily determined; in fact, Sir David Brewster
has suggested, from optical investigations, whether the primary form
of chabasite be not a prism.
          Is Phacolite a variety of Chabasite, or distinct from it?
    Tamnau of Berlin, in his very complete little essay on Chabasites,
has given very good reasons for uniting the two; while Breithaupt
has maintained them to be distinct.       The primary rhombohedron of

  hacolite, according to Breithaupt, is P on P, 94°, that of chabasite
}. on  P, 94°24'. Phillips makes the last 94° 46'. The analyses of
Anderson and Rammelsberg would seem at first to show a marked
difference in their composition, a difference which is also shown by
the different analyses of common chabasite, resulting in varieties
having different formularic expressions.        For example, acadiolite
contains three per cent, more of silicic acid than common chabasite,
and is a tersilicate of lime and the other isomorphous bases, instead
of a bisilicate of the same bases.       The mineralogical formula of
acadiolite is 3Al Si2+(Cal, N, K,) Siº + 6 Aq, while that of chaba
site is 3Al Siº + (Cal, N, K,) Siº + 6 Aq. Rammelsberg is inclined
to regard phacolite as a mixture of acadiolite and scolecite (lime
mesotype), the latter containing an additional atom of water*. By
uniting the atoms of both, he thus states the chemical formula for
phacolite : 2RO SiO2+2Al-O 3Six O'+10HO. As the analyses
stand (compare Berzelius's and Thomson's with the two just re
ferred to), phacolite differs from chabasite in containing three per
cent. less of silicic acid, and three atoms less of water.     Now it is
obvious that these differences are insufficient to authorize a separa
tion of the two minerals, unless there be a want of agreement in cry
stallographical and other characters, greater than that as yet pointed
out. An equally valid reason could be urged for the separation of
acadiolite from chabasite, on the ground of a difference in their com
position, had not the examinations of Prof. G. Rose proved an exact
agreement in the angles of their primary crystals. So, also, of levyne
and gmelinite, which are now admitted to be only varieties of cha
basite, their occurring forms all being secondaries to the same pri
mary rhombohedron.        The evidence of the identity of any two
minerals is best shown by the incipient or intermediate passages of
one into the other, in the same specimen. I am not aware that, in
the case of the Irish or Bohemian phacolite, such evidence has been
adduced; no tendency of the sort is shown in the specimens I have
examined from those countries.         Now one of my specimens from
New York has the distinct form of chabasite (the perfect rhombo
hedron) and of phacolite (perfect double six-sided pyramids).         The
first form, however, is rare; the incipient replacements are also
shown; but these crystals have not the full perfection of waxy lustre
reflected by the ultimate form of phacolite,—a singular effect, attri
butable, probably, to the nature of the solvent in which the molecules
were suspended.
            Approach   of twin-crystals to the Phacolite form.
    These, as they are sometimes presented, would, unless carefully
examined, be mistaken for the true form of phacolite.          The most
perfect specimens I have seen are from Nova Scotia.         They consist
 of two rhombohedrons united in the usual manner, each crystal
turned half round, but having their superior edges and lateral angles
   * See First Suppl. to his Handwirterbuch, p. 112. It was on these
grounds that Hoffmann proposed to separate acadiolite, as well as the Gus
tafsberg variety, from chabasite.—Poggendorff's  Annalen, xxv. 495.

    deeply replaced. The approach to the form of phacolite is thus pro
    duced; the edges and angles not standing out in relief, as they ordi
    narily do in these twin forms. The striae, parallel with the edges of
    the two rhombohedrons, so intersect as to show the compound nature
    of the crystals.  Dr. C. T. Jackson has a fine specimen of this va
    riety from the Two Islands, in Nova Scotia, of a wine-yellow colour;

      This rare mineral is found, associated with brucite, in rolled masses
    of limestone, in the town of Amity, Orange county, New York. I

may not have been derived from the gangue of slate, from which it
is difficult to obtain the mineral entirely free. Its infusibility before
the blowpipe would seem to show this. It has been suggested, also,
that a part of the iron may have been in the state of protoxide.          It
seems impossible, without some such supposition, that substances
so closely resembling each other in all their physical characters,
should differ so much in chemical composition.          Now, if the potash
be left  out, and the   peroxide of iron be   changed  into protoxide, the
ratio between the atoms of acid and bases is        nearly  the same as in
ottrelite, if we unite the atoms of magnesia and iron as isomorphous
with each other. Ottrelite, also, is not easily separated from its ma
trix, but the larger size of                    its

that Damour repeated his analysis, and obtained precisely the same

Now, if the phosphoric acid in ledererite is united with lime as an
accidental mixture, 2% per cent. of the lime should be taken from
the 11:48 per cent. found in the mineral: this brings the proportion
down nearly to that obtained by Connell. Mr. Hayes was not able to
determine the weight of the water with accuracy, owing to the small
quantity of the mineral operated upon. As the loss (1:44 per cent.)
was mostly water, we may suppose, with Rammelsberg, that ledererite
is gmelinite containing    (; ) quantity water. The chemical

The atomic proportions are thus nearly one atom titanic acid, two
atoms peroxide of iron, one atom protoxide of iron; or, a trititaniate
of iron, consisting of two atoms trititaniated peroxide and one atom
trititaniated protoxide.    If we unite the magnesia and lime with
protoxide of iron in the following analysis of an ilmenite from Aren
dal", by Mosander, we obtain precisely the same result. The cry
stalline form of the two varieties is also the same, and there can be no
doubt of their identity as one speciest.

      ON A NEW EUDIOMETRIC PROCESS.                   BY PROF. GRAHAM.
    Professor Graham described a new eudiometric process for the
 rapid absorption of oxygen gas from atmospheric air and other
 gaseous mixtures containing oxygen.               It consists in the employ
 ment of a solution in ammonia of a          sulphite  of the suboxide of cop
 per and ammonia. This salt falls as a granular powder, when a
 stream of sulphurous acid gas is conveyed into a cold solution of the
 ammoniacal sulphate of copper. When dissolved in ammonia it
 absorbs oxygen with singular avidity, and when employed in this
 form in eudiometry gives results of considerable uniformity.—From
 the Proceedings of the Chemical Society.
                        EQUIVALENT        of    cHLoRINE.
     M. Gerhardt observes, that M. Marignac has made some observa
 tions and experiments tending to show that the atomic weight of
 chlorine is not thirty-six times that of hydrogen, as he (M. Gerhardt)
 had concluded, but somewhat less. M. Marignac's conclusions are
  derived from the weight of chloride of potassium yielded by the cal
  cination of chlorate of potash; to these results M. Gerhardt makes
 the following objections:—
     It is the residue of chloride of potassium obtained, and not that
 of the oxygen gas, which is weighed; and from the following causes
 the quantity of chloride might be too small, and would diminish the
 atomic weight of chlorine:– a trace of moisture on the salt; a por
 tion of chlorate or chloride carried off by the current of oxygen gas;
 if the oxygen were impure, and contained, - as M. Marignac has
 stated, a trace of chlorine.
     Thus, observes M. Gerhardt, all the errors which can be com
 mitted in these determinations are referrible to the chlorine, and
 give it in too small quantity.
     From his experiments M. Gerhardt concludes, in opposition to
 those of M. Marignac, that the equivalents of chlorine, silver and
 potassium, are exact multiples of the equivalent of hydrogen, that is
 to say,–

   From the similarity of these results, M. Damour is of opinion that
this jade may be ranked with tremolite; and if this opinion should
be adopted, he observes, that in collections oriental jade will here
after be classed as compact                   tremolite.   —
