the lias and other rocks above; and water from the surface of
the earth passing through the strata must be constantly trans
porting organic matter from the surface, small in quantity
perhaps in a limited time, but large enough for the ob
served effect when supposed to be in constant action for
thousands of years; and this applies with equal force to the
Old as to the New Red series, in which, as I have said before,
the same effect may be observed.

        berries, the fruit of the dyer's buckthorn, Rhamnus
THESE
  Tinctoria, are imported from the Levant and from the
south of France, for the use of dyers, to whom they furnish a
yellow colour of great brilliancy, though not so permanent
as some others.    The appearance of the berries, as found in
commerce, varies considerably; some samples, and those the
most valuable, being larger, fuller, and of a light greenish
olive colour, whilst others are smaller, as if shrivelled, and
dark brown in tint. The former I consider to have the ap
pearance of being gathered before complete ripening, whilst
the latter owe their altered character to being allowed to re
main longer on the stem, or to having been incautiously
dried.
   The colouring matter in these two kinds is essentially dif
ferent. The unripe berries yield but little colour to pure
water, and when digested in aether give abundance of a rich
golden yellow substance, to which I give the name of chryso
rhamnine.   The dark-coloured berries contain little of the sub
stance soluble in aether, but give out to boiling water an olive
yellow material, to which, in                its
                                     pure form,    give the name

   Chrysorhamnine is of a rich golden yellow colour, of a cry
stalline aspect, and may be obtained in brilliant stellated tufts
of short silky needles. It is but very sparingly soluble in cold
water, and when boiled with water the portion which dissolves
does not separate on cooling, but is found to be changed into
xanthorhamnine. It dissolves in alcohol, but is not obtained by
 itsevaporation, without being much altered.         aether, how                       In
ever,    dissolves

III.    Demonstration of the Rule of Fourier.                  By J. R.
    YouNG, Esq., Professor of Mathematics in Belfast College”.
                 thing relating to the analysis and solution of nu
 EVERY merical equations has at length been brought under the
 dominion of common algebra, with the single exception of the
 rule which Fourier has proposed for discovering the character
 of a pair of roots indicated in a given interval. The investi
 gation of this rule has hitherto involved the analytical theory
 of curves, or else the theorem of Lagrange on the limits of
 Taylor's series.         It is desirable that this rule be stripped of
 its transcendental form, and be reduced to a level with the
 other general principles that now constitute the doctrine of
 numerical equations. It is the intention of the following proof
 to effect this object.
     Let a, b represent the numbers which bound the doubtful
 interval comprehending the two roots sought. We may con
 sider these numbers to be positive, giving rise to the following
 variations in the three final functions:—

If we wish to find integral equations of the first order, we
should have a perturbating function which will serve for two
at least of the three sets of equations (A.).
   My paper on M. Jacobi's Theory of Elliptic Functions,
printed in the Number of this Journal for the present month,
is not very intelligible.  I wish, therefore, to subjoin a few
words in the hope of making it plainer.     The expressions sin
a mn   w, cos a m n  w, mean sine of amplitude  of n w, cosine of
amplitude of n w. So also s a u, c a u mean sine and cosine of
the amplitude of u. They should have been printed thus:–
sin am n w, cos am n w, s a u, c a u. These faults run through
the paper. Moreover the a m and a for amplitude should not
have been in italics, as italics appear to denote quantity only.

             V. On the Sugar of the Eucalyptus.

INinVan   Diemen's Land a species of sugar or manna falls
      drops or rounded opaque tears from several species of
Eucalyptus.  This is collected in considerable quantity, but
it is doubtful still                  I
                          believe whether it is a natural exudation
of the trees from which it falls, or, like the different kinds of
honey-dew in our own country, is the consequence of punc
tures made by insects.
     I am indebted for a portion of this manna to Sir W.

This      fat

   For every 1000 lbs. of peas or beans the organism receives,

nothing, but only transforms                that

       must be evident to every unprejudiced person, that the
 fact mentioned in the preface has no necessary connexion
 with the discussion, concerning the production of fat, in the
 work itself, or in the appendix; it is not employed in the ar
gument.      While writing the preface, a friend of mine com
 municated to me the result of fattening geese with Indian
 corn. I found in the Jour. de Chim. Médicale, i. p. 353,
 an analysis of maize by Lespes, in which no trace of a fatty

 are such as naturally arose from oft-repeated visits to the
 various localities, and from a careful examination of their posi
 tion, formation, and general and particular features. Many
 hasty ideas had to be rejected as subsequent investigation
 proved them to be erroneous, and consulting writers was oft
 times rather a stumbling-block than a furtherance. However,
 several writers of late seem clearly to have pointed towards
 the truth, though they commonly appear to impute too much
 to any one cause. The following are the deductions which the
 writer feels at present warranted to make from his own per
sonal investigations.

That question has already been     partly  answered.      As the rock

          Geological Changes in the South          of Scotland.             33
wore down, the fragmentary       deposit behind becoming ex
posed to the current would be partly carried away, rolling the
boulders further along, and finally leaving them upon the
surface. At the same time it must be understood that they are
not confined to the surface alone, as they are plentifully found
at various depths.
   Such is that part of the phaenomena in question, which is
the most obvious, and which has been so frequently treated of
by various writers; but there are other appearances yet to be
noticed of an extremely interesting character, which, taken in
connection with the foregoing, seem to shed a ray of light
upon those long past revolutions of ancient time. In order to
point to those we must again ascend the hills, and draw atten
tion to the deeply engraved characters upon their rocky
shoulders.    We here in the first place allude to the terraces,
which in   many  places are so broad and well-defined upon the
hills in the district around Galashiels”. The writer has care
fully taken the level of those various shelves from hill to hill,
across valleys, &c., over a wide district, and has ascertained
beyond a doubt that they are correctly level or parallel in
elevation throughout.
   The cause is very obvious why those terraces have remained
so long undiscovered; their situation is very different from
those celebrated ones of Glen Roy; at the latter place they are
visible to the spectator for many miles along the steep grassy
banks of that Highland glen.      But here no such appearance
is presented to the eye, as we have no continued range of hills;
the highest are only a few insulated peaks, overtopping a
number of rounded and irregular undulating hills; it is only
upon some of the sides and projecting shoulders of these that
those terraces are to be seen.    He that would wish to survey
them, requires to provide himself with a proper levelling                   in
strument, and to travel patiently from hill to hill, and then,
but only then, will he be satisfied with the truth of our as
sertions: we proudly appeal to those faithful and enduring
 witnesses, whether for or against us.
    These terraces are not a single range but a series, extend
ing from the summit of the hill downward; they average 54
feet in perpendicular height one above another, some less and
others more. We assume each of those to have been success
ively the level of the ocean for an indefinite period of time.
We do not mean to state that the land had been raised 54 feet
at once by any sudden movement; but that during          eleva       its

tion it had been stationary at those levels for a longer period
than while it was emerging through the less-worn spaces be
tween. It is a remarkable feature in those terraces, that they
can scarcely be traced but upon the north and south project
ing shoulders of the hills, such as have been most exposed to
the sweeping currents from the west. The most distinguished
of those terraces is one upwards of 800 feet above the level of the
sea; as a great number of our lesser hills considerably exceed
that height, it might be expected to be pretty generally marked;
and not only is it so, but in a very remarkable degree.                                   Ac
cording to the situation of the hills, we have traced it from
where it was merely visible to where it was 300 feet broad; in
many places it exceeds 100 feet, and everywhere it seems
chiefly scooped out of the solid rock. As we ascend to the
 superior levels, the traces of each terrace become fewer and
 more distant as they overtop the hills; still upon some higher
 eminences they are very well defined, as for instance where
 they are so remarkable upon the north side of the Eildon hills.
 From the first-mentioned terrace downwards they become
 gradually less and less distinct, which is a further confirma
 tion of the theory in question, because the abrading action
 would become gradually less powerful as the land towards the
 west arose and checked the current.         Owing to the detached
 and rounded form of the hills, those shelves are nowhere of
 any great length; few of them exceed 300 yards, and many are
 not so much. However, upon Ruberslaw, a high conical hill
 about 6 miles west from the town of Jedburgh, there are two
 terraces upwards of 800 paces in length by 30 in breadth, and
 another 600 still broader.        These are very beautiful, and in
 some respects they are the finest in the district.      To the east
 is the  valley  of the   Rule,  and on the other side the ground
 rises to a high ridge, extending eastward to the town of                                 Jed
 burgh.      Near the north summit of this ridge, a finely marked
 terrace runs along                   its
                            whole length, which      about     mile,  is             1%

 litary exception; for wherever we have observed those mounds,
  they are always situated according to the natural declivity of
  the ground in the vicinity of elevated ranges, without regard
  to any direction.       We could direct attention to many more of
  a similar character, but as we have drawn out this paper to
  a greater length than was anticipated, we hasten to conclude
  as briefly as possible with a recapitulation of the principal
  points.
     When the summits of our hills were emerging out of the
  ocean, strong currents (perhaps periodically), accompanied
  with numerous floating icebergs, seem to have been furiously
  driven along, denuding their summits and sweeping the debris
  to the east, forming the beds of boulder clay commonly de
  nominated til; still as the land was upheaving and the higher
  peaks rising above the denuding action, the onward wave and
 ice, ever lashing against their western faces, rendering them
 bare and precipitous, and sweeping round their sides, cutting
 out the rocky terraces, grinding down and rounding over those
 saddle-backed ridges as they were raised to near the surface,
 while occasionally from some overhanging precipice masses of
 the rock would fall upon the ice, and be borne along with it until
 its floating raft gave way,            or
                                     until    was dashed from

 42               Mr. Martyn                  J. Roberts on             the    Analogy between
suffusion in the act of blushing was shown when the action was
viewed as analogous to or identical with electric phaenomena.
I  now proceed to consider this analogy as displayed in reflex
action, premising that at present the heads merely of the theory
are given, reserving for a future occasion the development of
the subject in                 its
                      fullest details. Theories are often condemned

the words          learned author: “Where definitive explanation

 pulsation of the heart, the action of the alimentary canal, the

     37. When speaking of these as “reflex actions,”                 do not                    I
 in  using their term follow the theories of either Prochaska or Dr.
 Marshall Hall*, who have classified these motions under this
 head: so far from agreeing with Dr. Marshall Hall in consi
 dering the spinal cord as the seat of the power of reflex action,
 I believe it merely closes the circuit of the nerves; and when we
 find reflex action suspended, from injury to the spinal cord, it
 is not that the seat of power has been destroyed, but that the
 closed circuit (as explained in sect. 34) has been broken, and
 that the spinal cord is not more essential than any other part
 of the circuit to the production of induced motion.
    38. A case of pure induction of one nerve upon another, and
 this attended with the peculiar phaenomena of an induced ac
 tion produced by the annihilation of the primary current (sect.
 33), may be shown by a simple experiment:—Place a piece of
zinc upon the tongue and a piece of silver between the upper
gums and the upper lip; turn the eyes towards a dark place;
then, while the metals are in this position, bring their contigu
 ous extremities together: at the moment of contact a bright
 momentary flash of light will be perceived; continue the con
 tact, and the sensation of light ceases; but separate the metals,
and now a bright flash of light is again perceived at the instant
of separation. Here then we have an excitement of the gusta
tory branch of the fifth pair which induces an action upon the
                         of all
optic nerve,        sensation      which appears in           light.    But    to   us   as
it   isworthy      observation, that this induced action           only                        is            at

though the contact         the metals     continued, and consequently
a   galvanic current           constantly circulating through this

quality will yield four gallons of oxygen gas, and that this is about
“the maximum obtainable quantity.”          But the author states that
 1638 grains of peroxide of manganese yield 200 grains of oxygen gas,
consequently 7000 grains, or one pound, will give 854 grains; then as
34°4 grains occupy 100 cubic inches, 854 grains will give 2482 cubic
inches, which divided by 2773, the cubic inches in a gallon will give
8% gallons of oxygen gas. Of course this is supposing the per
oxide of manganese to be pure; but even if the impurity amounts to
50 per cent., the quantity of oxygen will be greater than that stated
as the maximum obtainable from peroxide of “good quality.”
    Mr. Noad also states that the 1438 grains of oxide left after
heating 1638 grains of peroxide of manganese is “a mixture of 992
grains of deutoxide and 446 grains of protoxide of manganese.” The
fact however is that the 1438 grains are red oxide of manganese,
which are certainly equivalent to, but are not a mixture of, the two
oxides named, for deutoxide cannot exist at the temperature re
quisite to produce 1438 grains of red oxide from the stated quantity
of peroxide.
    Several errors occur in the author's statements respecting the
production of oxygen gas from chlorate of potash : we are informed
that half an ounce (218.75 grains) should yield 270 cubic inches of
oxygen gas, he having just before stated 1532 grains yield 600 grains
of oxygen, 218.75 therefore give 85-7 grains, measuring only 249
instead of 270 cubic inches.
    The following note on this subject at p. 144, exhibits an extraor
dinary degree of confusion of per-centage, weight and measure :—“I
find that the best chlorate of potash yields from 96 to 98 per cent.
of pure oxygen.”      For some time we were puzzled to attach any
meaning to this statement, but at length we concluded that the fol
lowing is what the author meant     :-"   I find that 100 grains of the
best chlorate of potash yield from 96 to 98 cubic inches of pure
oxygen gas.”
    Confusion of a somewhat similar kind, though not quite so glaring,
is observable in the following statement: “from an equivalent of
the oxide [of mercury] we get 100 grains, or nearly 300 cubic inches
of oxygen gas, and 1266 grains of mercury are found in the re
ceiver.”    It should have been stated that from 1366 grains, which
may be considered as representing an equivalent: but according to the
author's method equivalents are not relative merely, but absolute
weights.
    We had noted many other statements contained in this work for
observation, but the length to which this notice has extended pre
cludes our further proceeding.

quiries he obtained, through the favour of Colonel Colby, R.E., and
Lieut. Yelland, R.E., the able assistance of non-commissioned officers
and privates of the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners. He explains
in detail the nature of his observations, and the method he pursued
in constructing tables of mean results; and deduces from them the
conclusion, that the peculiarities in the tides which are the object of
his investigation are not dependent on any variations in the state of
the atmosphere, but are probably connected with the laws which
regulate the course of waves proceeding along canals.
   2. A paper was in part read, entitled, “On the Special Function of
the Skin.” By Robert Willis, M.D.         Communicated by John Bos

   March 9.-1. The reading of a paper, entitled, “On the Special
Function of the Skin.” By Robert Willis, M.D. Communicated
by John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
   The purpose which is answered in the animal economy by the cu
taneous exhalation has not hitherto been correctly assigned by phy
siologists: the author believes it to be simply the elimination from
the system of a certain quantity of pure water, and he considers that
the saline and other ingredients which pass off at the same time by the
skin are in too inconsiderable a quantity to deserve being taken into
account.     He combats by the following arguments the prevailing
opinion, that this function is specially designed to reduce or to regu
late the animal temperature.     It has been clearly shown by the ex
periments of Delaroche and Berger, that the power which animals
may possess of resisting the effects of a surrounding medium of high
temperature is far inferior to that which has been commonly ascribed
to them ; for in chambers heated to 120° or 130° Fahr., the tempe
rature of animals is soon raised to 11° or even 16° above what it had
been previously, and death speedily ensues.       The rapid diminution
or even total suppression of the cutaneous exhalation, on the other
hand, is by no means followed by a rise in the temperature of the
body.     In general dropsies, which are attended with a remarkable
diminution of this secretion, an icy coldness usually pervades both
the body and the limbs. A great fall in the animal temperature was
found by Fourcauld, Becquerel and Breschet to be the effect of
covering the body with a varnish impervious to perspiration; and
so serious was the general disturbance of the functions in these cir
cumstances, that death usually ensued in the course of three or four
                            -
hours.
   The question will next arise, how does it happen that health and
even life can be so immediately dependent as we find them to be on the
elimination of so small a quantity of water as thirty-three ounces from
the general surface of the body in the course of twenty-four hours?
To this the author answers, that such elimination is important as
securing the conditions which are necessary for the endosmotic trans
ference between arteries and veins of the fluids which minister to
nutrition and vital endowment. It is admitted by physiologists that
the blood, while still contained within   its  conducting channels, is

inert with reference to the body, no particle of which it can either
nourish or vivify until that portion of it which has been denomina
ted the plasma has transuded from the vessels and arrived in imme
diate contact with the particle that is to be nourished and vivified:
but no physiologist has yet pointed out the efficient cause of these
tendencies of the plasma, first, to transude through the wall of                                                          its
efferent vessels, and secondly,       find     way back again into the
                                                            to              its
afferent conduits.    The explanation given         the author     that,             by                    is             in
consequence                  of
                   the out-going current      blood circulating over the   of
entire superficies                 of
                        the body perpetually losing     quantity     water                a                    of
by  the action               of
                   the sudoriparous glands, the blood       the returning                       in
channels has thereby become more dense and inspissated, and                                                               is
brought into the condition for absorbing,            endosmosis, the fluid           by
perpetually exuding from the arteries, which are constantly kept                                                          on

different ways. By Hisinger, by Berzelius, and by Faraday it has
been ascribed to the liberation of hydrogen in this process: Davy and
others considered it as resulting directly from the attraction of the
 metal to the negative pole: and Daniell conceives that the metal [so
lution?] is directly electrolysed by the action of the voltaic circuit.
 The author found that the ends of copper wires, placed in a solution
 of sulphate of copper between two platina poles in the circuit, mani
 fest electric polarity; so that while one end is dissolving, the other
is receiving deposits of copper: he also found that platina was, in
 like manner, susceptible of polarity, although in a much less degree
 than copper, when placed in similar circumstances. With a view to
 determine the influence of nascent hydrogen in the voltaic reduc
 tion of metals, he impregnated pieces of coke and of porous char
 coal with hydrogen, by placing them, while in contact with a metal,
 in an acid solution, when they thus constituted the negative pole of
the circuit; and he found that the pieces thus charged readily re
 duced the metals of solutions into which they were immersed; and
 thence infers that the hydrogen is the agent in these reductions.
 From another set of experiments he concludes, that during these de
compositions, water is really formed at the negative pole; a circum
stance which he conceives is the chief source of the difficulties ex
perienced in electro-metallurgic operations when they are conducted
on a large scale, but which may be avoided by a particular mode of
arranging the elements of the circuit so as to ensure the uniform
diffusion of the salt.
    The author obtained the immediate reduction of gold, platina,
palladium, copper, silver and tin from their solutions by the agency
of hydrogen contained in a tube, with a piece of platinized platina in
contact with the metallic salt: nitric acid and persalts of iron, on the
other hand, yielded their oxygen by the influence of the same agent.
    The general conclusion which he deduces from his experiments is
that, when a metallic solution is subjected to voltaic action, water is
                                                                          at its

animal mechanism.             The grand organs of absorption the author
 believes to be the veins; and a principal object of his paper is to
point out the mode in which they acquire this remarkable faculty.
 The principal condition which this faculty of imbibition implies, is
a difference in density between the contents of the vessels which are
to absorb, and the contents of those which furnish the matter to be
absorbed.         If
                  the several constituent materials of the body, both fluid
and solid, were to remain in the same unaltered state, both chemi
cally and physically, there could be no interchange among them:
in order that mutual penetration may take place between two ele
ments, the one must differ from the other: that which is designed
to absorb must be, with relation to that which is to be absorbed,
more dense; that                    is,
                             must contain         smaller quantity   a      water                           of             in

   2. “Further Observations on the descending fluids of Plants, and
more especially the Cambium.”      By George Rainey, Esq. Commu
nicated   by P. M.  Roget, M.D.,  Sec. R.S.
   The author relates an experiment in proof of the sap descending
from the upper to the lower part of an exogenous tree, through vessels
which are continuous from the leaves to the roots; the course of
these vessels being shown by the addition of a solution of iodide of
potassium after they had taken up by absorption a quantity of a
solution of acetate of lead. The fluids in these vessels are, he con
ceives, separated from the sap, which is ascending from the roots,
only by the membrane of which they are composed. When the
leaf-buds of a tree are vegetating, large separations are observable
between the cells of the bark, and also between the bark and the
wood; while no such separations are apparent when the leaf-buds
are entirely inactive.    These separations are various in size, and
irregular in form; their parietes consist of rows of cells, piled up
one above another, like the bricks of a wall: and their cavities all
communicate with one another.        From these and other anatomical
facts, which are given in detail by the author, he concludes that the
propulsion of the sap along the vessels, resulting from the opera
tion of endosmose, will explain the descent of the cambium, which,
being the nutritious portion of the vegetable fluids, corresponds in
 itsnature  to the chyle    animals.

  The evening was one           uncommon serenity and beauty: the

far enough below the horizon       leave onlyto  faint glow  a  twilight      of

    P.S.—There having been no post today, and the above not having
been finished in time for despatch last night, an opportunity is af
forded me for stating that the phaenomenon above described has again
reappeared this evening, at the same hour and in the same situation,
or rather a very little more to the north, so as to graze and partly
to involve the stars k, A Leporis. It was also traceable in R. A.
some little way beyond those stars on the following side. The
horizon being more obscured by vapour tonight than last night,
neither y, 8, nor e Eridani could be seen.
    The fixity of this object among the stars on the 17th, induced me
to express to a member of my family this morning an idea that it
 might possibly be seen again tonight, in which event                 extra-at                           its
 mospheric origin would become quite evident.

Society of France, and Count Keyserling, was also commenced.
   April 20.—The reading of the Memoir on Russia commenced on
the 6th of April was resumed and concluded.
    With the exception of a sketch of the Ural Mountains, to be
given in a subsequent memoir, and of two short notices previously
read, on the Freezing Cave of Illetzkaya Zatchita, and on the
“Tchornoi Zem,” or Black Earth”, the following abstract contains
the chief results of a second examination of Russia in Europe.
Following the same method as in the account of their first ex
amination, the authors describe the depositary strata in ascending
order, successively adding to or correcting their previous know
ledge of each mass of deposits.
   Silurian Rocks.—The boundaries of these the most ancient fossil
iferous strata are more correctly defined than last year, and new
localities are cited. The lowest subdivisions of blue shale and un
gulite grit, which were previously spoken of in certain inland spots
only, are now described in the sea-cliffs of the Baltic between
Reval and Narva, as well as on the banks of the rivers Narva and
Luga, in which situations, as in the tracts S. and S.E. of St. Peters
burgh, they constitute the inferior masses or representatives of the
Lower Silurian Rocks.
   The Upper Silurian Rocks, chiefly composed of thin-bedded lime
stone, occupy the summits of the coast-cliffs in question, and the
platform on which the river Narva flows from the lake Peicpus to a
chasm worn by         its
                   own action, where    constitutes the picturesque

                                Narva.         Itbelieved

                                                                 the authors that
 this water-fall has receded (like those                 of
                                                    Niagara,        America, and  in
 other places,)   in consequence          of
                                           asolid tabular rock overlying less
 coherent strata, which have been undermined and have occasioned
 the subsidence       ofthe superior layers.                  In
                                                         addition, however,                         to
 these  conditions,  the  wearing      away     of
                                                the vertical cliffs     the Baltic     of
and the retrocession         of
                              the falls     the Narva, are supposed, by the
                                           of
 authors,   to have been accelerated            by
                                                another cause, viz. the direc
tion  of  the  symmetrical      joints     the overlying limestone.

joints present    a number        of of
                                   salient and re-entering angles which are
exposed    on  the surface        the impending cliffs, and when the softer
supporting strata have been partially excavated, the dividing lines
of   these natural joints facilitate the fall             of
                                                      the calcareous beds into
 the abyss below.

          Second Geological Survey                of Russia in          Europe.        59
formation. In this limestone fifteen species of fossils were observed,
including Pentameri, Terebratulae, and Orthidae; and it is considered
to be the representative of a calcareous rock which ranges to the
north of Dörpat and Weissenstein, and is known at Oberpahlen, &c.
Notwithstanding their almost perfectly horizontal position, the strata
in the Baltic provinces of Russia indicate most clearly a passage from
a lower horizon on the north to a higher on the south, where they
are surmounted by the Devonian system.
   In announcing a large accession of Silurian fossils to their former
lists, the authors advert to the labours of Professor Eichwald,
who after a personal examination of the coast-cliffs and of the
Isle of Dago, has been sedulously occupied in describing many new
species. They also dwell upon the important addition to their
knowledge of new forms contributed by Dr. Wörth, the secretary
of the Imperial Academy of Mineralogy, forms which they purpose
to figure and describe in the course of the ensuing winter; and they
acknowledge their obligations to Colonel Helmersen and the officers
of the School of Mines, for aiding them in their acquisition of fresh
knowledge concerning the contents of these the most ancient de
posits of the Russian empire. . In their tabular list of fossils the
authors give the following as characteristic    and          of,
                                                       part peculiar     in

         shells characteristic   of South Devon, the Boulonnais, and the
  ifel   #.
   Carboniferous Limestone and Coal.—The lowest beds of the car
boniferous system in Russia are, as stated in our first abstract (Phil.
Mag. S. 3. vol. xix. p. 493), sands and shale with thin seams of coal,
Stigmaria ficoides, &c. The authors examined a considerable tract
occupied by these beds to the south of Tula and Kaluga, where man
additional natural outcrops have been discovered by Colonel Olivieri,
the mineral having the lignite or impure character of the beds of coal
described last year in a similar position in the Waldai Hills.   These
strata are, the authors conceive, of the same geological age as those
of the great productive coal-field of Berwickshire, which equally
underlies the mountain limestone.
   By their recent labours the authors have divided the carbonife
rous limestone of Russia into three members. The lowest of these,
generally a dark-coloured rock, is characterized by the presence of
Productus gigantens and P. Waldaicus (near to P. anomala, Sowerby,
&c.). The central mass is the well-known white limestone of Mos
cow, containing Spirifer Mosquensis, S. resupinatus, S. glaber, the
Chaetetes radians, Euomphalus pentangulatus, and many other fossils,
some of which (such as Productus antiquatus, P. comoides) are found
 also in the lower division.      Beds of compact, yellow, magnesian
 limestone occur in this central part of the carboniferous system, as
 well as bands of red and greenish shale or marl, and thin beds of
 pure siliceous flint graduating into ordinary limestone chert.
    The third calcareous division is one which is not seen in the Wal
 dai or Moscow district, but which seems to surmount the before
 mentioned divisions on their eastern flank at Velikovo and Kosrof,
 on the river Kliasma.        Again, the lofty cliffs which occupy the
 banks of the Volga between Stavropol and Samara are almost ex
 clusively composed of this member of the carboniferous limestone,
 which is there made up of myriads of Fusulinae (the fossil bodies
 mentioned by Pallas as resembling grains of wheat), associated
 with Euomphalus pentangulatus, Cyathophylli, &c.
    In a part of the coal region between the Dnieper and the Don,
 the authors detected a band of this fusulina limestone, in the same
 relative position which had been assigned to it in other parts of
 Russia, namely, in the upper part of the calcareous strata.
    Carboniferous Region between the Dnieper and the Don, or Coal
field of the Donetz.-Whilst the central member of the carbonife
 rous limestone of the northern parts of Russia (Moscow basin) con
 tains no coal, and the upper beds on the Volga are equally void of
it,

               Second Geological Survey                       of   Russia in Europe.                                 63
sandstone, forming the base of the carboniferous system, through
various bands of limestone, alternating with many courses of sand
stone and shale with numerous seams of coal.
   In this wide carbonaceous tract, coal is extracted by the impe
rial government at two spots only. These pits were first opened in
the last century, by Mr. Gascoigne and a small company of English
miners, formerly employed by the Russian government.        The shaft
section at Lissitchi Balka, the chief of these places, and situated to
the north of the iron foundries of Lugan and to the east-north-east
of Bachmuth, clearly shows that       the best seams    all

                              Russia which occupy so vast a region to
the east of the river Volga, i.e. in the governments of Kasan, Wiatka,
Perm and Orenburg, are composed of white limestone with gypsum,
red and green grits with shales and copper ores, magnesian lime
stones, marl-stones, small conglomerates, red and green sandstones,
&c. By examining numerous natural sections between the neigh
bourhood of Sviask, Kasan, and Samara, upon the west, and the
carboniferous limestone on the edge of the Ural mountains on the
east, the authors have come to the conclusion, that however the
lithological sequence may vary in different tracts, the whole of the
vast region alluded to is occupied by deposits which belong to one
class or zoological system of deposits. Thus, though the limestones
are sometimes white, sometimes yellow and pure magnesian, and
                                                                      all

            Second Geological Survey                     of Russia in Europe.                      67
times upon an adjacent peat bog in North Wales specially affected
 and impregnated the vegetable fibre in preference to the accom
panying soil, so is it conceived that the forests washed into the sea
in which the Permian deposits were accumulated, attracted around
them the cupriferous matter contained in the transporting currents.
This point will be reverted to in the subsequent sketch of the Ural
 mountains.                            -
   The general succession of these Permian deposits is then described
on several parallels of latitude between the Ural and the Volga, and
also their outliers in the steppe between Orenburg and Sarepta;
and it is shown, that this vastly extended and diversified system,
containing not only copper deposits but also large masses of gyp
sum, rock-salt and copious salt-springs, lies in an enormous trough
bounded on the north and east, and south-west, by the carbonife
rous limestone on which it reposes.
   By their examination during the past year, the authors have
cleared away some difficulties which obscured their former views.
 By reference to the abstract of their first memoir (vol. xix. p. 492), it
will be seen, that they considered (though, with much hesitation)
certain limestones and beds of gypsum which occupy cliffs upon the
Dwina to the south of Archangel, and extend to Pinega and to
wards Ust Vaga, to be upper members of the carboniferous lime
stone.     By a comparison of the Producti and other fossils, and
the great masses of gypsum which they contain, these northern
beds are now brought into direct identification with the true Per
mian or Zechstein deposits.         In the south-western termination
of this vast basin near Samara, the Permian rocks, particularly
at Usolie, rest in patches of a dolomitic conglomerate upon the
steep escarpments of the carboniferous limestone, out of the mate
rials of which they have been formed, and do not present that
regular succession which they exhibit when followed westwards
from the slopes of the Ural chain.       It is also observed, that though
gently undulating or horizontal over                          all
                                                the lower regions, these
rocks,     on

 68               Geological Society:  Mr. Murchison's
 Orenburg, is subordinate to this system, in which indeed the great
 est saline springs of Russia occur.
     Red Sandstone, Marl, &c.—It is with hesitation that the authors
 make any separation between the Permian deposits and certain
 red and green sandstones, marls, marlstones and tufaceous lime
 stones, which occupy the central parts of the great trough above
 described; still less can they strictly identify them with the bunter
 sandstein, new red or trias of West Europe.
     It is however a fact, that the Permian rocks with their peculiar
 fossils are seen near Sviask, on the west of Cazan, to pass under
 red and green marls and impure limestones, which extend over a
 wide region by Nijny Novogorod, Juriavetz and Viasniki on the
 west, and to Totma and Ustiug on the north.         In no part of the
 region so defined (and most of which the authors examined on a
 previous occasion), have any fossils typical of the Permian age been
 discovered, though the deposits in question abound in limestones
 generally of a tufaceous character.     The gypsum which occurs in
 this member, differs from the massive white alabaster of the inferior
 rocks, and is usually in the form of small concretions of fibrous
 structure, often of brownish and pinkish colours.        At only Vias
 niki on the Kliasma could the authors detect any traces of fos
 sils, and these are minute Cyprida, associated with apparently flat
 tened Cyclades 2 which are imbedded in blood-red marl.             The
 thick cover of detritus which is spread over a very large area, ob
 scures the junction of these red deposits with the eastern edges of
 the carboniferous limestone of the Moscow and northern regions.
 Whatever may be the precise age of the uppermost beds of these
 red deposits in reference to other strata in Europe, it is clear that
 a considerable portion of the full geological succession is wanting
in Russia, for in various points upon the Volga, Jurassic shales are
 seen to repose on the denuded surface of these red deposits.
     Jurassic System.—In the sketch resulting from their survey in 1840
 (vol. xix. p. 495), Mr. Murchison and M. de Verneuil were dis
 posed to view certain deposits of shale and sand with concretions,
which in some places overlie the last-mentioned red deposits, and
in others rest at once on the carboniferous limestone, as the equiva
lents of the lias and lower oolites. This opinion is now modified, a
more extensive survey having led to the belief that true lias does
not exist in Russia; but that the shale beds in question, whether
studied in sections on the Moskwa near Moscow, on the Volga be
tween Kostroma and Jurievetz, or at numerous localities in the go
vernments of Simbirsk, Saratofand Tambof, are truly the equivalents
of the strata from the inferior oolite to the Kimmeridge clay, in
clusive, of English geologists.
    It is this Jurassic group which is traceable at intervals so far to
the   north-east,  and which has been found by Capt. Strajesski as far
as even 65° N. lat. on the eastern flanks of the Ural chain.
    The upper members of the Jurassic system, as exhibited in the
South of Russia, near Izium, where they were first recognised by
Major Blöde, differ both lithologically and zoologically from the

            Second Geological Survey                            of Russia in              Europe.                    69
dark shales and sands of the northern and central regions.           They
are chiefly light-coloured limestones and marls, and are charged
 with large Ammonites resembling those of the Portland rock with
 Trigonia clavellata, Nerinea, and other types closely allied to those
which occur in the upper oolites of Great Britain and the Continent.
   Cretaceous System.—This system is very considerably developed
in the central and southern tracts of Russia.     In the government of
Simbirsk, where it has been closely studied and          fossils carefully              its
collected      by
               M. Jasikof,    surmounts the Jurassic series, and the
                                         it
same order may        seen    be
                               the governments
                                            in      Sarátof and        the      of                            on
banks of the Donetz near Izium.
   Though the lithological sequence                              of
                                            the strata differs from that
   the British Isles, the system,       whole, bears striking analogies

white chalk, the authors observed, particularly between Sarátof
and Tzaritzin, many beds                    of
                               marl and siliceous clay-stone,    which                                  in
bodies like Alcyonia were prevalent, and         Kursk they found that    at

the white chalk contained      Belemnite,   a well                   as

Montperoux, Major Blöde, and others.        Distinctions are, however,
drawn between the more ancient tertiary strata, such as those of
Antipofka and other places, and the recent Caspian shelly sands
which cover the Steppes, the former having constituted a portion of
the ancient shores of a more widely spread Caspian sea.        The au
thors also entirely discard from residuary phaenomena due to the
presence and retirement of these Caspian waters, the existence of
certain great subterranean masses of rock-salt and salt-springs which
issue from the bowels of the earth, both of which have their seat in
purely marine deposits of much higher antiquity, chiefly Permian,
and which can never be referred to the desiccation of comparatively
modern, brackish, inland seas.
   The pliocene and post-pliocene strata, occupy a very large region
in Southern Russia. The inferior division of this group is well ex
posed in the lowest part of the cliffs at Taganrog, on the sea of Azof,
where beds of white and yellow limestone contain several species of
Cardium, a Buccinum and large Mactræ,             marine origin. The           all   of

that such blocks were transported to their present positions by huge
floating icebergs, arrested, in some instances, by rising grounds and
hills at the bottom of the then sea, and in others permitted to ad
vance further south by longitudinal depressions, which are traceable
in the present configuration of the land. Proofs are given that in

having been made to form melon by heating together bicyanide of
mercury and sulphur, it appeared that melon was formed, but was
with difficulty separated from the sulphuret of mercury which accom
panied it; but as the presence of the sulphuret of mercury does not
interfere with the formation of aethogen from a mixture of melon
and boracic acid, that substance may be obtained by simply heat
ing together 5 parts of sulphur, 58 of bicyanide of mercury and
7 of anhydrous boracic acid, or by heating together sulphocyano
gen and boracic acid.         Having an easy process for preparing aetho
gen, it was advisable in the next place to have a more ready method
of forming the aethonides than that of heating together aethogen and
the metals, which is a long and uncertain process, and an attempt
was made to form aethonides by heating aethogen with the sulphurets
of the metals.       As might be expected from the stability of aethogen
and       its
           strong  affinity for the metals, the aethogen directly displaced
the   sulphur   and formed the aethonide.        Upon further experiment                                           it
was    proved   that the aethonides     might      made      heating sulphur,

  With   the view    ascertaining the quantity

                                      of
following experiments                         on

    The subjects of experiment were confined in an air-tight box,
 wherein they were perfectly at their ease, being enabled to speak,
 eat, sleep, or read without inconvenience; a constant current of at
 mospheric air was admitted into the box, and the deteriorated gases
 abstracted by means of an air-pump.         The air withdrawn was con
 ducted into a proper arrangement of bottles, some containing sul
 phuric acid, others a solution of caustic potash. The quantity of
 carbonic acid, both previous to and subsequent to each operation, was
 carefully ascertained, by being received into three graduated tubes.
   The results were as follows:—
    1st. The Professor himself, aged thirty-five years, exhaled 219
grammes * during twenty-four hours, seven of which were spent in
sleep.                                     *
   2nd. A soldier, twenty-eight years of age, exhaled 239:728
grammes = 8:45 oz.
    3rd. A lad of sixteen, 224-379 grammes = 7-9 oz.
    4th. A young woman, aged nineteen, 165-347 grammes=5'83 oz.
    5th. A boy nine years and a half old, 133 126 grammes = 4.69 oz.
   6th. A girl of ten, 125:42 grammes = 4:42 oz.
    In the two last cases the period allotted to sleep was nine hours.
   From these experiments the Professor deduces that males exhale
more carbonic acid than females, and children comparatively more
than adults.     He also finds that less of this gas is given off during
the  night  than during the day; and that in certain cases of disease,
which he does not specify, less carbonic acid is formed than during
the healthy state. He is thence induced to hope that attention to
this point may ultimately throw some light on certain forms of
disease.
   It will be interesting to compare these results with Liebig's views,
as well as with the experiments which have recently emanated from
the French Académie des Sciences.

to be augmented in numbers and influence by the election of new
Members, and has been well supported by contributions of original
papers read at its meetings. The papers presented appear to                                      in
crease both in number and value; and any apprehension of a want
of papers, which formerly existed, has been in a great measure dis
pelled by the experience of the last Session.         It is now sufficiently
evident that    ample   materials exist in   England    for a Chemical So
ciety, and you have furnished unquestionable proofs of the utility of
such a Society in its power to advance the cultivation of chemical
research in the country.
    Thirty-one Members have been elected into the Society since the
last Anniversary.      Our present numbers are—77 Members resident
in   London,   57 Members resident in the country, or “non-resident”
Members, 10 Associates, and 3 Foreign Members, making a total of
 147 Members, with an annual income of £211.

the Proceedings of the remaining 21. These communications are
the fruit of numerous and varied inquiries, and form, in the opinion
of the Council, a contribution of some importance to the progress of
the science. The Council would refer in particular to the full ex
amination and discussion which the process of MM. Will and Var
rentrapp for the determination of nitrogen has received by the ex
periments of Mr. Francis and Dr. Fownes, and more lately in Dr.
Will's own comprehensive memoir;-to the series of useful papers
on astringent substances, which they owe to their valuable con
tributor Dr. Stenhouse; and to the papers on various subjects con
nected with the metals and the salts by Professors Liebig and Gre
gory, Messrs. Porrett, Croft, Cock, Balmain and Warington, and
on organic substances by Professors Liebig, Johnston, Everitt, Drs.
Playfair and Fownes; on agricultural subjects by Dr. Schweitzer
and Mr. Chatterley; on voltaic electricity by Mr. Arrott, and on the
heat disengaged in combinations by the President.           The Council
still presses upon these and other contributors not to relax their ex
ertions, and invites the Members generally to communicate the re
sults of their inquiries.
     The Society has also received presents of interesting chemical
products and crystalline specimens for their collection from various
donors, particularly Mr. Warington and Professor Liebig.            They
have also received several chemical works from their respective
authors.     The Council call attention to this nucleus of a collection
 which has been formed, and which they hope will be rapidly            in
 creased by the exertions and liberality of the Members.
     The Council has also lately made arrangements for procuring the
 leading chemical Journals and circulating them among the Members.
     The condition of the Society's finances is highly favourable.
     The following gentlemen were elected as Officers and Council for
the ensuing year —

     The thanks of the Society were given to the Officers and Council
 for their exertions during the past year.
     April 4.—The following communications were then read:—
     76. “On the Subsulphates of Copper,” by J. Denham Smith,
 Esq.
     }.   “On   the Spontaneous Decomposition of the Chlorate of     Am
 monia,” by    Mr. Joseph Wonfor.
     Having occasion lately to prepare  a quantity of this salt, the phae

nomena which              form the subject       of this communication                        were          ob
served.
  The salt was prepared by adding to a saturated boiling solution
of bitartrate of ammonia a saturated boiling solution of chlorate of
potassa, the liquor being strained from the precipitated cream of
tartar and cooled as rapidly as possible, it being observed that the
ammoniacal salt underwent a change if allowed to remain at a high
temperature for any length of time; the solution was then care
fully evaporated at a temperature below 100° Fahr., and again
strained from a small portion of cream of tartar which separated as
the liquor was concentrated.          The chlorate of ammonia crystallizes
in small acicular crystals, or in plates similar to the chlorate of po
tassa.    The crystals are very soluble both in water and alcohol, and
have a sharp cooling taste.
    This salt was partially examined by Vauquelin, but he does not
appear to have observed the change it undergoes at the ordinary
temperature of the atmosphere, which most likely arose from his
using the salt immediately after it was prepared.

 nected with a vessel containing a solution of nitrate of silver, through
which the products of the decomposition had to pass, the unab
 sorbed gases being collected in a jar at the pneumatic trough, hoping
 to collect the gases as they were liberated.             After gaseous matter
had been    quietly   evolved for twelve     hours,  it exploded  with greater
violence than    before,   no portion    of the bottle  remaining  (except the
neck)   larger  than a   pea.   A   quantity   of chloride of silver had pre
cipitated from the nitrate, and the gas jar contained free nitrogen.
Another portion of the salt was then placed on a sand-bath, the
temperature of which was about 120° Fahr. ; this soon underwent
decomposition, but only detonated slightly, giving off dense white
fumes, with the smell of nitrous acid.
    Finding the salt was so easily decomposed, I proceeded to ex
amine more closely the nature of the changes that took place.               20
grains of the salt were introduced into a strong flask, connected, as
in the previous experiment, with a vessel containing solution of           ni
trate of silver, but with the mercurial instead of the pneumatic
trough; the flask was then very carefully warmed by a spirit-lamp;
the salt instantly exploded with great violence and a loud detonation,
breaking the flask to atoms. Five grains of the salt were then ope
rated upon, without the vessel containing the solution of the silver
salt, and the products of the decomposition collected over mercury;
they were nitrogen, chlorine, nitrous acid and water, with a little
chloride of ammonium; but from the rapidity with which the gases
were eliminated, it was impossible to collect the whole of the pro
ducts of the decomposition, though the experiments were repeated
six or seven times, both with and without the vessel containing the
solution of nitrate of silver.      When five grains of the salt were em
ployed, the tubes (which were filled with mercury when no salt of
silver was used) were not broken; still the action was so energetic
that it did not allow of accurate indications of the quantity of the
gases evolved being obtained.
   From the presence of free nitrogen and chlorine, both in the pro
ducts of the spontaneous and produced decomposition, I am led to
conclude that chloride of nitrogen is formed; but as the whole of
the products were in no case obtained, it was impossible to deter
mine this experimentally.

     NEW ANALYSES OF THE CYMO PHANE (chrysoberyl) OF

ACTION OF NITRIC ACID ON CARBONATE OF LIME.             BY M. BAR

    It   is   generally admitted                     by   chemists            as   a   fact, that marble                    is   not

                                           Meteorological                       Observations.                                                         79
 acted upon by nitric acid of the greatest density.        M. Barreswil,
 desirous of ascertaining whether this anomaly was due to the same
 want of action of this acid on certain metals, kept a piece of marble
 in concentrated nitric acid, and it was not visibly acted upon. It
 was then removed from the acid, washed, dried and powdered, and
 the powder was put into fresh concentrated acid ; it was strongly
 acted upon, but not entirely dissolved.       A little water was then
 added to the acid, the reaction again took place, and after some time
 ceased, but recommenced on the addition of more water. It may be
concluded from these facts that marble is attacked by concentrated
 nitric acid with energy proportional to     surface, becoming covered                  its
 with     avarnish of nitrate of lime insoluble      concentrated nitric                               in
 acid.    This nitrate    lime concentrates the nitric acid

garden, also, there is a specimen of the Dammara orientalis,
from which the dammara resin previously described by che
mical writers is probably derived”; and on the stem of this
species I have also observed unequivocal proofs of the pre
sence of a resin.      The cowdie resin occurs in large masses,
from the size of the fist to a much greater magnitude.               It is
transparent when freshly fractured; but as it comes from New
Zealand, generally it is slightly opalescent, a character which is
said to be produced by the action of water or moisture. The
colour of the resin is light amber. It is easily fused, and then
emits a resinous or turpentine odour. A small portion of the
resin dissolves in weak alcohol, but the greater part remains
insoluble.    The solution in alcohol evolves the smell of tur
pentine.    The resin, when agitated with hot absolute alcohol,
forms a fine varnish.       A similar result follows its treatment
with    oil   turpentine, which might
              of                                found valuable   be    the                       in

according       their characters, acid and neutral resins. The

there remains        white resin, which

  The influence of heat may hence account in some degree for
the more rapid formation of resins from oils of the turpentine
type in warm countries, and also for the greater solidity which
resins acquire than in the more temperate latitudes,
                                             Dammarol.
     When the dammara resin is exposed to     a carefully regu
lated  temperature it  melts, and  heavy  vapours  arise, which
gradually and slowly pass over and condense in the form of
a fine amber-coloured oil swimming on the surface of water;
hence by this treatment the resin is resolved into an oil, which
may be termed dammarol, and water.          By evaporation at
300° the water is dissipated and the     remains.        boils     oil                    It            at

88       Dr. R. D. Thomson       on the Cowdie    Pine Resin.
shows that two atoms of carbonic acid and one of water have
been removed by the action of the lime.          That carbonic acid
is fixed  by the lime,  is proved  by the effervescence which takes
place when acid is poured on the residue in the retort.
    Dr. French of London, in his “Art of Distillation,’ pub
lished in 1664, was aware that by means of lime, oils might
be extracted from “resins, gums, fat and oily things.”          To
obtain them, he directs 1 lb. of any of these to be distilled with
3 lbs. of the powder of tiles or unslaked lime. I have not been
able to find any notice of these facts in Glauber or any ante
rior writer.
    The preceding experiments assist in carrying out certain
generalizations which had been deduced from a limited
series of data, and serve to confirm the idea of the analogy of
the resins, and of their derivation from an oil of the turpen
tine type.     The resins perhaps are more interesting to the
chemist than at first appears, from their analogy to other
bodies of vegetable and animal origin. . Whether their basic
oils are derived from the deoxidation of other bodies in plants
supplied with a larger amount of oxygen, or are formed           di
rectly from their gaseous constituents, is a subject for inquiry.
 If it be true that plants evolve no heat (although it is not easy
 to comprehend how gases can be condensed without such a
disengagement), then it would appear that no combination of
carbon and oxygen, no proper combustion, such as occurs
in the animal system, takes place in plants; and hence it
would follow that the essential oils are formed directly from
 their elementary constituents. But the statement (Brongniart)
which has been made that plants evolve heat in fertilization,
 that oxygen is absorbed and carbonic acid given out, would
appear to favour the idea that combustion can occur in plants
as well as in animals.      The admission of the operation of this
process in plants, would throw much light on the following
table, representing a descending series, with the exception of
the first, into which some bodies of animal origin are intro
duced for the sake of comparison.

   In reference to the preceding table, the analogies of starch,
gum and sugar are sufficiently familiar, both in the artificial
processes, by which the former may be transformed into the
latter, and in the changes produced by vegetation. The con
version of sugar and honey into wax by bees was long ago
shown by Huber, and has lately been brought forward with
happy effect by Liebig, in evidence of the part which the sac
charine class of bodies performs in the respiratory oeconomy.
The intermediate position which fat holds between sugar and
wax would seem to point to it as a stage in the process of re
duction. The analogy between wax and cholesterin is suffi
ciently striking as products of reduction from an amylaceous
or saccharine base; and this idea has been strengthened by
the circumstance of my having obtained from the latter bodies
bearing a close analogy to the turpentine and naphtha type,
while the opinion has gained support, which       entertain, that             I
cholesterin is the wax of mammiferous animals.      The corre
spondence of resins to these bodies is sufficiently apparent.

occasioned this      delay  in noticing his remarks of the 13th of
April ult. (inserted in the Number for May, p. 358) on a for
mer paper of mine. With respect to the second form of w, he
says, that I by no means show that Jacobi's formulae fail, but
rather confirm them.         Now I did not say that they failed for
it, but only that they were reducible till         disappeared, and     it
that with      their second members were

   These formulae, therefore, by suitable values of u, are con
structed to fulfil the conditions s a v = 0, c a v = + 1, and
also s a v = + 1, c a v = 0.      And it must be possible to
satisfy them both.     For at page 40, in deriving the value of
y=    s a v from that of 1                           –
                               y, Jacobi finds y = 0 when u = 0,
2 w,  &c. And at      page   41,  in finding the value of M, he
makes a = s a u =      1,  y = 1. Also the values of A and of
1 + A y depend on those of M and of y.          Both these condi
tions therefore are at the   very   foundation of Jacobi's theory.
   He also makes      u,  u + 2    w,  &c., and even 0, 2 w, 4 w,

XV.    Additional Objections to Redfield's Theory of Storms.
    By Robert HARE, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the
     University            of Pennsylvania”.
            a communication to the London and Edinburgh Ma
50.
         INgazine and Journal of Science for December 1841, I
endeavoured to point out various errors and inconsistencies in
the theory of storms proposed by Mr. Redfield, or in the rea
soning and assumed scientific principles on which that theory had
been advanced. Of these errors I will presenta brief summary.
    51.       I
           conceive that Mr. Redfield has erred in ascribing
atmospheric currents, whether constituting trade winds or
storms of any kind, “solely to mechanical gravitation as con
nected with the rotatory and orbitual motion of the eartht.”
    52. In ascribing those atmospheric gyrations, of which ac
cording to his hypothesis                 storms consist,    all  “opposing                          to
and     unequal    forces,”   without    specifying      the nature         ac                                 or
counting for the existence             these forces, although implying
                                                        of
that they originate

                              above mentioned.
    53.      assigning

                                  fluid matter tendency             “run into                        to

gyration. Being under the impression, that in many instances
no better answer need be given to Mr. Redfield's opinions than
that created in the minds of scientific readers by his own lan
guage, I will here quote his denunciation of the opinions of
the meteorological school and of Herschel.
   60. “The grand error into which the whole school of me
teorologists appear to have fallen, consists in ascribing to heat
and rarefaction the origin and support of the great atmospheric
currents which are found to prevail over a great portion of
the globe.     * * * An adequate and undeniable cause for
the production   of the phaenomena + + I consider is furnished
in the rotative motion of the earth upon        axis,    which ori     its                in

oceans     fluid and aerial matter, which rest upon the earth's
             of
crust, producing                  of
                       necessity those great currents     which we                         to
have alluded.”—(See Silliman's Journal, vol. xxviii.          316.)                             p.
Speaking           of
              Sir John Herschel's   explanation    the trade winds           of
and others, Mr. Redfield alleges, “Sir John has however
erred, like his predecessors,        ascribing mainly,in   not pri                         if
marily,       to
            heat and rarefaction those results which should have

presented by Mr. Redfield as having upon the atmosphere an
opposite effect.
   63. But notwithstanding the opinions expressed in the pa
ragraphs above quoted, and in the following, Mr. Redfield
         in his reply to my objections, that it is an error to con
sider him as rejecting the influence of heat. It is very possible
that his opinions may have changed since he read my “objec
tions;” but that he did reject the influence of heat when the
preceding and following opinions were published must be quite
evident.      “Were it possible to preserve the atmosphere in a
uniform temperature           allover the surface         of
                                                          the globe, the
general winds would not             beless brisk than      atpresent, but
would     be more constant and uniform than ever.”—(Silliman's
Journal, vol. xxviii.       p.318.)
   64. Mr. Redfield alleges that the proper inquiry                   What  is,
are storms      ?not How are storms produced? And yet                   will      it
 be  found that his     great  object  has been    to
                                                    show that    they  arise
from gyration caused           by

explicable mode by gravitation and the complicated motions
of  our planet. But suppose that before ascertaining how fire                           is
produced, chemists had waited for             an answer       the question

therefore blame Mr. Redfield for pursuing both inquiries                                si

96                Dr. Hare's Additional            Objections to

task.
    66. Speaking of the trade winds and monsoons, our author
states, “It   is to the operation and effect of these great and
regular moving masses, that we are disposed mainly to ascribe
the more active and striking meteorological phaenomena of
every latitude.” And again,              “At
                                         these seasons the northern
margin or parallels of the trade winds sweeping towards the
gulf, must necessarily come in collision with the great archi
pelago of islands which skirt the Carribean Sea; * * *
 (Silliman's Journal, vol.xx. p. 31,) the obstruction which they
afford produces a constant tendency to circular evolution.
* * * These masses of atmosphere thus set into active re
volution continue to sweep along the islands with increased
rapidity of gyration until they impinge upon the American
coast.”    “We have assumed that the leading storms of the
northern and western Atlantic and the American coast originate
in detached and gyrating portions of the northern margin of
the trade winds, occasioned by the oblique obstruction which
is opposed by the islands to the direct progress of this part
of the trade, or to the falling of the northerly and eddy wind
upon the trade, or to these causes combined.”—(Silliman's
Journal, vol. xx. p. 48.)
    67. I trust it will be sufficiently evident, that although great
and regularly moving masses of air, by encountering obstruc
 tions, may undergo a transient deflection, and that a portion

accidentally caught in a strait with high cliffs on either side
might, like the tide in the Bay of             , acquire a local and
temporary acceleration, yet that it would be utterly impossible
for a durable whirlwind to be thus excited. Obviously for the
endurance of a whirl, if not for    production, the continuous
                                             its
application   of   least two forces would
                   at                                  be

one must be endowed with            centripetal efficacy

counteract the concomitant centrifugal momentum.                   will        It
 be  evident that although        local obstruction may cause
                                     a                                                  an
eddy  or  whirl    in vicinity, the rotary momentum thus created
                        its

                    Redfield's Theory of Storms.                99
   77. Considering the inconsistencies of Mr. Redfield’s     “re
liable facts and observations,” I hope I may be allowed to
show what ought to ensue according to his own premises.
Evidently in a whirlwind, constituted as are those to which
we have reference, the centrifugal force will cause an accumu
lation of air towards the exterior until the otherwise uncoun
 teracted pressure of the accumulation, tending to restore the
 level, is in equilibrio with the centrifugal force.    Moreover,
 the reaction of the fluid lying in the same plane beyond the
 whirl, will cause the fluid to be higher, or if elastic, denser at
 an intermediate point than the general level.      In the case of
 an elastic fluid like the air, condensation will be substituted
 for accumulation, and will amount to the same thing in effect.
 It would follow, that as the whirl should advance, the baro
 meter would rise until the front limb of the zone of greatest
 condensation should arrive; subsequently it would fall till the
 central space should arrive, and then another rise and subse
 quent fall would ensue during the approach and departure of
 the rear limb of the zone of greatest condensation.
     78. One fact is mentioned among the contradictory evidence
 above quoted, which seems to be supported by universal ex
 perience.    The barometrical column does fall at the com
 mencement of a storm, and of course this fact does not accord
 with the idea that storms are whirlwinds produced by me
 chanical forces remote from the axis and attended necessarily
 by a centrifugal action which would accumulate the air to
 wards the exterior.
     79. Respecting another characteristic, the “reliable facts
 and observations of our theorist” are no less irreconcilable than
  in the case last considered.  I allude to the changes in the di
\rection of the wind which ensue from the commencement to
  the end of a hurricane, and especially on the outer limbs on
 each side of the line of progression.
     80. Thus, speaking of the progress of a storm from south
  west to north-east along the coast of the United States, he  al
  leges that “along the central portions of the track the first
  force of the wind is from a point near south-east, but after
  blowing for a certain period it changes suddenly, and usually,
  after a short intermission, to a point nearly or directly op
  posite to that from which it has previously been blowing; from
  which opposite quarter it blows with equal violence till the
  storm has passed over or abated.” Again,         “It   is demon
  strably evident, that at any point over which the centre of a
   whirlwind may pass, the wind must suddenly change to a      di

portion of an extensive storm passes over or near the point of
observation, that the comparative calm, or lull which prevails
about the apparent centre of rotation is preceded by a gradual
rather than a sudden abatement of the wind.” “Every expe
rienced navigator will shrink with instinctive apprehension
from the very idea of those moments of awful stillness which
place him in the central vortex of the hurricane.” (Franklin

   81. Amid the neutralization of evidence which inevitably
results from the conflicting statements above quoted, I will
endeavour to point out the results which ought to ensue if the
inferences of the advocates of the whirlwind doctrine were
COrrect.
   82. When a rotary motion is communicated to a solid by
a force applied to any part whatever, the tangential velocity
at any point will be directly as                           its
                                          distance from the centre.

    84. Mr. Redfield alleges, that the storm of August 17th,
 1830, whirling to the left, travelled from south-west to north
east at the rate nearly of twenty-seven miles per hour; that
 its greatest diameter was from five hundred          six hundred                        to
miles; that          severe part was from one hundred and fifty
                       of    its
 to  two hundred and fifty miles. Thus          may       assumed,             it             be
that     order for
         in            observer  an   exposed  successively

                                                             within
the severe portion                      on
                           the south-eastern and north-western
limbs, the storm would have had          move      least one hunto                  at
dred   miles, requiring  nearly four hours.   Hence      the storm                            if
in  question were      whirlwind, instead

gradual accomplishment.

crowd of vessels having only to complain of the violence, not
of the direction of the wind.
   88. It has been assumed, that a storm whirling to the left
and travelling north-easterly, must, at stations passing nearly
under the centre, first blow as a south-easter and afterwards
gradually change to a north-wester.          Meanwhile on the south
eastern or left limb it will blow only from the south-west, and
on the north-western or right limb it will blow only from the
north-west.     Consistently, when the storm travels from south
east to  north-west,   as hurricanes are represented to travel in
proceeding from the sphere of their origin in the West Indies
to the coast of North America, it will at stations within a cer
tain distance of a line described by the centre, blow from the
north-east first. On the south-western limb it will blow first
as a north-wester; on the north-eastern limb as a south-easter.
Moreover, that on the last-mentioned limb the greatest vio
lence will occur, since the general motion of the whirlwind
will there cooperate with that of the whirl. Yet in the fol
lowing paragraph Mr. Redfield informs us (Silliman's Journal,
vol. xxv. p. 128), that “in the West Indies hurricanes begin
to blow from a northern quarter of the horizon, and then
changing to west and round to a southern quarter and then
their fury is over.”
   89. This account of the direction of the wind in West India
hurricanes agrees with that quoted by Espy from Edwards's
 History of Jamaica, vol.           “All hurricanes begin from the
                                     iii.

east to south-east would undergo an intermediate deviation,
but necessarily of an opposite nature, since for the same rea
son that at one there would be first more northing and then
more westing, at the other there would be more easting and
more southing, pari passu. But on the outward north-eastern
and north-western limbs, or in other words, on the right and
on the left external borders, there would be no change. On
the one it would blow from the north-west only, on the other
only from the south-east.      On this last-mentioned limb the
blast would be    pre-eminent  in violence, since in that direction
the gyrative and progressive motion of the whirlwind would

    91. Nevertheless, agreeably to the observations which have
lifted the whirlwind theory above the reach of my strictures,
hurricanes in the West Indies begin (at every place) from a
northern quarter, and changing first west, and afterwards to a
southern quarter, terminate their fury. Thus, agreeably to the
evidence of Mr. Redfield, the fury of the hurricane is the least
where, according to his hypothesis, it should be the greatest.
    92. Having cited and endeavoured to show the futility of
the only explanation which can be found in Mr. Redfield's
essays of the mode in which whirlwinds are induced,          I  will
quote a passage from which it would seem that they are sup
posed capable of being self-induced. Whence it would follow,
that without any extraneous aid, his “rotary movement, which
is the sole cause of destructive winds and tempests,” could
 spontaneously excite itself and the adjoining elements into a
destructive commotion.       From this statement, it appears that
 the author was not aware that in making it he gave a blow to
 his favourite idea of opposing and unequal forces, arising from
 gravitation and terrestrial motion, being the cause of stormy
 atmospheric gyration.
    93. “We may observe, also, that whirlwinds and spouts
 appear to commence gradually and to acquire their full ac
 tivity without the aid of any foreign causes; and it is well
 known they are most frequent in those calm regions where
 apparently there are no active currents to meet each other,
 and they are least frequent where currents are in full activity.”
 (Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiii. p. 61.)
     94. Treating of whirlwinds excited by fire, the author thus
 expresses himself:—“The foregoing results can only be ex
 plained by a violent vortical action steadily maintained. * * *
  The ascending power of the vortical column or whirlwind is
 strongly exhibited. * * * But the spire of a columnar vortex
  exhibits a penetrating and ascending power which far exceeds,
  both in its intensity and the extent of     action, any other as

it not be as reasonable to expect the spiral of iron usuall
employed to open bottles, spontaneously to penetrate a
 without being actuated by the operator's hand, as that the
 aérial spiral, which agreeably to the description above given,
constitutes a tornado, should, “without any foreign aid,” “or
 any currents to meet each other,” be endowed with the force

storms, it may be expected that I should, on this occasion, say
something respecting the opinions which I entertain of their
origin. To a certain extent this will be found in my com
munications published in Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxii. p. 153,
vol. xl. p. 137, also in my Essay on the Gales of the United
States.       I
             still believe our north-eastern gales were correctly
represented in the last-mentioned essay as arising from an ex
change of position made between the air of the Gulf of Mexico
and that of the territory of the United States which lies to the
north-east of that great estuary; and that the heat given out
during the conversion of aqueous vapour into rain, by imparting
to the atmosphere as much caloric as could be yielded by
twice   its

    101. Squalls may be the consequence of electrical reaction
between the terrestrial surface and oppositely excited masses
of air, and the intermixture of masses so excited in obedience
to the same cause, may be among the sources of rain, hail,
and gusts. The specific gravity of a body of air, electrified
differently from the surrounding medium, may be lessened
by what is called electric repulsion; the particles inevitably
moving a greater distance from each other, as similarly elec
trified pith-balls are known to do.
    102. Hence a cause of rarefaction, buoyancy, and conse
quent upward motion, in a column of electrified air, more
competent than that suggested by Espy.
    103. Should it be verified that a gyration from right to left
takes place during convective discharges of electricity in hur
ricanes, it may be referrible to the disposition which a positive
electrical discharge from the earth to the sky would have to
gyrate in that direction.

 I IHEREWITH                transmit to you a rough specimen of what
         conceive to be a novel employment of the power of elec
 tricity, and shall be gratified should the process by which it
 was effected prove susceptible of any useful application to the
 arts.
     The method which I employed in the production of the
 characters on the accompanying plate" was the following:—
 Having six batteries of the kind invented by Mr. Smee, the
 platinized silver plate of each being about three inches square,
 I  attached the steel plate to be etched upon to the zinc ex
 tremity of the batteries, a coil of covered wire, of considerable
 length, being previously interposed between the steel plate
 and the zinc: then taking the wire connected with the plati
 nized silver in my hand, I used it as an etching-tool on the
 steel plate, -an electrical spark of great brilliancy, accom
    * This was a steel plate, on which the words “Etched by means of
 Electricity. Bath,    30th June 1843. I. H. P.” together with some orna
 mental    devices, had been produced by the above method.    It gave only a
 faint, just legible impression by the copper-plate press.-EDIT.

panied by a slight indentation on the steel, was the result of
each contact of the wire with the plate.
    The wire by which the etching was made was of platina;
the part at which it was held was carried through a glass tube
for the purposes of affording a more convenient handle, and
of protecting the hand from shocks to which it might other
wise have been exposed.
    By using the wire connected with the zinc of the batteries
as the etching-tool, and attaching the steel plate to the plati
nized silver, a very different effect is produced.      With the
apparatus thus arranged, the spark that results from the con
tact of the wire with the steel plate is accompanied by a depo
sition of a minute portion of the substance of the wire on the
steel; by using different wires, therefore, as of gold, silver,
platina, &c., a variety of ornamental designs may probably be
formed on polished steel surfaces.
    The effect of the electrical agency here described is not
however confined to steel; a somewhat similar one may be
obtained by substituting plates of other metals.     By augment
ing the quantity and intensity of the electrical current, it seems
probable that the effect on the steel, or other metals, would
be proportionally increased; and it may be anticipated that,
by other modifications of the process,                   its
                                             applications may                         be
advantageously extended.

110                    Propositions         for      rendering the Nomenclature                  of
   Among the numerous rules for nomenclature which have been proposed by
naturalists, there are many which, though excellent in themselves, it is not
now desirable to enforce*.     The cases in which those rules have been over
looked or departed from, are so numerous and of such long standing, that to
carry these regulations into effect would undermine the edifice of zoological
nomenclature. But while we do not adopt these propositions as authoritative
laws, they may still be consulted with advantage in making such additions to
the language of zoology as are required by the progress of the science.       By
adhering to sound principles of philology, we may avoid errors in future,
even when it is too late to remedy the past, and the language of science will
thus eventually assume an aspect of more classic purity than it now presents.
   Our subject hence divides itself into two parts: the first consisting of Rules
for the rectification of the present zoological nomenclature, and the second of
 Recommendations for the improvement of zoological nomenclature in future.
                                                           PART I.
                  RULES FOR RECTIFYING                      THE PRESENT NOMENCLATURE.
                   [Limitation of           the      Plan   to Systematic Nomenclature.]
   In proposing a measure for the establishment of a permanent and universal
zoological nomenclature, it must be premised that we refer solely to the Latin
or systematic language of zoology.    We have nothing to do with vernacular
appellations.    One great cause of the neglect and corruption which prevails
in the scientific nomenclature of zoology, has been the frequent and often
exclusive use of vernacular names in lieu of the Latin binomial designations,
which form the only legitimate language of systematic zoology. Let us then
endeavour to render perfect the Latin or Linnaean method of nomenclature,
which, being far removed from the scope of national vanities and modern
antipathies, holds out the only hope of introducing into zoology that grand
desideratum, an universal language.

tions, they would not act more unphilosophically or inconsiderately than they
do in the case before us; for, in truth, it matters not in the least by what
conventional sound we agree to designate an individual object, provided the
sign to be employed be stamped with such an authority as will suffice to
make it pass current.  Now in zoology no one person can subsequently claim
an authority equal to that possessed by the person who is the first to define a
new genus or describe a new species; and hence it is that the name origin
ally given, even though it may be inferior in point of elegance or express
iveness to those subsequently proposed, ought as a general principle to be
permanently retained.    To this consideration we ought to add the injustice
of erasing the name originally selected by the person to whose labours we
owe our first knowledge of the object; and we should reflect how much the
permission of such a practice opens a door to obscure pretenders for dragging
themselves into notice at the expense of original observers.   Neither can an
author be permitted to alter a name which he himself has once published,
except in accordance with fixed and equitable laws. It is well observed by
Decandolle, “L’auteur méme qui a le premier établi un nom n'a pas plus
qu'un autre le droit de le changer pour simple cause d'impropriété.      Lapri
orité en effet est un terme fixe, positif, qui n'admet rien, ni d'arbitraire, ni
de partial.”
   For these reasons, we have no hesitation in adopting as our fundamental
maxim, the “law of priority,” viz.
     §   1.   The name originally given by the founder of a group or the
describer          of    a species should                 be permanently retained, to the                 exclu
sion of           all   subsequent synonyms                     (with the exceptions about                 to   be
noticed).
  Having laid down this principle, we must next inquire into the limitations
which are found necessary    carrying  into practice.

114                Propositions for rendering the Nomenclature of
names is so defined as to be less extensive in signification than the earlier, for
if the later includes the type of the earlier genus, it would be cancelled by
the operation of $4; and if it does not include that type, it is in fact a distinct
genus.]                                               -                 -              -
     But when the later name is         more extensive    than the earlier, the following
rule comes into operation          :-
          [A later name equivalent to several earlier ones is to be cancelled.]
     The same principle which is involved in § 6, will apply to $8.
     § 8.     If the  later name be so defined as to be equal in extent to two
or more         previously   published genera, it must be cancelled in toto.
     Example.—Psarocolius, Wagl. 1827, is equivalent to five or six genera
previously published under other names, therefore Psarocolius should be
 cancelled.
     If    these previously   published genera be separately adopted (as is the case
 with the       equivalents  of Psarocolius), their original names will of course pre
 vail; but if we follow the later author in combining them into one, the fol
 lowing rule is necessary:—
  [A    genus compounded       of two or   more previously proposed genera whose cha
    racters are now deemed       insufficient,   should retain the name of one of them.]
      It sometimes happens that the progress of science requires two or more
 genera, founded on insufficient or erroneous characters, to be combined to
 gether into one. In such cases the law of priority forbids us to cancel all
 the original names and impose a new one on this compound genus.                  We must
 therefore select some one species as a type or example, and give the generic
 name which it formerly bore to the whole group now formed.                   If these ori
 ginal generic names differ in date, the oldest one should be the one adopted.
       § 9. In compounding a genus out of several smaller ones, the earli
 est of them, if otherwise unobjectionable, should be selected, and its
 former generic name be extended over the new genus so compounded.
      Example.--The genera Accentor and Prunella of Vieillot not being con
 sidered sufficiently distinct in character, are now united under the general
 name       of Accentor, that being the earliest.       So also Cerithium and Potamides,
 which were long considered distinct, are now united, and the latter name
  merges into the former.
      We now proceed to point out those few cases which form exceptions to
  the law of priority, and in which it becomes both justifiable and necessary to
  alter the names originally imposed by authors.
   [A     name should    be changed when previously applied to another group which
                                         still retains it.]
       It   being  essential to the binomial method to indicate objects in natural
  history by means of two words only, without the aid of any further designa
  tion, it follows that a generic name should only have one meaning, in other
  words, that two genera should never bear the same name. For a similar
   reason, no two species in the same genus should bear the same name. When
   these cases occur, the later of the two duplicate names should be cancelled,
   and a new term, or the earliest synonym, if there be any, substituted. When
   it s necessary to form new words for this purpose, it is desirable to make
   them bear some analogy to those which they are destined to supersede, as
   where the genus of birds, Plectorhynchus, being preoccupied in Ichthyology

Knighti,   Bullocki, Eschscholtzi, would be quite unintelligible if they were
Latinized into Vudvardi, Cnichti, Bullocci,   Essolzi, &c.    But words of bar
barous origin, having no fixed orthography, are more pliable, and hence,
when adopted into the Latin, they should be rendered as classical in appear
ance as is consistent with the preservation of their original sound. Thus the
words Tockus, awsuree, argoondah, kundoo, &c. should, when Latinized, have
been written Toccus, ausure, argunda, cundu, &c. Such words ought, in all
practicable cases, to have a Latin termination given them, especially if they
are used generically.
  In Latinizing proper names, the simplest rule appears to be to use the ter
mination -us, genitive                -i,
                         when the name ends with      consonant,       the above       a                           as   in

  The classical languages being selected for zoology, and words being more
easily remembered in proportion as they are expressive, it is self-evident that

the Latin or Greek, and express some distinguishing characteristic of
the object to which they are applied.

  It follows from hence that the following classes of words are more or less
objectionable in point of taste, though, in the case of genera, it is often neces
sary to use them, from the impossibility of finding characteristic words which
have not before been employed for other genera. We will commence with
those which appear the least open to objection, such as
   a. Geographical names.—These words being for the most part adjectives
can rarely be used for genera. As designations of species they have been so
strongly objected                     to,
                          that some authors (Wagler, for instance) have gone the
length      substituting fresh names wherever they occur; others (e.g. Swain
              of
son) will only tolerate them where they apply earclusively,                Lepus hiberni                   as
cus, Troglodytes europaeus, &c. We are                     means disposed    by       no

object       this class     names,        better      avoid giving them, except where

     b.Barbarous names.—Some authors protest strongly against the introduc
tion    exotic words into our Latin nomenclature, others defend the practice
          of
with equal warmth. We may remark, first, that the practice                    not contrary                        is
to classical usage, for the Greeks and Romans did occasionally, though with
reluctance, introduce barbarous words               modified form into their respective
                                                                       in

   d. Mythological                    to or
                           historical names.—When these have              perceptible re

             allusion     the characters      the  object         of
                                                               which  they  are conferred, on
they may               be
                 properly regarded         unmeaning and     as    bad taste.    Thus the       in
generic names Lesbia, Leilus, Remus, Corydon, Pasiphae, have been applied
to
a    Humming bird, Butterfly,           a  Beetle,     Parrot, and
                                                             a         Crab respectively,
                                                                            a                         a

without any        perceptible association of ideas. But mythological names may
sometimes       be used as generic with the same propriety as technical ones, in
cases     where a direct allusion can be traced between the narrated actions of a
personage and the observed habits or structure of an animal. Thus when the
name Progne is given to a Swallow, Clotho to a Spider, Hydra to a Polyp,
Athene to an Owl, Nestor to a grey-headed Parrot, &c., a pleasing and bene
ficial    connexion is established between classical literature and physical science.
      e. Comparative names.—The objections which have been raised to words
of this class are not without foundation. The names, no less than the defini
tions of objects, should, where practicable, be drawn from positive and self
 evident characters, and not from        a comparison with other objects, which may
be less known to the reader than the one before him. Specific names express
 ive of comparative size are also to be avoided, as they may be rendered in
 accurate by the after-discovery of additional species. The names Picoides,
 Emberizoides, Pseudoluscinia, rubeculoides, maximus, minor, minimus, &c. are
 examples of this objectionable practice.
     f. Generic names compounded from other genera.—These are in some de
 gree open to the same imputation as comparative words; but as they often
 serve to express the position of a genus as intermediate to, or allied with, two
 other genera, they may occasionally be used with advantage. Care must be
  taken not to adopt such compound words as are of too great length, and not
  to corrupt them in trying to render them shorter. The names Gallopavo, Te
  traogallus, Gypaetos, are examples of the appropriate use of compound words.
      g. Specific names derived from persons.—So long as these complimentary
  designations are used with moderation, and are restricted to persons of emi
  nence as scientific zoologists, they may be employed with propriety in cases
  where expressive or characteristic words are not to be found.         But we fully
  concur with those who censure the practice of naming species after persons
  of no scientific reputation, as curiosity dealers (e.g. Caniveti, Boissoneauti),
  Peruvian priestesses (Cora, Amazilia), or Hottentots (Klassi).
      h. Generic names derived from persons.—Words of this class have been
 very extensively used in botany, and therefore it would have been well to
 have excluded them wholly from zoology, for the sake of obtaining a memo
 ria technica by which the name of a genus would at once tell us to which of
 the kingdoms of nature it belonged. Some few personal generic names have
 however crept into zoology, as Cuvieria, Mulleria, Rossia, Lessonia, &c., but
  they are very rare in comparison with those of botany, and it is perhaps de
   sirable not to add to their number.
      i. Names of harsh and inelegant pronunciation.—These words are grating
  to the ear, either from inelegance of form, as Huhua, Yuhina, Crawirew, Esch
  scholtzi, or from too great length, as chirostrongylostinus, Opetiorhynchus,
  brachypodioides, Thecodontosaurus, not to mention the Enaliolimnosaurus
  crocodilocephaloides of a German naturalist. It is needless to enlarge on the
  advantage of consulting euphony in the construction of our language. As a
   general rule it may be recommended to avoid introducing words of more than
   five syllables.
       h. Ancient names of animals applied in a wrong sense.—It has been cus
   tomary, in numerous cases, to apply the names of animals found in classic
   authors at random to exotic genera or species which were wholly unknown
   to the ancients. The names Cebus, Callithria, Spiza, Kitta, Struthus, are
   examples.     This practice ought by no means to be encouraged. The usual

(from Cypselus and Tanagra), Merularis (Merula and Synallaaris), Lorigilla
(Loria and Fringilla), &c. In other cases, where the commencement of both
the simple words is retained in the compound, a fault is still committed by
cutting off too much of the radical and vital portions, as is the case in Bu
corvus (from Buceros and Corvus), Ninoa (Nisus and Noctua), &c.
  p. Nonsense names.—Some authors having found difficulty in selecting ge
neric names which have not been used before, have adopted the plan of coining
words at random without any derivation or meaning whatever. The following
are examples:      Viralta, Xema, Azeca, Assiminia, Quedius, Spisula. To the
same class we    may  refer anagrams of other generic names, as Dacelo and Ce
dola of   Alcedo,  Zapornia   of Porzana, &c. Such verbal trifling as this is in
very bad taste, and is especially calculated to bring the science into contempt.
It finds no precedent in the Augustan age of Latin, but can be compared only
to the puerile quibblings of the middle ages.         It is contrary to the genius of
all  languages,  which  appear  never to   produce   new words by spontaneous ge
neration, but always to derive them from some other source, however distant
or obscure. And it is peculiarly annoying to the etymologist, who after seek
ing in vain through the vast storehouses of human language for the parentage
of such words, discovers at last that he has been pursuing an ignis fatuus.
   q. Names previously cancelled by the operation of § 6.—Some authors con
sider that when a name has been reduced to a synonym by the operations of
the laws of priority, they are then at liberty to apply it at pleasure to any new
group which may be in want of a name. We consider, however, that when a
word has once been proposed in a given sense, and has afterwards sunk into
a synonym, it is far better to lay it aside for ever than to run the risk of ma
king confusion by re-issuing it with a new meaning attached.
    r. Specific names raised into generic.—It has sometimes been the practice
in subdividing an old genus to give to the lesser genera so formed, the names
of their respective typical species. Our Rule 13 authorizes the forming a
new specific name in such cases; but we further wish to state our objections
to the practice altogether.      Considering as we do that the original specific
names should as far as    possible   be held sacred, both on the grounds of justice
to their authors and of   practical  convenience to naturalists, we would strongly
dissuade from the further continuance of a practice which is gratuitous in itself,
and which involves the necessity of altering long-established specific names.

   A convenient memoria technica may be effected by adopting our next pro
position.    It has been usual, when the titles of species are derived from pro
per names, to write them with a capital letter, and hence when the specific
name is used alone it is liable to be occasionally mistaken for the title of a
genus.     But if the titles of species were invariably written with a small ini
tial, and those of genera with a capital, the eye would at once distinguish the
rank of the group referred to, and a possible source of error would be avoided.
It should be further remembered that                             all
                                              species are equal, and should there

 referred to in systematic works without the necessity of perpetually quoting
 their authorities.  The most simple mode then for ordinary use seems to be
 to append  to the  original authority for the species, when not applying to the
 genus also, some distinctive mark, such as (sp.) implying an exclusive refer
 ence to the specific name, as Tyrannus crinitus, Lin. (sp.), and to omit this
 expression when the same authority attaches to both genus and species, as
 Ostrea edulis, Lin." Therefore,
    § D. It is recommended that the authority for a specific name, when
 not applying to the generic name also, should be followed by the                                 di
 stinctive expression (sp.).
          [New genera and species to be defined amply and publicly.]
   A  large  proportion of the complicated mass of synonyms which has now
become the opprobrium of zoology, has originated either from the slovenly
and imperfect manner in which species and groups have been originally de
fined, or from their definitions having been inserted in obscure local publica
tions which have never obtained an extensive circulation. Therefore, although
under § 12, we have conceded that mere insertion in a printed book is suffi
cient for publication, yet we would strongly advise the authors of new groups
always to give in the first instance a full and accurate definition of their cha
racters, and to insert the same in such periodical or other works as are likely
to obtain an immediate and extensive circulation. To state this briefly,
    § E. It is recommended that new genera or species be amply de
 fined, and eatensively circulated in the first instance.
 [The names to be given to subdivisions of genera to agree in gender with the
                                 original genus.]
  In order to preserve  specific names as far as possible in an unaltered form,
whatever may        ".
                   the changes which the genera to which they are referred
may undergo, it is desirable, when it can be done with propriety, to make
the new subdivisions of genera agree in gender with the old groups from which
they are formed. This recommendation does not however authorize the
changing the gender or termination of a genus already established. In brief,
   § F. It is recommended that in subdividing an old genus in future,
the names given to the subdivisions should agree in gender with that
of the original group.
                 [Etymologies and     of new genera to be stated.]
                                        types
   It is obvious that the names of genera  would in general be far more care
fully constructed, and their definitions would be rendered more exact, if
authors would adopt the following suggestion —
   § G. It is recommended that in defining new genera the etymo
logy of the name should be always stated, and that one species should
be invariably selected as a type or standard of reference.
   In concluding this outline of a scheme for the rectification of zoological
nomenclature, we have only to remark, that almost the whole of the proposi
tions contained in it may be applied with equal correctness to the sister sci
ence of botany. We have preferred, however, in this essay to limit our views
  * The    expression   Tyrannus crinitus (Lin.) would perhaps   be preferable   from   its   greater
brevity.

124           Mr. Murchison             on the Geological Structure
to zoology, both for the sake of rendering the question less complex,
and because we conceive that the botanical nomenclature of the
present day stands in much less need of distinct enactment than the
zoological.   The admirable rules laid down by Linnaeus, Smith,
Decandolle, and other botanists (to which, no less than to the works
of Fabricius, Illiger, Vigors, Swainson, and other zoologists, we
have been much indebted in preparing the present document), have
always exercised a beneficial influence over their disciples.  Hence
the language of botany has attained a more perfect and stable con
dition than that of zoology; and if this attempt at reformation may
have the effect of advancing zoological nomenclature beyond                                its
present backward and abnormal state, the wishes             promoters of       its
will    fully
       be     attained.

ments of the Ural chain, to show of what sedimentary masses it
was originally composed, and to explain by what agency the strata
have been dislocated and altered.     In the latter respect they are
aware that their labours have to a great extent been anticipated by
the researches of Baron Humboldt, and his companions M. G. Rose
and M. Ehrenberg, as well as by their predecessors Colonel Hel
mersen and M. Hoffmann", and various officers of the Imperial School
of Mines f.
    Moving in two parties and upon separate but parallel lines of re
search,   the authors examined both flanks of the chain simultane
ously, their force being brought together at the chief establishments
by mutual converging traverses; and thus, in less than three months,
they acquired a general knowledge of the chain from Bogoslofsk on
the north to Orsk and Orenburg on the south, a distance of about
550 miles. It is not pretended that this knowledge is precise in re
lation to the mineral structure of the mining tracts; as such details
either have been or will be worked out by Russian engineers.          The
authors merely hope to have succeeded in giving an unity of geolo
gical composition to the chain, so that the age of the chief masses
may be effectively compared with the unaltered deposits of the
plains of Russia, and by this means with the geological succession of
sedimentary deposits already established in Europe.
    Physical Features.—Referring to Capt. Strajefski for his account
 of the northernmost and uncolonized part of the chain, which he ex
plored amid great privations to 65° N. lat., the physical geography
 of the civilized portion is briefly sketched, and the chief altitudes, as
determined by Colonel Helmersen, are given. The general bearing of
 the chain, as well known, trends from north to south. Ekaterinburg,
 the chief town, is situated on the eastern side of the only very low
 depression in the range, from which point this dividing crest between
 Europe and Asia rises both to the north and south, and attains al
 titudes occasionally of 2500 feet. The northern Ural, formerly
 occupied by Voguls, who still live in the wildernesses north of 61
 degrees, is inhospitable in climate, and is chiefly occupied by dense
 forests, through which the rocks of the central water.shed are per
 ceptible only at intervals. This monotony, however, is enlivened by
 knots of mountains which rise up on the sides of the parting ridge,
 and overtop        Such are the Katch Kanar, the Pawdinskoi Kamen,

   Devonian Limestones, &c.—The Devönian rocks of the North Ural
are seen on the banks of the Tchussovaya in the form of limestones,
grits and schists, which pass into the lower carboniferous limestone,
the latter being always in highly inclined, sometimes in very con
torted and even inverted positions, the younger rocks dipping under
the older.     These Devonian limestones much resemble, in their dark
colour and subcrystalline aspect, those of South Devon in England,
and they contain fossils characteristic of this division both in the
 British Isles, in Belgium, Prussia and the Eifel; but though perfectly
identified both by position and contents with the Devonian rocks of
 the flat regions of Russia, the Uralian strata are as dissimilar from
 them in external aspect as the rocks of the same age in Devonshire
 are from the old red sandstone of the north of Scotland and of
Herefordshire or Brecon in England. Nor are these llevonian rocks
on the western flanks of the Ural separated from the lower car
boniferous limestone by any band of sandstone and coal as in the
northern parts of Russia in Europe, but the grey limestone of the
overlying group is at once succeeded by the dark limestone of the
other, both undergoing the same flexures, and both forming parts
of one great palaeozoic series.
   In their prolongation to the south, the limestones of this Devo
nian group thin out and inosculate with a considerable development
of red sandstone, grit, fine conglomerate and schist, in some parts
resembling the old red sandstone of the Highlands.        A peculiar
mineral character of these Devonian limestones       that they    is,
                                                               retain
their black colour even when     the state of dolomite.

   Silurian Rocks,—The schists and flagstones which underlie these
limestones are considered        to   beSilurian age; with these strata

graphical sequence is interrupted, there is no doubt that the equi
valents, at least of the upper members of the Silurian rocks, exist
in these mountains; and in tracing such into the South Ural, par
ticularly by a transverse section from Verch-Uralsk to Sterlitamak,
the authors convinced themselves, from the presence of Orthidae,
Pentameri, &c., that where not much interfered with by intrusive
rocks, the central deposits of the chain (usually however in the
state of slate and quartz rock) belong to the Silurian system, and
probably to           its
                    lowest divisions.

and magnetic iron, the latter in so hard and crystalline a state that
 it is not worthy of extraction and manufacture.           The most pro
 ductive masses of magnetic iron are at the Government establish
 ment of Mount Blagodat, and that of Nijny Tagilsk, belonging to
 M. Anatole Demidoff. In both these cases the ordinary varieties of
iron occur in great masses, occasionally with chromate of iron *, in
contact with rocks of igneous origin, in which serpentine, compact
felspar, greenstone, porphyry, &c. are apparent. At Nijny Tagilsk
the chief intrusive rock (greenstone) is coated by prodigious masses
of the iron ore, which is worked in open quarries, and is most mag
netic where it is in contact with greenstone.           Copper ores also
abound at this   spot,  and some of them are associated with Silurian
limestone, often highly mineralized, but in which large Pentameri
and other fossils are observed; also with a bedded trappean rock or
schaalstein, which is in parts highly cupriferous.         It is from such
ancient rocks that copper solutions are supposed to have flowed, in
very remote periods, into the adjacent low countries on the west,
then under the sea, and to have impregnated the sandstones and
grits of Perm during their formation.        The malachites of this place
have   long been celebrated,   and,  from their structure as well as their
position, in cavities of the rock, they are supposed to have been
formed by ancient stalactitic depositions.         The ores of platinum,
though hitherto found in alluvia only, always occur near the pro
trusive igneous rocks. Magnetic iron ore and copper ore are stated
to occur at many other localities, and always under similar circum
Stances.
    Gold Ores.—Though the great supply of gold which the Ural
mountains afford, is derived from alluvia, the ore has been found in
veins which are slightly worked at Berosofsk, near Ekaterinburg,
and were formerly near Miaskt.             Wherever gold veins or gold
alluvia have been discovered, the auriferous matter is flanked by
rocks of intrusive origin, and these are very frequently serpentine.
It has however been shown by Humboldt and Rose, who, in the first
volume of their recent work, have described twenty-seven sites
of gold alluvia in these mountains, that the auriferous detritus
rests upon a great variety of rocks, viz. talcose, chloritic, siliceous,
argillaceous    schists and encrimite limestone, as well as upon
granite, greenstone and serpentine, though most frequently on the
last-mentioned rock.       An observation also of these authors is im
portant, as bearing upon the relative date of the origin of gold,
viz. that the veins containing it have been seen by them to cut
through not only the schists and the beresite (according to them
   * The largest masses of chromate of iron occur in the South Ural, near
the mines of Polikofski, south of Miask, and from whence from 6000 to 7000
“pouds” per annum have recently been sent to Moscow.
   + In the tracts around Miask and Zlataoust       the authors were most
cordially and judiciously assisted by General Anosof, an officer highly
distinguished for the metallurgic processes and the manufacture of small
arms which he directs.    His assistant, Major Lissenko, who has prepared
a mineralogical map of the surrounding country, was also kindly serviceable
to them.

that the gold veins have resulted from one of the very last changes
which have affected this region. (Rose, vol. i. p. 422.)
   It is stated, that as the alluvia containing gold are purely of local
origin, or derived from the adjacent hills, their accumulation can
have no reference to the actual period, and present rivulets or

 a great number of typical organic remains well known in Western
 Europe, they are still more convinced of the accuracy of their first

 their order and their imbedded fossils.

   Professor Lloyd exhibited a specimen of rock from Terre Adele.
   Professor MacCullagh communicated to the Academy a very simple
geometrical rule, which gives the solution of the problem of total re
flerion, for ordinary media and for uniaxal crystals.
   First, let the total reflexion take place at the common surface of
two ordinary media, as between glass and air, and let it be proposed
to determine the incident and reflected vibrations, when the re
fracted vibration is known. It is to be observed, that the refracted
vibration (which is in general elliptical) cannot be arbitrarily as
sumed; for, as may be inferred from what has been already stated

    A notice of the occurrence of a Metallic Alloy in an unusual state
of aggregation and molecular arrangement, was read by Robert
Mallet, Esq., M.R.I.A.,
  Amongst the several classes of substances which chemistry at
present considers as simple, the metals stand preeminently marked
by their almost invariable possession of a nearly fixed and striking
group of sensible qualities, which together constitute the well-known
“metallic character.”        Some of these, such as lustre and fusibility,
are common to      every  metallic body; but by the occasional variation
of  nearly  every  other sensible quality of the metals, the law of con
tinuity remains unbroken, which unites them in different directions
with the other classes of material bodies. Thus opacity, which is
probably mechanically destroyed in gold leaf, is lost in selenium;
and so, in this most prevalent of their properties, the metals, through
tellurium, selenium and sulphur, become translucent, and mingle
with the non-metallic elements. So also their solidity, at common
temperature, is lost in mercury; their great density, in sodium and
potassium ; their malleability, in bismuth, antimony, and arsenic;
while in tellurium, the power to conduct electricity is nearly wanting;
and, lastly, hydrogen, to all intents a metal in its chemical relations,
yet possesses not a single physical quality in common with these,
but exists as an invisible and scarcely ponderable gas.
   But although different metals thus vary in sensible qualities, those
which collectively belong to the same individual metal are as re
markable for their permanence.
   Unless selenium be admitted to be a metal, no approach to                                 di
morphism has hitherto been recognized in any body of the class;
the only case recorded, that by Dufresnoy, of the occurrence of cast
iron in cubes and rhomboids, not having been given by him with
certainty, nor since verified by other observers. Hence any instance
of such a character, or tendency towards                       it,

     It frequently happens, notwithstanding the polish of both metallic
 surfaces, and the application of oil, that the friction due to their
 rapid passage over each other, while exposed to undue or irregular
 pressure, produces a considerable rise of temperature, and the brass
 becomes abraded.            Its particles have no coherence, and much re
 semble the “bronze powder” used by painters.
     In an instance, however, which some time since came under the
 author's notice, a different result took place. The minute particles
 of abraded brass were by the motion of the shaft, during a few hours,
 impacted into a cavity, at the junction of the two semicylinders of
 the bearing, where they became again a coherent mass, and when
 removed presented                   all

 On more minute examination, however, the mass was found

   It seems, therefore, extremely probable, that the cause of the near
approach to blackness in the fracture and filings of this alloy, arises
from the excessive minuteness of                                    its

   Dr. Forster, with a view of drawing attention to the phaenomena
observed by him on the 20th of March in connexion with the comet,
had accurately represented in a coloured drawing the appearance
of the comet and of the surrounding sky, and had caused it to be
copied by an artist, with the intention of presenting the same to the
Society.   The drawing has since been received, and is now in the
possession of the Society.

   13. Abstract, by the Secretary, of Newspaper Accounts of the
Comet which have been forwarded to the Society.
   Some of these accounts are of considerable interest, and Mr. Main
thought it desirable to collect and to bring them before the Society,
which will thus be in possession of almost every thing that has been
published relatively to the comet.
   The first is extracted from a newspaper of Tobago, and is signed
M. Dill, Lieutenant Royal Engineers, Superintendent of Signals,
and dated Fort King George, 8th March, 1843.
   “During the last few days our island has been visited by a very
large and brilliant comet.    It is said to have been seen first on Fri
day evening, but was more generally observed on Saturday, when it
presented a most luminous appearance; the nucleus of the comet
being, at about 4 to 7 o'clock, in the direction of south-west, and
the tail stretching to an immense length across the heavens in a
south-east direction, and in opposition to the sun's light.          On
Sunday night it was observed by compass, when the nucleus bore
west 25° 0' south at # to 7 o'clock.        On Monday an observation
was taken with a theodolite at 16"+ past 7 o'clock, when the nucleus
bore west 16° 7' south, with an elevation of 6° 4', and the end of
the tail, as nearly as it could be caught, bore west 28° 14' south,
with an elevation of 28° 21'.”
   Similar observations were made of it on the following Tuesday
and Wednesday.
  The following letter from Mr. Benjamin Pierce, dated Cambridge,
March 31, 1843, appeared in the Boston Courier of April 1, 1843:-
  “The elements of the comet's orbit, which I send you, are roughly
computed, and will need future correction.   They agree very closely
with Mr. Clarke's   noonday  observations of February 28, and were
computed from Mr. Bond's observations of March 11, 18, 24, and 26.
More correct calculations, in which all the observations will be
thoroughly discussed, will in due time be presented to the American
Academy.

    In another American paper was the following account :—
    “A comet of unusual size and brilliancy was distinctly visible to
the naked eye in this vicinity on Tuesday last, the 28th of February,
 1843, at noonday, at a distance, as we should judge, of 5° or 6° east
from the sun.     It extended over a space in the heavens of nearly 3°
in  length, with little more than 1° in width, and appeared like a very

the outer sides of each branch convex, and of nearly equal length,

Variation of Gravity on Ships' Cargoes in different Latitudes.” On
turning to my manuscript, I find the article there headed, “On the
Variation in the Weight of Ships' Cargoes in different Latitudes.”
As weight and gravity are not exactly synonymous, perhaps this title
is less ambiguous than that which was printed; but be that as it
may, a very cursory perusal of the article is quite sufficient to show
that its design was to exhibit the variation in weight of cargoes in
different places through which a ship may be supposed to pass. The
table adverted to in your note showed the weight of the burden of dif
ferent vessels in each degree of latitude, they having a given tonnage
in the latitude of London. Whatever may be the merits or demerits
of the little article, I wish there to be no mistake; the article states

     In forming the little table that I sent to you, thought there was              I
  something novel in its showing how the weight of a body varies in
  each degree of latitude; at all events it was new to me; but that the
  weight of bodies does vary when they are carried into different lati
 tudes, was I thought a recognised fact admitting of no dispute. Thus
 Newton, Principia, lib. iii. prop. 20, prob. 4, has “Invenire et inter
 se comparare pondera corporum in terrae hujus regionibus diversis.”
  Having discussed the problem, he says, “Unde tale confit Theorema;
 quod incrementum ponderis pergendo abaequatore ad polos,                   quam                             sit
 proximè     ut sinus versus latitudinis duplicatae, vel quod perinde est,
 ut  quadratum sinus rectilatitudinis.”        This problem would seem                                                 to
 have some reference          the subject, but Newton appears
                                  to                                    have for                        to
 gotten the scales.

    Auro-cyanogen. Auro-cyanide of Potassium.—This salt is obtained
 by adding a perfectly neutral and saturated solution of chloride of
 gold to cyanide of potassium. On evaporation and on the cooling of
 the solution, the salt crystallizes in very white scales, of a pearly
 lustre; the chloride of potassium and the excess of cyanide of potas
 sium remain in solution.          This salt gilds much better than those
 now   employed    in the arts.
    Platino-cyanogen.        Platino-cyanide of Potassium.—Doebereiner,
 who discovered this     body,   prepares it by heating to redness a mixture
 of  equal   parts   of spongy     platina and ferrocyanide of potassium.
 The residual mass is to be washed, and the undecomposed ferro
 cyanide is to be obtained first by crystallization, and afterwards the
 platino-cyanide remaining in the solution, crystallizes when that is
 concentrated.      This process is a long one, and it is difficult to pro
 cure a    pure  salt.   M. Meillet prepares it by adding concentrated
 chloride of    platina  to a saturated solution of cyanide of potassium ;
 there is   immediately    formed a precipitate of chloride of platina and
 potassium mixed with cyanide; it is to be heated to ebullition, and
 then it redissolves with strong effervescence and disengagement of
 carbonate of ammonia.           It may be supposed that, in this case, the
 cyanide of platina which is formed reacts like an acid on the atom of
 cyanate of potash (always contained in this cyanide of potassium),
 and sets free cyanic acid, which, by absorbing three atoms of water, is
 converted into bicarbonate of ammonia. Cyanic acid being C*Azº O,
 with three atoms of water HºO", there will be formed an atom of
 bicarbonate of ammonia, C* O*, Az” H9.
    After the complete solution of the precipitate, the platino-cyanide
 of potassium crystallizes in blue needles, which are variegated by re
 flected and yellow by transmitted light.
    Cupro-cyanogen.       Cuprocyanide    of Potassium.—This is prepared
 by dissolving either cyanide of copper, or carbonate of copper with
 heat in cyanide of potassium and evaporation; on cooling the salt
 crystallizes in fine white needles. When, after having poured very
 concentrated hydrocyanic acid on hydrate of barytes, carbonate of
 copper is added, it dissolves with strong effervescence,             and the
 liquor assumes a carmine-red tint of extraordinary intensity.              On
rapidly evaporating the solution, it is gradually decolorated, so per
fectly indeed, that on treating the residue with cold water, cupro
cyanide of barium is obtained entirely colourless; the cause of this
colour was found to be derived from the formation of a considerable
quantity of murexide or purpurate of ammonia; M. Meillet endea
voured, but unsuccessfully, to explain the reaction to which its
formation was owing, seeing that this body contains a large quantity
of hydrogen.       Once or twice he found some rudiments of crystals
spontaneously formed, which had the colour of cantharides wings,
a tint which sufficiently characterizes     it.      This solution      cupro
                                                                       of

mains in solution. This purpurate [of copper] is a powder of a fine
deep violet colour. The red salt of barytes, treated with sulphate of
soda, yields sulphate of barytes, and there remains a mixture of pur
purate and hydrocyanate of soda, which separate very well by
spontaneous evaporation.       The purpurate collects on the edges of
the  capsule;  it crystallizes  like cauliflowers, and of a fine crimson
colour unalterable in the air. The cuprocyanate of sodium remains
at the bottom of the capsule in the form of small fine needles, which
are also unalterable.
   Argento-cyanogen. Argento-cyanide of Potassium.—This salt cry
stallizes in tables analogous to those of chlorate of potash; it is ob
tained by dissolving to saturation cyanide of silver in cyanide of
potassium; the solution is to be filtered, evaporated, and crystallized.
    Argento-hydrocyanic Acid.—This is prepared by dissolving cyanide
 of silver in cyanide of barium, and precipitating the barytes with
 sulphuric acid; it is a yellowish acid of considerable stability, pos
 sessing the smell of hydrocyanic acid; it is very weak, but still it
 combines very well with alkaline bases; it acts upon carbonates
 with greater difficulty.
    Hydrargyro-cyanide of Potassium.—This salt is analogous to the
 preceding, and is prepared in the same manner; it is white, very
 soluble, and assumes the form of small granular crystals.        Similar
 compounds may be formed with a great number of other salts, as those
 of cobalt, nickel and cadmium. These the author proposes to de
 scribe when he gives the analyses of those already mentioned.—Journal

it is the agent that brings about the decomposition of car
bonic acid. The faculty of producing like effect is not the
distinguishing quality of the tithonic rays, nor can the term
chemical be any more applied to them than to either of their
acknowledged distinct companions.             Unless therefore chemists
are content to admit that a species of heat may earist devoid
of the power of expanding bodies, of giving the sensation of
warmth, and of being transmitted by conducting processes; or,
unless they admit that light can eacist in such a modified condi
tion as to produce in our eyes the sensation of darkness, they
will have to admit these tithonic rays as constituting a fourth
imponderable agent.         The name they may take is not a matter
of importance, that which is least trammelled by hypothesis
is best.    It is not the object of the papers I have written in
this Journal to show merely that a class of invisible rays exists
in the spectrum; that has been known for a long time; but it
is to point out the true relation of these rays to other bodies
and other forces in the world, to assert for them their title of
a fourth distinct imponderable agent, and to secure for them
the admission of that title by giving them a name.

164     Dr. Draper on               the Decomposition                 of Carbonic Acid
in the water; no glistening air-film, such as is always on freshly
gathered leaves, nor any air bubbles were attached to them.
Great care was taken to secure this perfect freedom from air
at the outset of the experiments.
    The little trough was now placed in such a position that a
solar spectrum, kept motionless by a heliostat and dispersed
by a flint glass prism in a horizontal direction, fell upon the
tubes.    By bringing the trough nearer to the prism or moving
it further off, the different coloured spaces could be made to
fall at pleasure on the inverted tubes. The beam of light was
about three-fourths of an inch in diameter. In a few minutes
after the commencement of the experiment, the tubes on which
the orange, yellow, and green light fell, commenced giving off
minute gas bubbles, and in about an hour and a half a quantity
was collected sufficient for accurate measurement.
    The gas, thus collected in each tube, having been trans
ferred to another vessel and                       its
                                    quantity determined, the little
trough with         all    its

passing a beam through absorbent media of such a nature
that the extreme red, the blue, the indigo, and violet are ab
sorbed, this decomposition should nevertheless go on. A so
lution of bichromate of potash nearly fulfils these conditions,

166    Dr. Draper on            the Decomposition                        of Carbonic Acid
    Comparing these experiments, made by the aid of absorp
tive media, with those made by the prism, we are enabled to
come to a definite conclusion as to the character of the rays
which cause this decomposition.
    The true office of prismatic analysis is to determine the re
frangibility of the rays which produce given actions; but                                            in
asmuch as rays of heat, rays of light, and tithonic rays are
found throughout the spectrum, in many cases the prism fails
to indicate to which of these imponderable agents phaenomena
are to be ascribed.         The case before us furnishes a striking
example.       Although the decomposition of carbonic acid is
most energetically brought about by rays whose index of re
fraction corresponds to the yellow, yet that region of the spec
trum is far from being devoid of heat and tithonicity.
    By considering however the prismatic analysis and the ab
sorptive analysis together, the following facts appear:—1st, the
 place of maximum action in the spectrum corresponds to the
maximum of illumination; 2nd, at the place of the maximum
of heat (which in the prism here used is beyond the extreme
red) no decomposition whatever takes effect; this appears
 therefore to exclude calorific influence; 3rd, the point of
maximum action of the tithonic rays, which escape absorption
by the bichromate of potash, being towards the green, does
not correspond with the place of maximum decomposition,
which is the yellow; this seems to exclude the tithonic rays;
4th, the decomposition taking place almost as energetically
 under the bichromate of potash as in the unobstructed beams
                                                             to to

tarded  is to    extent                         their loss
which       far from being the case; the retardation which              ob                   is
served appearing           to   be
                                attributable rather       the loss    light to           of
 by  reflexion from the faces           the trough, and the partial tur
                                             of
bidity (want         of
                    translucence)             of       its
                                             glasses and solutions.
    For these reasons           I conclude that the decomposition                                    of
carbonic acid         bythe leaves       plants

rays  of  Light; and that the calorific and tithonic rays do not
participate     inthe phaenomenon.          As was stated before, there
fore, the rays        light are just

upwards, and is spontaneously expanded by the passage of
the gas through it into a bubble. The play of colour which
attends this experiment, and the excessive thinness which the

170          Dr. Draper on              the Decomposition           of Carbonic Acid
In fact, as I shall now proceed to show, the decomposition of
carbonic acid is only one of a very numerous series.
    The alkaline bicarbonates, as is well known, undergo de
composition by a slight elevation of temperature. When boiled
with water they gradually give off their second atom of acid,
and slowly pass into the condition of neutral carbonate. This
easy decomposibility led me to inquire whether green leaves,
under the action of the sunlight, would effect the liberation
and subsequent reduction of the acid.           In the following ex
periments it is to be observed, that the boiling is not con
tinued long enough to affect to any extent the constitution of
the salt, and in each case any portion of free carbonic acid
extricated during the cooling of the liquid was removed by the
action of the air-pump.          The solution when finally used
contained no gaseous matter, but only the salt dissolved in
Water.

   Saussure has already determined, that when plants are
forced to grow in an atmosphere of known volume, containing
carbonic acid gas, after the decomposition of the gas is com
pleted, the total volume remains unchanged.    As my experi
ments were made with leaves immersed in water, I was de
sirous of proving whether under these forced circumstances
the same result would still hold good.

                                                   I
some     leaves, taking   the   greatest  care that no bubbles         air                         of
should pass along with them. The jar was then placed                                                    in
the sunshine, and the decomposition completed.                 Corrected
for variation        of
                    temperature      and  pressure,    the  resulting  vo

same as that of the carbonic acid.
    We may therefore infer that the volume                  mixed gases           of
evolved     isprecisely  equal                to

  The following are the experimental                                    results which         I       have

in the reversal that takes place. The right side of the tithono
type corresponds to the right side of the original object, and
the left to the left. In the Daguerreotype it is not so.
    Copper tithonotypes were first made in this city by Mr.
Endicott, a lithographic artist of distinction.
   There is no great difficulty in obtaining from these titho
notypes duplicate copies. An expert artist can multiply them
from one another.
   The problem of multiplying the beautiful productions of
M. Daguerre is therefore solved.
        I
      will take this opportunity of making a remark which                                      I
intended to have inserted in my paper “On the rapid De
tithonizing Power of certain Gases and Vapours,” inserted in
the March Number of this Journal (S. 3. vol. xxii.). Ama
teurs, in the Daguerreotype process, are often annoyed by the
want of success which frequently attends them. They ascribe
to the atmosphere, or to the light, or to other causes, their                                in
ability to obtain impressions.        Most of these mischances are
due to the accidental presence of the vapour of iodine, or other
electro-negative bodies, in the chamber or about the apparatus.
It is incredible what a brief exposure to these vapours will en
tirely destroy a picture before it is mercurialized.                  If the
iodine box or the bromine bottle is kept in the same room with
the mercury apparatus, that circumstance in itself is often
sufficient to ensure an uniform want of success.                   the little If
frame which fits into the back of the        camera,     and which holds
the silver   plate,  be used in the   iodizing   process,   as is often the
case, the small quantity of vapour it absorbs will destroy every
picture, or at            all

XXII.    On the Use of Lightning-Conductors in India, with
  reference to a passage in Mr. Snow Harris's work on Thunder
  Storms.    By W. B. O'SHAUGHNEssy, M.D., F.R.S., Hon.
   East India Company's Service.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
   N the work just published by Mr. Snow Harris on “Thun
    der Storms,” there appears at p. 177, an assertion that “the
Governor-General and Council of the Honourable East India
Company were led to order the lightning rods to be removed
from their powder magazines and other public buildings,
having in the year 1838 come to the conclusion, from certain
representations of their scientific officers, that lightning rods
were attended with more danger than advantage.” Mr. Harris
then refers in a note to Correspondence between the Honour
able Court of Directors, Mr. Daniell, and myself, as his au
thority for this statement.
   As this assertion of Mr. Harris is altogether unfounded on
fact, and is moreover calculated to do me serious injury,              I
beg permission, as a subscriber of many years to your excel
lent Journal, to offer proof in your pages that no such mea
sures as those specified by Mr. Harris were ever recom
mended or carried into effect in Bengal by the parties, or at
the time he mentions.
   I inclose (No. 1) a copy of the report by the civil architect
of Fort William, showing that in 1838, by my suggestion and
advice, additional conductors were erected on and around the
Government House of Calcutta.
  I  also inclose a copy of a note with which     Ihave been fa
voured by Lord Auckland, showing that no orders were given
to remove the conductors from public buildings in India;
that the powder magazines in that country had not been pro
vided with conductors previously to 1840; and that the only
discussion which occurred there, was as to the number and
position of the rods to be erected for the protection of such
buildings.             I
                       have the honour to be, Gentlemen,

of north latitude, and 81° and 91° of west longitude. It includes the
States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Du
buque and Mineral Point districts of the territories of Jowa and
Wisconsin. The observations recorded are the results of numerous
excursions in those provinces, commenced in the year 1834, and
continued to the present time by Dr. Owen, sometimes alone, at
others accompanied by Dr. Troost and Dr. Locke, the state geologists
respectively of Tennessee and Ohio. Though the territory under
consideration occupies an area of about half a million of square miles,
its geological features are remarkably uniform.             With a few partial

   We next in descending order arrive at a group of bituminous,
aluminous shales and associate limestones, the lowest of which
affords a valuable water cement. In the shale there are no fossils
except a few slight impressions, apparently of seeds or seed-vessels.
Where the shale is replaced by indurated clay, Dr. Troost has found
Encrimites and Polypifera, and the “encrinital limestone” over the
shale in Tennessee is rich in Crinoidea.           Atrypa prisca, Orthis lu
nata vel orbicularis, Terebra sinuosa, Calymene bufo, and Asaphus ma
crurus occur in the water limestone. The shale, Dr. Owen considers,
must probably be referred, as well as the water limestone, to the
lower Ludlow, and may be regarded as the equivalent of the Hel
derberg group and Marcellus shales of the New York geologists.
The encrinital limestone and the green ferruginous rock of Indiana
may correspond with the Aymestry limestones.
   Next in order is a group consisting almost wholly of compact
limestones, lying in thick beds without any interstratified marls or
shales. This rock is best developed towards the north-west, and in
certain districts becomes a true magnesian limestone upwards of
500 feet in thickness.     It closely approximates, both in lithological
character, mineral contents, and even proximity to the coal mea
sures, the “scar limestone" of England, and were it not for the or

     2. On the Ridges, Elevated Beaches, Inland Cliffs and Boulder For
 mations  of the Canadian Lakes and Valley of the St. Lawrence. By
 Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S., F.R.S.*
    After adverting to his former paper on the Recession of the Falls
 of Niagara, and the observations which he made jointly with Mr.
Hall in the autumn of 1841+, Mr. Lyell gives an account of addi
tional investigations made by him in June 1842; in the course of
which he found a fluviatile deposit similar to that of Goat Island, on
 the right bank of the Niagara, nearly four miles lower down than
 the great Falls. The freshwater strata of sand and gravel here
 alluded to occur at the Whirlpool.       They are horizontal, about forty
feet thick, plentifully charged with shells of recent species, and are
placed on the verge of the precipice overhanging the river.          They
are bounded on their inland side by a steep bank of boulder clay,
which runs parallel to the course of the Niagara, marking the limit
of the original channel of the river before the excavation of the great
ravine.   Another patch of sand, with freshwater shells, was detected
on the opposite or western side of the river, where the Muddy Run
flows     in,
          about       mile above the Whirlpool.

184     Mr. Lyell    on the Ridges, Elevated Beaches, &c.
nudation the valley appears to have been submerged and filled up
with sand, gravel, and boulder clay, 300 feet thick.
    A description is next given of certain modern deposits, containing
freshwater shells, on the western borders of the Niagara, above the
Falls, and in Grand Island, in order to show that the future reces
sion of the Falls may expose patches of fluviatile sediment similar to
those in and below Goat Island.
    The author then passes to the general consideration of the boulder
formation on the borders of Lakes Erie and Ontario, and in the
valley of the St. Lawrence, as far down as Quebec.             Marine shells
were observed in this drift at Beauport, below Quebec, as first pointed
out by Captain Bayfield, and also near the mouth of the Jacques
Cartier river, and at Port Neuf and other places; also at Montreal,
where they reach a height probably exceeding 500 feet above the sea,
the summit of Montreal mountain being 760 feet high, according to
Bayfield's trigonometrical measurement, and the shells being sup
posed to be 240 feet below the summit.             These shells, therefore,
being more than 300 feet above Lake Ontario, we may presume that
the sea in which the drift was formed extended far over the territory
bordering that lake. The most southern point at which the author
saw fossil shells belonging to the same group as those of Quebec was
on the western and eastern shores of Lake Champlain, viz. at Port
Kent and Burlington, in about lat. 44° 30'. Here, and wherever
elsewhere the contact of the drift is seen with hard subjacent rocks,
these rocks are smoothed, and furrowed on the surface, in the same
manner as beneath the drift in northern Europe.               The species of
shells  occurring  in the  drift, to which Mr.    Lyell   has made some ad
ditions, are not numerous, and are all, save one, known to exist, but
are inhabitants, for the most part, of seas in higher latitudes.      Many
of them are the same as those       occurring  fossil at Uddevalla and other
places in Scandinavia, and they imply the former prevalence of a
colder climate when the drift originated.       At Beauport there are large
 and far-transported boulders, both in beds which overlie and under
lie these marine shells.
    The author next describes the ridges of sand and gravel surround
 ing the great lakes, which are regarded by many as upraised beaches.
 He examined, in company with Mr. Hall, the “Lake ridge,” as it is
 called, on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, and other similar
ridges north of Toronto, which were formerly explored by Mr. Roy”,
and which preserve a general parallelism to each other and to the
 neighbouring coast.      Some of these have been traced for more than
 100 miles continuously.       They vary in height from ten to seventy
 feet, are often very narrow at their summit, and from fifty to 200
 yards broad at their base.        Cross stratification is very commonly
 visible in the sand;   they   usually  rest on clay of the boulder forma
 tion, and blocks of granite and other rocks from the north are occa
 sionally lodged upon them. They are steeper on the side towards
 the lakes, and they usually have swamps and ponds on their inland
 side ; they are higher for the most part and of larger dimensions

to   the osars     inSweden, and conceives that, like them, they are not
simply beaches which have been entirely thrown                             the waves         up      by

 rests on the soft red marl, seen at the base of the river-cliff at Lewis
 town.    These several falls would each recede further back than the
 other in proportion to the greater lapse of time during which the
 higher rocks were exposed before the successive emergence of the
 lower ones.      Three falls of this kind are now seen descending a
 continuation of the same rocks on the Genesee River at Rochester.
 Their union, in the case of the Niagara into a single fall, may have
 been brought about in the manner suggested by Mr. Hall”, by the
 increasing retardation of the highest cataract in proportion as the
 uppermost limestone thickened in its prolongation southwards, the
 lower falls meanwhile continuing to recede at an undiminished pace,
 having the same resistance to overcome as at first.
    Mr. Lyell considers the time occupied by the recession of the Falls
 from the Whirlpool to be quite conjectural, but assigns a foot rather
 than a yard a year as a more probable estimate; thus he shows the
 Mastodon, found on the right bank near Goat Island, though asso
 ciated with shells of recent species, to have claim to a very high an
 tiquity, since it was buried in fluviatile sediment  before the   Falls had
 receded above the Whirlpool t.
    3. Notice on   a Suite of specimens of Ornithoidicnites, or foot-prints
 of  Birds on the New Red Sandstone of Connecticut.             By Gideon
 Algernon Mantell, LL.D.,       F.R.Sf.
    These specimens were accompanied by a letter from Dr. James Deane
of Greenfield, Massachusetts, the original discoverer of the Ornithoi
 dicnites, of which more than thirty varieties had been found, bearing
a striking resemblance to the foot-prints of birds.       In this letter Dr.
Deane gives an account of his discovery of the impressions eight or
nine years ago, and which he then communicated to Professor Hitch
cock.     He remarks, that “the footsteps are invariably those of a
biped, and occur on the upper surface of the stratum, while the cast
or counter-impression is upon the lower.       In some instances we may
follow the progress of the animal over as many as ten successive
steps.”     He has seen a course of steps twelve inches in length by
eight in breadth, extending several rods. The intervening space was
uniformly four feet.     One impression of a foot was fourteen inches in
length.    The impressions are accompanied by those of rain-drops.

      Mr. Lyellon            the    Tertiary Strata of Martha's Vineyard. 187
Palaeoniscus. In the sandstone between the fish-beds he discovered an
Ornithoidicnite, and observed numerous slabs exhibiting impressions
of rain-drops and ripple-marks. The rain-marks appear as if the rain
had been driven by a strong wind, and the direction of the impressions
indicated that the wind blew from the west, a quarter from which
violent squalls or thundergusts are still prevalent in these latitudes.
    5. On the Tertiary Strata of the Island of Martha's Vineyard in
Massachusetts.     By Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S., &c."
    The most northern limit to which the tertiary strata bordering
the Atlantic have been traced in the United States is in Massachu
setts in Martha's Vineyard, lat. 41° 20' north, an island about
twenty miles in length from east to west, and about ten from north
to south, and rising to the height of between 200 and 300 feet above
the sea. The tertiary strata of this island are, for the most part,
deeply buried beneath a mass of drift, in which        huge erratic blocks           lie
of   granite and other rocks which appear          have come from the        to
 north, probably from the mountains         New Hampshire.        The ter

  188   Mr. Lyellon the Tertiary Strata of Martha's Vineyard.
  Cetacea, crustacean remains and casts of Tellina and Mya. These
  prevail at intervals through a thickness of nearly 100 feet, and are
 followed by beds of sand and clay with lignite.        Mr. Lyell found no
 remains in the red      clays.   Many   rolled bones were found in the
 osseous conglomerate.
     In the section at Chilmark similar strata to those at Gay Head
 occur, but the general dip is south-west.        Some of the folds, how
 ever, give anticlinal dips to the north-east as well as the south-west,
 and there are many irregularities, the beds being sometimes vertical
 and twisted in every direction.      Several faults are seen and veins of
 ironsand, which intersect the strata like narrow dykes, as if there had
 been cracks filled from above.      One bed of osseous conglomerate at
 Chilmark, four yards in thickness, is vertical, and its strike is well
 seen to be north 25° east, so that the disturbances have evidently
 been so great that it would be difficult without more sections to de
 termine positively the prevailing strike of these beds.       The incum
 bent drift is very variable in thickness, and large erratics, from twenty
 to thirty feet in diameter, are seen resting on quartzose sand. The
 author saw no grounds for concluding that any cretaceous strata
 occur anywhere in the island, nor could he find any fossils which
 appeared to have been washed out of a cretaceous formation into the
 tertiary strata, as some have suggested.
    Mr. Lyell proceeds to the consideration of the organic remains
 collected by himself in Martha's Vineyard.
    Mammalia.-1. A tooth, identified by Prof. Owen as the canine
 tooth of a seal, of which the crown is fractured.         It seems nearly
allied to the modern Cystophora proboscidea.
    2. A skull of a walrus, differing from the skulls of the existing
species (Trichecus rosmarus, Linn.), with which it was compared by
Prof. Owen, in having only six molars and two tusks, whereas those
of the recent have four molars on each side, besides occasionally a
rudimentary one. The front tusk is rounder than that of the recent
walrus.
    3. Vertebrae of Cetacea, some of which are referred by Prof. Owen
to the Whalebone-whales,         and others to the Bottle-nosed (Hy
peroodon).                                         -
    Pisces.—Teeth of sharks resembling species from the Faluns of
Touraine, viz. Carcharias megalodon, Oryrhina riphodon, O. hastulis,
and Lamna cuspidata.        With these were large teeth of two species
of Carcharias, one resembling C. productus, a Maltese fossil. With
the exception of the two last, Mr. Lyell found the same species in
miocene strata near Evergreen, on the right bank of James River in
Virginia.
    Crustacea.—A species considered by Mr. Adam White as probably
belonging to the genus Cyclograpsus, or the closely allied Sesarma
of Say, and another, decidedly a Gegarcinus.
    Mollusca.-1. Casts of a Tellina allied to T. biplicata, a miocene
fossil, and of another near T. lusoria.      2. Cast of a Cytherea resem
bling C. Sayana, Conrad.        3. Three casts of a Mya, one of which
bears a close resemblance to Mya truncata.

      Mr.   J. H.   Cooper on Fossil Bones found in Georgia.                            189
   Mr. Lyell concludes, from the various evidence here given, that
the strata of Martha's Vineyard are miocene. The numerous re
mains of Cetacea of the genera Balana and Hyperoodon are adverse
to the supposition of their being Eocene, while such fossils abound
in the miocene beds of America.    The other fossils all point to a
similar conclusion.
  6. Letter from      J.   Hamilton Cooper, Esq.,      to Charles Lyell, Esq.,
V.P.G.S., On Fossil          bones found in digging the New Brunswick Canal
in Georgia”.
    Mr. Cooper prefaces his communication by a description of the
country surrounding the locality in which the bones were found.
The portion described is that part of the sea-coast of Georgia which
lies between the Alatamaha and Turtle rivers in one direction, and
the Atlantic Ocean and the head of tide water on the other.           For
twenty miles inland the land is low, averaging a height of from ten
to twenty feet, and reaching, in some instances, forty feet, and con
sisting of swamps, salt-marshes, sandy land, and clay loam. It then
suddenly rises to the height of seventy feet, and runs back west at
this elevation about twenty miles, at which point there is a similar
elevation of between sixty and seventy feet. The whole of this
district is a post-tertiary formation, and is composed of recent allu
vium, and a well-characterized marine post-pliocene deposit. The
recent alluvium is divided into inland-swamp, tide-swamp, and salt
marsh.     The two last occupy a shallow basin having a depth of about
twelve   feet, the bottom and sides of which are the post-pliocene for
mation.     This the author divides into three groups, in the last of
which, constituting the elevated sand hills, no organic remains have
been found; in the two former marine shells of existing species occur.
    The fossil bones of the land mammalia discovered by Mr. Cooper,
were found resting on the yellow sand and enveloped in the recent
 clay alluvium.    Their unworn state and the grouping together of
many bones of the same skeleton, render it highly probable that the
carcasses of the animals falling or floating into a former lake or
stream, sank to the sandy bottom, and were gradually covered to
their present depth by the sedimentary deposits from the water.
Among them were remains of the megatherium, Mastodon giganteum,
mammoth, hippopotamus and horse. The fossil shells found in the post
pliocene, were species at present existing on the neighbouring shores.
    The facts narrated by Mr. Cooper lead to the following conclu
sions —1st. That the post-pliocene formation extends further south
than Maryland, to which it has hitherto been limited. 2nd. The co
existence of the megatherium with the mammoth, mastodon, horse,
bison, and hippopotamus. , 3rd, That the surface of the country has
undergone no sudden or violent change since those animals inhabited
it,  which  is proved      by
                           the absence     all tracesofdiluvial action of                in
the   enveloping  alluvium       surrounding country.

 ever changes    of temperature may have taken place since that time,

   the  temperature  of the ocean at a period prior to the existence of
   the  megatherium,   the mastodon, and the hippopotamus was such as
   is congenial to the present marine testacea of Georgia.
     7. On the Geological position of the Mastodon giganteum and as
  sociated fossil remains at Bigbone Lick, Kentucky, and other localities
  in the United States and Canada.   By Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S*.
     With a view to ascertain the relations of the soil in which the
 bones of the Mastodon are found, to the drift or boulder formation,
 whether any important geographical or geological changes had
 taken place since they were imbedded, and what species of shells are
 associated with them, Mr. Lyell visited a number of places where
 they had been obtained.            In this paper he gives the result of his
 researches.
    The most celebrated locality visited was Bigbone Lick, in the
 northern part of Kentucky, distant about 25 miles to the S.W. of
 Cincinnati, situated on a small tributary of the river Ohio called
 Bigbone Creek, which winds for about 7 miles below the Lick before
 joining the Ohio. A “Lick” is a place where saline springs break
 out, generally among marshes and bogs, to which deer, buttaloes, and
 other wild animals resort to drink the brackish water and lick the salt
 in summer. The country around Bigbone Lick, and for a consider
 able distance on both banks of the Ohio, above and below                                                          it,

 the oldest members           the transition   of Silurian system. The strata
                                                                           or
 are  nearly   horizontal and form flat table-lands intersected by nume
 rous  valleys      which alluvial gravel and silt occur; but there

The Mastodon and other quadrupeds have been mired before the de
position of the incumbent silt, for a considerable number of fossil
bones have been found by digging through         Accompanying the                it.

     Mr. Lyell    observes that the surface                         of   the bog       is    extremely uneven,
and accounts for             it   partly by the unequal distribution  the incum                      of
bent alluvium, which presses with           heavy weight      a  certain parts                on                          of
the morass, from which other portions           the surface are entirely free.
                                                                     of

192         On the Distribution and Associations of the
giganteum    were found associated with existing species of Mollusca
in gravel and marl below peat.
    Genesee.—Here remains of the Mastodon giganteum were found
with existing shells in a small swamp in a cavity of the boulder for
mation, so that the animal must have sunk after the period of the
drift when a shallow pond fed by springs was inhabited by the same
species of freshwater mollusca as now live on the spot.
   Albany and Greene Counties.—Mr. Lyell examined, in company with
Mr. Hall, two swamps west of the Hudson River, where the remains
of Mastodon occurred in both places at a depth of four or five feet,
precisely in such situations as would yield shell marl, and peat,
with remains of existing animals in Scotland.       Cattle have recently
been mired in these swamps.
    According to Mr. Hall the greatest elevation at which Mastodon
bones have been found in the United States is at the town of Hins
dale, situated on a tributary of the river Allegany in Cattaraugus
county in the State of New York, where they occur at an elevation
of 1500 feet above the level of the sea.
    Maryland.—In the museum at Baltimore, Mr. Lyell was shown
 the grinder of a Mastodon, distinct from M. giganteum, and which
had been recognised and labelled by Mr. Charlesworth as M. lon
girostris, Kaup. It was found at the depth of 15 feet from the sur
face in a bed of marl near Greensburgh, in Carolina County, Mary
 land, and is considered by Mr. Lyell as a miocene fossil.
    Atlantic border.—Between the Appalachian mountains and the
 Atlantic there is a wide extent of nearly horizontal tertiary strata,
 which at the base of the mountains are 500 feet and upwards in
 height, but decline in level nearer the ocean and at length give place to
 sandy plains and low islands skirting the coast, in which strata con
taining marine shells of recent species are met with, slightly eleva
ted above the sea.         Occasionally deposits formed in freshwater
swamps occur, below the mean level of the Atlantic or over
flowed at high tide.      In this district Mr. Nuttall discovered, on the
 Neuse 15 miles below Newburn, in South Carolina, a large assemblage
of mammalian bones, including those of the Mastodon giganteum, rest
ing on a deposit containing marine shells of recent species.          Mr.
Conrad presented Mr. Lyell with the tooth of a horse covered with
barnacles, from this locality.      Professor Owen has examined it and
could find no corresponding tooth of a recent species, but considers
it as agreeing with the horse-tooth brought by Mr. Darwin from the
north side of the Plata in Entre Rios in South America.
   South Carolina.-Remains of the Mastodon were found in dig
ging the Santee Canal, in a spot where large quadrupeds might now
sink into the soft boggy ground.
    Georgia.—Bones of the Mastodon and Megatherium occur in
this district in swamps formed upon a marine sand containing shells
of species now inhabiting the neighbouring sea”.
   Mr. Lyell in conclusion offers the following observations:—
   1. That the extinct animals of Bigbone Lick and those of the At
                              * Ante, p. 189.

              Megatherium in North and South America.             193
 lantic border in the Carolinas and in Georgia belong to the same
 group, the identical species of Mastodon and elephant being in both
 cases associated with the horse, and while we have the Mylodon and
 Megatherium in Georgia, the Megalonyx is stated by several authors
to have been found at Bigbone Lick".
    2. On both sides of the Appalachian chain, the fossil shells,
whether land or freshwater, accompanying the bones of Mastodons,
agree with species of Mollusca now inhabiting the same regions.
    3. Under similar circumstances Mr. Darwin found the Mastodon
and horse in Entre Rios, near the Plata, and the Megatherium, Me
galonyx and Mylodon, together with the horse, in Bahia Blanca in
Patagonia; these South American remains being shown by their
geological position to be of later date than certain marine Newer
Pliocene, and Post-pliocene strata.     Mr. Darwin also ascertained
that some extinct animals of the same group are more modern in
Patagonia than the drift with erratics.
   4. The extinct quadrupeds before alluded to in the United States
lived after the deposition of the northern drift, and consequently the
coldness of climate which probably coincided in date with the trans
portation of the drift, was not as some pretend the cause of their
extinction.
  [* One of the conclusions to which the facts narrated by
Mr. J. Hamilton Cooper, in his paper (anté, p. 189) on fossil
bones found in Georgia, lead, is “the co-existence of the
megatherium with the mammoth, mastodon, horse, bison, and
hippopotamus.”      Mr. Lyell states, above, the co-existence of
the elephant (mammoth) and mastodon with the horse in the
Bigbone Lick and in the Carolinas; and also, on the authority
of Mr. Darwin, that of the mastodon and horse near the
Plata, and of the megatherium, megalonyx, mylodon, and
horse in Patagonia.      A parallel case, to a certain extent, is
afforded in the extreme north of the American continent, by
the association in Eschscholtz Bay, of bones of the elephant
(mammoth), bison (urus), musk-ox, deer, and horse; and if
the writer of this note be correct in assigning to the megathe
rium a cervical vertebra, hitherto unappropriated, in the col
lection from Eschscholtz Bay, the parallelism of the case there
presented with that occurring in Georgia will be very close;
since in both localities we shall then have the co-existence of
the megatherium, mammoth, horse, and bison.         And further,
the  megatherium   will then  appear  to have extended from the
extreme south   (Patagonia)  to the extreme north (Eschscholtz
Bay) of the New World; and to have been associated,
                                                        through
out   itsrange, with the horse,    ifnot indeed with the other
mammalia here enumerated. The former association,          Ame

                                     obtained in the autumn of
last year, with the electric boiler which I then used, induced
me to offer to procure one to be made, of a large size, and
upon an improved construction, for the Polytechnic Institu

discharged steam, it will act as well as it has done in the
open air.
    Ishall now endeavour to give you a general idea of the na

 to cause the electricity to pass in short sparks, instead of a
 uniform current.
      The collective periods during which the machine was in
 action, while accomplishing these effects, amounted to about
 an hour and a quarter, but by using very narrow tubes, and
 operating upon small quantities of liquid,                    could obtain  I
 equally decisive results in the        space   of eight   or ten minutes.
    In  making      some   experiments     similar  to  the  one I have just
 described,      I  perceived that when the electric current was
 passed through two glass vessels containing pure water, and
 communicating with each other by means of wet cotton, the

 negative pole, and subsided below                                 in

the positive pole, indicating the transmission                  water        of

being then put             action the following singular effects pre
                          in
sented    themselves.
   1st.  A   slender column           water, inclosing the silk thread
                                          of                                                         in
its centre, was instantly formed between the two glasses, and
the silk thread began            move from the negative towards the
                                     to
positive pole, and was quickly                       all
                                             drawn over and deposited
in the positive glass.
   2nd. The column of water after this continued for                       few                 a
seconds suspended between the             glasses      before,         as
                                                                but without
the  support       ofthe thread;     and  when        broke   the  electricity
                                                                   it
passed    sparks.
         in
   3rd. When one end                  of
                            the silk thread was made fast      the                             in
negative glass, the water diminished      the positive glass, and
                                                               in
increased     the
                in negative  one;   showing  apparently that the
motion    of
           the  thread, when free      move,  was     the reveree
                                                       to                        in
direction   the current of water.
            of

200                Mr. Armstrong's Account of a
     4th. By scattering some particles of dust upon the surface
 of the water, I soon perceived by their motions that there
 were two opposite currents passing between the glasses, which,
judging from the action upon the silk thread in the centre of
 the column, as well as from other less striking indications,      I
 concluded to be concentric, the inner one flowing from nega
 tive to positive, and the outer one from positive to negative.
 Sometimes the outer current, or that which I assumed to be
 such, was not carried over into the negative glass, but trickled
 down the outside of the positive one; and then the water,       in
 stead of accumulating as before in the negative glass, dimi
 nished both in it and the positive glass.
    5th. After many unsuccessful attempts, I succeeded in causing
 the water to pass between the glasses, without the intervention
 of the thread, for a period of several minutes; at the end of
 which time I could not perceive that any material variation
 had taken place in the quantity of water contained in either
 glass. It appeared therefore that the two currents were nearly,
 if not exactly equal, when the inner one was not retarded by
 the friction of the thread.
     As you are so much more competent than           I  am to draw
 conclusions from this curious experiment, I shall not ad
  vance any opinion upon the subject, further than by observing
  that it appears to me to be eminently calculated to elucidate
  the nature of the electric current.
     It  is proper to state that I found it essential to the success
 of this experiment, that the water in the glasses should be
  perfectly pure. The slightest contamination caused the water
 to boil upon the thread, instead of passing between the glasses
  in the manner I have described, and the instant the thread
  became nearly dry, it was destroyed by the heat elicited by the
  current of electricity. To ensure success it was necessary to
  use water distilled in glass vessels, for I found that the common
  distilled water which I obtained at the chemists' shops, was in
 general insufficiently pure for the purpose.
     Amongst various other cases of electro-chemical action ef
  fected by this machine, I may instance the coating of a small
  silver coin with copper, by attaching it to a platina wire which
 formed the negative pole in a solution of sulphate of copper,
 but a long-continued action of the machine was required be
 fore this was accomplished.       I may also mention the decom
  position of iodide of potassium to such an extent as to colour
 a deep blue wine-glass-full of the solution in a very short time,
 when starch and a few drops of hydrochloric acid were present.
  When the hydrochloric acid was omitted, the mixture in ge
 neral changed to an amber instead of a blue colour.

               of a   view   of certain Electrolytic Experiments.                        203
potash, or copper for instance, are subjected to electrolysis, it
is the base which is the direct subject of electrolyzation, the
liberation of acid and evolution of hydrogen being secondary
results.    Objecting to this opinion, the distinguished author
of the letter alleges “there is nothing, I think, that should                  I
have anticipated less than that a solution of sulphate of
soda would be affected by the voltaic current precisely in
 the same way as a solution of caustic soda, or that the
 powerful affinities of the acid and the base should have no
 influence upon the result.”
     In reply to this objection, I beg leave to point out, that so
 far is the direct influence of chemical affinity from being
 hostile to electrolysis, that the more energetic the attraction
  between the elements of an electrolyte, the more is it suscep
  tible of electro-chemical decomposition.    According to Fara
  day, “from the period when electro-chemical decomposition
  was first effected to the present time, it has been a remark
  that those elements which in the ordinary phaenomena of che
  mistry were most directly opposed to each other and combine
  with the greatest attractive force, were those which were most
  readily evolved at the opposite extremities of the decom
  posing bodies.” (See Researches, page 198, paragraph 669.)
   But if electrolysis be not impeded by the direct resistance of
  the chemical affinity, is it consistent that it should be con
  trolled by an indirect resistance of the same force, such as is
  exercised between the acid and the soda in the case under con
 sideration?
    3. Professor Daniell, in support of the view of the subject
 which he has taken, alleges, that “it will be easy for Dr. Hare
 to convince himself by a few easy experiments that a solution
 of sulphate of soda submitted to electrolysis becomes acid
 in the zincode division of a diaphragm cell, not only by the
 abstraction of sodium from        but   it,          by
                                            the accumulation      acid              of
 transferred from the   platinode  division;  just       will find   as   he                 an
 accumulation      soda of   the latter arising from the secondary
                                   in
 action of the sodium transferred from the former.”
    The ingenious author                of
                                  these allegations has, however,
 omitted        to
             show  that,   supposing   them        true, they will
                                                           to   be                           be
 more consistent with the idea, that the electrolyte which
  undergoes decomposition               is   an
                                     oxysulphionide than        oxide.             an
                 that,  according       either conception, there can

               of                           oxygen evolved

  anode?
         4.   Agreeably       to  the idea that oxysulphionide    sodium       of
 is   the subject       of   electrolysis,     by
                                              series
                                                  a        of
                                                      decompositions and

204           Dr. Hare   on    Prof. Daniell's Defence
recompositions, an atom of oxysulphion is liberated at the
anode, while an atom of sodium is liberated at the cathode.
These severally, by acting on water, are converted into soda
and oxysulphionide of hydrogen, evolving at the cathode one
atom of hydrogen for each atom of soda, and one atom of
oxygen at the anode for each atom of oxysulphionide of
hydrogen, or in other words, for each atom of free sulphuric
acid.
   5. Agreeably to the idea that oxide of sodium is the elec
trolyte, for each atom of water decomposed by the sodium
                               ..
evolved at the cathode, there will be an atom of hydrogen
evolved, and an atom of soda generated, while for each atom
 of oxygen liberated at the          by the decomposition of the
 soda, in which it existed, there will be an atom of acid set
 free, or according to the nomenclature of Professor Daniell,
 left in the state of oxysulphionide of hydrogen.     Hence con
 sistently with either view of the phaenomena, the transfer of
acid and soda can only proceed pari passu, atom for atom,
with the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen at the anode and
cathode respectively.
    6. According to Professor Daniell, “it is my oversight of
 the fact that the acid accompanies the oxygen to the zincode
while the metal travels to the platinode, that causes his ex
periments with the membrane to appear to me complicated
and confused.”      It was stated in my pamphlet, that when by
means of a membrane dividing the space between electrodes,
two fluids were subjected to the voltaic current, as for instance
a solution of potash and sulphate of copper, there would be,
according to one way of viewing the subject, a continuous
row of oxygen anions from the cathode to the anode; the
cathions being on one side of the membrane potassium, on
the other copper. According to the view preferred by Daniell,
the anions on one side would be oxygen, on the other oxy
sulphion, but evidently oxysulphion could not pass by elec
trolytic decomposition and recomposition beyond the point at
which it is replaced by oxygen in the row of anions. Of course
it is as inconsistent with one view as the other, that free acid
“oxysulphionide of hydrogen” should be liberated within the
zincode cell when not containing a sulphate.
    7. No effort is made by the distinguished Professor to ex
plain how the copper can, as alleged by him, yield up       its
                                                           charge
                    hydrogen, without uniting with the oxygen
of of
     electricity
               in to
    the water,     which that hydrogen existed.
    8.  The allegation that the precipitation     the copper en
                                                  of
sues because  “   that metal finds   nothing   to by
                                                combining    with
which    it can complete its course,” seems            be
                                                    coupled with

           of a view of certain Electrolytic Experiments.                                                       205
error; first, because in                      a chemical point                of view, a metal can
not displace the hydrogen of water without uniting with
the oxygen; and secondly, because no electrolysis can origi
nate without a simultaneous action ensuing in                the anions                     all
and cathions forming the electrolytic row, subjected                  the                                  to
decompositions and recompositions essential               that   process.              to
Had there been         anion     no

                                                to

Agreeably         my apprehension,            well might           repre

   We are principally indebted for our knowledge of the phae
nomena of storms to three observers, W. C. Redfield and
J. P. Espy of the United States”, and Colonel Reid, whose
labours, whether at present successful or not in leading to a
full explanation of their action, must ever be regarded with
an interest, independent of that which attaches to them merely
as important acquisitions to science, because of their being
undertaken at the instigation of benevolence, in order if pos
sible to mitigate the sufferings of mariners, by enabling them
to escape sooner than they otherwise would from the fury of
those terrific scourges of tropical seas.

lonel Reid has inserted in his work charts of two storms, the
data of which are extracted from Redfield's writings; and
hence we may suppose them at least as well adapted as any
others to illustrate the opinions he is supporting.  Below are
given the numbers of each wind for sixteen points of the com
pass (the directions being taken from the data themselves);
their striking discordance with the equality required will be
seen, and also that it is very little diminished by adding the
results of each storm together, showing that there are certain
points of the compass almost entirely wanting to complete the

These storms were both moving from S.S.W.                                          to N.N.E.,
 hence the deficiency of the north and south points and those ad
jacent cannot result from the progressive motion.
    W. C. Redfield has endeavoured to obtain evidence in fa
 vour of this theory from the tracks exhibited by vessels ex
 posed to hurricanes; with what success will appear from the
following instance. He says (American Journal of Science,
 vol. xxxi. p. 123),              “It
                               can but seldom happen however that
 the track of a vessel which scuds through a gale will fully de
 velope the entire circle of the wind, the combination of                                     cir
 cumstances necessary to this result being but rarely encoun
 tered; still I have obtained notice of a few such cases. A
 respectable ship-master not long since informed me, that he
 once scudded for twenty-four hours under a typhoon in the
 Chinese Sea, and on               its
                               departure found himself nearly         the                 in
position where           he
                       first took the   gale.”
    Now supposing the progressive motion               the hurricane   of                      to
have been      atthe rate           of

hours the storm would have moved 360                miles,     space the
                              assigned                 as
                                                                                 of a

    Ifit be thought that the objections here brought forward
are not founded on sufficient observations to amount to a re
futation of this theory, it will at least be allowed, that viewing
it in the most favourable light, it remains simply as an hypo
thesis, assumed to account for certain phaenomena, towards
proving the truth of which nothing has yet been done, though
it is one which is from      nature capable its    being tested                of                             by

position of the sun; but in one very material circumstance the
regions about the equator are subject to a variation to which
temperate regions are not exposed; this is the alternate north
and south declination of the sun, occasioning at some periods
of the year a partial or entire reversal of the regular currents
of the atmosphere, and thus producing the apparent disparity
between the storms of temperate and tropical latitudes.
    The facts which may be considered as established regard
ing hurricanes within the tropics are the following: the wind
at the onset of the storm usually blows from north-east, ge
nerally more easterly than the trade-wind, and sometimes from
north or north-west.          After blowing some time a calm fre
quently ensues, after which the wind again blows as violently
as before, but from south-east or south-west.           On the east side
of the storm the wind veers from north to south (sometimes
without the intervention of a calm) by east, but on the western
side frequently if not always by west.             The barometer falls
during the first part of the storm, and rises again with the
second part.       Hurricanes commencing about the 10th or 15th
degrees of latitude, advance in a curve somewhat of a para
bolic form, from east-south-east to west-north-west, until about
the 30th degree of latitude, when their direction gradually
changes towards east; and they then advance towards north
north-east or north-east until latitude 40° or 45°.
   I  have not thought it necessary to adduce any particular
instances in support of these facts; they are well established by
the observations of Redfield and Reid, and are those upon
which the theory advocated by them is founded.
    Now storms of high latitudes in like manner consist of two
portions, but the first is from south or south-west, which de
presses the barometer, and the second from north-westor north
east, which restores it to                its
                                     former elevation;      calm     lull

generally predominant on the eastern side, and the north on
the western; but the latter, which now must ultimately pre

November 29, 1836, appeared in the north of Germany after it

 British storms which have moved towards south of east.
   But it will also follow that those regions which are visited
by storms, which have arisen within the tropics and have
moved from them into high latitudes, will have storms of two
characters; the one progressing, as those which are the sub
jects of this paper, towards north-east, and the other, those
originating within themselves, which move towards south of
east.  Such a region is America and the portion of the At
lantic adjacent to           its
                         coast; and this seems       have given rise    to

quoting Redfield's language regarding the north-east progress
of the storms      the United States, says, “Perhaps they some

where I found a communication from M. C. le Fremy, upon
“The Action of the Alkaline Peroxides on Metallic Oxides.”
Since the appearance of this memoir, which has been followed
by researches by the same author on the combination of pot
ash with the oxides of zinc, tin, &c., various notices have
been published by MM. Trommsdorff, Wackenroder and
Poggendorff, on the subject of this combination of oxygen,
potassium and iron, confirming the existence of this purple
red compound, and pointing out various modes of obtaining                                              it.
 I    had expected that M. Fremy would have extended his
inquiries and ascertained the composition             this new oxide       of
of  iron; but
                        of as

withdrawing it by a tube and mixing with a large quantity of
distilled or of lime water (which latter seems to possess the
property of checking the rapidity of the decomposition of this
potash salt when very dilute), to ascertain whether the subsi
dence of the uncombined oxide of iron was so complete that
an apparently inappreciable quantity was held in suspension;
a certain quantity of this clear amethystine solution was trans
ferred to a retort of a known capacity—leaving, of course, a
portion of atmospheric air in the upper part of the body and
in the neck of the retort; this quantity of air was accurately
determined by previous measurements and graduation of the
retort; heat was then applied, and the contents of the retort
raised to violent ebullition which was continued so long as
any gas was evolved; these gaseous products were collected
over water, and when no more gas was liberated absorption
was allowed to take place by withdrawing the lamp from the
retort; any air which the retort then contained was added to
that already collected, and when the gas had acquired the
temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, it was measured,
the known bulk of atmospheric air originally contained in the
neck and upper part of the retort subtracted from        and the                                   it,

acids, including carbonic acid, but less readily by sulphuric
acid than by the others.       When strongly heated it evolves
water and   oxygen  gas. As diluted nitric acid appeared to de
compose this salt without the formation and evolution of any
but oxygen gas,    I selected this acid as the agent of analysis.
    Having procured a very thin light flask with a long narrow
neck of the capacity of about four fluid ounces, it was about
half filled with dilute nitric acid, which, together with the
flask, weighed 1862:05 grs., to this 33'16 grs. of the red bary
tic salt were gradually added, a rapid evolution of oxygen en
sued with every addition of the barytic ferrate; at the expira
tion of twenty-four hours the flask and contents were weighed
i.
 = 1891-94 grs., which indicates a loss of 3.27 grs. of oxygen
       the solution was of a light pink colour, showing that
  ecomposition was not wholly effected; but this entirely dis
appeared, and the solution became colourless on the addition
of two drops of weak hydrochloric acid to the warm solution,
evidencing so small an amount of the undecomposed salt as
not to be worth considering: this solution evaporated to dry
ness, redissolved, and filtered, gave 2.78 grs, of silica and sul
phate of barytes.     On the addition of sulphate of soda to the
solution sulphate of barytes was precipitated, which, washed,
dried and ignited, weighed, exclusive of ash of filter, 24.64
grs.; the oxide of iron precipitated by ammonia gave 8-88
grs, leaving 2:09 for water and loss.
    A second experiment upon a portion of this salt, prepared
at a subsequent period to that used in the first experiment,
and adapting a tube containing chloride of calcium to the
flask, gave from 47-47 grs. of the compound, 4’31 grs, of oxy
gen, and, exclusive of ash of filters, 0:48 grs, of silica, &c.,
 37-82 grs. sulphate of barytes, and 1527 grs. of sesquioxide
of iron, leaving 2.63 grs, for water and loss.
    A third experiment gave 3.06 grs, oxygen, 69 grs, of silica,
&c., 27.163 grs, sulphate of barytes, and io'86 of oxide of iron
 from 34-47 grs. of the red barytic salt.
                            I
    To obtain the water, merely heated the ferrate gradually
                                till
and gently on a sand heat       it   assumed  a  greenish colour,
 rejecting those experiments which were partially converted
 into light drab colour, which
     a                             is   an

gen. 64-48 grs.    of  ferrate lost 493 grs., and 44:41 lost 2.91
grs.;    by
          ignition this green residue was converted into draba
 coloured powder, apparently with the loss    of   half an equiva
 lentof  oxygen, which residue, treated with dilute nitric acid,
                                                                   in
 evolved oxygen gas. Now, estimating the loss sustained
 these experiments     as water and taking the mean, ferrate       of
 barytes when pure will contain 7.2 per cent.      of   water, and

 3.38 grs., and 2.44 grs., a result, as will be seen by reference,
 so near the loss sustained in analysis, that the difference may
 fairly be reckoned as merely an error of experiment. The
 results obtained from the three foregoing analyses, reckoning
 the loss as water and deducting the silica and sulphate of bary
 tes as impurities, will give respectively 30°38 grs., 46.99 grs.,
 and 33.78 grs., as the quantities of pure ferrate of barytes
 operated upon, yielding—

 quioxide of iron, 3:35 of oxygen, and 2:31 of water contained
in 37-06 of ferrate barytes.
    The 11-64 parts of sesquioxide of iron are composed of
 8:15 of iron and 3:49 of oxygen, which uniting with the 3-55
of oxygen gas (within '06 of a grain in 37.06 grs. of the quan
tity theoretically required), will yield 15.19 of teroxide of iron,
or ferric acid, combined with 19:56 parts of barytes, indi
cating the formula Bao FO, HO as the composition of this
salt.

                                                   .
    I therefore consider the acid oxide of iron present in the
deep amethystine solution of the potash salt, and in combina
tion with barytes in the crimson-red barytic salt, to be a ter
oxide of iron, containing twice the quantity of oxygen exist
ing in the sesquioxide.           Whether the           salt obtained by
the agency of chlorine is another and distinct combination of
iron with oxygen, forming a still more highly oxygenated com
pound than ferric acid,        I  am at present unable to state, but     I
am inclined to this    opinion;     it is certain, however, that another
acid oxide of iron exists, probably of a lower degree of oxida
tion than the ferric acid. The combination of this acid with
potash or soda is of a beautiful emerald-green colour, pre
cisely similar to the green manganate of potash. The condi
tions requisite to procure this compound I am at present un

clude also, that on the whole, “it seems right to admit that the effect
is greater when dissimilar metals are used;" but he has not been able
to satisfy himself of the truth of the statement, that when the cop
per coin is heated, and the plate of copper kept very cool, the effect
is increased.     His experiments on the effect of heat generally show,
it is stated,—“1st, that heat much increases the rapidity of the ra
diation, even when the object is not in direct contact ; and 2nd, that it
takes place much more energetically from gold and silver than from
copper (a copper plate being used). They also show that a perma
nent” spectrum is to be considered only as a higher degree of that
produced or rendered apparent by breathing.
    “Heat does not seem to increase the effect of metal coins on glass.
Neither did long contact.” The polished surfaces not appearing
capable of receiving the impressions are “talc [talc-mica], and, among
the metals tried, steel to a certain extent, platinum and gold;" and
experiments are described which, in the author's words, “seem            al
most sufficient to establish the important general principle, viz. that
the less metals are oridable by eayosure to the air, the less is their sus
 ceptibility to receive spectra.”
    Mr. Prater draws the following conclusions from his experiments
as regards comparative polish in metals.         “All these experiments
show that the dissimilarity of metals is not of such importance as
has been conceived: they show the difference wanted to produce
the effect is a difference in brightness or oxidation, i. e. as far as a
permanent and good impression, showing the lettering, &c., is con
cerned; for I find when left on the plate half an hour or so, tarnished
or polished metals give equally good spectra. But in this case the
spectrum is only made apparent by breathing, and of course shows
 nothing of the lettering, &c. However, even in this case, the spec
 trum of the tarnished sovereign disappeared less soon by breathing
 on it than did that of the polished one; so in reality the spectrum
 of the former may be said to have been the most perfect.
     “The same remark applies to a glass plate.
     “As regards the effect of interposed substances. As every sub
 stance tried left a spectrum, I did not much expect that the influence
 would permeate any lamina, even of the thinnest description.           Ac
 cordingly when a sovereign or shilling was left twenty-four or forty
 eight hours on a piece of stiff, though very thin, paper, it gave no
 spectrum, but the mark of the paper was alone visible.         The expe
 riment was    repeated,  half the coin  resting  on the  copper  plate and
 half on the   paper:   and although  it remained a   fortnight in this po
 sition, the half only in contact with the plate was visible by breathing
 on the paper, leaving       own spectral image just

rendered probable by observing that coins placed on a thick copper
plate seldom were in perfectly close contact, yet gave good spectra.
In order to come to a more definite conclusion on this point, I got a
lamina of bright copper, even thinner, and as elastic as the platinum
lamina above-mentioned.         Gold or silver coins left twenty-four hours
on this, gave a spectrum scarcely visible, but on leaving a half-sove
reign for two or three hours on it exposed to heat of 160°, as above,
and pressed down by exactly the same weight, the half-sovereign left
a permanent spectrum very well marked indeed.
    “The result of this experiment obviously shows, that, although
thinness and elasticity may have some little effect, the principal
cause for the formation of the spectrum is the peculiar chemical na
ture of the metal, and that a spectrum cannot be produced on a non
oridable metal such as platinum.         Bright silver and copper plates are
well known to tarnish by exposure to the atmosphere (the former
perhaps rather by forming a sulphuret than an oxide), but no matter
how.      I have also found that spectra could be formed on tin and
zinc plates, both of which of course are oxidable.             So on copper
coated with mercury, the mercury in such case no doubt readily tar
nished (see section 7, Polished surfaces not receiving spectra, ante,
p.226). Having decided that the effect in question is due neither to
light nor heat, to what cause it may be asked is it to be ascribed P
    “Conclusions.—1st. As brightness of the plate is indispensable,
and with brightness must exist an increased tendency to tarnish,
or enter into chemical combination;               2ndly, as the plate must
be of an oxidable     metal,  and  judging   from the experiments with sil
ver and copper the more oxidable the better; 3rdly, as the more
perfectly the coins are cleaned and dried” the less the effect; and as a

against this view, that the action takes place when the coins and
plate are both heated, and hence quite dry.                 But this is no solid
objection, for the adage “corpora non agunt nisi sint soluta' is not
true, as hundreds of examples in chemistry show. The very fact of
heat itself increasing the effect is all in favour of a chemico-mecha
nical view, for heat increases the tendency of copper to oxygenation,
and tends also to volatilize any feeble acid matter on the coins. But
again, if it be said the spectrum rubs off, even when permanent and
clearly defined (as we have shown), and leaves a polished surface under
it, this we admit; but still this surface has suffered an almost im
perceptible degree of oxygenation; for so slowly does this effect take
place, that it is only visible when much advanced, as will be evident
to any person who watches the gradual tarnishing of copper plates.
Moser's discovery shows that very slight chemical action is often
going on, which has been previously overlooked.

 attraction of glass and oxidable metallic plates for dust, &c. is very
 great, and is perhaps dependent on the same causes as their attrac
 tion for oxygen. Whether or not, I feel pretty well convinced, after
 a laborious investigation of the discovery in question, that it is...not
 of that wonderful character that Moser and others have supposed;
 nor calculated to alter our ideas of vision or of the nature of light.
 On the contrary, I think with Fizeau (a short notice only of whose
 memoir I have seen), that no effect of any consequence is produced
 where organic matters are carefully removed by boiling water and po
 lishing; for such is perhaps the philosopher's opinion just named,
 and in as far as our opinions agree he has the priority. Begun by a
 purely catalytic action, it is only continued and developed in any
 marvellous degree when those circumstances are present that permit
 it to assume a more strictly chemical character.”
    In the Athenaeum, No. 815 (1843, p. 557), our correspondent,
 Mr. Hunt, has replied to Mr. Prater's observations:—“I am not,”
 he says, “satisfied that Mr. Prater has succeeded in proving that the
 effect is due neither to light nor heat, and I must most decidedly ob
ject to his conclusion, that the effect is due to a mechanico-chemi
 cal action, or a catalytic action; meaning thereby an action so slightly
chemical as, in the present state of the science to be scarcely appre
 ciable.'    I have shown, in a paper published in the Philosophical
 Magazine for April [preceding volume, p. 270], that chemical decom
position could be brought about, in some metallic salts, by the jux
 taposition of metallic plates; that the iodides of copper and of gold
 were reduced to the metallic state by being allowed to remain for a
 few weeks under a copper plate with a well-amalgamated surface,
the salts and the plate being nearly a quarter of an inch apart.                 I
have since that time succeeded in decomposing many other salts in
a similar manner. These facts may appear to confirm Mr. Prater's
 idea.    We must of course consider the decomposition as a chemical
phaenomenon : but this change is effected by the influence of an
agent which bears a strong analogy to light, but which is separated
from it by many broad distinctions.            I am by no means wedded to
the   opinion   that heat is the active   principle.     That the phaenomena
described    by  Moser and     myself  are accelerated by the application of
heat,  all  my experiments render certain, and this           indeed admitted
                                                                      is

I  have stated that the   vapours        of
                                        mercury   and iodine attack the plate
differently.  I    find that   many   impressions   which we cannot render
visible  by breathing    on  the plates,      or   by
                                                 exposing them       the vapour to

of the vapours of water or of mercury, are readily evoked by the
vapours of iodine, bromine, or by sulphuretted hydrogen gas. It
appears to me that some very curious relations are yet to be traced
out between the vapours of bodies and solids on which they may be
condensed.”
  In No. 817 of the Athenaeum (1843, p. 598), Mr. Prater replies
to Mr. Hunt in the following terms:—
   “Moser's Discovery.—It is easier to demolish old theories than
establish new ones; and though I must continue to think the expe
riments detailed in my essay on Moser's discovery prove the effect
is neither due to heat nor light, I did not presume to say they proved
the correctness of the chemico-mechanical theory proposed by my
self. That theory seems to me the most satisfactory one hitherto
advanced; but perhaps future experiments may require it to be mo
dified.   At present however I have met with no experiments whose
results are incompatible with such theory.      I have lately looked over
the papers of Prof. Draper and Mr. Hunt in the Philosophical Ma
gazine, published during the last three or four months; but as in
none of these experiments interposed substances or screens were
used, nor the necessary precaution of boiling as well as polishing
used, I cannot see that either Fizeau's or my own experiments [are]
proved, in any way, inconclusive by the results obtained by the gen
tlemen just mentioned. Mr. Hunt did a great service to the subject
by his discovery of the power of heat to increase the effect; but as
he has not shown he can decompose the iodides of copper or gold by
mercurial plates placed nearly a quarter of an inch above them, when
a screen is interposed, the probability is that the iodides merely vo
latilized (as Mr. Faraday some time ago proved, even mercury itself
as well as many other substances, to do) at the common temperatures
of the air. The effect then in question seems to be a mere chemical
action produced by direct contact.      If future experiments prove it
can be done without such contact, it will then be time to think about
some new mysterious agency.         But even admitting Prof. Draper's
very valuable experiments to countenance such an agency (at pre
sent doubtful, as Mr. Hunt himself has well attempted to show), I
do not see we are at          all
                           nearer proof that such agency        concerned

having commenced the action propagates it in the manner of a fer
ment.    Not only is such an action of hyponitrous acid with regard
to nitric acid unnecessary, but it would be contrary to the oeconomy
of nature, which never proceeds so indirectly. Besides, it is too
evident that nitric acid totally free from hyponitric acid may com
mence action on metals, either when cold or at a higher temperature,
and if it begins, it may a fortiori continue                              it.

   If instead of exposing these mixtures to common temperatures,
they are heated to 212°, the results are totally different: mercury is
separated, and bichloride of mercury is found in the liquid; this
may be shown by agitation with aether, by evaporation and treating
the residue with iodide of potassium, protochloride of tin or hydro
sulphuric acid. When the liquors are concentrated, the presence of
a persalt of mercury may be detected by iodide of potassium. With
hydrochlorate of ammonia ebullition is quite unnecessary, the re
action taking place almost instantly, and with the aid of aether, the
bichloride of mercury formed in the solution is readily separated from
 it.When the chlorides        potassium      sodium are rendered impure

ADDITION TO THE MEMOIR OF M. MENABREA ON THE ANA
    LYT1cAL ENGINE.           SCIENTIFIC MEMOIRs, vol. III. PART
    XII.  P. 666.
    Much misapprehension having arisen           as to the circumstances
attending the invention and construction of Mr. Babbage's Cal
culating Engines, it is necessary to state from authority the facts
relating to them.
    In 1823, Mr. Babbage, who had previously invented an Engine
for calculating and printing tables by means of differences, under
took, at the desire of the Government, to superintend the con
struction of such an Engine. He bestowed his whole time upon
the subject for many years, refusing for that purpose other avo
cations which would have been attended with considerable pecu
niary advantage. During this period about £17,000 had been
expended by the Government in the construction of the Differ
ence Engine. A considerable part of this sum had from time
to time been advanced by Mr. Babbage for the payment of the
workmen, and was of course repaid; but it was never contem
plated by either party that any portion of this sum should be
appropriated to Mr. Babbage himself, and in truth not one sin
gle shilling of the money was in any shape whatever received
by Mr. Babbage for his invention, his time, or his services, a
fact which Sir Robert Peel admitted in the House of Commons
in March 1843.
    Early in 1833 the construction of this Engine was suspended
on account of some dissatisfaction with the workmen, which it
is now unnecessary to detail. It was expected that the interrup
tion, which arose from circumstances over which Mr. Babbage
had no control, would be only temporary.                    About twelve
months after the progress of the Difference Engine had been
thus suspended, Mr. Babbage discovered a principle of an en
tirely new order, the power of which over the most complicated
arithmetical operations seemed nearly unbounded.                The inven

tion of simpler mechanical means for executing the elementary
operations of that Engine, now acquired far greater importance
                                                                 -
than   it had hitherto   possessed.
   In the Engine for calculating      by differences, such simplifications
 affected   only  about a hundred and twenty similar parts, while
 in the  new,   or Analytical Engine, they might affect several thou
 sand. The Difference Engine might be constructed with more
 or less advantage, by employing various mechanical modes for
 the operation of addition.          The Analytical Engine could not
 exist without   inventing   for it amethod of mechanical addition pos
  sessed of the utmost    simplicity.   In fact it was not until upwards
 of twenty different modes for performing the operation of addition
 had been designed and drawn, that the necessary degree of simpli
 city required for the Analytical Engine was ultimately attained.
     These new views acquired great additional importance from
 their bearings upon the Difference Engine already partly exe
 cuted for the Government; for if such simplifications should be
 discovered, it might happen that the Analytical Engine would
 execute with greater rapidity the calculations for which the Dif
 ference Engine was intended; or that the Difference Engine
 would itself be superseded by a far simpler mode of construction.
     Though these views might, perhaps, at that period, have appear
 ed visionary, they have subsequently been completely realized.
    To have allowed the construction of the Difference Engine to
 be resumed while these new views were withheld from the                  Go
 vernment, would have been improper; yet the state of uncer
 tainty in which those views were then necessarily involved, ren
 dered any written communication respecting their probable bear
 ing on that engine a matter of very great difficulty. It therefore
 appeared to Mr. Babbage that the most straightforward course
 was to ask for an interview with the head of the Government,
and to communicate to him the exact state of the case. Various
circumstances occurred to delay, and ultimately to prevent that
interview.
    From the year 1833 to the close of 1842, Mr. Babbage repeat
edly applied to the Government for       its   decision upon the subject.
These    applications  were    unavailing.   Yearsof    delay and anxiety
followed each      other, impairing    those   energies  which were now
directed    tothe invention   of    the Analytical Engine. This state
of    uncertainty had many injurious effects.          It  prevented Mr.
Babbage from entering into any engagement with other Govern
ments respecting the Analytical Engine,           by     which       he
                                                                    might
have been enabled      to employ   a  greater number   of  assistants, and
thus   to  have applied his faculties only      to    the highest depart
ments   of  the  subject,  instead of  exhausting   them    oninferior ob
jects, that might have been executed with less fatigue by other

                      Mr.       Babbage's Calculating           Engines.                          237
heads.    It also became necessary, from motives of prudence,
that the heavy  expense incurred for this purpose should be spread
over a period of many years. This consideration naturally caused
a new source of anxiety and risk, arising from the uncertain
tenure of human life and of human faculties,       a reflection ever
present to distract and torment the mind, and itself calculated
to cause the fulfilment of                its
                               own forebodings.
    Amidst such distractions the author             the Analytical Engine
                                                              of
has   steadily  pursued    his  single  purpose.      The numberless mis
representations         the facts connected with both Engines have

  The mode of combining the various sections of which the En
gine is formed has been examined with unceasing anxiety, for
the purpose of reducing the whole combination to the greatest
possible simplicity. Drawings of almost    the plans thus dis                            all
cussed have been made, and the latest            the drawings (bearing              of
the number 28) shows how        many   have been superseded, and also,
from        its

ALTHOUGH
  the results which      were obtained from my researches on
 cerium and lanthanium I had no intention of making any
 communication on the subject on the present occasion, yet
 after hearing the interesting statement of Professor Scheerer,
 it appeared to me that it might be useful to make known more
generally some particulars which arose during my labours,
and principally because this advantage may result, that other
chemists, after becoming acquainted with what I am about to
state, may possibly be spared the loss of valuable time which
might otherwise have been fruitlessly expended.
                                      I
    When sixteen years since made some experiments upon
cerium, several circumstances occurred which led me to the
supposition that oxide of cerium was accompanied by some
                           fº
other oxide, which, however,          I
                                  did not succeed in separating,
and want of materials     prevented   me from then prosecuting
the inquiry. A few years since, having procured a quantity
of cerite and cerine,             from thence the double salt of
sulphate of the oxide of cerium with sulphate of potash, which
salt was washed with a solution of sulphate of potash, until
the passing fluid gave no trace of precipitate with caustic am
monia or carbonate of soda.               I
                                   believed that in this manner
I  could obtain a  pure  salt free from               all
                                             foreign substances,

 The double salt was afterwards decomposed in the moist way
 with carbonate of soda, and with the carbonate of protoxide
 of cerium thus obtained,                      all
                             the preparations have been made
 which will be now mentioned.
    After    long examination     various salts      protoxide
                                                        of                             of                    of

 sisting   the supposed new oxide, the presence      which, how                            of
 ever, appeared more and more probable         the course      the               in                    of
 experiments.    As was known that cerium gives two oxides,
                                 it
I  considered    probable that
                      it        hydrate     protoxideif    cerium           of                    of

Some of the results which                  I
                                    obtained unfortunately became
known to the public. When we find the oxide of a body                                     hi
therto unknown, nothing, generally speaking, is easier than the
determination of the qualities of the body, and I therefore ex
pected to be able to give a complete account of my experiments
in a very short time, but on this point I was much deceived.
That which, in the first place, gives any value to chemical                               in
vestigation, is the certainty that the object investigated is pure,
that is to say, free from foreign substances.           I had not made
much     progress  in the details of   my  inquiry,   when it appeared
that what I at first considered to be      pure   oxide of lanthanium,
was, in point of fact, a mixture of the new oxide with a num
ber of other substances, so that in the course of the experi
ments I succeeded in separating no less than seven different
substances, one after the other. The first, to my great sur
prise, was lime, in no considerable quantity; and I have found
that sulphate of lime and sulphate of potash forms a double
salt sparingly soluble. Afterwards the following oxides were
successively separated, and by the application of different
means, namely, oxide of iron in large quantities, of copper,
tin, nickel, cerium, and something resembling uranium, &c.;
but even the oxide which remained after the separation of all
these substances, left me in nearly the same position which I held
at the commencement of the researches, so that, although at
                                      I
the end of the year 1839 had already been fortunate enough
to obtain oxide of lanthanium tolerably pure, it was not until
the beginning of the following year that                         I
                                                    was able, with any
facility, to obtain a larger quantity of                   it;

when they are formed by the combination of the oxide of lan
thanium with uncoloured acids, are absolutely colourless, as
well as the most concentrated solutions of the same.       Salts of
lanthanium have a sweet,       slightly astringent taste, and the
solution of them can be completely separated from oxide of
lanthanium by the addition of sulphate of potash in sufficient
 quantity, because the double salt formed by sulphate of oxide
 of lanthanium and sulphate of potash is quite insoluble in a
 solution saturated with sulphate of potash. The atomic weight
 of oxide of lanthanium, as it has hitherto appeared in most
 instances, has oscillated about 680, a number which, however,
 possesses no scientific value, when, as I have already remarked,
 an absolutely pure oxide has not yet been obtained.
     Of the salts produced, I will only briefly describe a few of
 the most characteristic. Sulphate of oxide of lanthanium cry
 stallizes in small six-sided prisms terminated by six-sided
 pyramids, containing three atoms of water of crystallization.
  This salt has the same property as sulphate of yttria, thorina,
 and other oxides of the same class, namely, being much less
 soluble in warm than in cold water. At 73°4 Fahr. one part
 of anhydrous sulphate of oxide of lanthanium requires 42%
 parts of water to be dissolved, but of boiling water one part
 of the same salt requires about 115 parts.
     The crystals are very slowly dissolved, but the anhydrous
  salt is immediately dissolved.    The anhydrous salt developes
  much heat when mixed with a little cold water, and the salt
  then forms a crystalline crust, which afterwards is very slowly
  dissolved.    If powdered sulphate of oxide of lanthanium be
 thrown into water whose temperature is 35°-6 or 37°4 Fahr.,
  and kept stirring, and with the precaution that the liquid,
  which besides should be cooled from the outside, never attains
  a higher temperature than 55°-4 Fahr., one part of sulphate
  of oxide of lanthanium may be dissolved in less than six parts
  of water, and the solution preserved unchanged for weeks, in
  closed vessels, and within the stated limits of temperature;
  but if the liquid be gradually heated, then before the tem
  perature has reached 86° Fahr., a number of crystalline
  groups composed of small needles radiating from a common
  centre begin to deposit, and when once this crystallization has
  commenced it cannot be checked, however rapidly we may
  cool the liquid. With regard to the number and form of
  the deposited groups, the originally clear liquid is changed in
  a few minutes to a thin pap.     If during the dissolution of the
  salt  according   to the manner stated, a part of the liquid
  acquires a higher temperature through the heat that is deve
  loped by the union of the salt with water, the crystallization

     Oxide of didymium heated upon platina foil with carbonate

 didymium which is precipitated by caustic ammonia, can be
 washed without passing through the filter.

                           On Yttria, Terbium and Erbium.
   I published last summer a short notice of yttria, concerning
which earth the following facts subsequently discovered merit
attention.  When I stated on the former occasion that pure
yttria, as well as the salts of that base with a colourless acid,
are colourless, my experiments had only gone so far as to show
that   allthe yttria which         could procure for examination
                                               I
might with ease          separated into two portions, the one
                                  be
stronger and colourless base, the other             weaker, which,         a                          in a
proportion         was free from yttria, acquired
                  as                                      more intense

of the latter.
        If
      the name of yttria be reserved for the strongest of these
bases, and the next in order receives the name of oxide of
terbium, while the weakest be called oxide of erbium, we
find the following characteristic differences distinguishing the
three substances:—The nitrate of yttria is extremely deli
quescent, so much so that if a small portion of a solution of
that salt be left for weeks in a warm place, the salt produced
will not be free from humidity. The solution of nitrate of
oxide of terbium, which is of a pale reddish colour, soon eva
porates, leaving a radiated crystalline mass, which does not
change in air unless it be very damp. The crystals of sul
phate of yttria are colourless, and remain clear and transparent
for weeks in air at a temperature varying from 86°Fahr. to
158° Fahr., while a solution of sulphate of oxide of terbium
yields by evaporation, at a low temperature, a salt which im
mediately effloresces to a white powder. Oxide of terbium, the
salts of which are of a reddish colour, appears, when pure, to
be devoid of colour, like yttria. Oxide of erbium differs from
the two former in        propertyits   becoming       ofdark orange           of   a
yellow colour when heated           contact with

pitate following each addition be washed and dried apart, we
obtain basic salts, of which the last precipitated are colourless,
and contain yttria only. Going backwards in reverse order from
these last, we find the precipitates becoming nearly transpa
rent, reddish, and containing more and more oxide of terbium,
while the first precipitates contain the greatest proportion of
oxide of erbium, mixed with oxide of terbium and yttria.           If
a solution of ordinary yttria in nitric acid be treated in the
same manner, and the several precipitates be heated sepa
rately, the first precipitate will give a dark yellow oxide, the
colour of each succeeding one will be paler and paler, till at
last a white oxide will be obtained, consisting chiefly of yttria,
with a trifling quantity of oxide of terbium.      In making these
experiments it is of importance that the yttria be free from
iron, uranium, &c., a matter of considerable difficulty.        It is
 therefore better to commence precipitating with a weak solu
 tion of hydrosulphuret of ammonia, and when the precipitate
 has no longer a shade of bluish green, then to apply the caustic
 ammonia as described.        A better method in general is to add
 a portion of free acid to a solution of yttria, and then to drop
 in a solution of binoxalate of potash, continually stirring till
 the precipitate no longer redissolves.      In a couple of hours a
 precipitate will form, which is to be separated, and the re
 maining solution treated as above described, and that as long
 as any precipitate is formed.      If the remaining fluid be then
 neutralized with an alkali, a small quantity of nearly pure
 oxalate of yttria is obtained. Of the precipitates the first ob
 tained are most crystalline, and fall quickly, the last more
 pulverulent, sinking slowly.      The former contain most oxide
  of erbium, mixed with oxide of terbium and yttria; the next
  contain less oxide of erbium, more of terbium and yttria; while
  the latter contain more and more yttria, mixed with oxide of
  terbium.    The first precipitates are always reddish, and the
  last colourless.   If  a mixture of the oxalates of these bases
  be treated with a   very diluted acid, we obtain first a salt con
  taining mostly yttria, then one richer in oxide of terbium, and
  the remainder contains principally oxide of erbium.         I have
  even once succeeded in     obtaining  a double salt of sulphate   of
  potash and sulphate of oxide of erbium (which is with difficulty
  dissolved in a saturated solution of sulphate of potash), by
   treating a somewhat concentrated solution of the nitrates of
  oxide of terbium and erbium with an excess of sulphate of
  potash.
      That much time and labour have been employed in arriving
   even at the results which     I have hitherto obtained, will be

particularly when it is considered that one or two grains of
yttria have often been divided into nearly a hundred precipi
tates, which have been individually examined; but I live in
hopes that the knowledge already obtained will soon enable
me to publish a more complete account of my investigations.

    Besides, as the friction of the plate disengages variable quan
tities of electricity, which also go on decreasing, it was neces
sary to be independent of this cause of error. With this view
I  made use of a good Leyden jar, the interior armature of
which communicated with the machine, and the exterior with
the lower wire of the tube. Here again the spark darted
from the great ball of the jar to that of the conductor inter
rupted in the liquid of the tube, to a distance independent of
the colour of the glass which closed the opening of the case
(but less than that to which it passed by the mere discharge
of the jar itself).

   It  is perhaps impossible to isolate the effects of any one of
the imponderable fluids in an absolute manner, and in parti
cular those of electricity and of heat. It is interesting to search
out the relations which connect these two universal agents, as
well in order that our speculations on their nature may be
rendered more conformable to experimental truth, and on ac
count of the part that each of them tends to play in the Oeco
nomical applications of the other.

 independent of the state of electric tension of   surface       the          its             or

   I  wished to control this result by another process, by sub
stituting a secondary for a direct electric tension.                         A copper
vessel supported by a light tripod of wood was filled with olive
oil, a Leyden jar was placed in the centre of the liquid, the
exterior coating of which was in contact with the vessel and
the interior connected with the machine.                           A rod of brass
terminating on one side by a chain which descended upon the
ground, on the other side presented a ball a little distance
from the copper vessel in order to allow this complex appa
ratus to become charged.                     The machine was put in motion
in such a manner that the deviation of the electroscope indi
cated a constant tension.                 Two series of observations gave 9
for 27° of cooling.

    Lastly,     I wished to examine            the case of porous bodies. The
method which I            adopted       as the most simple and the least
incorrect, after various trials, consists in placing some hollow
cylinders of wood, such as oak and poplar, in the centre of
a thin metallic grating, (that of a calorimeter of Lavoisier and
Laplace) but wider by three quarters of an inch, placed on
the wooden tripod near the machine. The cylinders were
 made of a single piece without varnish and provided with a

XXXII.       On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity, and
    on the Mechanical Value of Heat.     By J. P. Joule, Esq.”
ITelectric
    is pretty generally, I believe, taken for granted that the
            forces which are put into play by the magneto
electrical machine, possess, throughout the whole circuit, the
same calorific properties as currents arising from other sources.
And indeed when we consider heat not as a substance, but as
a state   of vibration, there appears to be no reason why it
should not be induced by an action of a simply mechanical
character, such, for instance, as is presented in the revolution
of a coil of wire before the poles of a permanent magnet. At
the same time it must be admitted that hitherto no experi
ments have been made decisive of this very interesting ques
tion; for     all                  particular part
                    it of
                 them refer                       to   the circuit
                                                         a                                   of
only, leaving       matter
                         a                      of
                              doubt whether the heat observed
was generated,       merely transferred from the coils
                             or                              which                                 in
the magneto-electricity   was induced,  the coils themselves be
coming cold.    The latter view did not seem          me very im                        to
probable, considering the facts which     had  already  succeeded  I
in proving, viz. that the heat evolved      the voltaic battery          by                                   is
definitef for the chemical changes taking place          the same                             at
time; and that the heat rendered “latent”          the electrolysis                in
of water   is  the expense
                   at                            of
                                the heat which would otherwise
have been evolved         free state                          by
                                         the circuitf-facts which,
                                     in
among others, seem                to a
                          prove that arrangement only, not gene
ration   ofheat, takes place     the voltaic apparatus; the simply

                                              Effects
  The general plan which                  I   proposed to adopt in my experi
ments under this head, was to revolve a small compound
electro-magnet, immersed in a glass vessel containing water,
between the poles of a powerful magnet; to measure the elec
tricity thence arising by an accurate galvanometer; and to
ascertain the calorific effect of the coil of the electro-magnet
by the change of temperature in the water surrounding                                            it.
    The revolving electro-magnet was constructed              the fol                  in
lowing manner:      Six plates

                               ribbon a    oiled silk.    Twenty-one

of a previous experiment, in which, by revolving the appara

274                Mr. Joule      on the   Calorific Effects
  On comparing the corrected results in column 5 with the
squares of magneto-electricity given in column 6, it will be
abundantly manifest that the heat evolved by the coil of the
magneto-electrical machine is proportional (catteris paribus)
to the square      of the current.
   Column 7, containing the heat due to voltaic currents of
the quantities stated in column 2, is constructed on the basis
of three very careful experiments on the heat evolved by
passing currents through the coil of the small compound
electro-magnet.          I
                        observed an increase in the temperature
of the water    equal  to 5°3, 5°46, and 5°-9 respectively, when
2.028, 2.078, and 2: 145 of current voltaic electricity were
passed, each during a quarter of an hour, through the coil.
Reducing the first and second experiments to the electricity
of the third according to the squares of the current, we have
5°93, 50.82 and 5°-9 for 2-145 of current. The mean of these
is 5°88, a datum from which the theoretical results of the
preceding and subsequent tables are calculated.
   But in comparing the heat evolved by magneto-, with that
evolved by voltaic electricity, we must remember that the
former is propagated by pulsations, the latter uniformly.
Now since the square of the mean of unequal numbers is
always less than the mean of their squares, it is obvious that
the magnetic effect at the galvanometer will bear a greater
proportion to the heat evolved by the voltaic, than the mag
neto-electricity; so that it is impossible to institute a strict
comparison without ascertaining previously the intensity of
the magneto-electricity at every instant of the revolution of
the revolving electro-magnet.              I
                                         have not been able to devise
any very accurate means for attaining this object: but judging
from the comparative brilliancy of the sparks when the com
mutator was arranged so as to break contact with the mer
cury at different positions of the revolving electro-magnet
                             i.
with respect to the poles of the stationary electro-magnet,
there appeared to be           little variation in the intensity of the
magneto-electricity during # of each revolution.               The re
maining # (during which the revolving electro-magnet passes
the poles of the stationary electro-magnet) is occupied in the
conversion of the direction of the electricity.          In the experi
ments   all flow     electricity during this

Were A           a w'   B, &c. perfect rectangles, it is obvious that the
heat due to a given deflection                   of the galvanometer would be
                                             Fig. 5.
# of that due to the same deflection and an uniform current,
and column 8 of the table would contain exact theoretical
results.  But as this is not precisely the case, the numbers in
that column are somewhat under the truth.
   Bearing this in mind in the comparison of columns 5
and 8, it will,           I
                   think, be admitted that the experiments
 afford decisive evidence that the heat evolved by the coil of
 the magneto-electrical machine is governed by the same laws
 as those which regulate the heat evolved by the voltaic ap
paratus ; and exists also in the same quantity under compa
 rable circumstances.
    Although very little doubt could exist with regard to the
 heating power of magneto-electricity beyond the coil, I thought
 it would nevertheless be well to follow it there, in order to
 render the investigation more complete: I am not aware of
 any previous experiments of the kind.
   I  immersed five or six yards of insulated copper wire of ºth
 of an inch diameter in a flask holding about 12 oz. of water.
 The terminals of the wire were connected on one hand with
 the galvanometer of five turns and on the other with the com
 mutator, and the circuit was completed by a wire extending
 from the galvanometer to the other compartment of the com
 mutator.    The revolving electro-magnet was now subjected
 to the inductive influence of the large electro-magnet excited
 by ten cells in a series of five double pairs, and rotated at the
rate of 600 revolutions per minute during a quarter of an hour.
 The needle of the galvanometer, which remained as usual
pretty steady, indicated a mean deflection of 32°40' = 0.31
of current: and the heat evolved was found to be 0°46, after
the correction on account of the temperature of the surround
ing    air
         had been applied.      Another experiment gave me 0°4
for 0.286. The mean            the two  of  0°43 for 0.298 current
                                                       is

  That this is the true explanation of this variation can scarcely,
I think, admit of doubt; it requires of course that the press
ure of the atmosphere near the southern confines of the mon
soons should vary simultaneously with that of the northern,
but in the opposite direction, and that at the equator, or mid
way in the course of each monsoon, it should remain nearly
stationary throughout the year; and also that the variation
should be general throughout the zone of the tropics, because
although the atmospheric currents in only some portions of it
have the regular alternations of monsoons, they are everywhere
more or less influenced both in force and direction by the
movement of the sun in declination.       I am not aware of any
observations in the   longitudes  of India or China to enable
us to answer the first of these questions with regard to the
monsoons themselves, but the occurrence of the variations in
the required order in the longitudes of the New World is
shown by the observations given by Humboldt in his “Perso
nal Narrative;” the results of which with regard to this sub
ject, he thus states (English edit., vol.      747):—“It in

of  tropical hurricanes, by checking the acceleration of the
southern or upper current.
    The differences of the two descriptions of storms, with re
gard to the fall of the barometer and the extent of each parti
cular portion of the hurricane, are well compared by Professor
Dove to those between a deep ravine with precipitous sides,
and an extensive valley with gentle declivities; a comparison
however holding much more truly with regard to the views
here taken, than to those adopted by Professor Dove in ad
vocating the hypothesis of a whirlwind”.
   It will be easily seen that these differences arise from the
difference in the force of the wind. The more violent the wind
the more rapid will be the fall of the barometer, but at the
same time the resistance to the force of the wind will increase
more rapidly also, and overcome it in less time than when the
wind is less violent.
   The remaining differences are obviously referable to the same
origin as those generally existing between the meteorological
phaenomena of these two divisions of the globe,         the great
complexity of the causes which affect the distribution of heat
and atmospheric vapour in temperate regions as compared
with those of the tropics. Thus whilst in the latter each storm
is generally one individual phaenomenon, the former are fre
quently visited by them in rapid succession, each succeeding
one appearing before the subsidence of the last, and thus
often preventing the regularityof the succession of the currents,
here described as belonging to tropical gales and sometimes
to these, being observed.
    An interesting observation regarding the locality of hurri
canes has been made by Col. Reid, which is the fact of the
exemption from them of the region adjacent to St. Helena,
whose position occurs on the line of least magnetic intensity,
as drawn on Major Sabine's chart; not however as Col. Reid
appears to suggest, as pointing out the existence of a force
not previously recognised as at work in the movements of the
atmosphere, but as indicating the connexion between the              lo
calities of storms and climate; Sir David Brewster having
shown the relation existing between the isodynamic magnetic
lines and the isothermal lines; both these series of lines
agreeing in general in their deviations from the circles of la
titudes, the lines of greatest magnetic intensity following those
of greatest heat. The dependence of the force of the wind on
the relative difference of temperature of adjacent latitudes, has
been before shown with regard to seasons; storms will be

 most violent therefore where this is the greatest; and thus
 arises the great violence of the storms on the American coast,
 compared with that in general of British storms.
         If
       then I have been successful in my attempt to establish the
 views set forth in this essay, all the more important phaeno
 mena of the wind may be simply classed with those of the
 southerly and northerly breezes of our own climate, the
 various directions of the wind arising either from the simple
 deflection of one of the currents by the rotation of the earth, or
 from the collision of the two currents after being so deflected;
 the barometer rising or falling, as the density of the one or
 the momentum of the other prevails. But there yet remains the
  ultimate step in this inquiry, to discover the immediate or
  proximate cause of the descent of the upper current at any
  particular time.
     The principal difficulty to be overcome seems to be, that the
 descending air is warmer, and therefore lighter than that pre
 viously occupying            place; there must therefore exist some
                                   its

ment of the abstract science. Many difficulties occur in the
pursuits of a dairy farmer, which render his occupation pre
carious.   Such difficulties arise entirely from an ignorance of
the scientific relations of the practice in which he is engaged.
I  have endeavoured in the following paper to point out the
causes which so often effect changes in the nature of his pro
duce.
    Boussingault and Lebel” instituted some experiments, with
the view of proving that the composition of milk remains
constant, when the food given to the cow contains the same
amount of nitrogen; and their analyses established this fact,
as far as regarded the casein in the milk; although           other                          its
ingredients varied very considerably, according         the nature                    to
of  the food. The mean                           of
                                eight analyses described        the                              in
first part      of
              their memoir,  gives  the   following composition for
the milk of cow :—  a

                                  Butter ............                4:1

     The method employed                          by   these chemists           in their analyses
did not differ from that used                           by   Peligot       in   his examination
of the milk          of

weight, after washing with aether, was estimated                butter,                    as
while that experienced                       by

being milked, it had half a mile to walk from the meadow.

fresh grass, the animal had to eat a greater quantity than it
otherwise might have done, and consequently had to traverse

of the various kinds of food given to the cow. The cow re
ceived, during the course of the experiments, grass, oatmeal,
hay, beans, and potatoes. The following analysis exhibits the
composition of these various substances.

   In a specimen of beans analysed       Boussingault, only 4
per cent. of nitrogen was found.        ut in the bean-flour,
which I used in the experiments, there was as much as 5
per cent. It is obvious that if we multiply the            of
nitrogen by 6}, the product will be the amount of casein or
albumen in the various kinds of food; and further, by deduct
ing this, together with the water and ashes, the remainder
must indicate the quantity of unazotised matter.

Finally, according to Liebig, good hay contains 1:56 per cent.
of a fatty or waxy substance.      Braconnot found 0.70 per
cent. of a similar substance in beans. Vogel found 2 per
cent. in oats, and Liebig 0-3 per cent. in potatoes.
   Dumas, in an announcement to the French Academy, has
lately advanced the theory, that the fat of animals is wholly
derived from the fatty matter contained in their food. This
opinion has been very ably combated by Liebig, who refers
to an analysis of milk executed by Boussingault, and shows
that much more butter was contained in it than could be
accounted for by the fat in the food taken.    As the theory of
the formation of <U+017F>at is of the first  importance in the practice
of dairy farming, we will shortly examine Dumas's theory
with reference to the preceding experiments.
   1. On the 2nd day the cow received 28 lbs. of hay, which
contains 0436        lb.   of

receive a greater flow of milk. The loss experienced by the
greater absorption of oxygen is more than compensated for
by the increased appetite of the animal.
    In these experiments it will be remarked, that potatoes were
 favourable both to the flow of milk and formation of butter.
 This quite accords with practical experience. They abound
 in starch, and therefore furnish the substance from which
 butter is formed.      The increase of butter in the milk of the
 fourth day is very striking; on this day 24 lbs. of potatoes
 formed part of the food. The butter is also in large quantity
 in the milk of the fifth day, though not so much so as in that
 of the fourth, though 6 lbs. of potatoes in excess were con
 sumed. In these 6 lbs. of potatoes only 14                         dry un                  lb.   of

a portion  of this soured cream or milk may be added to fresh
cream or  milk,   which should be kept in a room possessing a
temperature of 60°.      By adding this soured cream to the
fresh milk, we furnish   an acid, by which the sugar of milk is
                            #.
converted into          sugar. The curd then acts upon the
grape sugar, and converts it into alcohol.   The latter by oxi
dation becomes acetic    acid, and thus the whole mass of milk
is rendered sour, the casein coagulated, and therefore pro
tected from immediate putrefaction.                 The butter made from
such soured milk is

          GENTLEMEN,
THE   new analytical
  of late attracted
                                      methods proposed by M. Hansen having
                                      much attention, I have for some time
employed myself in computing several places of Saturn rigor
ously from his formula; selecting for the dates those speci
fied in the Greenwich Observations for 1837–40, as the mean
day of the monthly observations.      M. Hansen having as
sumed the same elements as M. Bouvard (whose tables of
Saturn are now used for the Nautical Almanac), we derive the
great advantage of exactly testing the value of both methods
by reference to observation.  I have therefore made the com
putations for the London mean noons = Paris ones + 9" 215.5
for the 21 dates of the annexed table, in the following man
ner       :-

 M. Bouvard's tables furnished the perturbations produced                                      by

  The temperature       of the water and air at Bahadurghur is the mean of two                            ob
servations    taken at an interval of fourteen days.
    Respecting the last table Mr. Everest says, the irregularities in
the temperatures may be explained by some of the wells being worked
for the purposes of irrigation, and therefore supplied by a current of
fresh water continually issuing from the ground; whilst in those wells
which were still, the surface of stagnant water exposed to the air was
cooled by the evaporation dependent on so dry a climate.
    The general level of the country is said to be 800 feet above the
sea, and the temperature of Delhi, as determined by the author from
observations made during four years, to be 75°78, or 74°64 Fahr.,
taken as the mean between that result and another (73°5) given in
 the Gleanings of Science.' If to this 1°8 were added for the depth
 of the wells (115 feet), according to the rule which holds good in
 Europe, the temperature would be 76°44, or something less than
 that obtained by observation.     Mr. Everest then proceeds to show,
 according to the formula of Mr. Atkinson", that the temperature
at the level of the sea, in the latitude of Delhi (28° 40'), should be
 77°-84 (74°64 + 3°-2 for the difference of 800 feet of altitude), and
 that the temperature of Sincapore, in the second degree of north
 latitude, is 80°-2, leaving, in comparison with that of the former
 locality, only 2°56 of temperature for above 26° of latitude. This
 discrepancy, he is of opinion, may be partly explained by Sincapore
 being surrounded by the sea contiguous to the Pacific and Indian
 Oceans, and cooled by perpetual showers, and Delhi being in the
 midst of dry and burning plains.      But, adds the author, the mean
 annual   temperature  of Cairo, in 30° north latitude, and situated in
 a  dry and  sandy continent, is not above 72.5, leaving consequently
 yet a difference to be accounted for, and which he conceives may be
 owing to the tropical rains being limited west of the Indus to 234°
 north latitude, but extending in India even beyond 30° of latitude.
 During the period in which the rain prevails, or from the 25th of June
 to the 15th of September, the south-west monsoon blows nearly from
  the equator and transports a large quantity of aqueous vapour ha
  ving a temperature from 77° to 81°, or that of the rain as it falls
  and soaks into the earth, the evaporation being then very trifling.
  The quantity of rain during the other nine months is so small that
  it cannot counteract this effect, which, Mr. Everest says, may ac
  count both for the high temperature of the surface, and for the tem
  perature of the interior being greater than was to be expected.

304               Geological Society:—Mr.    Lyell   on the
  If this  explanation be allowed, the author observes, it may easily
be conceived that when a much greater portion of the globe was
covered with water, and the evaporating surface consequently larger,
currents of air charged with aqueous vapour prevailed still more,
and modified the ancient climate even in still higher latitudes.
   In conclusion, Mr. Everest remarks, that Scandinavia presents
another instance of the carrying power of fluids with respect to heat,
the coast, and even the bays, being free from ice to the latitude of
71°, owing probably to a south-westerly current in the adjacent
ocean; and he states, on the authority of persons who have win
tered at Spitzbergen, that south-west winds are usually accompanied
by rain and thaw even in December and January.
   A paper was then read, “On the Tertiary Formations and their
connection with the Chalk in Virginia and other parts of the United
States,” by Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S.*
    Having examined the most important cretaceous deposits in New
Jersey, Mr. Lyell proceeded, in the autumn of 1841, to investigate
the tertiary strata of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia, with a view
to satisfy himself, first, how far the leading divisions of the tertiary
strata along the Atlantic border of the United States agree in aspect
and organic contents with those of Europe; and, secondly, to ascer
tain whether any rocks containing fossils of a character intermediate
between those of the cretaceous and the eocene beds really exist. The
conclusions at which he arrived, from his extensive survey, are given
briefly as follows:–1. The only tertiary formations, which the author
saw, agree well in their zoological types with the eocene and miocene
beds of England and France; 2. he found no secondary fossils in
 those rocks which have been called upper secondary, and supposed to
 constitute a link between the cretaceous and tertiary formations.
    1. Virginia.-The tertiary strata bordering the James River, Mr.
 Lyell says, have been well described by Prof. H. D. Rogers and Dr.
 Rogerst; and, he adds, they are also noticed in Mr. Conrad's ex
 cellent work on the tertiary strata of the United States.     At Rich
 mond, Mr. Lyell examined the remarkable bed of infusorial clay
 described by Prof. Rogerst, consisting of an impalpable siliceous
 powder derived from cases of microscopic animalcules.      It varies in
 thickness from twelve to twenty-five feet, and is interposed between
 eocene greensands and miocene clays; but Mr. Lyell agrees with
 Prof. Rogers in considering it as probably belonging to the former
 epoch.
    Similar eocene greensands, very much resembling the cretaceous
 greensand of New Jersey, occur at Petersburg, thirty miles south of
 Richmond, and are overlaid by a large deposit of miocene marls
 abounding in testacea different from those of the subjacent sands.
 Among the fossils of the latter deposit are a Venericardia scarcely
 distinguishable from V. planicosta of the London clay, also an Ostrea

                Tertiary Formations of the United States.                305
   almost equally near to the Ostrea bellopacina and the O. selleformis, so
   widely disseminated through the eocene formations of South Carolina
   and Georgia, is found in the uppermost beds of the formation at
   Coggin's Point, on the James River. The part of Virginia to which
   these remarks refer, is a flat region, forty or fifty feet above the level
  of the sea. The miocene strata which compose the upper beds con
  sist sometimes almost exclusively of shells, and in the neighbourhood
  of Williamsburg Mr. Lyell collected eighty species, which bear a
  great resemblance generically, and in their relative numerical force,
  to collections from the Suffolk crag and the Faluns of Touraine.
  Among these Testacea are several species of Astarte, some very analo
  gous to those of Suffolk, the Voluta mutabilis, which resembles the
   V. Lamberti, also Conus diluvianus, Lucina squamosa, and L. divari
  cata. Mr. Lyell says there are many other analogies among the
  Mollusca, besides the occurrence of several corals, Echinodermata,
  fishes' teeth and bones of Cetacea; but he shows that the most im
  portant point of comparison is in the proportion of recent to extinct
  Testacea. Out of eighty-two species which he collected at Williams
  burg, sixteen are considered by Mr. Conrad to be recent, and found
  for the greater part living on the coasts of the United States. The
  existing species, therefore, are in the proportion of one-fifth of the
  whole, which agrees well, says the author, with the average per-centage
  in the shells obtained by him in 1840 from the Faluns of Touraine. The
  entire number of American miocene shells known to Mr. Conrad is
  238, of which thirty-eight have been identified with recent species.
      North Carolina.-In the neighbourhood of South Washington, on
  the north-east branch of Cape Fear river, Mr. Lyell found the dark,
  bluish marls of the cretaceous series, to which his attention had been
  directed by Mr. Hodge's paper in Silliman's Journal". They closely
  resemble, in composition and organic contents, those in New Jersey,
  and abound with Belemnites mucronatus, Erogyra costata, and a spe
  cies of Gryphaea resembling G. columba ; Mr. Lyell also found in
  them Ostrea vesicularis and O. pusilla of Nillson, likewise Anomia
  tellinoides, a species of Plagiostoma, and several new shells. These
  marls extend to the south of Lewis Creek, for several miles along the
  banks of the north-east branch of Cape Fear river, nearly to Rocky
  Point, where they are covered by the Wilmington limestone and
  conglomerate. This formation, which is overlaid by miocene strata,
  and ranges to Wilmington, as well as along the coast to Cape
  Fear river, has been considered by Mr. Hodge, and other geolo
  gists, to be an upper secondary deposit, or interposed between the
  eocene and cretaceous series; but Mr. Lyell could find in it no or
  ganic forms which supported this opinion, nor could he learn that any
  had been discovered.     On the contrary, the only determinable species
  apparently agree with the Lucina pendata, an Alabama shell, and
  Pecten membranosus, both eocene fossils. The organic remains at
  Wilmington are only casts, but are referable to the genera Cardium,
  Nucula, Corbula, Cardita, Venus, Arca, Natica, Oliva, Cypraea,
  Conus, Calyptraea, and Siliquaria.       Associated with these remains

of Testacea   are a species of Lunulites and several other corals, the
claws of Crustacea, and teeth of the Lamna family.            Many of these
fossils occur at Rocky Point, including Pecten membranosus, with a
Lunulite and a Vermetus subsequently found by the author in the
limestone of the Santee canal in South Carolina.
   South Carolina and Georgia.-Charleston stands on a yellow sand,
beneath which is a blue clay containing the remains of Testacea that
inhabit the adjacent seas; and Dr. Ravenel informed Mr. Lyell
that he had found in it the Gnathodon cyrenoides, not now known to
occur in a living state nearer than the Gulf of Mexico. The author
could not ascertain whether this post-pliocene formation rises above
high-water mark; but he states that, on the Cooper river thirty miles
north of Charleston, there occurs beneath the superficial sand and
mottled clay a freshwater formation, in which Dr. Ravenel has found
the remains of the Cypress, Hiccory and Cedar, which must have
grown in a freshwater swamp, although the formation is now six
feet below the level of high water.        No shells have been noticed in
the deposit, but they are also commonly wanting in the marsh accu
mulations of that region.       As the salt water of Cooper river must
now cover much of this deposit, a very modern subsidence, Mr. Lyell
says, must have taken place along the coast. At Dr. Ravenel's
plantation in the low country near the mouth of Cooper river is a
pulverulent limestone, artificially exposed, which Mr. Lyell thinks
may be an eocene formation, though                                     its
                                               fossils differ from those                                                  of

is nearly parallel to the Atlantic coast, but at the distance of 100 or 150
geographical miles. This great feature, Mr. Lyell states, was first
pointed out by Maclure, but he adds that portions of the tertiary
formations usually cover the hypogene rocks for a certain distance
above the Falls, and that their outline is very irregular and sinuous.
On Race's Creek near Augusta, the highly inclined clay slate, con
taining chloritic quartzose beds with subordinate strata much charged
with iron, are decomposed to the depth of many yards into clays and
sands which resemble so precisely a large portion of the horizontal
tertiary strata of the neighbouring country, that the disintegrated ma
terials might be mistaken for them, if the veins of quartz which often
traverse the argillaceous beds at a considerable angle, did not con
tinue unaltered. The only point at which Mr. Lyell saw any organic
remains in beds associated with these upper tertiary red strata was
at Richmond in Virginia, where he obtained casts of decidedly mio
cene fossils; but as he observed on the Savannah river thick beds of
sandy-red earth beneath the burr-stone of Stony Bluff, he concludes
that the same mineral character may sometimes belong to the upper
division of the eocene group. At the rocks six miles west of Augusta,
the tertiary beds derived from the hypogene rocks have the appear
ance of granite, and have been called gneiss by some geologists.
They exhibit occasionally a distinct cross-stratification, and include
angular masses of pure kaolin.

Reach, the author found impressions of Mactra, Pecten and Cardita,
also fragments of fishes' teeth, particularly of the genus Myliobates,
likewise several teeth of the genus Lamna, and one belonging to a
Notidamus or a nearly allied genus. At Sisters Ferry he observed
not only the brick-red loam, with the red and grey clay and sand,
but a highly siliceous clay, which though soft when moist, exhibits a
conchoidal fracture when dry, and resembles flint; in some spots the
clay also passes into a kind of menilite.
   in conclusion, Mr. Lyell offers the following general observations.
The part of South Carolina and Georgia which lies between the moun
tains and the Atlantic, and of which he examined a portion near the
Santee and Savannah rivers, has a foundation of cretaceous rocks con
taining Belemnites, Exogyrae, &c., overlaid first by the eocene lime
stone and marls, and secondly by the burr-stone formation with the
associated red loam, mottled clay, and yellow sand.        According to
Mr. Vanuxem's observations, a tertiary lignite deposit sometimes       in
tervenes between the cretaceous and eocene series. The remarkable
difference in the fossils of the eocene strata at different points, as
the Grove on Cooper river, the Santee canal, Vance's Ferry, Shell
Bluff, Jacksonborough, and Wilmington, might lead, Mr. Lyell states,
to the suspicion of a considerable succession of minor divisions of the
eocene period. That the whole are not precisely of the same age he
is willing to believe, but he is inclined to ascribe the difference prin
cipally to two causes : 1st, that the number procured at each place
is small and therefore represents only a fractional portion of the en
tire fauna of the period, so that variations in each locality may have
arisen from original geographical circumstances; and 2ndly, no great
eocene collection has been made from any part of the United States.
    Some of the burr-stone fossils occur in the limestone, and Mr. Lyell
thinks the former may bear to the latter a relation analogous to that
which the upper marine sands of the Paris basin bear to the calcaire
 grossler.
    With respect to the conclusion stated in the beginning of the pa
per, that he had been unable to find any beds containing an inter
mixture of cretaceous and tertiary fossils, Mr. Lyell says, it would
require far more extended investigations to enable a geologist to de
clare whether there exist in the Southern states any beds of passage,
but he affirms that the facts at present ascertained will not bear out
such a conclusion.
   The generic affinity of the cretaceous fossils of the United States
to those of Europe is stated to be most striking, and Mr. Lyell ob
served in Mr. Conrad's collection from Alabama a large Hippurite,
 a point of analogy not previously recorded.
   The proportion of recent shells in the eocene strata of the United
States appears to be as minute as in Europe, and the distinctness of
the eocene and miocene testacea hitherto observed to be as great.
Mr. Lyell says, it is also worthy of remark, that the recent shells found
in the American miocene beds are not only in the same proportion to
the extinct as those of the Suffolk crag, or the Faluns of Touraine,
but that they also agree specifically in most cases with mollusca in
habiting the neighbouring sea; in the same manner as the recent

 miocene species of Touraine agree for the greater part with species
 now living on the western coast of France or in the Mediterranean,
 and as the recent testacea of the crag are identifiable with species
 belonging to the British seas.     This result appears to Mr. Lyell to
confirm the    accuracy  of conchological     determinations; for            the                                    if,   on

1618, 1668 and 1702, were identical with the one                      question, and                 in
that that       of

    On the 5th a larger portion of the tail was visible, and it was evidently
 higher than the evening before; clouds, however, again hung over the head
 until it set.
    On the 6th the sky was free from clouds, and the comet presented a
 most magnificent appearance.      Observations of it in Right Ascension and
 North Polar Distance were obtained this evening with the equatoreal; but
 from the excitement at first view of so splendid an object, together with
 the confusion caused by a number of visitors at the Observatory, I do not
 consider them entitled to much confidence, especially those in North Polar
 Distance.     The length of the tail I measured roughly with a sextant, by
 bringing down the image of a star which happened to be situated near the
 faint end of        it,
                  into contact with the head, and made         be about 36°;                 it   to

 separate slightly into two parts, the upper one being rather longer than
 the other.
   On the 13th, after the observations for position,          introduced     parallel   I                          a

arsenic, if they   be present, are precipitated; and the precipitate con
tains no    sulphuret   of lead. As to the iron which the sulphuric acid
contains, it is well known to be the protosulphate, upon which hy
drosulphuric acid has no action.
     The non-formation of sulphuret of lead in this case had led the
 author to think, contrary to the general opinion, that commercial
sulphuric acid does not contain sulphate of lead, and consequently
that this metal is completely insoluble in it; but on trial he adopted
a contrary opinion. The following experiments were performed:—
      1. Recently precipitated sulphate of lead was put into a glass and
 covered with concentrated sulphuric acid, and exposed to the air
 during about six months, taking care to shake the mixture occa
 sionally. The acid was considerably diluted by absorbing atmo
 spheric moisture.       This acid, rendered clear by standing, was sub
 mitted to the action of a current of hydrosulphuric acid gas without
 occasioning any discoloration or precipitation of sulphuret of lead.
      2. Sulphuric acid of sp. gr. about 1:540, was boiled for an hour
 on sulphate of lead, and afterwards the experiment was repeated
 with concentrated acid. The liquids rendered clear by standing
 were treated with a current of hydrosulphuric acid gas, but neither
  precipitation of sulphuret of lead nor discoloration were produced.
      These experiments seem to prove that even boiling concentrated
  sulphuric acid does not dissolve sulphate of lead, and consequently
  that the acid of commerce cannot contain any ; but on adding water
  to the acids which had been boiled with the sulphate of lead, after
  they had become clear, a considerable white precipitate was formed ;
  this could only be attributed to the separation of the acid from the
  sulphate of lead which it had dissolved, an effect which is precisely
  similar to the precipitation of sulphate of barytes dissolved by con
  centrated sulphuric acid.
      An aqueous solution of hydrosulphuric acid was then added to the
  acid which had been treated with water, and still holding in suspen
  sion the white precipitate which had been formed; but neither the
  liquid nor the precipitate was rendered brown by the hydrosulphuric
  acid : they remained perfectly colourless.    From these facts M. Du
   pasquier began to suspect that sulphuric acid prevented the forma
   tion of sulphuret of lead; that this is actually the case was proved
   by the following experiment:—
       Sulphate of lead was put into a glass and covered to about 13
   inch of concentrated sulphuric acid, agitation being used to effect
   their mixture.     Being afterwards subjected to the action of hydro
   sulphuric acid, both in its gaseous state and in solution, the mixture
   remained perfectly white.     The same result was obtained by causing
   hydrosulphuric acid to react upon sulphuric acid, which had been
   boiled with sulphate of lead, and then mixed with this salt; in
   neither case was there the slightest formation of sulphuret of lead.
       In order to prove that the discoloration both of the dissolved and
   undissolved sulphate of lead was owing to the presence of an excess
   of sulphuric acid, the following experiments were performed:—
       1. The precipitated sulphate of lead was washed with distilled

 316           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 water, and treated with hydrosulphuric     acid, when   it became imme
 diately black.
    2. Sulphuric acid which had been boiled with sulphate of lead was
 saturated with potash; in this state a current of hydrosulphuric acid
 immediately rendered it black, and on standing a deposit of sulphuret
 of lead was formed.
    It follows from what has been stated,—
    1st. That a small portion of sulphate of lead is soluble in concen
 trated sulphuric acid.
    2nd. That hydrosulphuricacid does not react upon sulphate of lead
 dissolved in a great excess of sulphuric acid, or mechanically mixed
 with it.
    3rd. That consequently, hydrosulphuric acid cannot be employed
 for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of sulphate of lead in
 commercial sulphuric acid.
    4th. That boiling concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves some sul
 phate of lead, the greater part of which is precipitated on the addition
 of water.
    5th. That hydrosulphuric acid immediately reacts, and sulphuret of
 lead is instantly formed from the sulphate whether it is dissolved or
 not, when the excess of sulphuric acid is saturated by an alkaline
 base; from which it evidently results, that it is the excess of sul
 phuric acid that prevents the reaction of the hydrosulphuric acid
 on the oxide of the sulphate of lead.—Journal de Pharmacie et de
 Chimie, Août, 1843.

    CRYSTALLIZATION OF OCTAHEDRAL IODIDE OF POTASSIUM.
                    BY M. BOUCHARDAT.
   By evaporating a saline solution containing iodine, iodide of po
tassium and acetic aether, M. Bouchardat obtained light yellow
coloured semitransparent octahedral crystals.     These crystals, when
heated in a tube, yielded traces of iodine, and the fused residue con
sisted entirely of iodide of potassium; similar crystals were pro
 duced from a solution of biniodide of potassium by spontaneous eva
poration; in order to obtain them there must be a great excess of
iodine in the solution, although they do not contain 1-1000dth of
their weight of free iodine; but it is certainly curious to observe the

at the same time in contact with water, chlorate and carbonic acid,
without the air having access, it is gradually converted into white
lead, a fact which very much confirms M. Pelouze's theory of the
formation of this compound.
   A solution of chlorate of potash in water is therefore a powerful
oxidizing agent for neutral substances, abandoning both the oxygen
of     its
       acid and that                        of

      his attention directed to the comparative chemical and
 medical values of fermented and unfermented bread as articles
 of food. The common idea, which yielded the palm of supe
 riority to the former, did not appear to be based on solid data,
and it was therefore considered desirable that, in reference to
a subject of such importance to the nourishment of man, the
arguments in favour of such an opinion should be subjected to
 a careful examination.       Judging d priori it did not seem evi

the integrity of the flour was preserved, and that the elements
of the common salt required as a seasoner of the bread, were
thus introduced and the salt formed in the dough.    Dr. Hugh
 Colquhoun first, it is believed, carried this suggestion into
practice, in 1826, and made numerous experiments on bread
making". But it was not till within a very few years that the
idea of using bread thus baked on a large scale was carried
into execution. From the result of several experiments made
at the author's request, it appears that upon an average there
is a great loss sustained by flour when it is fermented.          In
comparison with the bread raised by carbonate of soda and
muriatic acid, there is a loss in the sack of flour of 30 lbs.
13oz. ; or in round numbers a sack of flour would produce
 107 loaves of unfermented bread, and only 100 of fermented
bread of the same weight. Hence it appears that, by the com
mon process of fermented baking, in the sack of flour, 7 loaves,
or 63 per cent. of the flour, are driven into the air and lostt.
An important question now arises from the consideration of
the result of this experiment, viz. does the loss arise entirely
from the decomposition of sugar, or is any other element of
the flour attacked 2
   It appears from a mean of 8 analyses of wheat flour from
different parts of Europe by Vauquelin, that the quantity of
sugar contained in flour amounts to 5.61 per cent.          But it is
obvious that as the quantity lost by baking exceeded this
amount by nearly 1 per cent, the loss cannot be accounted
for by the removal merely of the ready-formed sugar of the
flour. We must either ascribe this extra loss to a conversion
of a portion of the gum of the flour into sugar and          decom               its
position         by
              means      the      of
                               ferment,                  or
                                            we must attribute                               it   to
the action       of
               the yeast upon another element        the flour; and    of
if we admit that yeast       generated during the panary fermen
                                       is
tation, then the conclusion would be inevitable that another
element     the flour, besides the sugar
            of                               gum, has been affected.

   The author has succeeded in forming a wholesome and
palatable bread by the employment of ammoniacal alum and
carbonate of ammonia or soda as a substitute for yeast.                  In
this process the alum is destroyed by the heat; the bread is
vesicular and white, and rises, according to the judgement of
the baker, as well as fermented bread.            It is obvious that none
of the ingredients added can affect the integrity of the consti
tuents of the flour, an occurrence which possibly may happen
in the preparation of bread by the common process of fermen
tation, as has been shown, even to the azotized constituents.
The disadvantage of such a deterioration is sufficiently evident
if we view these principles as the source of nutrition in flour.
    The first chemist who examined flour with any successful
result was Beccaria of Bologna, who detailed his experiments
in a communication to the Academy of that place, in 1742.
 “To endeavour to know oneself,” observes he, “is to satisfy
the obligation which the oracle of Apollo imposes on every
one—to know oneself—for, if we except the spiritual and im
mortal part of our being, and if we only take into considera
 tion our bodies, is it not true that we are composed of the
 same substances which serve as our nourishment?”                    From
his subsequent remarks it is obvious that he considered the
glutinous part of flour to be peculiarly of an animal and the
 starch of a vegetable nature; for when distilled, the gluten, he
 says, affords principles similar to those of                      all
                                                        animals, while the
 starchy part yields products similar                                               all
                                                                            of of

 for September 2, 1843, in which the writer attempts to appro
 priate my views, I do not know of any observations to which
 the Professor can allude, but those which I published in your
 Journal for March 1839 [S. 3. vol. xiv. p. 174], and if he will
 refer to them he will perceive that he has not quite under
 stood my notions.     My experiments were made with elastic
 and not muscular     tissue, and the increase of heat in the
 caoutchouc operated on was observed immediately after it
 had been elongated and before it had been allowed to re
 COntract.
    As the Professor's imperfect explanation of my views might
 bring them into some discredit, I shall feel obliged by your
 publishing this Note.

devising of a process for obtaining the principal ingredients
pure, a difficult analytical problem. The details of the pre
liminary experiments (which occupied some time) for finding
out what I had to deal with, would be both tedious and use
less; I proceed, therefore, to give a summary of the method
I   adopted for the analysis of this substance, and of the best
means of proceeding, if the extraction of malic acid be the
only object. The stalks should have the cuticle taken off, as
it would introduce a great deal of colouring matter if put into
 the press; the peeled stalks are cut into small pieces about an
inch long, put into a strong canvas bag, and then subjected
 to a great pressure; by this means 20,000 grains of peeled
 stalks yielded 12,500 grains of juice, and left 3850 grains of
 damp fibre, which well washed and dried at 212°, weighed
 800 grains, and is equal to 4 per cent. ligneous fibre.                   The
liquid had a light green colour, was very acid,                 density variedits
with the size        the stalks and the time elapsed since they were
                        of
cut,      also varied
         it                 the same specimen

the pressing; that which flows first                   have had

 the solution which filtered from the mixed sulphate and phos
phate, containing excess of nitric acid, nitrate silver was added
and 4:1 of chloride obtained; to the solution filtered from
the chloride of silver, excess of hydrochloric and sulphuric
 acids were added to remove the excess of silver and baryta:
 the filtered liquid evaporated to dryness and ignited, after
putting on it excess of sulphuric acid, gave 39.3 grains of
 a white salt, quite soluble in water (sulphates of soda and
 potassa); these were dissolved in a minimum of water, and
 excess of crystals of tartaric were added; the granular pre
 cipitate washed with dilute alcohol, weighed 33°3; the solu
 tion from the bitartrate of potassa evaporated and ignited, then
treated with sulphuric acid, evaporated again to dryness and
ignited, gave of dry sulphate of soda 4:7; this was dissolved
in water, and being slowly evaporated, the characteristic cry
 stals were formed.

the tea.    When another portion of the precipitated tannin
was boiled with tolerably dilute sulphuric acid, it did not yield
any gallic acid, but was changed into a dark brown substance,
nearly insoluble in cold, and but very little more so in boiling
water.    It gave a grayish black precipitate with protosulphate
of iron, but was not precipitated either by gelatine or tartar
emetic.    It dissolved however pretty easily both in alcohol
and   alkalies, forming dark brown solutions.       It is evident

ducts   of   its
              decomposition are essentially different.
    The tea was next examined for the gallic acid which       evi                               it

aether,  pouring off the solution, recovering the greater portion
of the aether by distillation, and leaving the remainder to spon
taneous evaporation, crystals of gallic acid were deposited in
a few hours. The quantity of gallic acid in myrobalans is
pretty considerable.
    Besides tannin and gallic acid, myrobalans contains a good
deal of mucilage, and a brownish-yellow colouring matter,
which Dr. Bancroft states was employed in India in his time
as a yellow dye. Myrobalans have long been employed by
the calico-printers of India instead of galls, and from the large
   uantity of astringent matter they contain, I think perhaps
they might be worth the attention of the tanners and calico
printers of this country.       A decoction of myrobalans makes
a  very  tolerable ink, which   however,  as we have already stated,
is rather deficient in lustre.
    Bistort, Polygonum Bistortus.-The root of this plant,
which is pretty common in Scotland, has a pale pink colour
internally, but when it is exposed to the air for some time it
becomes deep yellow.          Its aqueous solution is yellowish at
first, but on standing it assumes a fine red colour, and the same
effect is immediately produced by boiling it with any of the
alkalies.     With protosulphate of iron it gives a bluish-black
precipitate, a good deal resembling that of galls, but having a
bluish-purple shade. Gelatine produces a copious brownish
precipitate in a solution of bistort, which shows that the quan
tity of astringent matter it contains is considerable.         With
tartar-emetic it gives a brownish-white precipitate.         When
extract of bistort is evaporated to dryness and distilled, it gives
distinct indications of pyrogallic acid. The pyrogallic acid
however, as in the case of myrobalans, was derived not from
the tannin in bistort, but from a quantity of gallic acid with
 which it was mixed, for on precipitating the tannin by sul
phuric acid, and distilling it alone, not a trace of pyrogallic
acid was obtained, and when boiled with sulphuric acid it was
not converted into gallic acid.
    The gallic acid it contains was easily obtained from bistort
by precisely the same process as that already described.          Its
quantity, compared with that of the tannin in the root, was
very considerable.
    Besides tannin and gallic acid, bistort contains a brownish
red colouring matter, and a quantity of mucilage.            Bistort
may likewise be made to furnish' a very tolerable ink, which
appears to stand very well.         It has a bluish-purple shade,
owing to the reddish colouring matter of the root.

 bluish-purple precipitate with the acetate.               It is also readily
 precipitated by gelatine, but not by tartar-emetic. This tannin
is mixed with a small quantity of gallic acid. The shell of
 the fruit also contains a good deal of a fatty matter, which is
 solid at ordinary temperatures and crystallizable. It is easily

    GENTLEMEN,
I HAD
                sº
                the honour         of reading a paper before the Philoso
   phical                      of Dublin, on a new Geometrical principle,
which as far as      I am aware has hitherto escaped the notice of
mathematicians.         May          I
                                 ask of you the favour of inserting-
it in  your   valuable Journal?
    The principle consists in taking the inverse of curves and
surfaces, by means of which we readily find conjugate properties
to those possessed by every known curve and surface, the dis
cussion of many of which would be impossible by the ordinary
methods.            If
                  in the plane of a curve we take any point as a
pole and produce the radius vector, so that the rectangle
under radius vector to the original curve and the whole pro
duced radius be constant or equal to                             k”,
                                                 we may call the locus

 lars from the pole on the tangents are as the radii, and the first
 perpendicular being known, the second is so also.
      Having established these principles, I shall proceed to show
 the application of this method, first to the right line and
 circle, afterwards to curves of the second degree, and finally
 to surfaces.
     If  a circle passing through the pole be            Fig. 2.
 called a polar circle; from the known theo
 rem of the bisectors of the angles of a tri
angle meeting in a point, by taking the                          AA
inverse of all these lines we come to the
following theorem: if three polar circles
form by their intersection a polar triangle
A B C, the polar circles AO, BO, CO
bisecting the angles meet in a point O,
which is the inverse of the point in which                 B
 the original bisectors meet.
     From the theorem of the three perpendiculars from the
*
angles of a triangle on the opposite sides meeting in a point,
we get by inversion the three polar circles perpendicular to the
opposite sides of the polar triangle, and passing through the
           meet in a point.
       n like manner every theorem in plane geometry, com
prising only the right line and circle, gives a conjugate one,
in which right lines and circles only are contained,—every
theorem, I mean, which has relation only to position, without
introducing lengths of lines.         I shall not mention any more
of    them,   as, when the   principle  is clearly seen, that to a line
corresponds a circle, and to a point a point, to the contact of
a line and circle, the contact of two circles or of a line and
circle according as the pole is or is not on the circumference
of the circle, and to the angle between two lines, the angle
between the tangents to two circles at their point of inter
section, any one can multiply theorems at will.

    The difference of the arcs of an inverse ellipse, one mea
sured from the end of the major, the other of the minor axis,
and whose amplitudes fulfil the condition b tan t tan b = a
(a and b being the axes of the direct ellipse), is equal to the
arc of a circle, which may be found by the following construc

cular from the centre on the tangent of the direct ellipse and
the point of contact, P the perpendicular from the centre on the
line joining the extremities of the axes of the directellipse, and L

 it is the same as the intersection of the surface of second

    6. The circular sections of the surface of elasticity corre
 spond to those of the ellipsoid, and the umbilici of either are
 found by the intersection of the diameters conjugate to the
 circular section of the ellipsoid, as at the umbilici the ultimate
 section must be a circle, and therefore parallel to the circular
 sections.
    7. As to the rectilinear generatrices of the hyperboloid of
 one sheet correspond circular sections in the inverse hyper
 boloid, the latter has an infinite number of circular sections
 passing through the centre, but only two whose centre is at
 that point.
    8. Hence the inverse hyperboloid of one sheet may be de
 scribed by a moveable circle passing through a given point
 and moving on three others passing through the same point,
which only cut in that point, and which neither                   the same        lie   in

perties of curves of the second order, we come to those of the
fourth with regard to polar circles, so by deducing those of
the second order with regard to these latter, we might arrive
at the properties of the higher curves with regard to lines.

new properties, many of which I have deduced in the paper

I   NOW      proceeded    to consider the heat evolved by voltaic
   currents when they are counteracted or assisted by magnetic
induction. For this purpose it was only necessary to intro
duce a battery into the magneto-electrical circuit: then by
turning the wheel in one direction I could oppose the voltaic
current; or, by turning in the other direction, I could increase
the intensity of the voltaic- by the assistance of the magneto
electricity.   In the former case the apparatus possessed        the                                    all
properties   of the electro-magnetic engine;     the latter     pre          in                         it

 348                     Mr. Joule            on the         Calorific Effects
     Inthe preceding series I used the steel magnets previously
described as the inductive force: and      had two of the large           I
Daniell’s cells in   series, arranged so as to pass a current of
electricity through the revolving electro-magnet and galvano
meter. The wheel was turned in the direction which it would
have taken had the friction been sufficiently reduced to allow
of the motion of the apparatus without assistance. The pre
caution of interpolating the experiments was again adopted.
     I
     give another series, in which everything else remaining
the same, the direction of revolution was reverse, so as to
increase the intensity of the voltaic electricity by superadding
that of the magneto-electricity.

352                     Mr. Joule      on the Calorific Effects
are not so much inferior to the experimental results of column
5 as they were in Table I. The principal reason of this
arises from the mixture of the constant effect of the battery
with the variable magneto-electrical current, as will be readily
seen on inspecting figs. 6 and 7, the former of which repre
sents the currents in series No. 9; the latter, those in series
No. 10. The dotted rectangles a b c d, &c., represent the
constant effect of the battery of two cells, which is in one
instance diminished, in the other increased by the magneto
electricity.

    On comparing                 columns 6 and 8 with column 5, it is ma
 nifest that the law of the square of the electric current still
obtains, and is not affected either by the assistance or resist
 ance which the magneto-electricity                    presents to the voltaic
 current.         Now the increase or diminution of the chemical
 effects   occurring           in the battery during a given time is propor
 tional to the         magneto-electrical      effect, and the heat evolved is
 always proportional to the square of the current; therefore
 the heat due to a given chemical action is subject to an                  in
 crease or to a diminution directly proportional to the intensity
 of the magneto-electricity assisting or opposing the voltaic
 current.
     We have therefore in magneto-electricity an agent capable by
 simple mechanical means of destroying or generating heat.                  In
 a subsequent part of this paper I shall make an attempt to
 connect heat with mechanical power in absolute numerical
 relations. At present we shall turn to a question intimately
 connected with the previous investigations; and which indeed
 has already been partly developed.

   It was discovered  by Prof. Jacobi, and by myself also one or
two months    afterwards*, that the attraction of electro-magnets,
either towards one another or for their armatures, is (below
the point of saturation) proportional to the square of the
electric force. The magnetism in an electro-magnet is there
fore simply as the electric force.    Consequently the numbers
in column 2 are proportional to the magnetic virtue of the
electro-magnet. But on comparing columns 3 and 4 together,
it will be seen that the heat evolved is as the square of the
electricity.   Therefore the heat evolved by a revolving bar of
iron is  proportional  to the square of the magnetic influence to
which it is  eagosed.
   After the preceding experiments there can be no doubt that
heat would be evolved by the rotation of non-magnetic sub
stances, in proportion to their conducting power, Dr. Faraday
having proved the existence of currents in such circumstances,
and that their quantity is proportional, cacteris paribus, to the
conducting power of the body in which              are excited. .
have not made any experiments on this subject, but in the
next part we shall have occasion to avail ourselves of the good
                                                                 º               I
conducting power of copper, in conjunction with the magnetic
virtue of the bar of iron, in order to obtain a maximum result
from the revolution of a metallic bar.

XLIV.       On the so-called Calorotypes, with Animadversions on
     the Papers of Mr. Hunt and Prof. Draper lately published in
     the Philosophical Magazine.     By Prof. LUDwig MoseR".
      WAS   not a little surprised to find in vol. lviii. of these
     Annalen, an article by Mr. Robert Huntt of Falmouth
on  Thermography,       and one on Calorotypes by M. Knorr, in
which are communicated as discoveries facts which I had
previously described at length in the same work. Mr. Hunt
sets out from my first Memoir on Visioni, in which demon                                                   I
strated the existence of invisible light; he repeats the experi
ments which he read $ in this Memoir, and gives them out as
his own discovery.       I cannot name a single experiment com
municated    by  either of the authors which I had not previously
described, except it be that the one employs a jasper instead
                                        I
of an agate, which used, or a bronze medallion instead of a
piece of copper coin.
   In my Memoir on Vision, &c. of May 1842 (vol. lvi. of
these Annalen), I communicated at page 206 [Scient. Mem.
vol.      iii.
           43] the fact, that when any body
              on p.                               warmed   depicts                  is                    it

                                is         the body.  These expe          of

358          Prof. L. Moser on the so-called Calorotypes.
 It is that experiment in which I caused a seal to depict itself
 on mercury with which a pure or silvered copper-plate had
 been coated, and afterwards produced the image in the iodine
 vapours.
    I now turn to the calorotypes of M. Knorr.            As soon as                                  I
 had found from    my  experiments    the fact that the actions of the
 bodies were manifested without any elevation of temperature,
I   operated at the ordinary temperature and never employed
 heat, for the phaenomenon appeared already to belong to a
                                                                   i. .#
 somewhat complicated class, which needed not to be rendered
 more intricate by the introduction of any foreign force.              In
 one case only did I depart from this                      that was in
 order to determine the colour of the latent light of oxygen.
 Since the affinity of several metals for this gas is increased
 by heat, I warmed plates of copper and brass, on which the
invisible rays had acted, and on their becoming iridescent,                                           I
obtained the images by means of the various colouring.                                                I
 communicated these results to several persons about the 18th
 Sept. 1842, and among others to the Editor of these Annalen
(Prof. Poggendorff), who had the kindness to bring them
before the notice of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and to
cause their publication in the Monthly Proceedings”. Now
 these are the calorotypes of M. Knorr, only, as              conceive,               I
obtained in a more       advantageous      manner;      for M. Knorr
heats the plate with the body to be depicted on it until the
former becomes iridescent. The image which is formed under
these circumstances             I
                           have long been acquainted with, but
even now in my opinion it affords no proof.               for instance,  If,

change in them: the light, on the contrary, which effected
that peculiar change on the surface of bodies which subse
quently is best rendered perceptible by the condensation of
vapours, is not again radiated, and it must therefore be as
sumed that it has become extinct with this action.                I have

scura, placed them in contact for a short or long period with
other iodized plates, or with plates of other metals; some
times      I
           employed for the same purpose metallic plates on
which the image produced by imperceptible light was in a far
more advanced state.                                       I

case have          I
                succeeded in detecting even a trace of transfer of
an  image   on to another plate. The light which has produced
its effect radiates accordingly           more.      no

360            Professor Sir William Rowan Hamilton on
the disappearance of the image must rather be ascribed to a
peculiar action of the oxygen of the atmosphere, on which
subject I recently made a preliminary communication to Sir
David Brewster and Professor Magnus, and intend shortly to
publish the details in these Annalen. Dr. Draper is so con
vinced of the radiation of these images, that he pretends to
preserve them by covering them, and in this scientific man
ner has discovered specific light analogous to specific heatl

    1. “On the general and minute Structure of the Spleen in Man
and other Animals.”      By William Julian Evans, M.D. Communi
cated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    After adverting briefly to the discordant opinions of Malpighi,
Ruysch, and others regarding the structure of the spleen, the author
  roceeds to detail the results of the investigations on this subject, in
which he has been for many years engaged. According to his ana
lysis, the following are the component parts of this organ:—first, a
reticulated fibro-elastic tissue; secondly, a pulpy parenchyma, con
taining the Malpighian glands and the splenic corpuscles; thirdly,
distinct cellular bodies; fourthly, the usual apparatus of arteries,
veins, lymphatics and nerves; fifthly, certain fluids; and lastly, the
membranes or tunics by which it is invested.
    He describes the cells of the spleen as being formed of a lining
membrane, continued from that of the splenic vein, and strengthened
by filaments of the fibro-elastic tissue. The splenic vein communi
cates with these cells, at first by round foramina, then by extensive
slits resembling lacerations; and it ultimately loses itself entirely in
the cells. The cells themselves communicate freely with one another,
 and also with the veins of the parenchyma; and may therefore be
 considered as in some measure continuations of the veins. This
 structure constitutes a multilocular reservoir of great extensibility,
 and possessing great elastic contractility; properties, however, which
 exist in a much less degree in the human spleen than in that of her
 bivorous animals; in which animals the cellated structure itself is
 much more conspicuous, and predominates over the parenchymatous
portion.    As the splenic artery has no immediate communication
 with the cells, these latter may be filled much more readily by in
jection from the vein than from the artery. In the ordinary state
of the circulation, the blood, which has passed into the cells from the
veins, is pressed into the branches of the splenic veins by a force de
rived from the elasticity of the fibro-elastic tissue which surrounds

372                    Royal Society: Mr. Newport on the
Annelida. He traces the different forms exhibited by the nervous
system in the principal genera of that order, the most perfect of
which are connected on the one hand with the Crustacea, and on
the other with true insects. Passing from these to the Geophili, the
lowest family of the Chilopoda, which still present the vermiform
type, the nervous system is traced to the tailed Arachnida, the
Scorpions, through Scolopendra, Lithobius and Scutigera; the last
of which tribes connects the Myriapoda on the one hand with the
true insects, and on the other with the Arachnida. The brain and
the visceral nerves, the coverings and structure of the cord and
ganglia, and the distribution of the systemic nerves are examined in
each genus, but more particularly in the Scorpion, in which the
nerves of the limbs are traced to the last joints of the tarsi, and
those of the tail to the extremity of the sting.           Especial attention is
bestowed on the structure of the cord and                ganglia, and their de

            Development and Circulation                         of the Myriapoda.                           373
sets of fibres, namely, an upper and an under one, communicating
with the cephalic ganglia; a transverse or commissural, which com
municates only with corresponding nerves on the opposite side of the
body; and a lateral set, which communicates only with nerves from
another ganglionic enlargement on the same side of the body, and
which forms part of the cord in the interspace between the gan
glia. The author had long suspected that this latter set of fibres
existed; but he had never, until lately, ascertained their presence by
actual observation.          Their action seems fully to account for the re
flected movements of parts both anterior and posterior to an irritated
limb; as that of the commissural set does the movements of parts
situated on the opposite side of the body to that which is irritated.

vous cord, this vessel is gradually lessened in size, until it arrives at
the terminal ganglion of the cord in the tail, where it is divided into
two branches, which take the course of the terminal nerves, and
these are again subdivided before they arrive at their ultimate distri
bution. In addition to these parts, the author found a hollow fibrous
structure, which closely surrounds the cord and nerves immediately
after they have passed beneath the arch of the thorax.         From the
sides of this structure there pass off backwards two pairs of vessels,
that get beneath the peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity and
are distributed on the first pair of branchiae. A small vessel also
passes   backwards beneath the cava, and, being joined by anasto
moses from the spinal artery, form the commencement of a vessel
which the author formerly described in the ‘Medical Gazette' as the
subspinal vessel. This vessel, extending along the under surface of
the nervous cord, communicates directly, by short vessels, with the
supra-spinal artery, and gives off, at certain distances from            under                          its
surface, several large vessels, which unite with others that convey

   He proceeds to consider, in the remaining part of his paper, the
application of the gas battery to the purposes of eudiometry, founded
on the circumstance already mentioned, that nitrogen gas, as well
as several other gases, are absolutely without effect in as far as re
gards any alteration of their volume, and may therefore be ad
vantageously employed in the analysis of atmospheric air, or other
mixed gases.    Several experiments of this nature are described, and
others suggested for future trial. Various theoretical views, arising
from this train of inquiry, are then discussed; particularly with re
ference to the contact theory, with which the author conceives that
the action of the gas battery is not reconcileable; and also to the
source of the caloric evolved during voltaic action, which he is
strongly inclined to think is in the battery itself.

stations previously recorded.
   The author first describes the experiments which                   instituted                           he
                                                                    be by

for determining the coefficient                 employed       the formula for

the  singular  fact  that,      needles made   in        particular   species    of  a                                      of
Russian steel, this coefficient         negative; that   is      these needles,            is,   in
 an increase                 of
                   temperature      increases the     magnetic     power.     M.
Adolphe Erman describes this particular kind               steel     consisting
                                                                                      of of               so as
of  alternate very thin layers         soft iron and  of  steel,     that when
heated the soft iron   layers   increase their   magnetic   intensity and the
steel layers diminish theirs.
   He next considers the more important question                 the steadiness                  of
with which the needles may have maintained their magnetic condi
tion. By intercomparison                            of
                                    the results obtained       various stations                at

   2. “On the Respiration of the Leaves of Plants.”               By William
Hasledine Pepys, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author gives an account of a series of experiments on the
products of the respiration of plants, and more particularly of the
leaves; selecting, with this view, specimens of plants which had
been previously habituated to respire constantly under an inclosure
of glass; and employing, for that purpose, the apparatus which he
had formerly used in experimenting on the combustion of the dia
mond*, and consisting of two mercurial gasometers, with the addi
tion of two hemispheres of glass closely joined together at their
bases, so as to form an air-tight globular receptacle for the plant
subjected to experiment.
   The general conclusions he deduces from his numerous experi
ments conducted during several years, are, first, that in leaves which
are in a state of vigorous health, vegetation is always operating to
restore the surrounding atmospheric air to             natural condition,   its                               by
the absorption               of
                    carbonic acid and the disengagement            oxygenous                 of
 gas: that this action      promoted        the influence
                                           is               by light,  but that         of
it continues         exerted, although more slowly, even
                        to       be                                   the dark.               in
 Secondly, that carbonic acid        never disengaged during the healthy
                                                       is

Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., F.R.S."
  In this paper the author details and discusses the magnetic obser
vations made on board Her Majesty's ships Erebus and Terror,
between October 1840 and April 1841, being the first summer which
the expedition under the command of Captain James Clark Ross,
R.N., passed within the Antarctic Circle.
   The elimination of the influence of the ship's iron in the calcula
tion of the results of these observations occupies a considerable por
tion of the paper. Formulae for this purpose are derived from M.
Poisson's fundamental equations, and the constants in the formulae
are computed for each of the two ships, from observations made on
board expressly with that object. With these constants, tables of
double entry are formed for each of the three magnetic elements,
namely, declination, inclination, and intensity, giving the required
corrections of each, for               all
                            the localities  the voyage.                  of
   These and other corrections being applied, the results are tabu
lated and charts formed from them. The full consideration of the
charts     is   postponed
                        until the whole                        of

higher intensity than would be expressed by 2:1 of the arbitrary
scale.    In this respect also the analogy between the two hemi
spheres appears to be closer than is shown in M. Gauss's maps,
Plate XVIII. With respect to the direction of as much of the line
of highest intensity (2:0) as it has been possible to draw with any
degree of confidence from the observations now communicated, it
will be found to be in almost exact parallelism with the isodynamic
line of 17 in Plate III. of the author's report “On the Variations of
the Magnetic Intensity,” in the Report of the eighth meeting of the
British Association, for 1838; which line was the highest of which
the position could be assigned at that period for any considerable
distance by the aid of the then existing determinations.
    3. “An Account of several new Instruments and Processes for
determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit," by Charles Wheat
stone, V.P.R.S., Professor of Experimental Philosophy in King's
College, London, Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of
 Sciences at Paris, &c.
    The author proposes in the present communication to give an ac
count of various instruments and processes which he has employed
during several years past for the purpose of investigating the laws
 of electric currents. He states that the practical object for which
these instruments were originally constructed, was to ascertain the
 most advantageous conditions for the production of electric effects
 through circuits of great extent, in order to determine the practica
 bility of communicating signals by means of electric currents to more
 considerable distances than had hitherto been attempted. Their use,
 however, is not limited to this special object, but extends equally to
 all inquiries relating to the laws of electric currents and to every
 practical application of this wonderful agent.
    As the instruments and processes described by the author are all
 founded on Ohm's theory of the voltaic circuit, he commences with
 a short account of the principal results to which this theory leads,
 and shows how the clear ideas of electromotive forces and resist
 ances, substituted for the vague notions of intensity and quantity
 which formerly prevailed, furnish us with satisfactory explanations
 of phenomena, the laws of which have hitherto been involved in ob
 scurity and doubt.     According to Ohm's system, the force of the
 current is equal to the sum of the electromotive forces divided by
 the sum of the resistances in the circuit. The several electromotive
 forces and resistances which enter into the circuit of a voltaic battery
 are then defined; and having frequent occasion to refer to the laws
 of the distribution of the electric current in the various parts of a
 circuit, when a branch conductor is placed so as to divert a portion
 of the current from a limited extent of that circuit, the author directs
 particular attention to these laws.     After recommending several
  new terms in order to express general propositions, without circum
 locution and with greater precision, the author states the method of
  obtaining the constants of a circuit employed by Fechner, Lenz,
 Pouillet, &c., and then proceeds to explain the new method he has

himself adopted.   The principle of this method is the employment
of variable instead of constant resistances, bringing, thereby, the
currents in the circuits compared to equality, and inferring from the
amount of the resistance measured out between two deviations of
the needle, the electromotive forces and resistances of the circuit
according to the particular conditions of the experiment; a method
 which requires no knowledge of the forces corresponding to differ
 ent deviations of the needle. To apply this principle, it is requisite
to have a means of varying the interposed resistance, so that it may
be gradually changed within any required limits.                The author de
scribes two instruments for effecting this purpose; one intended for
circuits in which the resistance is considerable, the other for circuits
in which it is small. The Rheostat (for thus the inventor names the
instrument under both                      its
                               forms) may also            usefully employed     be                                          as

   6. “Physiological inferences derived from Human and Compara
tive Anatomy respecting the Origins of the Nerves, the Cerebellum,
and the Striated Bodies."   By Joseph Swan, Esq.       Communicated
by Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author remarks that those parts of the nervous system which
are concerned in motion and in sensation exhibit a great similarity
in all vertebrate animals. To the first of these functions belong the
anterior and middle portions of the spinal cord and medulla oblon
gata, including the anterior pyramids, the crura cerebri, and some
fibres leading to the corpora striata and the convolutions, and also
the cerebellum.      To the function of sensation belong the posterior
surface of the   spinal   cord, the posterior and lateral portions of the
medulla oblongata,     including   the posterior pyramids, the ventricular
cords, and the fourth and third ventricles.
    From a general comparison of the relative magnitude and struc
ture of these several parts in the different classes of vertebrated
animals, the author infers that only a very small portion of the brain
is necessary for the origins of the nerves, their respective faculties
being generally derived near the place at which they leave the brain.
These origins are traced in various cases, where, from peculiarities
of arrangement or of destination, they present certain remarkable
differences of situation.
    The author is led to consider the cerebellum as an appendage
to the brain, rather than to the medulla oblongata and spinal
nerves, for it does not correspond with either the number or the
size of the sensitive or motor nerves; and that it is not required
for the intellect, for the special senses, for common sensation, or for
volition, appears from            its
                              size bearing     proportionno   the strength    to                      of

milation, nor does            its
                            size present any relation with the heart, the
lungs, the muscles, the limbs, the vertebrae, the ribs,             any other        or
organ, not even those           reproduction.

is  probable, also, that the principal crossing                     of
                                                         impulses from one

    increasing the vital powers, and imparting greater energy              the                   to

de l’Evaporation.” Par Daniel Parat, Médecin a Grenoble. Commu
nicated by the President.
   The author commences by explaining his conception of the nature
of heat, of which he gives the following definition:—“Mouvemens
centraux obsculaires de la cohésion devenus extemporanément plus
rapides, et dilatant de plus en plus tous les corps par une augmenta
tion aimsi acquise de toutes les forces centrifuges.”     He adopts the
theory that the evaporation of water in contact with air is a process
identical with chemical solution, and adduces as evidence supporting
his views various circumstances which are common both to evapora
tion and to the solution of a salt in water.

    The beautiful experiments of Mitscherlich on the indefinite con
version of alcohol into aether by the same quantity of sulphuric acid,
seem to point out the possibility of effecting a great improvement
in the economical production of that important substance.                  It is
well known that in the old process, in which equal weights of acid
and spirit are subjected to distillation, a large quantity of alcohol
escapes atherification at the commencement of the process, owing
to the low boiling-point of the mixture, and on the other hand,
much is destroyed towards the end of the distillation by the excess
ive heat; the limits of temperature within which aether is generated
in quantity being, as is well known, rather narrow, ranging perhaps
between 280° and 320°.
    In the continuous operation described by Mitscherlich such a mix
ture of alcohol and sulphuric acid is made that          boiling-point shall    its
 be  well within the aether-producing limit, while into this mixture,

perature and rapid and violent ebullition. It was soon found that
by a little management the thermometer could be kept quite sta
tionary at any required point within the limits before referred to.
At 300°, and thence to 360°, the separation of the distilled products
into two strata was very distinct and beautiful; at 280° to 290°,
enough      alcohol passed over unchanged to prevent this separation
until a little water had been added. There was a slight trace of
sulphurous acid, and the mixture in the flask gradually deepened in
colour, until at last it became nearly black, without however in the
slightest degree losing                its
                                     efficiency.

so experienced an engineer as Mr. Clegg to present himself before
the public as the inventor of an instrument which he considers likely
to realize what appears to be so much required.
   The construction and action of this meter are based upon the
established facts, that the heat and light from the various kinds of
carburetted hydrogen gas are strictly proportionate to each other; and,
by the application of that fact, in combination with an apparatus, act
ing on the same principle as the differential thermometer of Leslie.
   By this apparatus will be measured most delicately the smallest
differences of heat, and consequently the consumption of gas will be
registered in proportion to    illuminating power.   its

                                  determined the exact flow          air      gas                    of          or

 given quantity        gas of     certain uniform temperature, for the gas

being thus heated, and allowed to flow out at a given velocity, a
uniform flow of heat was obtained.
    Now, for the purposes of measuring this flow of heat, in the                                                    in
stance of a gas-meter, the source of heat is present by the inflam
mable gas itself; and, after numerous experiments, it was fully and
conclusively ascertained that a jet of gas, issuing out of an orifice,
perforated in the side of a small solid brass cylinder (such as will be
afterwards described, and shown in the annexed figures), will heat
the said cylinder to a uniform given temperature, whatever be the
height of the said jet : for, with a small flame, the jet clings, as it
were, and is in immediate contact with the solid cylinder; whereas,
when the flame issues from the orifice with considerable velocity, still
the longerjet only imparts the same degree of heat to the solid cylinder
as did the smaller one; the increased (or lengthened) flame being, in
this latter case, driven away from any closer contact by                own ve                     its
locity,    or
            rather             by

repeated experiments and practice, the necessary apparatus              the gas                     of

 sixty-four times as much air or gas as through a circular aperture of

     First,          the                previously described, are
                               two glass cylinders,              as                                                       to   be

motion with a power equal to the weight and height of the fluid
raised.   To ensure, however, the proper pendulous motion, it is
necessary to attach a counterbalance to the weight of the glass cy
linders and their connecting tube; this is further required, for the
purpose of regulating the quantity of alcohol to be driven into the
upper cylinder. The descent of this cylinder constitutes one vibration,
the counter weight giving it such sufficient preponderance or mo
mentum in its descent, as to cause it to impart motion, with cer
tainty, to a train of wheel-work, revolving in the way usual in gas
meters; and the vibration, and consequently the corresponding con
sumption of gas (or light), thereby becomes registered. The manner
of suspending the glass cylinders, and fixing the counterbalance
weight, is hereafter described.
   The next considerations are—1st, how is the tube or receptacle
before mentioned (and which will be called the “heater”) to be
placed over the lower cylinder, so that, in discharging thereupon the
hot gas, it may not communicate any of         heat    the upper one its            to
                                                                                                                at to at *
and, 2nd, how      place the upper cylinder
                           to                       medium always          ina

            it                             keep the two cylinders
                                                                to

   The preceding are the leading features of this philosophical ar
rangement for measuring the flow of gas of a given quality.                 With
the same heat the same results will obtain; the only variation that can
take place must be by change of temperature of the small jet of
flame which issues from the hemispherical end of the solid brass
cylinder, this being the governing principle; consequently, with an
increased temperature of the solid brass knob, caused by a brighter

    From the preceding, it is clearly proved that the illuminating
 power of gas depends upon the quantity of oxygen consumed, and
 of carbonic acid produced during combustion.
    The object of Dr. Henry's paper was only to prove the illuminating
 power of the gas; in order therefore to prove that the heat from
 the combustion of any gas increases in the direct ratio of the oxygen
 consumed, the following is extracted from Professor Graham's Trea
 tise on Chemistry:—
    “From the late researches of Despretz and of Bull, a very inter
 esting rule has been obtained; it is as follows:– That in        cases                                     all
 of       combustion the quantity                      of   heat evolved                is   proportional       to   the
 quantity    oxygen which enters into combination.’”

    And    Henry's Chemistry, ninth edition,
             in                                422, we find  stated,               p.                      it
 that “by the combustion       denser gases,   higher temperature
                                                  of                               a                                  is

 perature between the two cylinders, which forms the basis of the
 principle on which the vibrations are kept up. The “working gas,”
 after acting on the lower cylinder, as above described, flows down
 through the main body of the meter, and along the outlet at the bot
 tom, where it re-unites with the “neutral gas” coming through the
 regulating disc Z, and with it passes to the general exit, K, towards
 the burners.
    This, then, is the description of the whole of the mere meter,
 and it will be evident that no alteration in the measure can, at any
 time, take place by the leakage of valves, there not being any in the
 working parts, neither is there therein any membrane or partition,
 that when such become acted upon, and rendered porous by the ac
 tion of the gas, any portion can escape through them unmeasured;
 the moving power being the small light at the top (the “meter jet”),
 it will likewise be apparent that there is not the least resistance to
 the flows of the gas, and that thus the gas passes through every part of
 the meter in the same uninterrupted way it would flow through a
 pipe, neither interfering with the perfect steadiness of the lights, nor
 requiring any pressure.
    The remaining mechanical contrivances are for stopping-off the
 gas from the burners when the meter jet is not lighted, for giving
a temporary extra temperature to the heater, for a few minutes only,
 when the meter jet is first lighted, and for the regulation of that
jet (when the meter is originally fixed in its place) according to the
 pressure; the whole contrivances being chiefly, as before observed,
for preventing fraud, and ensuring proper registration.
    To prevent the gas flowing to the burners, except when the meter
jet is lighted, and the meter registering accordingly, a valve which
communicates with the supply of gas is opened or shut by the ex
pansion or contraction of a pyrometer, the heat to which is com
municated by the small jet at G.

     ACTION OF   sul PHUROUS      ACID ON METALLIC Oxi DEs.
  The following are the results of experiments on the action of sul
phurous acid on metallic oxides by M. Vogel.
   1st. Red oxide of mercury at first becomes protoxide combined
with sulphurous and sulphuric acids, and is afterwards completely
reduced to the metallic state by sulphurous acid.
   2nd. Pernitrate of mercury is slowly reduced by sulphurous acid,
but the reduction becomes perfect with the aid of heat; the protoni
trate is reduced in the same manner, but more rapidly.
   3rd. Bichloride of mercury is not reduced, under the same cir
cumstances, by sulphurous acid, lower than to protochloride; and
when the solution of the bichloride is mixed with a sufficient quan
tity of sulphurous acid, it is not decomposed by the caustic alkalies
added in excess; the mercury remains in solution in the alkaline
liquor.
   4th. Protochloride of mercury is not reduced to the metallic state
by sulphurous acid, but merely to a subchloride of mercury; but
subpersulphate of mercury (turbith mineral) is entirely reduced by
sulphurous acid.
   5th. Neither oxide nor nitrate of silver is completely reduced by
sulphurous acid.
    6th. The oxides of zinc, antimony and uranium, do not suffer the
slightest reduction by sulphurous acid.
   7th. The black oxide of copper calcined and left in contact with
sulphurous acid, becomes brown protoxide, and the acetate of the
oxide becomes acetate of suboxide when heated; the greater part
of the copper being deposited in the state of brown suboxide.

  oxygen to sulphurous acid; but the peracetate of iron becomes pro
  toacetate by its action.
      9th. Molybdic acid is not reduced by sulphurous acid, but mo
  lybdate of potash is reduced to a low state of oxidizement, to the
  blue compound or molybdous acid.—Journal de Pharmacie et de

                EXTRACTION OF PALLADIUM IN BRAZIL,
     The extraction of palladium from the auriferous sand of Brazil
  consists in fusing it with silver, and consequently forming a quater
  mary alloy of gold, palladium, silver and copper, which is granulated
  by projecting it into water.
     By treating this alloy with nitric acid the gold is separated from
  the other metals which are soluble in the acid; the silver is precipi
  tated by a solution of common salt in the state of insoluble chloride,
  which being separated, the copper and palladium are precipitated by
  plates of zinc. The pulverulent deposit of these metals is redissolved
 in nitric acid and the solution precipitated by excess of ammonia,
 which redissolves the oxide of copper and of palladium; when the
  ammoniacal solution of these metals is saturated with hydrochloric
  acid, a double chloride of palladium and ammonia is deposited in the
 state of a crystalline yellow powder, and this when calcined in a
 crucible is readily decomposed, and leaves spongy palladium—

 ON    THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE                ON   THE PRODUCTION
                 OF IODOFORM.         BY M. BOUCHARDAT.
     Many instances of the influence of temperature in chemical reac
 tions are known, to which M. Bouchardat has added that which it
 exerts in the production of iodoform.
     If to water containing iodide of potassium and a little alcohol,
 iodine and potassium be alternately added in sufficient quantity to
 decolorize and colour the liquor, it becomes hot, and there are
 successively produced acetic aether, and iodoform without any trace
of iodate of potash.
    But if instead of this the iodine be dissolved in the water and al
cohol holding iodide of potassium in solution, and to these there be
added an aqueous solution of potash, but not in sufficient quantity
to decolorize the liquors, and then fresh iodine be added and suc
cessively potash in sufficient quantity to decolorize, then no trace
of iodoform is produced. The oxygen which the iodine displaces
from the potash acts upon the alcohol to convert it into acetic aether,
which may be easily separated; but the action goes no further; as
soon as the alcohol is converted into acetic aether, the oxygen dis
placed acts upon the iodine to produce iodate of potash which is
deposited.
    Thus with excess of iodine at common temperatures, there is no

XLIX.     Description of the Tithonometer, an instrument for
   measuring the Chemical Force of the Indigo-tithonic Itays.
   By John W. DRAPER, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in
   the University of New York”.
I HAVE       invented an instrument for measuring the chemical
     force of the tithonic rays which are found at a maximum
in the indigo space, and which from that point gradually fade
away to each end of the spectrum.        The sensitiveness, speed
of action and exactitude of this instrument, will bring it to rank
as a means of physical research with the thermo-multiplier of
M. Melloni.
   The means which have hitherto been found available in op
tics for measuring intensities of light, by a relative illumination
of spaces or contrast of shadows, are admitted to be inexact.
The great desideratum in that science is a photometer which
can mark down effects by movements over a graduated scale.
 With those optical contrivances may be classed the methods
hitherto adopted for determining the force of the tithonic rays
 by stains on Daguerrotype plates or the darkening of sensitive
papers. As deductions, drawn in this way, depend on the
opinion of the observer, they can never be perfectly satisfac
 tory, nor bear any comparison with thermometric results.
     mpressed with the importance of possessing for the study
 of the properties of the tithonic rays some means of accurate
 measurement,    I have resorted in vain to many contrivances;
 and, after much labour, have obtained at last the instrument
 which it is the object of this paper to describe.
    The tithonometer consists essentially of a mixture of equal
 measures of chlorine and hydrogen gases, evolved from and
 confined by a fluid which absorbs neither.       This mixture is
 kept in a graduated tube, so arranged that the gaseous surface

 exposed to the rays never varies in extent, notwithstanding
 the contraction which may be going on in                   volume, and the                its

    The theoretical conditions of the instrument are therefore
 sufficiently simple; but, when we come                put them into prac            to
 tice, obstacles which appear            first sight   insurmountable are
                                                                  at

        From this it will be perceived that, taking the first experi

meter has moved 7:00, at the end of 60" it has moved 8:00
more, at the end of 90", 7.50 more, at the end of 120", 7.75
more; the numbers set down in the vertical column repre

when it is recollected that the readings are    made with the                          all

 apprehended.                    If
                       half the surface of the lens be screened by
an  opake   body,  as a piece of blackened cardboard, of course
 only half the quantity of rays will pass which would have
 passed had the screen not been interposed.               one-fourth of                        If
 the lens be left uncovered, only one-fourth of the quantity
 will pass; but in                     all
                           these instances the focal image remains
 the same           as
              before.    By   adjusting, therefore, upon the wooden
 frame     the lens, two screens the edges
             of                                    which pass through            of

                           when the screens are

positions, we can gain          quantities from               180°, and                   0°   up    to

 of the yellow, insulated by the same, being marked 3; the                                in
 tervening region being divided into two equal spaces, and                                di

    As instruments will no doubt be hereafter invented for
 measuring the phaenomena of different classes of rays, it may
 prove convenient to designate the precise ray to which they
 apply. Perhaps the most simple mode is to affix the name of
 the ray itself.       Under that nomenclature the instrument de
 scribed in this paper would take the name of Indigo-tithono
Ineter.
    There is no difficulty in adapting this instrument to the
determination of questions relating to absorption, reflexion
and transmission.             Thus     I found that a piece of colourless
 French      plate-glass     transmitted 866 rays out of 1000.
    Description      of   the Instrument.           First, of the glass part.—
The tithonometer consists of a glass tube bent into the form
of a siphon, in which chlorine and hydrogen can be evolved
from muriatic acid, containing chlorine in solution, by the
agency of a voltaic current. It is represented by fig. 1, where
a b c is a clear and thin tube four-tenths of an inch external
diameter, closed at the end a. At d a circular piece of metal,
an inch in diameter, which may be called the stage, is fastened
on the tube, the distance from d to a being 2.9 inches. At
the point r, which is two inches and a quarter from d, two
platina wires, r and y, are fused into the glass, and entering
into the interior of the tube, are destined to furnish the sup
ply of chlorine and hydrogen; from the stage d to the point
b, the inner bend of the tube, is 2-6 inches, and from that

peppercorn be left, the operator will be abundantly satisfied
with the sensitiveness of his instrument. Commonly, at first,
a large residue of hydrogen gas, occupying perhaps an inch or
more, will be left.  It is to be understood that even this large
surplus will disappear in a few hours by absorbing chlorine.
But this is not to be waited for ; as soon as no further rise
takes place in a minute or two, the siphon is to be inclined on
one side, and the residue turned out into the open leg.
   Now, recurring to what has been said on the equilibrium,
it is plain that this excess of hydrogen arises from a want of
chlorine in the tithonometric liquid. A proper quantity must
therefore be furnished by proceeding as follows.
   The sentient tube being filled with the liquid by inclination,
connect the polar wires with p q, as before. These may be
called generating wires.      Allow the liquid to rise in b c, until
the third   platina   wire z, which may be called the adjusting
wire, is covered an eighth of an inch deep. Then remove the
negative wire from the cup p into the cup r, and now the con
ditions for saturating the liquid are complete; hydrogen esca
ping away from the surface of the liquid at 2, and chlorine
continually accumulating and dissolving between a and d.
This having been carried on for a short time, the gas in a d
is to be turned out by inclination and the instrument re
charged.     That a proper quantity is evolved is easily ascer
tained  by  allowing   total condensation to take place, and ob
serving that only a small bubble is left at a.
   It will occasionally happen in this preliminary adjustment,
that an excess of chlorine may arise from continuing the pro
cess too long.    This is easily discovered by       greenish-yel its

same, it should be 14; at the end of the third 21, &c. &c.
This may be done until the fiftieth division is reached, which
is the terminus of the scale.
   Recharge the tube by a momentary application of the polar
wires: but it is convenient first to remove any excess of mu
riatic acid gas in the sentient tube by allowing it time for con
densation; or, if that be inadmissible, by inclining a little on
one side, so as to give an extensive liquid contact.
   Of the Method of interrupted observation.—It frequently
happens that observations cannot be had during a continuous
descent, as when changes have to be made in parts of appa
ratus or arrangements.       We have then to resort to inter
rupted observations.
   This method requires that the gas and liquid should be
well adjusted, so that no change can arise in volume when
extensive contact is made by inclination.
   The tithonometer being charged, place it in a proper posi
tion.   At a given instant remove       cap, and the liquid de       its

  The    same original volume of gas in a d will last for a long
time, as we keep replenishing it as often as the fiftieth division
is reached.
   The experimenter cannot help remarking, that on suddenly
exposing the sentient tube to a bright light, the liquid for an
instant rises on the scale, and on dropping the cap in an in
stant falls. This important phaenomenon, which is strikingly
seen under the action          of an electric spark,   I
                                                 shall consider
hereafter.
   In conclusion, as to comparing the tithonometric indication
at different times, if the gases have the same constitution, the
observations will compare; and if they have not the value can
from time to time be ascertained by exposure to a lamp of con
stant intensity.                         I
                   To this method commonly resort.
   From the space occupied in this description the reader
might be disposed to infer that the tithonometer is a very
complicated instrument and difficult to use. He would form,
however, an erroneous opinion. The preliminary adjustment
can be made in five minutes, and with it an extensive series of
measures obtained. These long details have been entered into
that the theory of the instrument may be known, and optical
artists construct it without difficulty. Though surprisingly
sensitive to the action of the indigo ray, it is as manageable by
a careful experimenter as a common differential thermometer.

       DEAR SIR,
     CANNOT      but regret that any remarks which I may have
   made on the very interesting discoveries of Professor Moser,
should have so far disturbed the philosophic quiet of his mind,
which it is so important to maintain, when engaged in the        in
vestigation of truth, as my paper on Thermographyl appears
to have done... I am, however, called upon to reply to M.
Moser's remarks, which appear in your Journal for Novem
º
ber, in a way that is very unpleasing to me.     However much
men may differ, in the interpretations they give to obscure

truth, or facilitate the progress of inquiry, by indulging in
           attacks.   I have ever pursued my inquiries with,       I
  ope, but one object in view. The investigation of curious
phaenomena has ever been a pleasure to me, and an occasional
discovery has been       its

416     Mr. Hunt          on the Spectral Images                     of M. Moser,
expected to be charged with repeating the experiments of others
and giving them out as my own discovery.           The mind of that
man, who thinks to elevate himself by any paltry piracy of
this kind, is of a low order, and the attempt to defraud the
public by any such means is certain, sooner or later, to have
its  full amount      punishment
                     of                the contempt
                                                 in       the many and      of
the pity  of  the few.     But feel myself put upon my defence.

in   many    ofthe leading scientific journals for December, was,
I   believe, the first series              of

included in M. Moser's attack, that they should not remain unaware                               of
misrepresentations which were     circulation abroad, and thus
                                            in                    enabled              be

   Now, with regard to the experiments themselves, surely
Professor Moser will not claim as his own the experiments, of
placing a coin on a glass or polished metal plate, or of writing
on glass with a piece of steatite, and bringing out the images
by breathing on them. Dr. Draper in 1840 published this *;
and when a schoolboy, twenty years ago, I tried these expe
riments without ever suspecting their scientific value, which
M. Moser was the first to call attention to. M. Moser, in
his memoir ‘On the Action of Light on Bodies,” states,
“Silver and other metallic plates were made warm, and cold
bodies, variously cut stones, figures of horn, pasteboard, cork,
coins, &c. allowed to remain on them for some time.”                    It
must be      distinctly    understood,    that at the     meeting  of the
British Association it was stated, that the images could be
brought out by the vapours of water, mercury, &c.; but with
out being, at the period of making my experiments, October
 1842, aware of the above, which I did not see until February
 1843, my first simple experiments convinced me that some
connexion existed between the conducting powers of bodies,
 as it regards heat, and the strength of the impressions made by
 them.     With this in view I tried good and bad conductors of
 heat, from copper plates and coins to platina ones, glass and
 charcoal.     These constitute the experiments given in para
 graphs from 2 to 7 of my paper.              Now if M. Moser used                                        all
 these materials, and                     do
                                 not doubt but
                                     I                 may have done so,      he
 he  certainly did not make his experiments with the same ob
ject    inview,       or        he
                          would not have neglected            observe the               to
 fact, which      Iwas the first        announce, that “bodies which
                                                    to
 are bad conductors                  of

 cidedly the strongest impressions.”             am quite ready  I    give                         to
 up  any claim        the experiments, but
                           to                      reserve     myself the
                                                                      I                  to
 interpretation they afford.
    M. Moser says,                   “I
                              cannot name         single experiment, &c.

silver.       I
           find that M. Moser has also used coloured glasses,
but principally upon iodized silver plates. It is to be lamented
 that he has made so great a number of very careful experi
 ments in this way; for, by regarding the colour of the glass,
 and the colour of the ray which permeates                     the same,      it,   as                         he
 has been led        someto  very  incorrect   conclusions,        the slight              as
 est   acquaintance    with the valuable labours           Sir John           of                          Her
 schel would have shown him.              My use       coloured glasses  of                                    in
 these experiments was confined            the heating powers
                                                        to              the                     of            dif
Jerent    colours, and these were contrasted with smoked               glasses,
 and the like, the results showing, whether the experiments
 were made         sunshine
                    in                night, that those glasses, the red
                                            or    at
 and blackened      ones,   which admitted the permeation,                    ab                      or
 sorbed the largest quantity                           of
                                          heat, made the most decided
 impressions             on
                      metal plates.          cannot see how M. Moser
                                                        I
 makes out his claim            these   experiments,
                                        to               except           upon                  it   is
 the principle that Professors Faraday and Daniell are guilty                                                  of
 scientific piracy        publishing,

 M. Moser's, or otherwise. . I have seen paragraphs stating
that M. Moser has succeeded in copying engravings from
paper, but   I   do not, even now, know his experiments. I shall
not dispute with M. Moser the point of priority, but trust he                    I
will do me the justice of acknowledging, that he has judged
hastily in accusing me of having appropriated his experiments
without acknowledgement. In the paper in question I thought
I   had sufficiently acknowledged the high merits of Professor
Moser; I again do so. He has opened a new and important
path of physical inquiry, which promises to lead to some great
truths connected with the constitution of matter, and the ope
rations of the imponderable elements; at the same time, how
ever, that I admit the importance of his discoveries, I must be
allowed, for the present, to dissent from his conclusions.
    It is not my intention to offer any further remarks in explai
nation of that portion of M. Moser's paper which particularly
applies to myself, but      I  must be allowed this opportunity of
reviewing some of the opinions he has put forth, and of ex
plaining my reasons for differing from him.
    M. Moser states that every body must be considered as self
luminous, and he appears to view the accelerating power ex
erted by heat, as stated in his own experiments, as the influ
ence of caloric increasing the intensity of the invisible radia
tions, whilst as “their temperature becomes higher their re
frangibility decreases.” It becomes necessary, in the first place,
to ascertain upon what evidence this self-luminosity of bodies
is asserted. It has been long known, that light acting upon
                                of its
ioduret of silver, alters        condition, and renders       capable       it             of
condensing the vapours           mercury               in

                                                        a    manner;--
this constitutes the Daguerreotype.               has been shown that

cing definite changes in the condition of the surface of solid
bodies, and the remarkable property of two substances in
juxtaposition, inducing upon each other changes which may be
 rendered evident to the senses; and these changes, it must be
 remembered, are not confined to the surface merely, but they
 penetrate to a considerable depth into the solid structure of
 the mass, as I have already proved in several of my published
experiments.
    These results, in addition to many which                           I
                                                         have previously
 given, also show the impropriety of considering these spectral
 images as the effects of “invisible light,” “light radiated in
absolute darkness,” as they have been by M. Moser.                 I must
 in this  place express    my   conviction,   that  any   term  involving
 an idea contrary to our received ideas, is calculated to produce
 much confusion. Light is that element which affects the organ
 of sight, enabling us to distinguish objects; that which does
 not do this is no longer light. The prismatic spectrum has
 been proved to consist of one element giving light and colour,
 of another element affording heat, and of a third element, which
 is active in producing chemical change.            Now M. Moser                           in
 forms us that it is neither of these, but a class of rays which
 are still more refrangible than those which have been called
 the “invisible chemical rays.”          “According to my experi
 ments,” he says, “the invisible rays of light pass very readily
 through aqueous solutions of various kinds, and through dif
<U+017F>º
 ferent oils, but they decidedly do not pass through the thinnest
         of glass, mica, or rock-salt, &c.” Now, as M. Moser
   as not given us his experiments, it is very difficult to deal
 with them. In the first place, he has not, as it appears to me,
 as yet afforded any evidence of the existence of such a class
 of rays as those he speaks of; and if the “thinnest plates of
 glass, &c.” are not permeated by these rays, upon what prin
                  he,   by
 ciple does           the use      coloured glasses, prove “that light
                                       of
 and mercurial vapour are identical               their effects?” The

vapour, but the space occupied by the extra spectral red rays,
had undergone that change, which renders metals most suscep
tible to the action of vapours, and a thick white line of vapour
very distinctly marked this calorific region, giving a spectral
image similar to the accompanying figure. It does not appear
that so long an exposure to solar influence was necessary,
for a similarly condensed spectrum was allowed to traverse
over a polished copper plate for a few hours.       On submitting
this plate to vaporization, a line of thickly-deposited mercurial
vapour distinctly marked the path of the extra-spectral red
rays.   I should explain that I mean the extreme red ray of
the spectrum, which is seen when it is looked at through a
cobalt-blue glass, and which has been made the subject of
much attention by Sir John Herschel, and some rays below
this extreme red ray.    These rays cover a space which cor
respond as nearly as possible with the large heat-spot in Sir
John Herschel's thermographic spectrum. I have been ex
ceedingly anxious to repeat these experiments on other metals,
but the unfavourable state of the weather, and the advanced
season has compelled me to abandon this examination for the
present.

    Three very large flat white glass bottles were provided, and
filled with coloured fluids, blue, yellow and red. The light        .

          a   powerful accelerating agent.
      M. Moser has not told us how he has determined that his
 dark light passes readily through aqueous solutions and oils.
I    have tried some experiments which are instructive, and                                                       I

to the British Association at Cork, I stated several experi

Copper plates were polished with water only and boiled, and
all the things placed               on
                             these plates were boiled also, yet very
perfect images were produced.             have since tried the effect

apparent difference between the images formed under these
circumstances, and those formed upon plates, and with medals,
&c. which have been purposely covered with very slight films
of  organic matter.          have also repeated these experiments

easily ascertain the force necessary to move the apparatus at any
given velocity; for, having given in the first instance the re
quired velocity with the hand, it was easily observed, in the
course of about 40 revolutions of the axle, corresponding to

placed in the scales were just able to maintain that velocity.

connected with the large electro-magnet; and the small com

  Another experiment, conducted in precisely the same man

capable of raising 587 lbs. to the height of one foot.
  As the preceding experiments are somewhat complicated,
and therefore subject to the accumulation of small errors of
observation,        I
                 thought it would be desirable to execute some
of a more   simple  character.  For this purpose determined                                I
upon an arrangement in which the whole of the heat would
be evolved in the revolving tube.
   The iron cylinder used in previous experiments was placed
in an electrotype apparatus constructed in such a manner as
to render every part of it equally exposed to the voltaic action.
In four days 11 oz. of copper were deposited in a hard com
pact stratum.     The ends of the cylinder were then filed until
the iron just  appeared. Thus I had a cylinder of iron imme
diately surrounded by a hollow cylinder of pure copper nearly
one-eighth of an inch thick. This was placed in the centre of
a new revolving tube fitted up in precisely the same manner as
the former one, which had been accidentally broken, and sur
rounded with 114 oz. of water.      I give the following series of
                                                                              j,

  I now    proceeded to ascertain, by means already described,
the mechanical power by which the above effects were                                                                     pro
duced.     First, I ascertained the current passing through the
coil of the electro-magnet; then the weights necessary to
maintain the velocity of 600 revolutions per minute, both
when the magnet was in action and when contact with the
 battery was broken.      I have collected the results of my expe
 riments on this   subject in the following table. The first five
 were obtained with a battery of ten cells in a series of five;
 the last two with a battery of five pairs in series.

chemical force causing the atoms to combine.           now venture                    I
to state more explicitly, that it is not precisely the attraction of
affinity, but rather the mechanical force expended by the atoms
in falling towards one another, which determines the intensity
of the current, and consequently the quantity of heat evolved;
so that we have a simple hypothesis by which we may explain
why heat is evolved so freely in the combination of gases, and
by which indeed we may account “latent heat” as a mecha
nical power prepared for action as a watch spring is when
wound up.      Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that 8 lbs.
of  oxygen  and 1 lb. of hydrogen were presented to one another
in the gaseous state, and then exploded, the heat evolved would
be about one degree Fahr. in 60,000 lbs. of water, indicating
a mechanical force expended in the combination equal to a
weight of about 50,000,000 of lbs. raised to the height of one
foot.    Now if the oxygen and hydrogen could be presented
to each other in a liquid state, the heat of combination would
be less than before, because the atoms, in combining, would
fall through less space. The hypothesis             confess, suffici        is,
                                                                             I

   Dec. 29.—Last night a gale, continuing in the morning;
wind west-south-west. The fall in the barometer at the com
mencement was not more than one-tenth of an inch, and du
ring the night it did not fall at all, standing during the gale
at 29.9. Thermometer yesterday morning at 34°, with a hard
frost on the ground, which lasted till 11 o'clock a.m. At 10
o'clock p.m. thermometer was 48° (a difference of 14°), and
this morning at 50°.
   Dec. 30.—Last night, but more particularly from 3 o'clock
this morning, very heavy gusts of wind nearly west, without
any rise or fall in barometer worth notice; but the tempera
ture at night was 50°, and at half-past 7 o'clock this morning
52°.     About half-past 6 o'clock in the morning I thought I
saw    patches  or gleams of electric light along the grass. Gale
continued throughout the day, barometer rising very slowly.

   Now assuming, according to custom, that A, is always plus,
it is plain, that if any one of the right-hand conditions have
place, without regarding those on the left, a pair of imaginary
roots will necessarily be indicated; because, although the ac
companying left-hand condition should not have place, yet,
by ascending to the preceding pair of conditions, and thence
to that next in order, and so on, we should evidently at length
arrive at a co-existent pair. It is equally evident          no two                                       º:
consecutive pairs can exist simultaneously, since the second

whom half a century back they were utterly inaccessible, it ap
pears a strange anomaly that there should be less of serious and
deep thought than in the days when little adventitious aid to study
of any kind could be obtained; yet those who have observed most
closely, and reflected most deeply, agree in the opinion that such is
the case, and that the present age, with all its “appliances and
means” of knowledge, may be justly termed superficial.           One ob
vious cause of such a state of things, and the only one which it is
needful to our present purpose to notice, arises from the immense
increase of our population—all struggling for maintenance, or for
the good things of this world in some shape—all ashamed not to
possess some slight acquaintance with the literature of the day, yet
all too much engrossed by the immediate pressure of their daily con
cerns to give more than a passing thought to other matters. Among
the many whose cases come under the above description, there must
however be a large number who would gladly obtain more solid                                     in
formation on subjects, both of science and general knowledge, than
has hitherto been within their grasp; but how can the evening of a
 day of toil, or a proper use of the needful and holy rest of Sunday,
 afford leisure for the study of voluminous writings, even were the
 demand on their pockets within the means of those who would learn
if they could       The strong conviction of the necessity of <U+017F>urnish
 ing persons so situated with the mental nourishment they require in
 a condensed form, has induced a few friends to unite “for the pur
 pose of supplying the deficiency,” which, as their prospectus states,
 “could hardly be supplied in the common course of trade;” and the
 three little works, whose names stand at the head of this article, have
 been already published by the Society. We willingly co-operate in
 a design so well intentioned, and so likely, we think, to be useful to
 the world, by introducing them to the notice of our readers, to whom,
 however, it is very probable that the 2nd and 3rd numbers may be
 already known, being the substance of two lectures delivered, one in
  1841, the other in the spring of this year, at the Royal Institution,
 by the Rev. John Barlow.
     In the first treatise, “Philosophical Theories and Philosophical
 Experience,” the ‘Pariah' (as the author chooses to style himself)
  discourses on those most important of                       all
                                                subjects, the present and

  all true religion  and all real philosophy   must accord,  since eternal
  truth is  One, and admits of no contradictions; and that the word of
  God and reason unite       pointing out
                                   in          man wherein his real good
                                                          to

 mankind     in   all
                    ages, and whose solution forms the basis            sy            of   all

 (Phil. Theo. and Phil. Er. pp. 11, 12.)
   In  reply  to the first query the author proves, that “by legitimate           a

course of reasoning we arrive at the certainty of one eternal, self
existent, all-wise, and all-powerful Being, whom our simple ances
tors, with a degree of philosophical accuracy which no other nation
seems to have reached, named Rob, i. e. good.” (Ibid. p. 19.)      He
shows that “Christianity goes further,” but in strict accordance with
those conceptions of the Almighty which the purest philosophy
could form; and that “it sets before man an exemplar of human
virtue, made perfect by the indwelling of the Deity.” (Ibid. p. 41.)
   In the solution of the second inquiry the ‘Pariah' classifies “the
phaenomena of man's nature into
    “1. The instinctive emotions and appetites.
   “2. The faculties.
   “3. The will.” (Ibid. p. 54.)
   The two former, partaking “ of the changes which the body un
dergoes,” are assumed to be “bodily;” but “the individual and                                                        in
telligent will,” which can control and restrain the emotions and
direct the faculties, and also “that species of memory which forms
the consciousness of identity, and which (however ordinary recollec
tions may be impaired by the injury or disease of the brain) never
suffers any change from infancy to death" (ibid. p. 37), cannot be
bodily, and are consequently considered by the ‘Pariah' as “spiritual
and unchanging functions.”
   The “practical results” which form the reply to the third query
are such as, were they carried out in their full extent (and there is
no insurmountable obstacle in the nature of things against it), would
render our earth a paradise in comparison with its actual condition.
    “Ihave stated,” says the Pariah, “that an essential part of the great
Self-existent Cause of        things,     all
                                            free and governing will.

   “Thus we have three distinct systems of nervous mechanism in the
living body, each dependent on the other, namely,
   “l. The unconscious involuntary nerves of life.

   “3. The conveyers of volition from the brain to the organs fitted for
action; which are respectively termed the sympathetic, the sensitive and the
motor nerves.” (Connection between                                Physiology and Intellectual                 Philosophy,

458            Geological Society:                      Mr. Fox's       Notice     of
an agate cup and moving on a steel point.                 A fine brass wire was
coiled forty-eight times round the box which contained the needle.
    The ore-points connected with the two extremities of the appa
ratus were, in some instances, only six or eight fathoms apart, but
in others thirty, forty, and even 100. The small portion of the south
vein which could be tried produced a deflection in the needle of about
20° from the point of rest, after the circuit had been repeatedly made
and broken; the currents passing from east to west through the ap
paratus.     In the north vein the deflections amounted to 45°, 60°,
and 80° in different levels, the direction of the currents being the
same as in the south vein ; and in the eastern portion of the six
 fathom-level the needle traversed completely round and continued to
revolve a short time after the circuit was broken.
    Sulphuret of lead being much more electro-positive than arsenical
copper or iron pyrites, contact was made with those ores, generally
 dry, without affecting the currents, when the ore-points thus varied
were near together, and there was no defect in the contact with
 them. These results were not apparently modified by the method of
                                                                                 it,

making the contact, or by the metal employed to effect               provided
adequate degree       of   pressure was employed. For instance,           point         a
a  copper wire pressed against            given ore-point was mostly
                                               a                             effec          as
tual
         as
         a plate  of    that metal similarly treated; and when zinc and
platinum were successively substituted for copper                   change wasno
produced.
    It   is,
          therefore, evident, Mr. Fox remarks, that these electric cur
rents were independent             extraneous causes, and were derived from
                                     of
the veins   only.
    Towards the eastern part                the north mine arsenical pyrites

460    Geological Society:                      Mr. Logan               on the St. Lawrence,
water is still, it is immediately cased over. The first barrier completed
across the river below Montreal is usually formed about Christmas, at
the entrance of Lake St. Peter's, where the St. Lawrence is divided
into a multitude of channels by low alluvial islands. This barrier is
rapidly increased by extensive fields of drift-ice, enormous quantities
of which are heaped upon, or forced under, the stationary mass. The
space left for the water to flow being thus greatly diminished, a per
ceptible rise in the river takes place, and by the time that the ice
becomes stationary at the foot of St. Mary's current, opposite Mont
real, the waters in the harbour have usually risen several feet, and as
the packing rapidly proceeds, they soon attain the height of twenty,
and sometimes twenty-six feet, above the summer level. It is at
this period that the grandest glacial phaenomena are presented.
In consequence of the packing and piling of the ice, as well as the
accumulation of the moistened snow of the season, and the freezing
of the whole into a solid body, sometimes more than twenty feet
thick, the water suddenly rises, and lifting a wide expanse of the en
tire covering of the St. Lawrence, urges it forward with terrific vio
lence, piling up the rended masses on the banks of the narrower
parts of the river to the height of forty or fifty feet. In front of
Montreal is a newly built revetement, the top of which is twenty
three feet above the summer level of the river; but the ice broken by
it,  accumulates           on
                        the surmounting terrace, and before the wall was
erected the adjacent buildings were endangered, the ice sometimes
 breaking          in
                   the windows         the second floor, even 200 feet from

 extensive one which occurred on the Maskinongé in 1840 is described
 in this part of Mr. Logan's paper.
    The waters of that river, after passing through a series of lakes, are
precipitated from the granitic region in a beautiful cascade, and then
 flow along a deep valley in the terrace, the only interruption to their
course being a collection of boulders combined with a mill-dam, pro
 ducing a fall of about fifteen feet. The valley has a uniform breadth,
 the distance between the summit of the banks being about 200 yards,
 and the height of the banks is 120 feet.                                         -
     The   point  at which the     landslip   occurred is nine miles from the
 granitic hills, and where the river, ten to twenty yards wide, changes
 its  direction from south         west, for 700 yards. The movement com

                                                              about three hours.
For some time after the movement began the surface                       the great of
masses remained unbroken, and the sugar maple-trees, with which
they were covered, preserved, for the greater part,                          an

Two farm-steads were also carried away, and though the people
escaped, the cattle, and other live stock perished with the falling
buildings.       The masses which moved along the valley had                height      a
of   about sixty feet, and their surface was slightly raised, but the
front  of   each terminated              blunt point which projected            the         in

shares advanced, they turned up, Mr. Logan says, the soft mud from
the bed     of the river, casting           it   on
                                            the banks, and producing          into      so
lerable      stench that        no
                               one could approach within 100 yards. This
odour,  he a  conceives, arose from the sulphuretted hydrogen produced
 by  the decay       vegetable matter.

overtopped the barrier; but                 by

from the White Sea, and 130 feet above its level.          He also alludes
to Mr.    Lyell's  comparison   of the Quebec shells with species which
occur at Uddevalla.
    A communication was afterwards made by Dr. Grant, F.G.S.,
“On the Structure and History of the Mastodontoid Animals of
North America."
   The chief object of this communication was to point out the
structural differences and zoological distinctions of the Mastodons
and Tetracaulodons of North America; and the inquiries were            in
stituted in consequence of the favourable opportunity afforded by the
temporary exhibition, in this metropolis, of Mr. Koch's large collec
tion of organic remains from the State of Missouri, consisting prin
cipally of the relics of these two genera.
   After pointing out the important applications of the study of these
remains, and the geological relations of Mastodontoid animals, and
the discordant opinions of zoologists as to their specific distinctions,
Dr. Grant entered into extended details regarding the general struc
ture and the peculiarities of the skeleton in the three principal
Mastodontoid genera, Mastodon, Tetracaulodon, and Deinotherium,
which are compared with those of the elephant and other allied ge
nera. The fifth section of the memoir is occupied with the descrip
tion of the development, forms, structure and changes of the dental
system of Mastodontoid animals; and each tooth and tusk of the
three principal genera are described and compared, and the principal
modifications they exhibit according to difference of age, sex, and
species. After pointing out the necessity of including the entire se
ries of successive teeth, in the dental formulae of genera, where the
teeth are constantly displacing and succeeding each other through
the whole of life, the author announces the dental formulae of the
four Proboscidian genera of Pachyderma to be

                 Dr. Grant     on Mastodontoid Animals.               465
     For  the determination  of the dental formulae  of Mastodon and  Te
 tracaulodon, Dr. Grant relied entirely on the splendid collection of
jaws, crania, and teeth in Mr. Koch's possession, which afford ample
 means for the solution of that problem.        For the dental formula of
 Deinotherium     he has been indebted solely to the casts and fragments
of that genus in     the British Museum.      After explaining the uncer
tainties    and fallacies to which naturalists have been exposed in the
identification of species, from not having ascertained the entire dental
series in any Mastodon, the sixth section of the memoir describes the
distinctive characters and the distribution of the Mastodon angusti
dens, M. latidens, M. Elephantoides, M. minutum, M. Tapiroides, M.
Andium, M. Borsoni, M. Humboldtii, M. Turicense, M. Avernense,
 M. giganteum, M. Cuvieri, and M. Jeffersoni. The seventh section
of the memoir is devoted to the examination and description of the
 generic characters of Tetracaulodon, as established by Dr. Godman,
 and as founded on the number and form of the teeth, the peculiarities
of their microscopic structure, the form of the jaws, the tusks, the
alveoli of the tusks, the intermaxillary fossa, the infra-orbitary fora
 mina, and other influential characters. The eighth and last section
of this paper is occupied with an account of the distinctive characters
and the distribution of the known species of this genus ; viz. Tetra
caulodon Godmani, T. Collinsii, T. Tapiroides, T. Kochii, T. Haysii,
 and T. Bucklandi.
     June 29, 1842.-Seven communications were read.
     1. “Notices connected with the Geology of the Island of Rhodes."
 By Mr. T. A. B. Spratt, Assistant-Surveyor of H.M.S. Beacon. Com
 municated by C. Stokes, Esq., F.G.S.
     The observations detailed in this paper were made during the sum
 mer of 1840. The geological structure of the Island of Rhodes, Mr.
 Spratt states, is simple, and the distribution of the deposits easily
 defined. The formations consist of mica schist, shales, limestones,
 trachyte with basaltic rocks, large beds of shingle, both anterior and
 posterior in origin to the volcanic aera ; and very extensive tertiary
 deposits.
     The mica schists occur in the central districts near Alleyermah and
 Sclipio, but do not form ridges of very great altitude.
     The limestones are scattered in detached masses and rest appa
 rently on argillaceous shales of a black, light cream or reddish colour,
 but the positive order of superposition the author had no opportunity
 of determining.      He failed also in detecting in them any organic re
 mains, but he is of opinion that they are of contemporaneous origin
 with the strata near Smyrna, assigned by Mr. Strickland to the Hip
 purite limestone. The shales are well developed in several places
 around the base of Mount Ottayaro, but more particularly in the
 valley west of the village of Embono.
     Both the schists and the limestones exhibit, Mr. Spratt states,
 proofs of great dislocations, and he is inclined to ascribe these effects
  to the outburst of the volcanic rocks which constitute so large a por
  tion of the central and southern districts of the island. He mentions
  as instances of these disturbed beds a thin stratum of limestone which

    The loftiest summits in the island are composed of limestone.
Mount Attayaro (anc. Atabyrius), the highest, exceeds 4000 feet in
altitude, and at least three-fourths of it are composed of horizontal
beds of limestone.        The other principal calcareous mountains are

     Near Melona and Archangilo fossils may be procured in abun
 dance, but the species are grouped; and about a mile north of the
 latter place the author found on the end of a low ridge which pro
jected into the plain, a thin stratum of calcareous sand containing
 numerous fossii leaves, also marine shells and an ichthyolite.       The
 leaves resembled those of the olive, oleander, and plane tree, now
growing on the island.
    In the neighbourhood of Koskinou and Rhodes fossils are also very
 abundant, especially in the upper deposits.         Mr. Spratt gives the
following list of the strata exhibited in a hill near the town of Rhodes,
 and he says that it affords a type of the whole of the adjacent depo
sits, with the exception of the distribution of the fossils, which are
sometimes wanting, sometimes plentiful, in the same bed.
    Top.–Calcareous conglomerate, containing Turbo rugosa in great
abundance.
   Laminated marls in which fossils are sometimes numerous, but at
this locality they are wanting.
    Coarse sand, inclosing species of Pecten, Turbo, Echini, and corals
in great confusion and seldom perfect.
    Fine sand from which the author procured only a species of
Venus.
    Marls without fossils, at this point sometimes indurated.
    Greenish sand.
    Fine brownish sand with numerous fossils.
    Total thickness about 300 feet.
    In the deposits along the north shore Mr. Spratt procured no fos
sils, though he very closely examined Mount Paradiso and Philielmo.
The strata in these hills and in that overhanging Tholo and Soronee
dip at a considerable angle to the north ; and exhibit the greatest
visible thickness of the tertiary deposits, Paradiso, the highest, having
an altitude of 920 feet; but in the basin of Archangilo they attain
nearly the same vertical dimensions.
    The tertiary strata are apparently continuous along the north coast,
so that no defined margin between the supposed western lacustrine
deposits and those of decidedly marine origin is indicated by an inter
vening ridge or formation of a different character.        The long ridge
of Skathee is considered however by the author a natural boundary
between the basin of Palatshah and the eastern deposits, but he was
unable to determine if the strata around Katavyah with which it is
believed to be connected, contain marine or freshwater shells.
    There are also in several parts of the island elevated shingle beds
of considerable thickness; some of them, composed entirely of rounded
limestone pebbles, occurring on the sides of the calcareous moun
tains; while others consist of limestone and volcanic materials, and
others again wholly of volcanic fragments. These accumulations, Mr.
Spratt says, are evidently of two epochs, one anterior to the great
volcanic aera, and the other intermediate between it and the tertiary
series, the sands and marls of that group being in several places
around them.

468        Geological Society:          Mr.       Nasmyth on the Structure
  2.   “On       the minute Structure of the Tusks of extinct                      Mastodon
toid Animals.”     By Alexander Nasmyth, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, at the commencement of his memoir, acknowledges
his obligations to Dr. Grant for having first called his attention to the
minute anatomical structure of the tusks of Mastodontoid animals;
and for having placed at his disposal a copy of the Swedish edition
of Retzius's demonstration of the typical structure of the dental                            or
gans of animals.
    Availing himself of the able tuition afforded by the Swedish Pro
fessor, Mr. Nasmyth says, he has prosecuted the subject, and that
 these inquiries, besides explaining to him the structure of that portion
 not completely investigated by Retzius, have unfolded to him some
 observations which are now generally acknowledged to be truths in
 the valuable but intricate department of animal development.          He
 further says, that he has been led to results differing somewhat from
 those of Retzius, so far as the physiology of the cellular tissues is
 concerned; yet the general appearances exhibited and the manner
 of displaying them will remain, he adds, lasting memorials of the ta
 lents and ingenuity of the Swedish Professor.
    The specimens to which Mr. Nasmyth's attention has been directed
 form part of the collection of Mr. Koch, and they were delivered to
 him as belonging to Mastodon giganteum, Tetracaulodon Godmani,
 T. Kochii, T. Tapiroides, and the Missourium. In the analysis of each
specimen he considers—
    1st. The constituent structures of the tusk.
   2nd. The comparative extent of each of the constituent structures,
as far as  it can be ascertained.
   3rd. Each constituent structure regarded separately in                  minute      its

mals. The term fibres is used, moreover, to define those appearances
which Retzius considers due to a tubular structure, because the au
thor has been unable to find anything which confirms this theoretical
appellation founded on the existence of a series of continuous rami
fying tubes. This question therefore he leaves in abeyance.
   Mastodon giganteum.—The constituent structures of the upper
tusks are only two, crusta petrosa and ivory. The crusta petrosa, in
the specimens examined, is comparatively thin, or about half a line;
but the extent of the investigation being necessarily limited, the au
thor considers that the observations on this head are incomplete.
   The corpuscules of the crusta petrosa are scattered irregularly ; but
they are numerous and give                              off
                                          radiating branched fibres, tending
generally either from the surface              the surface

470     Geological Society:                 Mr.      Nasmyth on the Structure
organization of the individual tissues is the same at both periods,
though certain modifications of instruments are exacted at successive
stages of existence.         Thus, in early youth, when the frame is not
powerful, every efficiency is given to the cutting edges of the dental
apparatus; and the author states a fact he believes never before re
marked, though long noticed by himself, that the tusks of the young
Elephant and Walrus are tipped with a very thin layer of enamel.
    The head of the Tetracaulodon Godmani examined by Mr. Nas
 myth is shown to have been that of an animal in which two of the
 adolescent teeth are well developed. The crusta petrosa of the tusk
 was about half a line thick, and extended over the whole of the visible
 surface. The corpuscules were irregularly disposed, but closely ag
 gregated, and exhibited in the transverse section an irregularly circu
 lar shape with occasionally angular points. The radiating fibres were
 numerous, ranging in                all
                                 directions; and the independent transverse
 fibres were also numerous, traversing with curved course the whole  a
 substance.      The cells         the interspaces were visible. The enamel
                                     of
 on   the upper tusk was        line thick. The parallel rows

 throughout the internal half they were curved diagonally.                       There
 was   no  clear space between the enamel and ivory, but the line                                               of
 junction was well defined.             plumose layer

and they are of an irregularly twisted oval form. The cells of the
interspaces are likewise visible.
   The ivory of the upper tusks consists of very slightly undulating,
undivided fibres, with the cells of the interfibrous substance well
marked, but semi-transparent.       The fibres of the under tusk slightly
undulate, and present occasionally an appearance of thorny projec
tions.   The compartments of the fibres are easily seen, and are irre
gular in size, but rounded.
    Tetracaulodon Tapiroides.—The tusks consist also of only crusta
petrosa and ivory, and the resemblance in the microscopic structure
of this species with that of T. Kochii is great. The thickness of the
crusta petrosa is considerable. The very irregularly-shaped corpus
cules, placed at intervals of two or three corpuscular diameters, are
semi-transparent, and without radiating fibres in the external half;
but those situated in the internal half are of the usual opacity, and
give off numerous radiating fibres. Transverse, irregularly beaded,
independent fibres traverse the substance, making one distinct curve
in their passage across        The cells

   This corresponds well enough with the observations to be used in
 computing the parallax and aberration, and in reducing to a com
 mon date the places observed during the same half hour. These ele
 ments have some resemblance to those of the comet of 1689 as com
puted by Pingré.    The inclination, however, of the latter, 69° 17',
differs too much to be consistent with their identity. Professor Ben
jamin Pierce, of Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., has recom
puted the observations used by Pingré, and finds for the elements of
 the comet of 1689,

it immediately becomes olive-green, and hence it may be concluded
 that pechblende is not identical with the olive-green oxide.
    The pechblende from Joachimstal in Bohemia, when treated with
 hydrochloric acid, yields at first carbonic acid gas, afterwards hydro
 sulphuric acid, and eventually dissolves almost entirely, leaving only
 a little gelatinous silica, entirely soluble in potash. The filtered so
 lution was found to contain lead, iron, manganese, lime, magnesia,
 and a small quantity of soda. When pechblende is heated in a cur
 rent of dry chlorine it yields only chloride of sulphur.        Pechblende
 acted on by chlorine is partly soluble in water, and leaves a yellow
 residue of urinate of lime and magnesia; the solution contains neither
 antimony, bismuth, arsenic, copper, or zinc.
    To analyse pechblende it was treated with nitric acid; the silica
 was separated by evaporating the solution to dryness; the residue
 was treated with hydrochloric acid and filtered.         The lead was se
 parated by hydrosulphuric acid, converted into sulphate and esti
 mated; to the solution after the separation of the lead hydrosulphate
 of ammonia was added, which precipitated the uranium, iron and
 manganese; the method by which these three metals were separated
 will be presently stated. The solution from which they were pre
 cipitated was boiled, then treated with oxalate of ammonia, the
 oxalate of lime converted into sulphate and estimated. The filtered
 solution was evaporated to dryness, and the residue heated to redness
 to expel the ammoniacal salts, sulphuric acid was then added, and the
 sulphates of magnesia and soda were obtained; the alkali was sepa
 rated from the magnesia by means of acetate of barytes.
    The sulphur was determined by a separate experiment, and                                                its
quantity was exactly proportional          that     the lead; the carbonic
                                                              to            of
acid was expelled                    by
                         nitric acid, and      quantity determined by that

      ON THE COMPOSITION OF WOLFRAM. BY M. EBELMAN.
   Until lately wolfram has been considered as a compound of tung
stic acid with the protoxides of iron and manganese; but recently,
                                                                               ii.
M. Schaffgotsch (Ann. de Ch. et de Phys.        532) has stated that            p.                                       it
contains the oxide     tungsten and not the acid. He has deduced this
                            of
from the results     his analyses, which
                          of                 gave    excess    five        all                an              of         or

M. Wöhler arrived at the same conclusion from the action of chlorine
on wolfram.

LIX.        On    Dr. Hare’s “Additional Objections” relating to
               Whirlwind Storms.   By W. C. REDFIELD".
     N    my   reply to Dr. Hare's first series of “Objections” and
    “Strictures,” I attempted to show that these could have
no weight  or efficacy in disproving the whirlwind character
of  violent storms and tornadoes; and, furthermore, that con
vincing evidence of whirlwind action in the tornado of New
Brunswick was found in those very facts which he had set
forth and relied on for disproving        rotation             its                  f.
   Besides   correcting,     that          on
                                   occasion,  certain grave errors
into which   my  opponent   had  fallen,   also referred   the ad
                                                                I                                  to
ditional proofs            of
                     rotation which are found         my published                  in
survey         of
            the effects              of
                         this tornadof.   This was deemed suf
ficiently conclusive    replying     Dr.
                                     in  Hare,            to
                                                 who had chosen
to  “enter the lists”    my assailant and
                                      as      support     his own      in                         of
and Mr. Espy's notion                          of
                             the centripetal course     the wind                              of
in  these storms; for the effects produced      the New Bruns               by
wick tornado had been greatly relied               each      these         on       by              of
writers,     proving such centripetal course
                as                               the wind      tor              in                       of
madoes.
     At    that time       I     possessed,              in   my field-notes             and surveys,
abundant evidence of       constant rotative action
                                          a            several                                     in
other tornadoes, and plans     diagrams which exhibit portions

482            Mr. Redfield's Reply to Dr. Hare's
 taining what    I deem decisive evidence of the whirling cha
 racter of the Providence tornado, published since the first ap
 pearance, in America, of his “Additional Objections,” and
 found in this Journal for January 1843, p. 38–52.
    It has probably been perceived, that in advancing his      “ad
 ditional objections,” which are found in this Journal for
 August last, Dr. Hare seems virtually to abandon the main
 question of rotation as an issue of fact, as rested on his pre
 vious allegations relating to the New Brunswick and Provi
 dence tornadoes: for he appears now to rely chiefly on a
petite guerre of criticisms, which have little, if any, relation to
 definite observations; the only evidence on which the ques
 tion really depends.
    I might justly complain of that apparent want of candour
which has prevented Dr. Hare from correcting, in any man
ner, the several mistakes and errors, whether of fact, quota
tion, or induction, which were pointed out, long since, in my
reply to his first series of “objections” and “strictures.”       It
is this want of candour in the discussion that seems to demand
these defensive notices and remarks, which perhaps are more
necessary from the fact that few persons, probably, engage in
a careful and strict analysis and comparison of the observa
tions which have been made in storms.
    Dr. Hare now says he had “endeavoured to point out va
rious errors and inconsistencies in the theory P storms pro
posed by me, or in the reasoning and assumed scientific prin
ciples on which that theory had been advanced.”          But it has
never been my purpose to “propose” or “advance” a
“theory of storms” founded on “reasoning and assumed sci
entific principles.”      This has, indeed, been attempted by
others; with what success is best known to attentive inquirers:
whereas I have mainly endeavoured to exhibit a matter-of
fact view of the actual phaenomena of storms, so far as relates
to their progress, the violent rotative winds which they exhibit,
and the effect of these winds on the barometer.
    Referring to a supposed approval of my views by men of
science, Dr. H. says [$ 58],     “It  strikes me, however, that a
fault now prevails which is the opposite of that which Bacon
has been applauded for correcting.         Instead of the extreme
of  entertaining   plausible theories having   no adequate founda
tion in observation or    experience,  some men of science of the
present time are prone to lend a favourable ear to any hypo
thesis, however absurd in itself, provided it be associated with
observations.” As already stated, it is “observations” and
their results which I have chiefly endeavoured to promulgate.
But if it has been attempted to associate a favoured “hypo

      “Additional               Objections” relating to Whirlwind Storms.                                483
thesis,” whether “absurd ” or otherwise, with observations on
storms, I apprehend it has been by my opponents, notwith
standing that the seeming dislike to observations may appear
unfavourable to this conclusion.
      In
       the same paragraph are alleged no less than three quota
tions in forms of words and connexion such as I did not use;
and at least three following paragraphs of the “additional
objections” appear devoted to the unamiable attempt to render
me obnoxious to distinguished men, which perhaps may ren
der proper the following statement and explanation.
      I
      had incidentally remarked, on the occasion of Mr. Espy's
first attempt to discredit certain facts and results which I had
stated *, that “the grand error into which the whole school of
meteorologists appear to have fallen, consists in ascribing to
heat and rarefaction the origin and support of the great atmo
spheric currents which are found to prevail over a great por
tion of the globe.” And, in allusion to the views found in
Sir John F. W. Herschel's treatise on Astronomy, I also
said, “Sir John, however, has erred, like his predecessors, in
ascribing mainly, if not primarily, to heat and rarefaction
those results which should have been ascribed solely to me
chanical gravitation, as connected with the rotative and orbi
tual motion of the earth's surface, the influence of which he
but partially recognizes in connection with this and another
subject of inquiry.” By the ill-chosen phrase “whole school,”
was simply meant,                    all
                         meteorologists    whose writings     had   to                          I
obtained access.       was          It         by
                                inadvertent form      expression,                    of

not particularly noticed      me till after publication, and has
probably given more pain         myself than    any one else.

   Paragraphs 66 to 70 Dr. Hare has devoted to some super

were virtually withdrawn more than three years since”.    He
has also joined [š 68] a passage from that paper with another
from a subsequent one, and quotes both as from the latter.
 The “unresisted rotation * here refers to the seeming non-re
sistance of the air to a body turning on        own axis; and the            its

                                 settle the main      question    between me
 and my opponents.
     Dr. Hare infers that “in                                no

 surers;” and then says, that “experience shows that every
 north-easter brings                         vessels having only
                                                              of          com

 But do the alleged “crowd                               of

  found “about ten or twelve points of the compass MoRE To
  THE LEFT [on the compass card], than on the coast of the
  United States in the latitude of New York.”
     In the next place, Dr. H. endeavours to show ($ 92–94]
 that I seem to suppose whirlwinds as capable of being “self
 induced.”      In justice to his readers, however, he should have
 quoted the entire paragraph from which he has cited my re
 mark, “that whirlwinds and spouts appear to commence gra
 dually and to acquire their full activity without the aid of any
 foreign causes" (Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiii. p. 61).       But
 can Dr. Hare prove to us “the aid of any foreign causes **
 It is proper to note here, that by the above remark I did not
 intend to exclude the influence of atmospheric pressure and
 elasticity, nor variations of temperature and density in and
about the body in which gyration is induced.            Neither do                I
disconnect or “isolate” the       spirally ascending  central motion
from the great body of the tornado or whirlwinds as he at
tempts to do for me.
    Dr. Hare finally declares [595],              “I
                                               do not deem it expe
dient to enter    upon   any discussion as to the competency of the
evidence by which the gyration of storms has been considered
as proved.”       The friends of science may well be surprised at
this.     For, if Dr. H. did not intend to discuss the “evidence”
of gyration, for what useful purpose did he “enter the lists?”
or why did he attempt to show facts in disproof? Was it
more important to array a series of criticisms and speculations
than to bring the question to the test of strict observation and
induction? And will not this evasion be received as proof of
the weakness of his cause?         He says that the competency of
the evidence has by Mr. Espy been “ably contested.”             But
has it been so “contested ”       by  that writer, as to be decided
adversely in the mind of any strict and careful inquirer, or
with such scrutiny and arrangement of the facts alleged as
would allow them to speak in their own true language"?
Even if Dr. H. should admit gyration to be “sufficiently
proved,” and “should consider it as an effect of a conflux to
suPPLY an upward current at the axis,” would not this imply
a self-elevating power in this “upward current?” And would
not the admission of gyration decide the question in my favour?
    But he adds further: “Yet the survey of the New Bruns
wick tornado, made on terra firma with the aid of a compass,
by an observer so skilful and unbiassed as Professor Bache,
ought to outweigh maritime observations, made in many cases
under circumstances of difficulty and danger.”           Now     me         let

prostration, and the general character of the prostrating force
which these may conjointly indicate.      The course of induc
tion suggested in my two papers on the tornadoes of Provi
dence and New Brunswick, as taken together, are believed to
afford sufficient grounds for a correct determination, when
applied to the traces of other tornadoes.      It is also satisfac
tory to find, that in the surveys exhibited in the above cases
there are several traces of individual objects moving in the
tornado, which fully confirm the accuracy of the more general
induction.
   As regards Dr. Hare's own views of the electrical origin of
storms, some notice has been taken of these in Silliman's
Journal for October 1842, p. 261-263. Since the discoveries
of Franklin, an electrical origin and character has often been
conjecturally ascribed to storms.     A want of originality in
advancing this hypothesis will not weaken any evidence          Wii.
shall be adduced in its favour; but until it shall have been
satisfactorily supported by observed phaenomena, it will pro
bably continue to be rejected by scientific inquirers. And were
it possible to show an electrical origin in great storms and
tornadoes, it would in no wise alter the known fact that a de
terminate rotative action has been noticed in these storms.
LX.     Notice    of some
                     Experiments on Subterranean Electri
  city made in Pennance Mine, near Falmouth.   By R. W.
  Fox, Esq.”
I HAVE       already communicated to the Geological Society of
     London't some results produced by the electric action of
two nearly east and west metalliferous veins which have been
partially explored in Pennance mine. I have since made other
experiments in the same mine, in which ore-points, consisting
of copper and iron pyrites in the two veins, were connected by
a pair of copper wires, which in most instances acted on a
galvanometer or other apparatus at the surface, an end of each
wire having been brought up through a shaft for the purpose;
about 50 fathoms of wire were employed, although the ore
points in the different veins were only about 14 to 18 fathoms
asunder in a direct line.
   A galvanometer of not much sensibility was generally used;
the needle, which was 2% inches long, moved on a pivot, and
had a coil of fine wire passed 48 times round            it.
                                                       Another
galvanometer, consisting      suspended astatic needle and 140
                             of  a
coils of wire, was also employed occasionally.

   When the former, which call No. 1, was placed in the                                    cir
cuit, the needle was deflected so as to become stationary
at 14° to 15° from zero; and it revolved rapidly round the
circle when the circuit was broken and restored a few times, the
direction of the electricity being from the south vein to the
northern one.        The other galvanometer (No. 2) suffered a
permanent deflection of about 40° when in the circuit. The
interposition of a plate of platinum or zinc at either of the ore
points, or of a point, instead of a considerable surface of me
tal, did not affect the direction or force of the currents; they
were, moreover, constant in both these respects during more
than eight months that the two veins were connected by the
wires, and a part of this time the mine was filled with water
in consequence of an accident to the machinery. Ore-points
in the two veins situated within two or three feet of the others
respectively, were at one time connected by a second pair of
copper wires of the same lengths as the first; both sets of par
allel wires being kept apart, and insulated from the sides of the
levels or galleries by poles stretched across the latter at short
intervals.
   When galvanometer No. 2 was placed in the second                                        cir
cuit, No. 1 remaining in the other, the needle of the latter re
ceded at least 2", standing at 12°, instead of 14° or 15°; and
the former stood at 5° or 6° less than it did when only one
circuit was established. On breaking either of the circuits,
the deflection of the needle in the other circuit was increased
to     original amount; and when both pairs
     its                                              wires were conof
nected with only one                of
                            the instruments, the effect was almost
precisely the same        that produced
                                  as                     by

circuit acting in an opposite direction to the electricity from
the mine, the deflection showed a difference in favour of the
latter, and indeed this was the case when the interposed cloth
was moistened by a very weak solution of common salt.
    The electro-magnetic and decomposing effects of these sub
terranean currents also afforded unequivocal evidence of their
energy.      A helix of copper wire fixed round a small horse
shoe-shaped bar of iron, was placed in the circuit formed by
the wires from the veins, when the bar became so magnetized
as to cause a compass needle 1% inch long, at the distance of
nearly half an inch, to oscillate through an arc of about 70°,
 when the circuit was alternately made and broken a few times.
     A solution of hydriodide of potash was found to have been
 decomposed after it had been left in the circuit for rather more
 than a day.
     The endosmose action occurred in various experiments, but
 it may be sufficient to give one example. Sulphate of copper
 in solution was put into both branches of a U-shaped glass
 tube with clay in the bent part of                      it,

     In   some instances the cylinders    of copper pyrites were                       al
lowed to remain in solutions of       sulphate   of copper in the bent
tube for several weeks, when deposits of oxide of iron were
found coating the inside of the tube about the negative pole.
These results remind one of the ochrey appearance observed
in rocks inclosing much vitreous copper, a fact noticed by my
friend Joseph Carne; and it may be worth while to inquire
how far the proportion of “gossan” in copper veins may be
connected with the quantity of vitreous ore contained in them.
    Since the foregoing experiments were made, I have obtained
an electro-type copper plate 1 inch long, 13 wide and sº of
an inch thick, by the agency of these subterranean currents.
The apparatus consisted of a porous earthenware vessel, rest
ing on wooden legs in a larger one; both were partly filled
with solutions of sulphate of copper, an engraved copper plate
attached to the negative wire being placed in the outer vessel,
and another plate of copper attached to the positive wire in
the inner one. After a few days it was observed that crystals
of copper had been formed on the negative plate, but it was
nearly two months before the apparatus was removed from the
circuit, when the deposited metal was detached from the plate,
having received              its

                                                                     it,
by   an assistant against the walls      one   ofthe veinsof    the sides  or
of “cross-cut” between them. Under these circumstances
     a
the astatic needle was several times suddenly much deflected,
and the parts           of
                     the rocks from which this increased action

                       made    in Pennance Mine.                           4.95
proceeded having been marked, they were broken away, when
iron pyrites was in every instance found imbedded in them;
and there can be no doubt that the smallest branch of copper
or lead ore might have been detected in like manner.
     On several occasions the ends of the opposite wires were
placed in contact with the rocks near the two veins, when there
still appeared to be a tendency in the currents to pass in the
same direction, but often they could not be detected, or were
too feeble for their direction to be determined with certainty.
 Pieces of copper pyrites attached to the wires and imbedded
in wood, were likewise used instead of the metal for producing
contact with the rocks, and with still less effect; and when the
contact was made with platinum and zinc in succession, the
currents were in opposite directions, and in accordance with
the action of those metals respectively; so that the existence
of independent currents under the circumstances described,
though more than probable, was not clearly proved.                   Electri
city, generated by a pair of zinc and copper plates, was trans
mitted through the rocks between the two veins from north to
south, and also from south to north, in order to detect any                 in
dependent currents traversing the rocks by a differential effect
on the needle.        This method appeared likely to be a very
delicate test of electric action in rocks, but no decided results
were obtained, the currents passing in opposite directions ap
parently with equal facility, at least the few experiments
hitherto made in this way have not led to any satisfactory
conclusions relative to the point in question.                It should be
remarked, however, that the astatic needle employed was                     in
conveniently sensitive, and was often set in motion when the
cause was not very obvious.              With needle No. 1 the case
was widely different, as it could scarcely be moved by any
subterranean currents that were not tolerably energetic, such
as were produced when both the wires were in contact with
ore-points, and then, as has been stated, it often revolved
rapidly.
     It has been long known that electric currents will traverse
a very considerable thickness of rock or strata”; but in what
degree this property may be modified by the nature or tex
ture of the rocks, the saline contents of the subterranean water,
or the proportion of ores included in the circuit, remains to
be ascertained.        If the influence of these different circum

                                            |.     “on the electro-magnetic
properties of metalliferous veins,” published in 1830, in the Phil. Trans
sactions, p. 399.  I have long ago seen a very feeble current act on a sen
sitive galvanometer after it had traversed nearly a quarter of a mile of strata,
and stronger currents would probably be detected in like manner after
having passed many times that distance under the surface.

496                Mr. J.    Denham Smith on the
stances should greatly vary, electric currents generated by
given elements might be rendered available on various occa
sions;–to ascertain, for instance, the connection of saline
splings not very distant from each other, often appearing at
the surface or in mines; or of a metalliferous vein discovered
in one place, with a vein which has been worked for ore in
another.   The conducting power of the circuit at Pennance
mine, already described, was in this way found to equal that
of a tolerably strong solution of common salt, the current in
the latter experiment having to traverse an inch of the solu
tion and short copper wires to complete the circuit. The
conducting power of the rocks or strata in this case, there
fore, appeared to be very great.
   When some sulphate of copper was added to the solution,
the conducting power of the latter exceeded that of the strata.
Glass tubes filled with solution of salts in different known
proportions might be used as tests in experiments on the re
lative conducting power of different strata, and they might be
referred to as standards in describing the results.
LXI.     On the Constitution      of    the Subsalts   of Copper.—No. I.
      On the Subsulphates.        By    J.   DENHAM SM1th, Esq.”
THE   results of several analyses of some of the basic salts
  of copper made at former period not agreeing with the
                             a
constitution ascribed in many instances to these compounds,
again directed my attention to their composition, and further
experience has confirmed this disagreement, showing either
that the analytic results are in one case incorrect, or that the
composition of these salts, prepared at various times by the
same method, is not constant.
   The mode adopted for determining the composition of the
subsulphates of copper, was to dissolve one portion of the salt
in pure hydrochloric acid, and ascertain the quantity of sul
phuric acid by a salt of barytes. To estimate the proportion of
black oxide of copper, the course pursued in the experiments
alluded to, was solution of another portion of the salt, under
examination, in dilute sulphuric acid and precipitation by a
caustic alkali from the boiling solution, carefully washing,           ig
niting, and weighing the precipitate. This mode, however, is
open to the objection of the possible adherence of portions of
the precipitant, or other foreign matter, to the oxide; and as
I subsequently found that this class of salts when exposed to
a lengthened and bright ignition, care being taken not to fuse
the oxide, loses the whole of        sulphuric acid,
                                         its            adopted
                                                              I
                    by   the Chemical    Society; having been read April   4,
 ...Communicated
1843.

                Constitution  of the  Subsalts of Copper.        497
  this latter mode of estimating the oxide, it being one which
  appears to me free from objection : I would remark that the
  residual oxide after this ignition was always examined for
  sulphuric acid, and if any was detected the experiment was
  rejected. The deficiency of weight between that of the salt
  operated on and the sum of the sulphuric acid and oxide of
  copper, was estimated as water.
     This method of estimating the water may be objected to as
 an indirect one, but     I consider it more likely to be correct,
  where a substance possesses so simple a composition as in the
 case of these subsulphates, than any mode would be that
 could be devised of actually obtaining and weighing the
  water; especially as these salts were thoroughly washed until
 no soluble matter could be detected in the washings, and
 dried either in a water-bath or on a porous stone, and expo
 sure to the atmosphere at the temperature of the laboratory,
 50° to 80° Fahr.
     In those instances where the results of my analyses were
 not in accordance with those cited by Berzelius, Graham,
 Kane, Thomson and others, the examination was at times
 repeated, sometimes thrice, and the mean of these analyses
 taken in estimating the composition of the salt. The modes
 of preparation and the constitution of these salts I shall clas
 sify in the order of their composition, and at the same time
 notice discrepancies, when such occur, between my results
 and those of the analysts who have preceded me.
     Trisulphate of Copper.—By boiling an equivalent of oxide
 of zinc and two equivalents of sulphate of copper together,
 the subsulphate noticed by Berthollet, of a bright green co
 lour with a shade of blue, is obtained. The mean of two ana
lyses gave, from 50 grs. of this salt, 33.97 grs. of sulphate
 barytes and 34.3 grs. of oxide of copper. The composition
 deduced from these results would seem to indicate the for
 mula 2SO, 6GuO, 3HO; but I am inclined to consider this
salt as really consisting of SOA 3CuO, 2 HO, a constitution
almost exactly borne out by the second of these analyses,
agreeing more nearly with Brunner's analysis of the subsul
phate obtained in this way, and also with the composition of
some subsulphates prepared in a different manner, but which
indicate the composition SO, 3CuO, 2HO, which will give—

  This salt is also obtained when less than an equivalent of
oxide of copper is boiled with an equivalent of sulphate of
copper.
  In Dr. Kane's tabular view of the sulphates of copper
(Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, &c., vol. xix.),
this salt, the trisulphate of copper, is not noticed; but Ber
zelius has described one, assigning to it 3 equivalents of water.
If such                  have been unable to obtain it; and
              a salt exists                 I
although I admit that such a composition is by no means im
probable, seeing that another subsulphate exists in which the
number of equivalents of water and oxide of copper are equal,
I am inclined to consider that the third equivalent of water
in Berzelius's salt was hygrometric, as in no one instance,
although this salt was prepared at several distinct periods and
in the mode described by Berzelius, did obtain results indi              I
cating an approximation to the constitution SOA CuO, 3HO.
   The composition I have assigned to this salt agreed with
that quoted by Dr. Thomson, as arrived at by Brunner from
the analysis of the subsulphate prepared by Berthollet's pro
cess.
   Tetrasulphate of Copper.—This salt is obtainable in a great
variety of ways. It is precipitated when a cold solution of
sulphate of copper is mixed with an insufficient quantity of

tate falls, and no copper remains in solution; by treating a
cold solution in the same manner; by acting on the ammo
niacal sulphate by a large quantity of water, &c. Numerous
analyses of this salt, prepared by the various processes above
mentioned, have only served to confirm the correctness of
the formula, SOs 4CuO, 4 HO, assigned to it by Professor
Graham and Dr. Kane; it is therefore useless to quote any
of these results.
    Dr. Kane, in the paper before mentioned, states that “this
salt when heated does not lose water until the temperature
rises above 300° Fahr., but then loses all.”     I find, however,
by exposing this salt to a temperature of 400°–470°Fahr.,
that it assumes a grass-green colour accompanied with the
evolution of water.
    When 43-2 grs. of the dingy greenish-blue powder, ob
tained by digesting an equivalent of precipitated oxide of cop
per with an equivalent of sulphate in the cold, were exposed
to the above temperature, it changed to a decided green co
lour and lost 1.63 grs., this is equal to 8.9 grs. of water from
 236, the equivalent number of the tetrasulphate of copper,
 which indicates SO, 4CuO, 3HO as the constitution of this
green subsulphate.
    27.07 grs. of the blue subsulphate became of a grass-green
 colour and lost 1.04 gr. of water, equivalent to 9:07 grs. from
 236 grs., and indicating the formula SO, 4CuO, 3HO as
 the constitution of this green subsulphate, arising from the
 loss of an equivalent of water by the blue subsulphate, SOs
 4CuO, 4 HO. This green salt on analysis gave from 13:43
 grs. 9.4 grs. of black oxide of copper, and 6.05 grs. of sulphate
 barytes from 1 1-62 grs., proving     composition          its

   This composition is the same as that of stearine from mut
ton tallow, according to the authority of Lecanu.      I insert
here an   analysis of stearine,  made  by  Liebig and Pelouze,
and the result of their calculation, in order to compare them
with the analysis made by myself.
                  Liebig and Pelouze.                                    Calculated.

   The solubility of the substance is also the same as that of
stearine, and the difference of the temperatures at which the
two bodies melt is very small.    The melting point of stearine
is 62°, that of the body  under examination 59°, while that of
tallow is not more than 37°C.
   A portion of the body was saponified by soda. The soap
was solid and hard, and when dissolved in hot water it formed
on cooling a gelatinous mass, even when the quantity of soap
was very small. It was decomposed by hydrochloric acid, and
the fat acid obtained in this manner was also hard and brittle;
 itsmelting point was 60°C.
  On burning the acid with oxide        copper, the following of
result was obtained:—
  0.3215 gr.      the substance gave 0-3715 gr.
                    of                              water and                        of
0-886 gr.    of
             carbonic acid.
   This composition,  calculated   the 100 parts and compared
                                                        to
with the analysis and the calculation     stearic acid made        of                               by
Berzelius, gives the following results:—

proposed by Dr. Wollaston of ten inches, and the indicator c,
as a consequence, has only the half of this length, that is to
say five inches. The bottom bar d is about two feet in length,
and has a dove-tailed groove or furrow ploughed in it through
out its whole length; in this groove a piece e is made to slide
easily, which may be clamped or made fast by means of a
thumb-screw in any part that may be required. To this sliding
piece is attached a hinge, and to this hinge is also attached
one of the sliding bars I, the other sliding bar 2 being hinged
to the bar b. These sliding bars are capable of being fixed
at any required length, by means of a clamping-screw.       The
bar b is hinged to an immoveable block for about two inches

     In an escarpment in the banks of the adjoining river are two beds
of limestone,           the upper of which Mr. Brodie obtained small ely
tra, and from the lower Cypris, and from both carbonized wood, also
a species of Cyclas.       Under these strata is a very oolitic limestone,
in which the author found a small Melanopsis and a seed-vessel.
     A mile distant Mr. Brodie procured from a bed of limestone, about
five inches thick, Cyclades, Isopods, and a small fish of the species
which occurs at Dallards; and in a bed of clay, bones of a tortoise.
The hard crystalline limestone of the Lady-down beds are noticed
as yielding, but rarely, Cyclades and Cyprides. In the neighbourhood
of Tisbury, in a soft, gritty, slightly oolitic stone, the author found
Isopods of a larger size than elsewhere, likewise an elytron of a cole
 opterous insect. Though the number of beds of limestone vary in
different parts of the Vale of Wardour, yet Isopods and insects cha
racterise the whole of them; and as respects lithological characters,
notwithstanding the great varieties which occur at different localities,
there is throughout the district that general peculiarity of aspect which
is so remarkable in freshwater formations of very different ages, and
which serves to identify detached quarries with each other.
     Vale of Aylesbury.—In Buckinghamshire the Wealden beds possess
a certain similarity with those in Wiltshire, but with clearly marked
local differences. At Quainton Hill Mr. Brodie could not discover
any traces of fishes, insects, or Isopods. In a quarry near the village
of Stone he obtained the following section
     1. Rubble, several feet.

    4. Black clay, containing bones of a Tortoise                     ....        I foot.
     5. White and blue limestone (Pendle), yielding Modiolae in abun
dance; also a few Cypris and Cyclas; likewise bones and palates
 of fishes, coprolites, and, but rarely, remains of insects; fragments
 of carbonized wood are common; and Mr. Brodie obtained a speci
 men of Sphenopteris Mantelli, and another minute but beautiful species
 of Fern. This limestone bears a close resemblance to one of the
 beds at Dallards.
     In his general observations on the fossils from these different local
 ities, the author states, that though he has greatly added to the num
ber and variety of insect-remains since his former communication, yet

514          Geological Society:               Mr. Lyell             on the Fossil
he has not found any of the larger kinds, almost every specimen re
quiring a high magnifying power to be seen distinctly. Next to the
Coleoptera, the most prevalent orders are the Homoptera and                                               Tri
choptera; and Mr. Brodie observes, that this fact accords with the
habits of the two latter orders, the first living on plants, remains
of which are found abundantly in the Wealden, and the second
hovering over the surface of streams.            From the fragmentary state
of these   remains,  and from the     wings   never being expanded in the
more nearly perfect specimens, he considers it probable, that they
were carried for some distance down the streams which flowed into
the Wealden estuaries.        A few of the insects which have been exa
mined   by  an eminent    entomologist,   have been pronounced to possess,
with one    exception,   a decidedly   European     character, to differ from
those at  Aix,  and to be less   tropical  than those found at Stonesfield.
   Since the reading of his prior communication, Mr. Brodie has ob
tained Isopods an inch and a half in length and an inch broad. These
crustaceans, so interesting from the analogy to Trilobites, presented
by allied genera, are rarely found in single specimens, but in groups,
and therefore present this additional agreement with the habits of re
cent species. The fossils appear to have been deposited tranquilly
at the bottom of the water which they inhabited, being always found
imbedded with their legs downwards, and they are generally well-pre
served. The whole of the freshwater remains of these Wealden beds,
including the testacea, afford the natural characters of such deposits
by yielding abundance of specimens, but few genera.
   Associated with the above-mentioned organic remains of the Vale
of Wardour, Mr. Brodie has obtained three species of small fishes
quite distinct, he says, from those found at Lady Down and Chicks
grove. With a single exception they were             procured       all

     All   these fossils were discovered byMr. Kaye and a friend within
the last two  years, and are  entirely new to European palaeontologists.
    In the neighbourhood    of Pondicherry   and bordering on the lime
stone is a bed of red sand   containing  an immense quantity of the sili
cified wood long known to collectors.
    Trichinopoly.—The spot in this district from which Mr. Kaye pro
cured his specimens he was not able to visit. The fossils occur also
in a limestone, preserve their shelly matter with occasionally the
colour, and belong principally to marine genera, but some are con
sidered to be of freshwater origin. Cephalopods appear to be of very
rare occurrence, Mr. Kaye having obtained from the locality only
one fragment of a large Ammonite.          Wood bored by Teredines is
also found in the limestone.
    Verdachellum.—From a calcareous rock near Verdachellum, forty
miles from Pondicherry, Mr. Kaye procured a variety of marine shells,
including a considerable number of Ammonites, considered by him to
be distinct from those found near Pondicherry; also a few imperfect
Nautili and a few Echinidae, corals, &c.
   Among the testacea are several considered to belong to species
found in the Trichinopoly deposit, and a few believed by Mr. Kaye
to be identifiable with Pondicherry shells. This limestone is likewise
bordered by a red sand which contains specimens of silicified wood.
The formation was discovered only a short time before the writer
quitted India, and he consequently considers his collection as defec
tive; but he regards the deposit whence it was obtained as of interest,
affording, by          its
                   position and organic contents,   link between the                a
other two localities.

the very flags on which Ornithichnites occur; and from this he infers,
that there were eruptions of trap, accompanied by upheaval and par
tial denudation, during the deposition of the red sandstone.
   With respect to the impressions having been made by birds, Mr.
Lyell states, that until he examined the whole of the evidence he
entertained some scepticism, notwithstanding the luminous account
given by Prof. Hitchcock. In proof of their being the foot-prints of
some creature walking on mud or sand, he mentions, 1st, the fact of
Prof. Hitchcock's having seen 2000 impressions, all, like those he had
himself examined, indented in the upper surface of the layer, the
casts in relief being always on the lower surface; and 2ndly, that
where there is a single line of impressions the marks are uniform in
size, and nearly uniform in distance from each other, the toes in the
successive steps turning alternately right and left. Such single lines,
 Mr. Lyell says, indicate that the animal was a biped, and the trifid
marks resemble those which a bird leaves, there being generally a
deviation from a straight line in any three successive prints; and his
attention having been called to indications of joints in the different
toes, he afterwards clearly recognised similar markings in the recent
steps of coots and other birds on the sands of the shores of Massa
chusetts.    Prof. Hitchcock has shown, that the same impression ex
tends through several laminae, decreasing in distinctness in propor
tion as the layer recedes from that in which it is most strongly marked,
or in proportion as the sediment filled up the hollows and restored
the surface to a level; and Mr. Lyell states, that he has observed a
great number of instances of this fact.
   He also says, that he can scarcely doubt that some of the impres
sions on the red sandstone of Connecticut are not referable to birds,
but he believes that the gigantic ones described by Prof. Hitchcock
are Ornithichnites.     At Smith's Ferry they are so numerous that
a bed of shale many yards square is trodden into a most irregular
and jagged surface, so that there is not a trace of a distinct footstep;
but on withdrawing from this area to spots where the same tracts are
fewer, the observer, Mr. Lyell says, is forced to admit that the effect
in each case has been produced by this cause.
   On examining the shores on some small islands about fifteen miles
south-east from Savannah, the author was struck with the number as
well as the clearness of the tracks of raccoons and opossums imprinted
in the mud during the four preceding hours, or after the tide had be
gun to ebb. At one spot, where the raccoons had been attracted by
the oysters, the impressions were as confused as when a flock of
sheep has passed over a muddy road ; and in consequence of a gentle
breeze blowing parallel to the line of cliffs composed of quartzose
sand, the tracks had in many places already become half-filled with
blown sand, and in others were entirely obliterated; so that if the
coast should subside, the consolidation of this sand would afford
casts analogous to those of Storeton Hill in Cheshire, yet the im
pressions had been made and filled in a few hours.
   When considering the broad question whether the fossil foot-prints
were made by creatures walking on mud or sand after the ebbing of

the tide, Mr. Lyell reminds his readers of the fact that in the United
States, as in Saxony and Cheshire, the tracks in sandstone and shale
are accompanied by littoral appearances, as ripple-marks, the casts
of cracks in the clay, and often by the marks of rain.
   In regard to the age of the red sandstone of the valley of the
Connecticut and New Jersey, the author states he has nothing
to add to what had been previously advanced, by which               position                           its
had been shown                      to

   Nov.   16, 1842.-A paper was read “On the Structure of the Delta
of the   Ganges, exhibited by the Boring Operations in Fort William,
A.D. 1836–40.”                By Lieut. R. Baird Smith, B.E.
    Since the year 1804, a number of boring operations have been
conducted in the Gangetic Delta, with a view to supply the deficiency
of good fresh water in the vicinity of Calcutta, but, from mechanical
obstacles, without success. The geological results of the last of
these experiments, commenced in April 1836, and abandoned in 1840,
after being carried on to the depth of 480 feet, are detailed by Lieut.
Smith in this memoir. After penetrating to the depth of ten feet
through the artificial surface soil, a bed of blue clay, close and ad
hesive in        its
                texture, was entered.       As the bore descended, the clay
became darker          colour, till,
                         in             from thirty

tions    ofpeat, with decaying fragments           trees, were found. These

Dr. Wallich identified with the common Soondri the Sunderbunds,                    of

                        of

of forests which           former period covered the entire surface

clusion, that when these were originally deposited bold rocky moun
tains existed in close proximity to the present site of Calcutta; and
taking his data from the results of personal observation on the trans
porting power of rapid currents, he estimates the distance of these
mountains at not greater than twenty or thirty miles.      Resting on
the bed of coarse   conglomerate,   the entire  depth of which is un
known, although it cannot be less than eighty feet, the bore having
pierced it to that extent, there are beds of carbonaceous matter and
lacustrine clay bearing the clearest evidence of having been quietly
deposited on a marshy surface clothed with vegetation.        Ere this
could have taken place, the powerful currents indicated by the gravel
must have been arrested, and as this could only be effected by a great
lowering of the inclination of the bed of the river, we may infer the
check arose from the entire subsidence of the range of hills above
alluded to. The extent to which this took place it is impossible for
us to estimate, but the deposits which the river continued to make
would repose upon the depressed masses, and were boring operations
to be carried on successfully in such localities they would ultimately
expose these again to our observation.     Supposing then, as without
 impropriety we may do, that the rocks of which these hills were
composed stretched away beneath the conglomerate bed formed by
the large gravel borne along by the torrent issuing from them, we
are led to believe that had the Fort William boring operations been
successfully carried through the entire depth of the conglomerate,
the auger would then have impinged on the solid rock, and if so,
would the experiment have terminated favourably *
   “When we remember,” observes Lieut. Smith, “that the con
glomerate was almost entirely composed of debris from primary rocks,
admitting of the inference that the chain of hills itself was formed of
members of this series, there can be but little hesitation in replying
in the negative.”
   “On Pipes or Sandgalls in Chalk.” By Joshua Trimmer, Esq.,
F.G.S.
  In a former paper (Proceedings, vol. iii. p. 185) the author de
scribed two detrital deposits in Norfolk, which appear to have been
produced by powerful currents of water.          The lowest of these is
marked on the surface with numerous furrows and penetrated by
cylindrical and funnel-shaped cavities like those of the chalk, though
in general of smaller dimensions. If these have been caused by the
mechanical action of water, they indicate a pause between the two
deposits of sufficient duration to allow of the consolidation of the
lower bed before the other was thrown down upon                Therefore,
                                                                    it.

   Having had an opportunity of observing the removal of its cover
ing from the chalk near Faversham, Mr. Trimmer found that the
pipes were but the terminations of furrows from six to twenty-four
inches deep in the shallowest parts exposed, but widening and deep
ening as they approached the pipes till they were lost in them.
   The diluvial covering spread over the chalk is a strong loam of a
reddish brown colour, with numerous unabraded flints dispersed

by the mountains of Cambrian slate which occupy the greater por
tion of the island. The arenaceous formation attains in some parts
a height of about 200 feet above the sea, though the undulations of
its surface prove that considerable portions of the deposit have been
removed by denudation.       This district, comprising about fifty square
miles, furnishes perhaps the most extensive example in the British
Isles of a marine newer pliocene or pleistocene deposit. In the Isle
of Man the sea-cliffs on each side of this tertiary district afford a
good insight into its structure and composition.         On the north of
 Ramsey the cliffs average about 100 feet in height, and consist prin
cipally of irregularly stratified yellowish sand, sometimes clayey, with
interspersed bands of gravel and scattered pebbles. The gravel is
 chiefly composed of slate-rock, quartz, old red sandstone, granites,

   Between three and four miles north of Ramsey, the beds of this
deposit occasionally exhibit a very remarkable concretionary struc
ture.   The sand has here been cemented into masses, which are ex
tremely hard, and even sonorous when struck, though the sand in
which they are imbedded is perfectly loose. The cementing ingre
dient, which the application of acid proves to be carbonate of lime,
seems to have been influenced in     operations partly by the planes           its
of stratification, and partly   the direction    which the sand has  by                             in

   Before entering upon his own views, the author quotes the opinions
published by others upon the age of the limestones of Bala and Coni
ston; previous to the labours of Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Mur
chison, these two calcareous bands were thought to be of the same
age, and to be nearly the oldest fossiliferous beds in this country;
but the first definite arrangement of them was made by Professor
Sedgwick, whose views will be found in our Proceedings (vol.                                        ii.   p.
675), placing both these limestones       the Upper Cambrian system,

his work upon the Silurian system, upon the authority          Professor               of
Sedgwick.
   In 1839 Mr. James Marshall classed the Coniston limestone
with the Caradoc sandstone, upon the evidence    fossils examined            of
by Mr.  J.Sowerby, and pointed out that    rested upon the Lower   it
Cambrian rocks; thus omitting the Upper Cambrian system                        the               p. in

everyone admitted that the Bala fossils agreed,                   far    they had as   as
been examined, with those           the Lower Silurian beds, and that there
                                              of
 was no clear line       separation between the Lower Silurian and Up

    Mr. Sharpe points out, that up to the moment of his taking up the
 subject no one of the authors quoted had expressed a doubt of the
 existence of a great thickness of fossiliferous beds below the Caradoc
 sandstone and Llandeilo flags, although it was admitted that these
 supposed beds could not be distinguished by their fossils from the
 Lower Silurian; and he states that the object of his communication
 is to show the error of this view as relates to the Bala rocks,
 which he proposes to prove to be the equivalent of the Lower
 Silurian beds described by Mr. Murchison, and not part of an older
 series; and he infers from analogy that the same will be found to be
 the case in other parts of North Wales which he has not visited, where
 he conjectures that                    all
                             the rocks containing shells             Lower Silurian           of
 species will also prove equivalents                                of
                                                the Lower Silurian beds.                                                In
 stead     continuing the Silurian system downwards through

Sharpe identifies with the No. 2. of Mr. Bowman's lower division of
the Upper Silurians, the probable equivalents of the Wenlock shale.
   Mr. Sharpe then describes the Bala series of rocks, beginning
with the uppermost beds.
    1. Dark blue slate.—Worked at Craig Calettwr for good roofing
slates and flags; in one quarry the beds dip W.N.W 35°, and the
cleavage planes dip W.N.W 65°; in another the beds dip W. 70° and
the cleavage W. 80°. Between Dinas Mowddy and Mallwyd it is
largely quarried for good slate and flags; the beds dip S.E. or E.S.E.
about 30°; the cleavage is perpendicular, and strikes S.S.W. The
lower beds pass into a soft argillaceous slate of no value. The whole
is not less than 300 or 400 feet in thickness.
    2. Upper Bala limestone.—A dark blue bed ten feet thick, accom
 panied by calcareous slates and soft brown shales, with many fossils,
 among which are Orthis canalis and O. compressa, and several new
 species. Mr. Edward Davis, who accompanied the author, discovered
 this bed at Pen-y Dall Gwm, four miles south-east of Bala, dipping
 W.H.S. 70°: it is supposed to follow a line bearing N.N.E., much
broken up by faults *.
    3. Rotten argillaceous schist and indurated shale.—Light grey,
 weathering to brown, with many joints and few fossils; well exposed
 in the valley of the Dwm-lach, above     junction with the Dyfi 400
                                                   its                                                 :

   7. Dark blue slate, of poor quality, covers the eastern flanks of
Arenig and Arran Mowddy, quarried at Blaen-y-cwm, where the
beds dip N.E. 35°, and the cleavage dips E.N.E. 55°; the lowest bed
of the series.
   As the Bala beds are quite unconnected with the Cambrian rocks
of the Berwyns, and are only overlaid by Upper Silurian deposits;
as most of their organic remains are known Lower Silurian species,
and as the total thickness of the whole series is about the same as
has been assigned by Mr. Murchison to the Lower Silurians, Mr.
Sharpe concludes that they are the exact equivalents of the Lower
Silurian formation, and do not carry the series down below the beds
described by Mr. Murchison. Mr. Sharpe considers it as easy to
prove their identity with the Caradoc sandstone as with the Llandeilo
flags, and again endeavours to show that these must be regarded as
the same formation under different names.                This classification re
places the dark blue limestones of Bala and Coniston, on the same
parallel from which they were separated when Professor Sedgwick
adopted Mr. Marshall's view of the Silurian age of the Coniston
limestone, but left the Bala limestone in                erroneous position
                                                                         its                                as

          the   Upper   Cambrians.
    Mr. Sharpe adds comparative tables             the Silurian system
                                                                  of           ex                      as

                                        of        lays before the Society the
conclusion of his remarks on Westmoreland.
    Mr. Sharpe hopes that                    he
                                    has done away with            objection often   an
made      tothe Silurian   system,  that      wanted     definite base, and was

not   distinctly  separated  from the Cambrian      system;    this was not over
looked by Mr. Murchison, who states that the line drawn between
the two systems was provisional.           The difficulty arose from classing
with the Cambrian system many beds belonging both                      the Upper         is to
and the Lower Silurians, and            will vanish when this

In   the absence of direct evidence on the subject, Mr. Sharpe en
deavours to prove that Arenig and Arran Mowddy are at least as
modern as the Ludlow rocks, by showing that the upheaving of
these chains has broken up the parallelism of the cleavage planes
of the slaty rocks resting on them : assuming that these planes had
originally a constant direction in each district, their dislocation at
any spot would show that it had been disturbed subsequently to the
cessation of the cleavage process, and we may thus class igneous
eruptions as prior to, or posterior to, the cleavage; and may then
connect them with the deposition of the formations, by observing
at what epoch the cleavage ceased in the district.    In North Wales
and in Westmoreland, the cleavage only reaches into the Lower
Ludlow formation; in Devonshire and Cornwall it continued later :
therefore Arenig and Arran Mowddy must have been upheaved after
the epoch of the Lower Ludlow shale.
    The memoir concludes with a general list of the species of fossils

    “Notice on the discovery of the Remains of Insects in the Lias of
 Gloucestershire, with some remarks on the Lower Members of this
Formation.” By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, F.G.S.
    The lower beds of the lias, in which these organic remains occur,
are extensively developed in the neighbourhood of Gloucester and
Cheltenham, and occupy the greater part of the vale. In the upper
part of the lower beds, in a hard blue limestone, was found the ely
tron of a coleopterous insect of the family Buprestidae, apparently a
species of Ancylocheira of Escholtz.    This was the only fossil of the
kind met with by Mr. Brodie in this portion of the lias. With this
 exception, the numerous fossil insects he has obtained occur in the
bottom parts of the lower beds near the base of the lias, which are
 seen at several points in the neighbourhood of Gloucester.          At
 Wainlode Cliff, the lower beds of lias, resting on red marl, form a
bold escarpment on the south bank of the Severn, and afford the
 following section in descending order:—

530                 Geological Society:           Mr. Strickland
   The insect remains consist chiefly of elytra belonging to the seve
ral genera of Coleoptera, which are not very rare; and a few wings,
not unlike the genus Tipula, which bear a close resemblance to some
Mr. Brodie had previously found in the Wealden; the latter are
much rarer than the former.        The elytra are generally of a light
brown colour and small size ; in some cases both the elytra are at
tached. With these were found abdomens of some insects and larva
apparently of the gnat tribe.      Shells are not common, but Ostrea,
Unio, and a small species of Modiola are the most abundant.         The
fossils from the yellow limestone, No. 4, bear a close resemblance to
those from the Wealden.       The real genus of the bivalve resembling
Cyclas is undetermined.      The plants belong to a species of Fucus,
apparently an inhabitant of fresh water.     At Combe-hill Mr. Brodie
also observed both the insect limestone and that containing the small
bivalves. To the south-west of this point the insect limestone is well
seen, and yielded the greatest number and variety of insect remains.
Here the yellow limestone was not traced, and the bone-bed was want
ing. The fossil insects are, as at Wainlode Cliff, for the most part re
mains of small Coleoptera, sometimes tolerably preserved, and in one
specimen the eyes were visible.      None of the beetles resemble those
of the Wealden, but some wings of insects, allied to Tipula, are very
similar.   A few imperfect but large wings of Libellula occur: there
are also numerous singular impressions of a doubtful nature, many
of which may however owe their origin to the partially decomposed
bodies of various insects.    With these are numerous small plants,
some resembling mosses, but very different from those in the yellow
Cypris limestone, a few seed-vessels and leaves of fern. A small spe
cies of Modiola, probably M. minima, is exceedingly abundant.      Re
mains of Crustacea occur, one of which resembles the genus Eryon
from the Solenhofen slate.
   Near Gloucester the same strata occur at a much lower level.
At Westbury, eight miles below Gloucester, the following section is
presented :—
   1. Bottom bed with Ostrea, equivalent to that at Wainlode and
     other places: 3 in.

      istic): 4 in.

    on Impressions in the Lias bone-bed in Gloucestershire. 531
carried far out into the water, gives a greater probability to the sup
position that this part of the lias may have been formed in an estuary
which received the streams of some neighbouring lands, perhaps nu
merous scattered islands, and which brought down the remains of
insects, Cypris, and the plants above referred to. The shells usually
found in the insect limestone are Modiola and Ostrea, both of which
frequently inhabit estuaries, and are capable of living in brackish
water as well as in the open sea. The shells, however, so abundant
at Westbury in the same stratum are exclusively of marine origin;
the wing of a dragon-fly from Warwickshire is a solitary instance of
its kind. Mr. Brodie observes, that such stray specimens had pro
bably been carried out to sea, which might also have been the case
with a small wing he discovered in the upper lias at Dumbleton near
Tewkesbury; which also proves the existence of insects during the
deposition of the upper portions of this formation.
   Thus it will be seen that the remains of insects are of very rare
occurrence in the upper beds, and in the higher portions of the
lower ones in the lias, while at the base near its junction with the
red marl they are abundantly distributed.      The discovery of small
elytra of coleopterous insects and portions of the wings of Libellula
in the lower division of the lias near Evesham, by Mr. H. E. Strick
land, shows that these fossils are characteristic of the same beds in
distant parts of the system.
   “On certain impressions on the surface of the Lias bone-bed in
Gloucestershire.”     By H. E. Strickland, M.A., F.G.S.
   The   singular markings   described, which the author in a former
communication     suggested  might be caused by the crawling of crus
tacea, but which further opportunities and observations have induced
him to refer to a different cause, have been noticed only at Wain
lode Cliff on the Severn.     There they occur on the uppermost sur
face of the band of micaceous sandstone which represents the “bone
bed,” and which appears to have consisted of a fine-grained muddy
sand, capable of receiving the most minute impressions, while the
pure black clay which forms the superincumbent stratum has pre
served this ancient surface in the most unaltered condition.       The
ripple-marks produced by currents on the surface of this bed of sand
are very interesting, from their perfect preservation, and from often
exhibiting two sets of undulations oblique to each other, indicating
two successive directions in the currents, such as would result from
a change of tide.
   The impressed markings were evidently produced by living beings,
probably by fish or invertebrate animals. To determine their nature
Mr. Strickland observed the progression of two species of Littorina
among Gasteropodous Mollusca, and of Carcinus Manas among Crus
tacea, but the impressions produced were very different from those
under consideration.
   The fossil impressions are of four kinds:–
    1st. Lengthened and nearly straight grooves, about one-tenth of
an inch in width, and several inches long, very shallow, with a
rounded bottom.      These, Mr. Strickland considers as caused by
                                  2 M  2

532          Geological Society:        Mr. D. Sharpe      on the
some object striking the surface of the sand with considerable impe
tus.    They may often be seen to cut through the ridge of one ripple
mark, and after disappearing in the depressed interval, they are again
seen pursuing their former direction across the next ridge.              They
may have been caused by fish swimming with velocity in a straight
direction, and occasionally touching the bottom with the under part
of their bodies.
    2nd. Small irregular pits averaging one-fourth of an inch wide
and one-eighth of an inch deep.          These might have been caused by
some small animal probing the mud and turning up the surface in
quest of food. Mr. Strickland conjectures that some of the numerous
species of fish found in the bone-bed may have produced them, the
heterocene form of tail common to most of which, Dr. Buckland has
suggested, enabled them to assume an inclined position with the
mouth close to the ground.
    3rd. Narrow deep grooves, about one-twelfth of an inch in width,
the sides forming an angle at the bottom, irregularly curved and
often making abrupt turns, apparently formed by a body pushed
along by a slow and uncertain movement, such as might arise from
the crawling of Mollusks. Mr. Strickland refers them to the loco
motion of Acephalous Mollusca, and supposes that the only shell
found in this bed, a small bivalve named by him Pullastra arenicola,
might have produced them.*.
    4th. A tortuous or meandering track consisting of a slightly raised
ridge about one-tenth of an inch wide, with a fine linear groove on
each side. These tracks are analogous to those formed by the
crawling of small annelidous worms, as may often be seen on the
mud of the sea or fresh water.
    About eleven feet above the stratum which presents the impres
sions above described, a second ossiferous bed occurs at Wainlode
Cliff, which escaped Mr. Strickland's notice in the section formerly
given (Geol. Proc. vol. iii. p. 586).        It is a band of hard, grey,
slightly calcareous stone, about an inch thick, containing a plicated
shell resembling a Cardium, and scales and teeth of Gyrolepis tenui
striatus, Saurichthys apicalis, Hybodus Delabechei, Acrodus minimus,
and Nemacanthus monilifer, all of which occur in the true “bone
bed” below.       On the upper surface of that bed are numerous im
pressions, termed by Mr. Strickland fucoid, consisting of lengthened
wrinkled grooves, variously curved, about three quarters of an inch
wide, one-eighth of an inch deep, and of variable length.                  The
bone-bed seems to be a local deposit, not being met with in the
 other localities examined by the author, and being confined to a
portion only of Wainlode Cliff, where it constitutes No. 9. in the
following corrected section      :-
    * Mr. Strickland describes this species as follows:– “Its form is nearly
 a perfect oval, depressed, nearly smooth, but with faint concentric striations
 towards the margin.    The apex is about halfway between the middle of the
 shell and the anterior end. The general outline closely resembles that of
 the recent Pullastra aurea of Britain. Maximum length 7 lines, breadth
 4} lines, but the ordinary size is less.”

lowest bed of the Silurian system in this districtt, and in all his

of Professor Sedgwick; a bed only found in two localities, at Meer
Beck and a wood behind Low Hall, on the east of the road from
Ireleth to Kirkby Ireleth, where it is a dark-blue limestone very
like that of Coniston, dipping east 40°, of which only about a thick
ness of twelve feet is laid open; and at Turtle-bank Heights, south
west of Blawith, where it has been quarried near the top of the
south-east face of the hill, and is a dark gray limestone, twenty feet
thick, striking north-east and dipping perpendicularly; from this
spot it runs by Cockin's-hill to the side of Coniston Water, half a
mile north of Water Gate. The fossils found by Mr. Marshall in
this bed near Blawith were identified as Lower Silurian species.
    5th. Flagstones and Slates of Kirkby Ireleth.-These are placed
by Professor Sedgwick below the Blawith limestone, No. 4, but
as Mr. Sharpe considers erroneously: nevertheless, although no
fossils have been found in them, he considers them to be the upper
most bed of the Lower Silurian series, because they are always con
formable to the undoubted Lower Silurian beds below them, and are
notequally conformable to the beds above. As this southern edge forms
the boundary line of the Lower Silurian formation, Mr. Sharpe traced
them carefully along their whole course, from their first appearance
rising from under the mountain limestone, on the east of Ireleth, till
they are hidden by the old red sandstone of Birkbeck-beck.           Near
Ireleth it is only used for building-stone, but at Kirkby Ireleth are
quarries extending for a mile and a half along the range of the bed,
supplying dark-blue slates of very good quality.       At Horse Spital
 Quarry the beds dip south-east 80°, and the cleavage dips south-east
55°, both sets of planes striking north-east: this coincidence in the
strike of the bedding and cleavage planes is common in all this
district; yet at Lord Quarry, close to the last-mentioned, the beds
dip N.N.E. 20°, while the cleavage dips S.S.E. 70°. Further east
 the rock is of inferior quality, and is rarely worked for roofing-slate:
its usual course is north-east, passing by Suberthwaite, Blawith,
 Nibthwaite, at the foot of Coniston Water, where much building
stone has been quarried, and the rock is well exposed, being a dark
blue flagstone streaked with gray : between Oxen Park and Satter
thwaite it dips north 50°, and N.N.W. 70°, and is lighter and more
striped than usual; at Force Mill it strikes E.N.E. and dips N.N.W.
 65°, and the cleavage has the same strike but is perpendicular: at
 Satterthwaite the dip is north 45°: between Esthwaite and the
Ferry on Windermere the road runs near the upper edge of the bed,
which is well exposed close to the Ferry House, north of which spot
 it reaches more than a mile up the shore of the lake. On the east
 side of the lake it has been quarried north of Bowness.
    Eastward of Bowness, Mr. Sharpe corrects an error which he
 committed in laying down this line too far south; he now traces it
 nearly E.N.E. by Ing's Chapel, Row Gill, and Hugill Hall, dip
 south-east 60°; Monument Hill on the west side of Kentmere, dip
 S.S.E. 80° to Fellfoot in Kentmere. The flagstone crosses Long
 Sleddale at the Chapel, where it was found not worth working for
 slate: at Bonnisdale-head Farm it gives a slate of fair quality, the

 536           Geological Society:    Mr. D.   Sharpe on the
 beds dip south-east by south 65°, and the cleavage dips in the same
  direction 80°; from here it crosses into High Borrowdale half a mile
  above High House, dipping south-east by south 50°; a fault down
  this valley throws the bed below High House on the east side of the
  valley: in the next Fells it is much concealed by the vegetation,
  but it is seen at a cutting of the road from Shap to Kendal on Hurd's
  Brow, between the ninth and tenth milestone, dipping south-east
   75°, and the cleavage dipping north-west 85°. Near the Borrow
  the beds are thrown into several anticlinal ridges bearing north-east,
  by faults which disturb the cleavage planes as well as the bedding
  of the rock: this slate has also been worked in the upper part of
  Bretherdale.    The boundary thus laid down nearly corresponds with
  that given in the new edition of Mr. Greenough's map.
     The lowest beds of the slate in High Borrowdale are calcareous,
  and may perhaps represent the Blawith limestone, which has not
  been found in conjunction with the slate eastward of Blawith.
     In High Furness, the district of Lancashire consisting of Lower
  Silurian rocks, the principal valleys run from south-west to north
  east, parallel to the strike of the beds, each ridge of hills repre
  senting the outcrop of a particular bed: this is not the case with
  the same formation in Westmoreland, where the valleys of Coniston
  Water, Esthwaite, Windermere, Troutbuk, Kentmere, Long Sled
  dale, Bannisdale, High Borrowdale, and Brethesdale, all follow great
  faults across the strike of the stratification : these faults are con
  tinued through the Windermere rocks, and sometimes into the Lower
 Ludlow rocks, but are lost before entering the Upper Ludlows.
     It is in High Furness that the Lower Silurian formation is best ex
 posed to observation, and has a greater thickness than in Westmore
  land, the beds gradually diminishing in their course eastward.      In
 the same district of Lancashire the slaty character of the rocks is
 more developed than we find it in Westmoreland; it is especially
 between Coniston, Old Mere and Kirkby Ireleth, that the crystal
 lizing agency which has changed the rocks into slate has acted most
 powerfully, many beds in that district supplying good slate, which
 will hardly split up at all elsewhere.
     From the prevailing parallelism long known to exist between the
 planes of slaty cleavage over considerable areas, Mr. Sharpe considers
 it nearly certain that these planes had a uniform direction in each
 district, and that the cases of exceptions which are found are due to
 disturbing forces acting after the cessation of the cleavage action.
 In the district under consideration the mean dip of the cleavage
planes is considered to be S.S.E. 70°, and the cleavage action is
thought to have ceased before the formation of the Upper Ludlow
rocks.
     Windermere Rocks.—The beds formerly classed by the author as
the lowest division of this series are now placed in the Lower Silurian
formation, and the middle and upper divisions are thrown together,
for want of any distinct line of division between them, and some
considerable corrections are made in their geographical boundaries.
They rise, near Ulverston, from below the mountain limestone of

 Silurian Rocks of Westmoreland and North Lancashire.                     537
Low Furness, dipping E.S.E. at high angles, and disappear in West
moreland   beyond Bannisdale, during which course they rest on the
Kirkby Ireleth slate; but their southern boundary  can only be under
stood from the map, as to the west of Windermere they are over
laid by large patches of mountain limestone, and in their range east
ward are gradually covered up unconformably, and concealed by the
Lower Ludlow rocks.      In some places the similarity of the rocks of
the two formations, and the absence of fossils in both, makes it diffi
cult to determine the boundary between them, the best guide being
the dip and strike of the rocks. In Mr. Sharpe's first map a portion
of the Lower Ludlow rocks on the north-east of Kendal was errone
ously coloured as belonging to the Windermere series; the error
was pointed out by Cornelius Nicholson, Esq., of Cowan Head, who
assisted the author materially in mapping the neighbourhood of his
residence.
   The upper boundary of the Windermere rocks begins on the south
west at the lower point of Witherslack, and is marked by a great
fault which crosses the valley between that hill and Whitbarrow,
and appears to pass under the mountain limestone of Whitbarrow,
then runs north-east through Underbarrow, by the Chapel, to Mount
joy:  on the west side of this fault the Windermere rocks form high
ridges of hard slaty grits of dark grey colour, with lighter streaks,
dipping N.N.W., while on the east side of the fault is a gritty rock
of uniform grey colour dipping E.S.E., overlaid with beds containing
the fossils of the Ludlow beds. From Mountjoy the line turns to
the north-west, and passes round Crook Chapel, which stands on a
ridge of the Windermere grits; at Crook Common it turns to the
north-east, and follows that direction to near Borrowdale, where the
formation is lost, being completely hidden by the Ludlow rocks,
which there rest on the Lower Silurians. Crook Common is thrown
into great confusion by the meeting of two lines of elevation, one
coinciding with the E.N.E. strike of the Lower Silurian rocks, the
other coming up from the S.S.W. through Cartmel Fell.
   At Backbarrow, below Newby Bridge, the upper beds of this
series are slaty, with a wavy cleavage dipping N.N.E. 80°, the beds
dipping south-east 80°; these beds contain irregular calcareous
nodules in great abundance, and Orthoceras articulatum was found
in them.
   Mr. Sharpe refers to his former memoir for the description of the
Windermere rocks on the east of the Lune, which extend to Grey
rigg Forest, Whin Fell, and Howgill Fell; in these Fells are several
axes of elevation which require further examination.
   Ludlow rocks.-These were described in the author's former paper;
the area covered by them is larger than was there stated, their lower
boundary being now carried more to the north, and their eastern
portion being extended in a sort of trough between the Lower Silu
rian slates of Shap Fell and the Windermere rocks of Whin Fell,
crossing Barrowdale between High and Low Barrowbridge.
   In the lowest beds of the series in Fawcett Forest were found
Leptaena lata and Turritella conica, in a slaty rock. The Terebratula
navicula is found thinly scattered throughout        all

formation, and occurs in vast numbers in a bed which forms about
the middle of the Ludlow series. Mr. Murchison has told us that
this little shell is usually found in such numbers as to form a bed
which lies above the Aymestry limestone, and it serves to mark the
place of that rock where it is wanting: and Mr. J. E. Davis informed
the author, that at Stapleton, near Presteign, where there is no
Aymestry limestone, this species is found throughout the whole of
the Lower Ludlow shales.       Mr. Sharpe has made use of this shell
in  dividing  the Upper from the Lower Ludlow rocks in Westmore
land, classing all the beds containing it in the lower series. The
bed in which it occurs in greatest abundance was traced through
Underbarrow, by Tullithwaite Hall and High Cray, across the west
end of Rather Heath and a little south of Cowan Head, and also in
Lambrigg Park; it is usually accompanied by Atrypa affinis, Spirifer
octoplicatus, Leptana lata and depressa, Orthis lunata, and Terebratula
nucula : the T. navicula seems to have died out suddenly, as it is not
found in the Upper Ludlow beds.
   The same division of the Ludlow rocks may be obtained by attend
ing to the direction and dip of the beds; the lower series partakes
of the north-east strike, which runs through the older Silurian rocks
in these counties, and is traversed by many of the same faults as
those formations, but the Upper Ludlow beds are thrown up in anti
clinal ridges with a different direction.
   Mr. Sharpe gives a list of the organic remains found in each divi
sion of the formation, which includes forty-four of the species de
scribed in Mr. Murchison's work from the old red sandstone and
Upper Ludlow, fourteen of those from the Aymestry limestone, and
twenty-two of those from the Lower Ludlow beds. Of the species
of shells placed by Mr. Murchison in the old red sandstone”,                            all
but two have now been found low    the Ludlow beds, proving that

   Trap Rocks.—These are rare in the district; Professor Sedgwick
 has laid down some masses of igneous rocks at Shap Fells, on the
 south side of the high road; one of them consists of red felspar with
 some mica, quartz, and hornblende. The slate rocks are much disturbed
 in the neighbourhood, and the faults have broken up the cleavage
 planes as well as the bedding of the rocks, from which Mr. Sharpe
 infers that the trap is more modern than the eruption of the Shap gra
 nite, which took place before the cleaving of the slates,as the cleavage
 planes run through      all
                          the faults connected with that eruption.

  the Lammermuirs, is very great, but the series is far from being com
  plete, there being no appearance of the older strata on the one hand,
  and on the other their junction with the newer formations is always
  unconformable. The materials of which they are composed were pro
  bably derived from the disintegration of the granites and primary
  schists to the westward.
     2. The formation next in order is the upper division of the old
 red sandstone, the members of which rest unconformably upon the
 upturned ends of the greywacke.           The lowest member of it is an
  old red sandstone conglomerate, consisting of fragments of grey
 wacke and felspathic rocks, cemented by a paste which is generally
 arenaceous, sometimes calcareous.         It varies much in thickness.
     3. Red and   greenish   white sandstones succeed with soft red ar
 gillaceous strata.    Part of these seem to have been formed in a shal
 low sea, since they exhibit ripple-marks, and contain remains of
 Holoptychius and Dendrodus. Another portion contains few traces
 of fossils, and was probably deposited in deeper water. Some curious
 spindle-shaped concretions and the impressions called Kelpie's feet
 occur, also traces of Fuci.     Two localities near Preston-Haugh, and
 one at the foot of the    Knock-hill,   are                    all
                                                     which organic remains
                                                                      in

deeper water than the ichthyolitic beds. They consist                red and               of
greenish white sandstones interstratified with beds               softer and      of   a
more argillaceous character, and                      of
                                            deep red colour.

feet above the strata containing the animal remains.
      5.Above the soft, red and white sandstones are calcareous shales,
sandstones and cornstones,        impure concretionary limestones, with
out fossils. The     junction           of or

    6.  The lower portion      the coal-measures succeeds, consisting
                                   of                                                                 of

appear       correspond with the lower beds

                            in        Mr. Stevenson        inclined               is                 to

              on Fossil Fruits from the Chalk formation.           541
answer it in the negative.      He regards the beds at Cumledge, de
scribed by Mr. Milne as such, as old red, and considers the soft red
clays and sands at Lintlaw, derived from the disintegration of the
old red sandstone, referred by Mr. Milne to the new red sandstone,
to be of undetermined age, from want of sufficient evidence in the
absence of organic remains. The exact position of the greywacke
strata of the Lammermuirs is for the same reason indeterminate.
The author concludes by pointing out the great gap which occurs
between the greywacke and the upper division of the old red sand
stone in Berwickshire, the middle and lower divisions of the old red
and the whole of the Silurian system being deficient. Another cir
cumstance worthy of remark is the absence of any formations more
recent than the coal-measures, if we except alluvial deposits and the
undetermined red strata formerly mentioned.

 the South-east of England.” By Gideon Algernon Mantell, LL.D.,

     The fruits described are three in number, viz. –
     1. Zamia Susseriensis, Mantell.—From the greensand.        A cone
 allied to the Zamia macrocephala, a greensand fossil from Kent,
 figured in Lindley and Hutton's ‘Fossil Flora, pl. 125, from which
 it differs in form and in the number, size, and shape of its scales,
 which are more numerous, smaller and more oblong than in the
 Kentish species. It is five inches long, and at the greatest circum
 ference measures six inches.     It was found about two years ago in
 an accumulation of fossil coniferous wood in a sand-bank at Selmes
 ton, Sussex, at the junction of the Shanklin sand with the gault.
  Dr. Mantell having sent a cast of the only specimen found to M.
 Adolphe Brongniart, that distinguished botanist suggested that it
  might be either the stem of a young cycadaceous plant or the fruit
  of a Zamia, but the situation and small size of the stalk at the base
  and the appearance of the scales, induce Dr. Mantell to refer it to
  the latter.
     2. Abies Benstedi,  Mantell.–From the greensand near Maidstone,
  Kent. A beautiful cone found by Mr. W. H. Bensted in the quarry
  in which the remains of the Iguanodon were discovered in 1834,
  where it was associated with Fucus Targionii, and some indetermi
  nate species of the same genus; stems and apparently traces of the
  foliage of endogenous trees allied to the Dracaena (Sternbergia), and
  of trunks and branches of Conifera. The wood occurs both in a
  calcareous and siliceous state. The cone found is in every respect
  such a fruit as the trees to which the wood belonged might have
  borne.    It bears a close resemblance to a fossil from the greensand

nodon quarry of Kentish rag near Maidstone, belonging to Mr.                                 W.
H.    Bensted.
     Mr. Bensted having long paid attention to this subject, more
than two years ago submitted to Dr. Mantell specimens of fossil
shells, the cavities of which were filled with a dark brown substance
in every respect identical with the nodular and irregular concretions
of coprolitic matter which abound in the surrounding sandstone.
Mr. Bensted expressed his belief that the carbonaceous substance
was derived from the soft bodies of the Mollusca, and that the con
cretionary and amorphous portions of the same matter dispersed
throughout the sandstone of this bed, were masses of the fossilized
bodies of the animals which had become disengaged from their shells,
 and had floated in the sea till enveloped in the sand and mud, which
is now concreted to the coarse sandstone called Kentish Rag. In
proof of this opinion reference is made to an account published in
the “American Journal of Science’ for 1837, of the effects of an epi
demic among the shell-fish of the Ohio, which, killing the animals,
their decomposed bodies rose to the surface of the water, leaving the
shells in the bed of the stream, and floating away covered the banks
of the river. Mr. Bensted points out that nearly the whole of the
shells in the Kentish rag of his quarry appear to have been dead
shells, and infers that their death might have been owing to a similar
cause with that which destroyed the Uniones in America; while their
bodies intermingling with the drift wood on a sand-bank furnished.
the concretions described in this communication.
   The Rev. J. B. Reade submitted some of the substance of these
bodies to an analysis by Mr. Rigg, who confirmed Dr. Mantell's
suspicion of the presence of animal carbon in                     it,
                                                   and states that the
 darker portion       of
                    the substance contains about       per cent.    its 35               of

intermingled among the soft animal mass before the latter had un

           ON      THE PHOSPHO RESCENCE OF THE GLOW-WORM.
              MATTEUCCI            has performed            numerous experiments on
               glow-worms, and        has arrived       at   the following conclusions,

some of which, he observes, are new in part, and others more accu
rately determined than heretofore :—
   1. The phosphorescence of a glow-worm may cease before its
death.
    2. There exists in the glow-worm a substance which emits light,
 unaccompanied by sensible heat, and this does not require for its ex
 hibition either the integrity or the life of the animal.
    3. The phosphorescence of the insect ceases in carbonic acid and
 hydrogen gases in thirty or forty minutes, provided the gases are
   ure.
    4. The light of the phosphorescent matter is decidedly brighter
 in oxygen gas than in atmospheric air, and it preserves                    brilliancy                   its
 for nearly   three times          long.   This occurs not
                                          as                  only  with the entire
 insect, but with the luminous segments separated from                                                   it.

                                                                  it

segments were alone carefully put into hydrogen, they continued                                                           to

 ACTION OF POTASSIUM AND SODI UM ON SULPHUROUS ACID.
                        BY MM. FOR DOS AND GELIS.
    When potassium or sodium is thrown into an aqueous solution of
sulphurous acid, they act upon it in the same way as on pure water;
potash and soda are formed and hydrogen is evolved, which inflames;
the alkalies combining with the sulphurous acid to form sulphites,
which remain in solution; if the experiment be made in a tube with
the pure metals, the phaenomena are similar, hydrogen and sulphites
being obtained.
    The reaction takes place with so much violence, and the rise of
temperature is so considerable, that it is natural to suppose that these
two circumstances influence the results, and that if the reaction were
less vivid different results would be obtained; for such bodies as
combine at common temperatures do not act upon each other when
the temperature is raised.
    MM. Fordos and Gélis endeavoured therefore to bring potassium
into contact with aqueous sulphurous acid, under such circumstances
as should not raise the temperature, and they succeeded in the at
tempt, by operating with freezing mixtures and treating sulphurous
 acid with potassium which had been previously combined with metals
that were incapable of decomposing water or sulphurous acid by
themselves; or in other words, they used the alloy of potassium and
antimony, and that of potassium and mercury.
    These alloys decompose water which has been well cooled, regu
larly and without inflammation; when they are treated with very
 dilute sulphuric acid containing sulphurous acid, hydrogen mixed
 with sulphuretted hydrogen is disengaged, the presence of which is
 ascertained by the smell and its action upon acetate of lead.
    If these alloys be treated with water containing sulphurous acid
 only, hydrogen is still disengaged, for the action cannot be so regu
 lated as to obtain the perfect reduction of the sulphurous acid; but
 no sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved, and acids precipitate sulphur in
 abundance from the solution; consequently there are formed, under
 these circumstances, both a sulphite and a hyposulphite.—Journ. de
Ph.   et de Ch., Octobre      1843.
  ACTION OF ZINC on SULPHUROUS ACID, SULPHITE OF ZINC.
                BY MM. FOR DOS AND GELIS.
    An aqueous solution of sulphurous acid readily attacks zinc, espe
 cially when the metal is in filings and the solution is concentrated;
 there is increase of temperature but no gaseous product.      Fourcroy
 and  Vauquelin   have stated, that when the action is rapid   a notable
 quantity of hydrosulphuric acid gas is evolved; but it is easy to prove
 that when this occurs it is from a totally different cause from that
 which they assign to        Well-washed and recently prepared sul
                           it.
 phurous acid never produces this effect;   occurs,

acid, the gas, well-washed, should be passed through Woulf's bottles,
containing distilled water and cuttings of zinc. In this operation the
following appearances occur : the metal at first tarnishes and is co
vered with a grayish crust; the liquor then becomes slightly yellow,
but not turbid; the colour increases until it becomes as deep as that
of a concentrated solution of chromate of potash, and it continues as
long as there is great excess of sulphurous acid in the liquid. If the
disengagement of gas slackens, or if by the increase of temperature
 the metal is more rapidly dissolved, the colour diminishes, and in
 the first case the liquid becomes turbid and a white pulverulent de
 posit is formed; if the operation be now stopped, or if the liquor be
 suffered to remain at rest during a night, this white powder is con
verted into white brilliant prismatic crystals, which collect on the
 sides of the vessel and on the undissolved portions of the metal.
    Eramination of these Crystals.-They are easily obtained in con
 siderable quantity, either by spontaneous evaporation or cautious
evaporation in a water-bath; much sulphurous acid is evolved, and
 the surface of the solution is covered with a thick layer of crystals.
 These crystals may be washed with water, for they are almost in
 soluble in it; but water containing sulphurous acid dissolves them
 readily, without becoming coloured; these crystals are colourless,
 inodorous, transparent and insoluble in alcohol; acids decompose
 them with the evolution of sulphurous acid, without any deposit of
 sulphur; the solution in hydrochloric acid gives no precipitate with
 chloride of barium.     When the crystals are moist they are readily
 converted into sulphate by exposure to the air, but when dry they
 may be long kept without alteration.
    The preceding facts prove that these crystals consist of sulphurous
 acid, oxide of zinc and water; to analyse them the oxide of zinc was
 obtained by calcination, the sulphurous acid by converting into sul
 phuric by means of iodine, and noting the quantity absorbed, and
 the water by calculation; this it would be almost impossible to ob
 tain directly, for the sulphurous acid is disengaged at about the same
 temperature.

     Eramination of the Mother-water.—The solution from which the
  sulphite of zinc has been separated is colourless, transparent and  in
 odorous, contains no sulphuric acid; and the examination proved
 that when sulphurous acid acts upon zinc two salts only are formed,
 the sulphite and hyposulphite; when, however, the mother-water is
 further evaporated, it yields different products according to the tem
  perature at which it is effected, yielding sulphurous acid, sulphite of
 zinc and other products.-Journ. de Ph. et de Ch., Octobre 1843.
