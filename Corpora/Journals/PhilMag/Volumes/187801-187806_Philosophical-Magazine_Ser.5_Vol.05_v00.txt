I. On a Form of Daniell Cell convenient as a Standard of Elec
       tromotive Force. By OLIVER J. LoDGE, D.Sc."
                                          [Plate     I.]
       LTHOUGH a volt        is the formal unit of electromotive
        force, yet it happens in practice that differences of po
tential get stated as equal to so many Daniell cells more fre
quently than anything else, showing that there is some decided
 convenience in this mode of statement, a convenience partly
owing, no doubt, to the fact that a freshly set-up Daniell is a
 tolerably uniform and easily reproduced standard.      An ordi
 nary Daniell, however, is by no means suitable as a standard,
because of the diffusion of the copper-liquid through the porous
 cell. This defect must obtain in any cell where two liquids
 separated by a porous partition are employed ; and hence
attempts have been made to construct standard cells with solid
electrolytes, or with mercury instead of copper salts, as in the
little cell devised by Mr. Latimer Clark, which, though not
absolutely constant, is still,              I
                                  suppose, the best for   special                      its
Purpose.     But     all
                     cells with solid electrolytes are extremely
inconstant,    inthe sense that they suffer greatly from short
circuiting and take some time           recover themselves; and
                                                     to
there    aresome other inconveniences attending the use                                            of      a

respect, that the materials remain always the same during
action except that the sulphate of zinc gradually increases in
quantity, a difference which scarcely affects the electromotive
force. Almost the only defect in the constancy of a cell so
charged is due to the fact that the two liquids diffuse into
each other, for which reason the battery cannot retain                                                            its

to exist lead to three principal axes of elasticity.                  Many

 few pounds weight on a common india-rubber band, and takin
a red-hot coal, in a pair of tongs, or a red-hot poker, an
moving it up and down close to the band. The way in which
the weight rises when the red-hot body is near, and falls when
it is removed, is quite startling. Joule experimented on the
amount of shrinking per degree of elevation of temperature,
with different weights hung on a band of vulcanized india
rubber, and found that they closely agreed with the amounts
calculated by my theory from the heating effects of pull, and
cooling effects of ceasing to pull, which he had observed in
the same piece of india-rubber.            Joule's experiments leave
the statements of the     following   paragraph    (5) true for common
india-rubber at 5°C., but reverse it for common india-rubber
at higher temperatures and for vulcanized india-rubber—that
is to say, leave it applicable to these substances with “pull”
substituted for “push ’’ throughout.]
    (5) We may conclude as highly probable, that pushing a
column of india-rubber together longitudinally while leaving it
free at its sides will cause the evolution of heat, when the force
by which               its
                 ends are pushed together falls short             certain                         of

In  carbonate of iron (a paramagnetic crystal) the difference of
inductive capacities in different directions was reduced to one
third when the temperature was raised from 70° to 289°Fahr.,
and was tripled when the temperature was again brought down
to 70°   (Exp. Res. 3400 and 34.11).
     (2) Thermodynamic Relations.—The     theory of the mutual
convertibility of heat and mechanical work in reversible ope
rations when applied to these phenomena proves:–1. That a
piece of soft iron at a moderate or low red heat, when drawn
gently away from a magnet experiences a cooling effect, and
 when allowed to approach a magnet experiences a heating
 effect; that nickel at ordinary temperatures, and cobalt at

 objects, is indeed perfectly distinct by the light of the electric

    How many different observers have determined the absolute
quantity     of the Siemens resistance-unit,         so many    different,
indeed very different, results have been found.                With the
delicacy now attained of galvanometric methods of observation,
with the completeness with which we believe we understand
the fundamental laws of current-electricity, certainly no one
anticipated that in the final results of physicists so practised
in this kind of work there could appear so great a divergency.
These four different results, when compared, present a new
problem, and one of fundamental importance for galvano
metry.       The two & priori equally possible solutions of the
 problem are     :-
    (a) The four observers, or groups of observers, have carried
 out the difficult observations requisite for a determination of
 the absolute resistance without error; and the final results
 differ because the natural laws assumed as the basis of the
 different methods of observation are not precisely the true
 ones.    Or
    (b) The natural laws employed are rigorously correct, and
 at least three of the above observers have committed some
 error.
     In the following investigations it is found that the latter
 solution is the true one. Three essentially different methods,
 which brought into application three quite different natural
 laws, and in which both rapidly and slowly varying induced
 currents and also stationary flows came into use, have given a
 perfectly accordant final result for the absolute value of the
  Siemens resistance-unit—namely,
                 1  S. M. U. = 0-9550   × 1019
                                                 (º)

the value of the unit in question                    I
                                          chose a procedure which

spirals were connected with a multiplier so that their axes fell
into one and the same horizontal straight line, which was per
pendicular to the magnetic meridian.            The inner radius of
 the spirals was 144-43 millims. ; the outer radius amounted to
 184:46; the depth of the space occupied by the turns amounted
 consequently to 40.03 millims. ;               its

    In deriving this expression it was presupposed that in place
of the spiral turns circular turns might be put continuously
filling the space occupied by the multiplier; further, the angle
u of the deflection of the magnet was taken as so small that
one might put cos u-1 and 5 sin” w vanishingly small in
comparison with 1.      In the observations carried out u never
exceeded the value 2°.     The cylindrical spirals were so con
structed and set   up that the lengths R, D, h, and b could be
accurately measured to within 0.1 millim. directly-     with the
cathetometer.
     The number n of the Siemens units which represented the
resistance  of the multiplier at the time of each observation
was   determined by aid of a bridge arrangement, which most
                                  of all
carefully excluded     errors that might happen from extra
currents, variations  temperature, dissimilar positions      the                                       of

current-intermissions) showed, some years later, by a series of
measurements.       Since the question whether the induced
currents originated by sudden current-intermissions exactly
follow Ohm's law or not, cannot be theoretically decided uni
versally, but only be answered empirically in each individual
case, I have, in order to gain a perfectly sure foundation for the
measurements attempted, first instituted, in a preliminary in
vestigation, as severe a trial as possible of how far the currents
induced by sudden opening of the inducing circuit, in my
arrangement of the experiments, follow Ohm’s law.   In this
preliminary investigation nothing could be perceived that
would    intimate that induced currents arising from sudden
current-variations do not exactly follow Ohm’s law.

and he has not considered the propagation of electro-magnetic
                                           But according to a
former paper of ours, on the “Viscosity of Dielectrics,” no
charging of any condenser whatever is always accompanied
                                                        and the

   Hence although, if a method of experimenting were employed
in which a water-condenser of great internal resistance were
discharged through wires of less and less resistance for shorter
               ift
and shorter periods of time, the measured specific inductive
capacity
value  equal
                  get less and less, and gradually approach a
             to the square of the index of refraction of water
for infinitely long luminous waves (the index of refraction for
air being called unity), still practically the measured specific
inductive capacity can never be even approximately equal to
the refractive index of water, since the absorbed charge is
immeasurably greater than the surface-charge.          We therefore
need not    expect to find the specific inductive  capacity of water
in its variations with temperature consistent with Dr. Glad
stone’s results for index of refraction.         When Prof. Clerk
Maxwell takes into account      conductivity,  his equations are not
generally integrable; but even       they were they could not deal
                                                   if
 with the real case, because                      he
                                   leaves absorption quite out                              of
 account.

have been fully met.     It is a necessary condition of Le Sage's
theory, in order that gravity may be proportional to mass,
that the total volume of the free spaces in a substance in the
form of interstices between the molecules must be great com
pared with the total volume of matter contained in the mole
cules themselves. This condition of free interstices Mr. Preston
considers to be satisfied by assuming the molecules to be small
relative to their mean distances.
                       º
   Were we at liberty to make any assumptions we choose in
reference to the smallness of the molecules of matter and their
distance apart, we might be able to satisfy the conditions of
Le Sage's theory as to mass; but this we are not at liberty to
do. Modern              has enabled us to determine, at least
roughly, the size of the ultimate molecules of matter and also
their distance apart.   This subject has recently been investi
#.      by Sir William Thomson, the details of which will be
 ound in a remarkable paper in “Nature, vol. i. p. 551. Sir
William says the diameter of the molecule cannot be less than
Honºrodon of a centimetre. The number of molecules in a
cubic centimetre of a liquid or a solid may, he says, be from
                                                                    Hºw
3 x 10° to 3 x 10". This gives the distance from centre to
centre of two consecutive molecules to be from
  cooºoooo of           a centimetre.    Now,   if
                                             we take the mean of
these two   values, we have anoºmoon of a centimetre               the           for
 distance between the centres. The mean spaces between the
molecules are therefore less than the diameter of the molecules
themselves.     Under this condition       things,
                                               of     must      abso

                            coming into collision with      molecule.a

lable with Sir William's conclusions regarding the size            the               of
material molecule.       But even supposing we were          assume,     to
what we are hardly warranted           do, that the molecules are
                                         to
 10,000 times smaller, and their distance apart 10,000 times
greater than Sir William Thomson concludes, still this would
not assist the theory. The gravific particles would then, no

         On the Artificial Production of Corundum, Ruby, and
    carious Crystallized Silicates. By M.M. E. FREMY and FEIL*.
                     mineralogy (that is to say, the artificial pro
       duction of minerals) presents, in a scientific point of view,
an interest which every one can understand ; for it throws the
greatest light upon the mode in which minerals are formed,
and permits us to solve certain questions, relative to their com
position, which chemical analysis often leaves undecided. In
fact, a mineral which appears most pure contains almost always
foreign substances interposed which existed in the medium
that formed it; analysis is then powerless to determine the
real composition of the mineral, while a synthetic reproduction
enables us to distinguish the constituent elements from those
which are merely accidental.
     A great number of minerals have been artificially produced
in the dry way, in the wet way, and by M. Becquerel's inge
nious methods; and synthetic reproduction is daily receiving
some fresh extension, as is proved by the recent discoveries of
 M.    Hautefeuille.
     Corundum has, perhaps, more than any other mineral ex
ercised the sagacity of chemists. The excellent investigations
on the different modes of crystallization of alumina which have
been published by Ebelmen, de Senarmont, and since by
 MM. H. Sainte-Claire Deville and Caron, by M. Gaudin, and
 by M. Debrayf, are known to every man of science. Even
 after these remarkable researches, however, we have thought
 we might still be permitted to interest the Academy by making
         .
 known the processes we employ for the production of differ
 ently coloured and crystallized alumina (that is to say, ruby"
 and sapphire) in masses sufficiently large to be used in horo
 logy         to be cut by the lapidary. It will probably be pos
 sible to apply the methods we are about to describe to the
 artificial production of other minerals; in this respect they
 seem to possess a true scientific interest.
      Wishing to approximate as nearly as possible to the natural
  conditions    will   have probably determined the formation of
  corundum, ruby, and sapphire, we have borrowed from industry
  its most energetic heat-producing appliances, which permit an
  elevated temperature to be produced, to be maintained for a
  long time, and considerable masses to be operated on; indeed

  with chlorhydric acid, M. Debray has obtained at the same time apatite
  and crystallized alumina.

we kept heated uninterruptedly for twenty days.

experiments which required the highest temperature.         When
our trials demanded prolonged calcination, we had recourse to
a glass-furnace which was generously placed at our disposal
by the Company of                    In this case our essays were
directed by an eminent chemist, M. Henrivaux, whose intelli
gent supervision secured their success, for which we here render
him all our thanks.
   The following is the method which permitted us to produce
the largest quantity of crystallized alumina                                           :-

   We commence by forming a fusible aluminate, and then
 heat it to bright             redness with a siliceous substance.   In this
 case the alumina              is slowly separated from   saline combination     its

mitted to lapidaries, they have been found as hard as, and often
harder than, natural ones.        They rapidly wear away the best
grindstones of hardened steel. M. Jannettaz has kindly, sub
mitted our rubies to crystallographic observations; with the
Amici microscope they present a black cross in their interior
and coloured rings upon the margins.
   The crystals which we have             cut, and now exhibit to the
Academy, have not yet the brilliance demanded by commerce,
because they did not present to the lapidary faces favourable
º
for cleavage and cutting ; but here are some crystalline masses
weighing several kilograms, among which we shall doubtless
find some that can be easily cut.
   We will now describe the method which has enabled us to
            the fine specimens of crystallized silicates which we
  y before the Academy.           The experiments about to be de
scribed are connected with the preceding ; for they have fre
quently given us crystals of corundum together with crystallized
silicates.
   It was by means of fluorides that we produced the crystal
lized bodies, of which we have still to speak.

This comes near to the composition of natural kyanite".
   The action of fluoride of aluminium on boric acid gave a
crystallized borate of alumina which corresponds to kyanite.
   e are at present carrying out a series of trials in which
fluoride of aluminium will act upon other mineral acids.
   The important fact of the volatility of the fluoride of alumi
nium, discovered by M. Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, enables
us readily to explain the remaining experiments.         When a
mixture of equal weights of alumina and fluoride of barium,
into which has been introduced 2 or 3 per cent. of bichromate
of potass, is heated to and maintained at a very high tempera
ture during a long time, a crystallized mass is obtained the
has   i.
study of which is of the greatest interest.    If the calcination
            effected in a crucible covered with another (which
serves in some sort as a condenser), two sorts of crystals are
found in the crucibles: the one sort are long colourless prisms,
often several centims. in length, and presenting the aspect of
the silvery flowers of antimony ; the others are ruby crystals,
remarkable for the regularity of their forms and beautiful
rose-colour.
  The long prismatic colourless crystals are formed by a
double silicate of baryta and alumina, which present the
composition    :-Silica........................     34.32
                 Baryta........................     35-04
                 Alumina .....................      30-37
   In our essays this double silicate often crystallized in rather
short, hard and transparent, clinorhombic prisms which, M.
Terreil has ascertained, have the same composition as the long
and hollow prismatic needles.
   M. Jannettaz has proved that the long prisms are often con
stituted by four plates with parallel faces, forming the faces of
a hollow prism.    These plates are very thin ; under the micro
scope they extinguish light; or rather they             let
                                                  darkness persist

which have been described under the names          Fribolite, Bucholzite,
                                                   of

       Corundum, Ruby, and rarious Crystallized Silicates.        51
 plane of the optic axes is parallel to these intersections; they
 cut one another at angles of 60°42' and 119° 18'.
    There is therefore produced in this curious reaction corundum
 and a crystallized double silicate.     These two crystalline sub
 stances result from the following transformations:—
    In the calcination of the mixture of alumina and fluoride of
 barium there are evidently formed fluoride of aluminium and
 baryta.    The fluoride of aluminium, once produced, must have
acted in two different ways.      Decomposed by the gases from
the   hearth, it formed   fluorhydric  acid and corundum, which
crystallized under the influence of the vapours. Acting be
sides upon the silica of the crucible, it gave rise to silicate of
alumina, which, combining with the baryta, produced the fine
crystals of double silicate of alumina and baryta which we
exhibit to the Academy.       Such, in our opinion, is the theory
of the reaction.
    Permit us now to dwell on the conditions which have de
termined the crystallization of the two substances, corundum
and the double silicate.       Looking at the specimens we here
exhibit, and which present such well-defined crystals, one is
struck with the place which they occupy in the crucibles :
they seem to have been volatilized; and yet we have ascertained,
by exposing them to the highest temperatures of our furnaces,
that they are absolutely fixed.      It is because the fluorides are
not merely powerful mineralizers; they are also compounds
 which, as was formerly said, give wings to the least—volatile
 substances.     Do we not recollect, indeed, that remarkable
formation of orthose felspar, produced artificially and found
in the upper part of a copper-furnace at Mansfeld 2             The
 employment of fluoride of calcium in the melting-bed of the
furnace which produced that felspar permits the belief that the
fluorine intervened in that case as a transporting agent.         It
was evidently this which presented itself in our experiments,
as in those which have been so often performed by M. H.
Sainte-Claire Deville: the agents of the transport and crystal
lization of the corundum and the silicate were likewise the
fluorine compounds which we employed.
    It was to be presumed that this action of fluoride of barium
 upon alumina in presence of silica, forming a crystallized double
 silicate, would reappear as a general phenomenon connected
 with the decomposition of the fluorides by different bases. This
 we have, in fact, proved ; in another communication we will
 describe some crystallized double silicates produced under
 the same conditions as the double silicate of alumina and
 baryta ; and then we shall give the general formulae of these
compounds.

   Such is the brief account of our researches which we wished
to present to-day to the Academy.       It is probable that our
experiments, which give, in considerable masses, substances
whose hardness is comparable to that of the natural ruby, will
be utilized from time to time by the watchmaker, and even by
the jeweller.    We will say, in conclusion, that in this labour
the aim we    pursue is exclusively scientific ; consequently we
put into the possession of the public the facts we have dis
covered, and shall be very happy to learn that they have found
useful industrial applications.
VIII.     On a Variety of the Mineral Cronstedite. By FREDERICK
      FIELD, F.R.S., Vice-President of the Chemical Society".
       HEvarious analyses of the interesting mineral Cronstedite,
       named after the Swedish mineralogist Cronstedt and
hitherto found only in two localities (Przibram in Bohemia and
Wheal Maudlin in Cornwall), are rather conflicting, since the
amounts of ferrous and ferric oxide differ considerably, as the
following results will show. Nevertheless          examinations                all
tend     prove
            to that Cronstedite     essentially hydrous

     T has always seemed that more experiments were required
       in regard to the destruction of the                           photo
graphic image by chemical or physical agency.                   In the pre
sent communication                        I
                              propose to give some instances of the
destruction by the former, as it appears they may be capable
of throwing light on some of the phenomena which have as
yet been only imperfectly explained.
                                                                                           *.
   The undeveloped Daguerrean image, as is well known, can
be destroyed by the action of iodine, bromine, or chlorine on
the sensitized surface of the plate; and it can also be destroyed
by other agents which might naturally be expected to do                                                    so.
Perhaps the most remarkable method                 destroying the image,

The image on  silver iodide was amenable to the last two oxidi
zing         but apparently not to the first one.
  A silver-bromide plate, after the image had been oxidized,
was allowed to come into contact with nascent hydrogen; and
a partial restoration of the image was obtained, but the distinct
ness was much marred by the reducing action that took place
on the   silver bromide which had received no impression by
light.
 9. a crucial    test, however, both bromide and iodide films
were exposed moistened to the action of ozone obtained by the
ordinary electrical arrangements from perfectly pure oxygen;
and in all cases the image was totally destroyed.    Whilst the
film was still in the ozonized condition, it was again exposed,
and a feeble image, due to the new exposure, was developable,
whilst after destroying the ozone, a new exposure gave a vigo
rous picture.                                  -
   From these experiments are to be deduced that the image
formed in the silver iodide is of the same nature as that formed
in the silver bromide, the difference between them being pro
bably that in the former the atoms are more strongly bonded
tº an in the latter, that oxidation of the loose atom of silver
makes the image undevelopable, and that to this cause the
deterioration of the image on dry plates by keeping after ex
posure is most probably due.                               If
                                   the red rays promote oxida
tion, as has recently been asserted by Chastaing, the pheno
mena observed by Draper and others, already alluded        may                                     to,
be   readily accounted for.

stations in the Bombay Presidency was made in 1851—two years
before the Brussels Conference, the outcome of which, among other
results, was the establishment of our own Meteorological Office
under the direction of the late Admiral FitzRoy, and about four
years after the general idea of systematic meteorological observa
tion, especially by officers in the army, navy, and mercantile marine,
was suggested in this country. The observations in the Bombay
Presidency were made in pursuance of orders received from the
Honourable Court of Directors; but at most of the stations they were
soon discontinued altogether, whilst at others they were continued
in a very inefficient and negligent manner. Towards the end of
1852 the receipt of five complete sets of verified instruments from
England revived in a measure the work of observation in India.
Orders were given to erect them at Belgaum, Poona, Bombay,
Deesa, and Kurrachee, and place them in charge of the Superin
tendent of the Government Observatory at Bombay, and the senior
Medical Officers at the other stations, with this comment:—“We
would hope that, from the zeal and energy of Medical Officers in
charge of European hospitals and their love of science, the observa
tions may be made by themselves and their establishments, without
entailing on the public any expense on this account.”    The zeal and
energy of the medical officers and their love of science, however,
seem not to have been equal to the occasion; for after vainly en
deavouring until the end of 1855 to carry out the orders they had
received without entailing expense on the public, it was arranged
at the direction of the Honourable Board that two European soldiers
should be told off at each station to undertake the duty of making
meteorological observations, on an allowance of 25 rupees per month
for each observatory.   The soldiers were sent to the Bombay Ob
servatory early in 1856 for a preparatory course of training, on the
successful completion of which they were furnished with certificates
of competency for performing the work. Soon after this time the
real work of meteorological registration may be said to have com
menced so far as the observers were concerned; for the work from
this time appears to have been carried on generally in a thorough
and trustworthy manner.
   Turning to the administrative report, the first portion of which
has reference to the machinery of the Meteorological Departments
previous to the establishment of the Meteorological Department by
the Government and the reorganization of the observations, we find
there were eighty-four observatories in India and        itsDependencies.
In  the scheme      reorganization, one
                    of                     of  the most important points
was  a redistribution      the observatories,

   Under the head of Publications we find the results obtained by
the Meteorological Department of India will be published in two
serial forms—an    “Annual Report on the Meteorology of India,”
and ‘Indian   Meteorological Memoirs, the part of which about to
be issued will contain:—
  1st. On the Winds of Calcutta.
  2nd. On the Climate and Meteorology of Kashghar and Yárkánd.
  3rd. On the Diurnal Variation of the Barometric Pressure at
Simla.
   The Report on the Meteorology of India is a folio of 386 pages,
297   being occupied with tables of results obtained at 87 stations.
These comprise Solar Radiation, Terrestrial Radiation, Air-tempera
ture, Atmospheric Pressure, Anemometry, Hygrometry, Cloud-pro
portion, and Rainfall. The second paragraph of the introductory
portion of this Report indicates in so lucid a manner the connexion
of Meteorology with Physical Geography, and is of itself sufficient
to exhibit the spirit in which Mr. Blanford has undertaken the work,
that we quote it in eartenso:—
   “As a field for the advantageous study of Physical Meteorology,
India stands pre-eminent—in virtue not only of the intensity and
variety of the phenomena it presents, but also of their intimate
localization in a circumscribed arena.      Isolated on the north by the
gigantic mountain-range, which presents an impassable obstacle to
any interchange of the lower half of the atmosphere with that of
the regions beyond, and bathed on two sides by an ocean which
stretches away without a break to the margin of the Antarctic land,
it affords an almost unique example of the contrasted conditions of
land and water, of continent and ocean, of great extent, yet for the
most part accessible and uncomplicated by influences of unknown
origin and uncertain magnitude.         At the same time situated half

 these subjects are treated, we will indicate briefly the contents of
 one chapter; and for this purpose we will take the last, viz. that on
 Vibrations of Plates—a plate being a thin solid “ of uniform iso
 tropic material and constant thickness” (p. 293).          The general
expressions in the case of such a plate are first investigated for
the potential energy of each unit of area, and for               variation                                      its

subjects      this kind, however, the difficulty only begins when the
                    of
general  equations   have been formed; and accordingly the next step
is     modify them
       to              suit the case  to circular plate and     integrate
                                                                  of  a                                          to

    example, and particularly in regard to the difficulties incident to
    the treatment of “Vibrating Systems in general.”       He has done
    this by his elaborate discussion of the case of a vibrating system
    having one degree of freedom, which, as already mentioned, forms
    the subject of Chapter 3, as well as by the discussion of the system
    having two degrees of freedom at the end of Chapter 5.
       The complaint has often been made, and with regard to widely
    different subjects, that, with a few conspicuous exceptions, our
   best scholars and ablest men of science do not write—that they
   content themselves with the pleasant task of acquiring knowledge,
   and possibly of adding to it by means of brief memoirs which are
   apt to be lost in the waste sea of the literature of Memoirs and
   Periodicals. The last step between acquiring the knowledge, and
   drawing up a formal statement of it for the benefit of others                                          in
   volves labour which they decline to take”. The present volume is
   a striking exception to the common practice.        Its noble author
   might well have considered himself absolved from the irksome labour
   of writing a book, a task which he might have regarded as falling
  more properly to the lot of the professional mathematician. . We
  do not doubt that this consideration will add to the gratitude of
  students, who will find in the work before us a means by which their
  labours in this branch of science will be most materially lightened.

ing to the heater of the engine, being also part of the moving fly,
is restricted as to weight, material, and area of surface.   It must
be of the lightest possible construction, or friction will greatly
interfere with its movement; it must not expose much surface, or
it will be too heavy; and it must be a very bad conductor of heat,
so as to retain the excess of pressure on one side.  Again, the part
corresponding to the cooler of the engine (the side of the glass
bulb) admits of but little modification.  It must almost necessarily
be of  glass, by no means the best material for the purpose; it is
obliged to be of one particular shape; and it cannot be brought very
near the driving surface.
    A perfect instrument would be one in which the heater was sta
 tionary; it might then be of the most suitable material, of sufficient
 area of surface, and of the most efficient shape, irrespective of weight.
 The cooler should be the part which moves; it should be as close as
 possible to the heater, and of the best size, shape, and weight for
 utilizing the force impinging on            By having the driving surface

blackened surface at any degree of exhaustion.       At the ordinary
density of the atmosphere the existence of this molecular disturbance
was detected several millimetres off, and its intensity increased
largely as the generating surface and movable plate were brought
closer together.   It would be possible, therefore, to construct an
otheoscope in which no rarefaction or containing vessel was neces
sary, but in which motion would take place in air at the normal
density”. Such a heat-engine would probably work very well in
sunlight.
   Aided by the mechanical dexterity of my assistant, Mr. C. H.
Gimingham,           I
                  have constructed several varieties of otheoscope.
These will be exhibited at the Soirée of the Royal Society on
Wednesday next, as illustrations of the very beautiful manner in
which, at this stage of my investigations, theory and experiment
proceed hand in hand, alternately assisting each other, and enlarging
our knowledge of those laws of molecular movement which con
stitute a key to the relations of force and matter.
   The following is a list of the otheoscopes      have already made,  I
together with some new experimental radiometers, which will be
exhibited for the first time on Wednesday:-
   1. Otheoscope.—A four-armed fly, carrying four vanes of thin clear
mica, is mounted like a radiometer in an exhausted glass bulb.
At one side of the bulb a plate of mica blacked one side is fastened
in a vertical plane, in such a position that each clear vane in rotating
shall pass the plate, leaving a space between of about a millimetre.
If a candle is brought near, and by means of a shade the light
is allowed to fall only on the clear vanes, no motion is produced;
but if the light shines on the black plate, the fly instantly rotates
as if a wind were issuing from this surface, and keeps on moving as
long as the light is near.
   2. Otheoscope.—A four-armed                       fly
                                          carries roasted mica vanes,

          is                                                                          a
Fixed      to
           the side     the bulb are three plates       clear mica, equi    of

A  candle brought near the fixed plates generates molecular pressure,
which, falling obliquely      the fly, causes

narrow bands of black carbonaceous and Graptolitic shales, which,
from their especial abundance in the neighbourhood of the town of
Moffat, Dumfriesshire, are known to geologists as the Moffat Shales
or Moffat Series.
   The most perfect section of the black shales visible within the
Moffat area is exhibited in the cliffs of the gorge of Dobb's Linn, at
the head of Moffatdale.    It was shown by the author that they are here
disposed in a broken and partially inverted anticlinal, which throws
off on both sides the basal beds of the surrounding non-fossiliferous
greywackes.    They are distinctly arranged in three successive groups
or divisions.   Each of these divisions is distinguished by special
lithological characteristics, and possesses a distinct fauna. To the
lower and middle divisions a few fossils are common ; but between
 the middle and upper divisions the palaeontological break is com
 plete.  These divisions, again, are naturally subdivided into several
zones, each characterized by special species or groups of species.
  A larger exposure of the same deposits occurs at Craigmichan, a
few miles to the south-west, where the beds of the lower division
are shown to a much greater depth than at Dobb's Linn.       In these
two localities the general succession of the Graptolitic shales is as
follows:—
                                                                                                           feet.

ON   THE COMPOSITION       AND THE INDUSTRIAL USE OF THE GASES
   ISSUING FROM METALLURGIC HEARTHS. BY L. CAILLETET.
                      investigations of H. Sainte-Claire Deville on dis
THEsociation,
         remarkable
                  in  opening to science a new path of research, have
likewise   promised    to interpret a great number of metallurgical
phenomena which had till then remained unexplained.
   By collecting the gases which circulate in the hottest part of the
furnaces in which iron is worked, I have been able, by means of
apparatus similar to M. Deville's, to prove that the composition of
those gases, suddenly cooled, is totally different from the results
given by the analyses of Ebelmen.          That skilful metallurgist, unac
quainted with the phenomena of dissociation, collected the gases by
slowly aspirating them by means of a long tube—which necessarily
brought about the combination of their dissociated elements.
   In Ebelmen's analyses the reaction seems almost always com
plete, while the cooling undergone by the gases shows that smoke
and carburetted gases can subsist in presence of oxygen at the tem
 perature of welding iron.
   The gases collected at the top of the grating of an annealing-oven,
at a point where the temperature is such that the eye cannot sup
         :-
port the brightness of the bricks raised to a most intense whiteness,
contain
                    Oxygen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13-15
                    Carbonic oxide . . . . . . . . 3.31

                                                      100.00
   Independently of the carbonic oxide, there is found in the oxi
dizing atmosphere     of the oven a large excess of finely divided carbon,
which   deposits itself on the tube, hot and cold, which serves for the
aspiration.
   In metallurgic works the gases issuing from welding-fires are
generally conducted beneath generators, which thus produce with
out expense the supply necessary for the working of engines.           The
gases, therefore, rapidly cool against the walls of the boiler; thus,
after traversing a length of 15 metres, their temperature is below
 500°. They are then formed of
                    Oxygen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7-65

                                                      100.00
    It may be concluded from this analysis that the quantity of
 oxygen has diminished by nearly one half, in reacting, not upon
 the carbonic oxide, of which the proportion has changed but little,
  but upon the finely divided carbon, which exists in large quantity,

as   I have shown,   in the atmosphere of the hearth. The cooling and
extinction of the gases stops                             all

formed into electricity by means of magneto-electric       machines,
supplies this electricity much more economically than any chemical
action pile that has hitherto existed.   This consideration gave me
the idea of producing electricity by attacking coke directly.   But,
as every one knows, coke is not attacked by any liquid at ordinary
temperatures;       I
                    was therefore obliged to construct an electro
chemical   pile with hot liquid.
   Now it was evident that bodies which are liquid at ordinary
temperatures would be vaporized at the temperature necessary for
attacking coke.     Hence it was necessary to take a substance which
would   only   become liquid at a sufficiently elevated temperature,
and be converted into vapour only at a very high temperature.
                          I
   With this view fused either nitrate of potass or nitrate of soda;
and in this liquid        I
                      immersed as attackable electrode ordinary coke,
and  platinum    as the unattackable electrode.   But experience has
proved to me that this latter electrode may be iron, cast iron, or
any other metal which in the presence of coke is not attacked by
the liquid.
   By adding different metallic salts one can vary the electromo
tive force of the pile, the velocity of combustion of the coke; and
with those salts the galvanoplastic deposit of the metals is received
upon the unattackable    electrode.
   The electromotive force of the pile varies between 2 and 3 units,
according to the nature of the metallic salts introduced intº the
liquid; this force is therefore superior to that of either the Bunsen
or the Grenet pile; indeed the Bunsen pile gives the maximum of
1’S unit, the Grenet pile 2 or, in the most favourable conditions,
2:1   units.
   To set the pile in action in the most practical manner, it is not
necessary  to fuse the alkaline nitrate beforehand; it suffices to ignite
a piece of coke and put it in contact with the nitrate in powder.
Chemical action commences immediately; the temperature produced
fuses the salt which surrounds the coke; and the pile enters upon
its functions. During the activity         the pile much carbonic acid

and other gases are liberated.               I     have devised           arrangement
mitting the gas         to    be   stored,   in   order   to   make           serve   as

power.      The following      the practical arrangement
                                    is                        the elements     of
of the   pile  —
  A   cast-iron pot,         cylindrical shape, serves

as receiver and unattackable electrode.           An iron-wire basket,                               of
concentric form, serves for holding the coke, and           the same time     at
plays the part     of  rheophore.

ON    THE LAw of ABsor PTION OF RADIATIONS THROUGH BoDIES,
     AND ITS EMPLOYMENT IN QUANTITATIVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
    (PART I.). By G. GOVI.
    When we interpose an absorbent medium in the path of the
white light which passes through the slit of a spectroscope, we
usually see dark bands appear in different parts of the spectrum,
which there diminish the brightness of the colours or even eom
pletely extinguishes them.      It is seldom that these bands do not
invade a great number of contiguous wave-lengths, which they ob
scure in spreading more feebly on both sides of a more intense line
of absorption.     If the thickness of the absorbent medium be aug
mented, fresh shaded bands often appear between the former ones;
but what never fails to be produced is the strengthening of the
first bands and their progressive dilatation; so that, for a certain
thickness of the medium, the entire spectrum is invaded by the
shade, and so much enfeebled that it may be regarded as quite ex
tinguished.
    This progressive widening of the absorption-bands singularly
 reminds one of the increase in number and the dilatation of the
 bright lines which several observers have verified in the spectra of
 incandescent gases in proportion as their rarefaction is diminished
 and their temperature augmented; so that it is quite possible the
 two
      *...'.        may correspond and be complementary the one to
 the other for one and the same substance. Moreover all the radia
 tions, visible and invisible, of the spectrum present analogous phe
 nomena; and if we here speak of the luminous radiations only, it is
 solely because their study is much more convenient and more usual
 than that of the ultra-red or ultra-violet radiations.
    It is obvious, from what has just been said, that the absorptive
 power of a substance is not sufficiently characterized by such or
  such a dark band appearing in the spectrum of the white light
 which has passed through a certain thickness of          and that,         it,

to deduce therefrom the corresponding                   coefficients of absorption.
It suffices for observing directly the spectral curves of equal ab
sorption *, to give to the absorbent the form of a prism (or, more
strictly speaking, of a wedge) more or less acute, which is applied
by one of            its

   The employment of solar light permits the reference of the ab
sorption-curves to the Fraunhofer lines, and consequently to the
wave-lengths   of the different points in the spectrum.      If the
prisms were replaced by networks, we should have a simpler repre
sentation of the relation connecting the coefficients of absorption
with the different wave-lengths.      When, however, we wish to
study, with respect to chromatic absorption, substances endowed
with a very feeble absorptive power, or desire to express more pre
cisely the law of extinction for    the radiations, the process just

82                     Mr.    J. Aitken           on some Erperiments on
general use.     He has, however, some time ago suggested, and
now    generally  uses, the word centreward in place of centri
petal.   It is much to be hoped that in his reforms he will not
spare the word centrifugal, but will replace it by some word
more etymologically correct.       While objecting to the name
centrifugal force, we are under the necessity of retaining it
till some better term has been introduced.       It will, however,
be   necessary   for us  clearly to understand what we mean by
centrifugal force. According to the First Law of Motion, any
body when in motion tends to move at a uniform velocity
and in a straight line.      If we wish the body to move in a
circular or any  curved  path,   then we must cause some force to
act on it to compel it to deviate from      free path; and the re             its
sistance which the  body  offers     this deviation  what   tocall                                is              we
centrifugal force. Or, more simply, centrifugal force      the re                                           is
sistance which      body offers when
                              a              motion     change               in                     to                     of
                               we remove the deviating force, then

direction      motion.                      If
there          centrifugal
              is             force,   and the body simply tends                                                            to

at the lowest point and increasing to a maximum at the highest

putting and keeping the chain in motion; this tension is greatest
at the part of the chain approaching the driving pulley, and
least at the part                  just leaving            it.

further and further from the pulley, the loop keeping, however,
much the same shape it had while at rest.         This elongation

 them, as the subject is one of great difficulty, and one of which
 we have a very limited knowledge.                A rigid body is one which
 is generally    supposed    to be  capable   of resisting    a certain amount
 of force without being permanently put out of shape. The
 force required to put it permanently out of shape may                      small;                                      i.
 yet it is a perfectly definite amount.             Now the      chain,   when in
 motion, may have            shape altered  its   any force, however small,      by
 the greater force only making the alteration take place more
 quickly.      This being the case, does not this new property

break.     In order, therefore, to cause the chain to take up the
same   velocity  as the pulley, it was pressed against it by means of
the elastic pulley G, fig. 3, Pl. IV., with the following results.
   A. Fig. 1, Pl. W., shows the effect when the chain is pressed
by G at o, on the descending side, at the point where it leaves
the pulley. There is no alteration in the path of the chain,
because the chain after it leaves the pulley is moving in a
straight line, and as there is no deviating force there is no
centrifugal force, and therefore removing the tension in the
chain has no effect on the direction of motion of the links.
   B. Fig. 2, Pl. V., shows the effect when the chain is pressed
at the point p, a little higher up the pulley on the descending
side. }. this case, the centrifugal force of the curved part of
the chain resting on op on the descending side of the pulley
being unbalanced by the tension, the chain rises from the pulley
and is shot away from                                   it,

the chains when in rapid motion on an inclined metal or other
polished surface, where they will remain in rapid motion for
some time, gradually getting their form flattened by gravi

curious reverse curve in the chain, caused by it curving further
 round than seems necessary, and then requiring to be unbent
 again.     These two alterations in the shape of the loop look as
if the motion had conferred a certain degree of rigidity on
the chain, which enabled it to resist bending at the entrance to
the curve, and also to resist unbending at the other side.
 There are also alterations in the shape of the loop near the
driving-pulley.           It will be also noticed that the chain does
 not now hang in the same position as when at rest;                         centre                      its

102              Mr.       J.   Aitken on some Experiments on
links alters the form of the curves; A shows how the flatten
       produced at the entrance to the curves.      Suppose the
#'.
link 1 to be moving in a straight   path and  just  entering on
the curve cd, the links 2, 3, &c. have entered the curve. The
sketch shows the position of the links with regard to the line
of tension. The links tend to keep their centre line vertical,
and resist moving in the curved line c d. , The sketch also
shows that, by doing so, in passing round the curve the ten
sion on each end of the link is no longer in a straight line,
but acts as a “couple,” tending to cause the link to rotate.
Again, B shows the effect of the rotation of the links when
passing from a curved into a straight path; the link 1 is
moving in the curved path ed. The outer parts of the links
are in this case moving quicker than the inner, the result
of which is to throw the centre line of the link inwards,
thus causing the link to move inwards, and also forcing the
link in front inwards, so causing the links to continue to move
in their curved course. This rotation of the links causes the
tension in the chain to act as a “couple’’ on the links as
shown, but this time in the opposite direction to the case A,
and tends to destroy the rotation.           But before the rotation is
destroyed, the chain has curved far past               position       rest;

pulley C (fig. 2, Pl. IV.) and driven at the same velocity, the
loop of the chain with the longest links opens out and tends
to take up the circular form, the smaller links keeping near
the form the chain had while at rest. In the long-link chain
there is no reverse curve, while it is well-marked in the short
linked one.
    XI. An elastic cord in rapid motion also tends to assume
 the circular form, because the internal strains in the quickly
curved parts tend to open them out in the same manner as if
the cord were at rest. An elastic cord, when in motion, does
not take the reverse curve like a chain, because    tendency                          its

 the force necessary to keep up the motion is imparted to the
 chain at one point, which ought not to be, as it produces a
 tension in the chain which varies in amount at the different
 parts, being greatest at the part               the driving
 pulley.   These imperfections must always be borne in mind
 when experimenting with this apparatus.
    To set the chain in motion, it is first put round the pulley i
 and then tightened by holding it out by means of one of the
 movable pulleys, in the form shown at fig. 6, Pl.                    After the                      VII.

 moved, as the centrifugal force tightens the chain. When in
 motion, we shall find that we can, by means of the movable
 pulleys, mould the chain into a variety of curves, and that it
 will retain for some time whatever shape we give                     We may                          it.

           measuring-apparatus    for a laboratory-spectroscope
THEwhich       I have been asked to describe, was fitted about a
year ago to an instrument in common use in the College              La
boratory, and has afforded very satisfactory results.    My chief
aim in planning the arrangement was, to facilitate the measure
ment and identification of spectral lines and the mapping of
spectra under circumstances admitting of little general illu
mination.
   The spectroscope to which the apparatus is fitted has two
fixed flint-glass prisms, the refracting angle of each being 60°.
This instrument is shown in the annexed engraving.          When
in use the    prisms  are covered  by  a brass cap provided  with
openings for the collimating- and observing-telescopes.      The
movable arm D that supports the observing-telescope also
carries a vernier which is moved with the telescope over a
graduated arc; and in this usual way the relative positions of
the several lines of a given spectrum can be determined.     The
angular distance traversed in passing from the extreme red
to extreme violet is necessarily small, owing to the low dis
persive power of the instrument; but this, I need scarcely say,
is an advantage rather than the reverse in a spectroscope
 which is commonly employed as an aid in ordinary qualitative
analysis.
   The graduations of the are are unavoidably close and diffi
cult to read in a feeble light; consequently the eyes of the
observer become speedily tired and unfitted for the examination
of faint spectra.    Nevertheless measurements made with the
graduated arc and vernier are, in my experience, more trust
worthy and satisfactory than those obtained with even the best
photographed scale that I have had the opportunity of working
with.    Desiring, then, to retain the method of direct angular
                  I
measurement, sought to multiply the motion in such a manner
as to obtain wide readings on a convenient scale.    After many
trials in different directions, the form of  apparatus   which I
shall now describe was finally adopted.

    Measuring-Apparatus for a Laboratory-Spectroscope.                                 107
   Description of the Apparatus.-The annexed woodcut, which
is taken from a photograph, represents the whole apparatus.
The index A, attached to the spectroscope, moves in front of a
graduated plate of opal glass, the latter being supported, in the
manner shown, by the stand Sº, to which the spectroscope is
also screwed by means of the rod R.        The index is attached to
                    i.
a milled head which moves stiffly on a stout steel rod r ; the
latter can revolve in little bearings supported by the projecting
arm of “angle-brass,”, a, the other end of the rod being                                   let
into  a hole                  in

ment. On the rod just mentioned, and immediately beneath                                   c,
a  small toothed wheel       securely keyed. The diameter
                                   is                               this              of

with the teeth of the wheel on the rod r, and to act upon the
teeth directly so as to cause the rod carrying the index, A, to
j
rotate easily.     This strip is bent to a curve whose radius is
equal to the distance from the axis of the pillar, P, of the
instrument to the middle of the toothed wheel.            The strip is
attached to a stout    arm;   and this is in turn screwed to the
slightly projecting end of the heavy plate, D, which carries,
     of course moves with, the observing-telescope, the motion
being communicated to the latter by turning the milled head
m. As the observing-telescope moves over the graduated arc
g, the index A moves in front of the graduated plate B, but in
the opposite direction; for the motion of D is communicated
to the rod r by means of the serrated slip c. When the fittings
are well made, the movement of the index A is steady and
corresponds in both directions with those of D. By the simple
means described, a very slight motion of the observing-telescope
produces a comparatively considerable displacement of the
index A.
   In my instrument, the telescope and the index move in
opposite directions.      Any objection on this score can be re
moved; for it is only necessary to point out that the motions
may be made to coincide in direction by placing c under            in
stead of over the toothed wheel.
   Graduation of the Glass Plate.—It is very desirable that the
graduations on the plate and on the arc of the instrument
should agree; the best mode of securing this is to graduate
the plate with the aid of the arc.       For this purpose the tele
scope is moved into such a position that the rays less refrangible
than the red potassium-line shall occupy the field of view ;
the zero of the vernier is then made to coincide with the nearest
convenient degree marked on the arc. The rod r is then firmly
grasped and the index A brought down to a horizontal posi
tion, and a fine dot made on the plate under the point by
means of a pen dipped in “black japan.”           This point is taken
as the zero of the scale.       Each half-degree is marked off in
a similar manner until the semicircle is graduated.          The two
                                                        and the opal
       g.
scales are  again    compared   at different    points,
glass plate removed; each large division, corresponding to
half a          is then subdivided into 10° equal parts.      Finally
the semicircle is numbered from zero       up  to 200: each division
of the scale therefore corresponds to 3' of the arc g.         In my
spectroscope the angular motion of the observing-telescope is
magnified 25 times, and the width of each division of the glass
scale is 2% millimetres, so that the readings are easily made
in a feeble light without straining the eyes of the observer.

positions of the more important lines of the elements whose
spectra are easily obtained with the aid of the Bunsen flame.
The symbol of the element to which a particular line or band
belongs is legibly written under the particular point of the
scale, and connected by a line with the point in question.
Identification of the bright lines observed in the spectrum of
an unknown compound is thus greatly facilitated.
         I
      may be permitted to add that the measuring-apparatus
described has been fitted to the spectroscope used in the College
Laboratory by Messrs. Yeates and Son of this city, whom I
have to thank for the care and skill with which they carried
out the details of construction.

         WHEN
            able on    which to experiment, the measure of con
ductivity by any dia-calorimetric method becomes difficult; and
accordingly observers have contented themselves, in the case of
the rarer crystalline bodies, with comparing their conductivities
in different directions by Sénarmont’s or some similar method.
 If the substance is sufficiently plentiful to be obtained in slabs
(like rocks), then some modification of Fourier's “thermo
mêtre de contact” will give
                                                                 of its

     (3) When the crystal is surrounded with cotton-wool or felt,

so that M = 0.  In this case the left-hand member of the above

 necessity of seeking a cause for gravitation.               To do so                                           is,

 that the particles producing gravity in the visible universe
 converge towards it in streams from ultramundane space. On
 the contrary, we assume that the matter producing gravity
 within the confines of the visible universe is as a whole at
 rest; or we regard the medium producing gravity simply as
 a gas. This gas differs from an ordinary gas only in the mul
 tiplicity of       particles, their excessive minuteness, and (con

Possibly this might account for (or at least throw some light
upon) the extraordinary varied behaviour of chemical
nity.” If this were justified, it would certainly be a remarkably
simple cause.     It is just possible that a thing may be missed
sometimes   by  looking   too deep.   The processes of nature are
as a rule recognized to be simple, this being the necessary
condition for order.      “Simplicity is the soul of mechanics.”
This  view,  if well founded,  would have the advantage of cor
relating all molecular actions (including “gravity”) under
one cause.     We have thought it just as well to mention these
views in  passing   (without attaching the same definiteness to
them as we attach to gravitation).
   15. We would in conclusion make a few remarks upon a
matter of principle connected with this subject.        It must be
evident that under a dynamical theory of gravitation, when a
mass is lifted, the energy expended in lifting cannot be con
verted into “potential" energy, but must be converted into
kinetic energy, in imparting motion to the particles impinging
upon the upper side of the mass, and which tend to urge it
downwards.       Conversely, when the mass falls, kinetic energy
is transferred from the particles of the medium to the mass.
As a general principle, therefore, by the abandonment of the
theory of “action at a distance,” there can be no such entity
as “potential" energy at all. We cannot avoid thinking that
the very necessity to put forward a theory, that energy can
possess, as it were, a double nature (kinetic, and not kinetic),
in order to harmonize with the theory of “action at a distance,”
is by itself a sufficient logical condemnation of this latter
 theory. The idea of “potential” energy                    energy  (i.    e.     an
 which  is  not kinetic) involves the inconceivable idea                              of     an
energy without motion,      i.   kind

that this term “potential” energy could still be used in a certain
sense, even after the theory of action at a distance had been
                                                                                º
abandoned. We think it can be clearly shown that this is not
legitimate.     For, by the rejection of the theory of “action at
a distance,”   external matter or a medium (in a state of motion)
must be concerned in developing motion in matter; and
therefore it must be a case of kinetic energy, not “potential"
energy.     Either (for example) the motion of                  of two
masses (or molecules) is developed (as supposed) without the
concurrence of external matter, or (secondly) this motion is
simply transferred to the masses from external matter.               In
this latter case (which represents the case where the theory of
“action at a distance" is rejected) the energy exchanged can
only be the energy of motion (kinetic energy), not, therefore,
“potential" energy.         It might, perhaps, be urged that even
when the theory of “action at a distance ’’ is rejected, a raised
mass can still be said to have “potential" energy (due to                                                       its
position), because      can fall.

On this hypothesis, consequently, the proportionality-factor of
Joule's law of heat-evolution is equal to the reciprocal value
of J. Supposing that this assumption, the whole of the me
chanical work consumed by the stationary galvanic current
appears in the form of heat, is correct, we have a new definition
for the absolute resistance of a conductor —The absolute re
sistance (measured according to any system) of a conductor
is equal to the mechanical value of the amount of heat which
is generated in the conductor in the unit of time by the con
stant galvanic current 1 (measured according to the same
system of measurement).      And a new method for the experi
mental determination of the absolute resistance of a conductor:-
Measure the amount of heat, Q, which in the time z is gene
rated by the constant current i measured in absolute measure ;
then the absolute value of the resistance (measured in the
same system of measurement in which i is measured) is

    It cannot be maintained that the correctness of the hypo
thesis, “in the stationary galvanic current the entire work of
the current is converted into heat,” is so far above             doubt                     all

                    Calometric Absolute Measurements.                129
development cannot be unhesitatingly made use of for the
absolute determination of resistance.
   In order to procure the means to enable me to carry out an
entirely unexceptionable determination of the absolute value
of the S. M. U. by the heat-evolution of stationary galvanic
currents, I undertook, in a very extensive and in many ways
varied third experimental investigation, as rigorously exact a
solution as possible of the question               –In
                                          a stationary galvanic
current in which evolution of heat appears as the only action,
is the heat generated in a certain time the ea act equivalent of
the mechanical       work consumed by the current during that
time?
  In  the path of a current maintained constant, of which the
absolute intensity i was carefully measured electromagnetically,
was placed a thin platinum wire of about 15 S. M. U. resist
ance, wound in zigzag upon a numerously perforated frame
of hardgum.      Thick copper wires conducted the current to
and from the platinum wire.       The frame carrying the wire
was suspended in a water calorimeter of the thinnest sheet
copper, which was in an environment of constant temperature.
The water filling the calorimeter amounted to about 250 grams;
the water-worth of the calorimeter-vessel, the frame, and the
thermometer amounted to about 3 grams.
   The constant current with the intensity i was conducted,
during the time z, through the resistance win the calorimeter.
The mechanical work consumed by the current during this
time, within the conductor with the resistance w, was then
*wz.    On the other hand, a certain amount of heat Q was
generated in the resistance w, was given up to the calorimeter,
and was to be calculated from the rises of temperature in the
calorimeter, the water-worths of the substances filling the
calorimeter, and the losses of heat of the calorimeter by radia
tion outwards or the gain of heat by the calorimeter from
without.    The mechanical value of this amount of heat, JQ,
would necessarily, if the total work of the current were con
verted into heat, be equal to ºwz.
   On the hypotheses that the entire work of the current is
converted into heat, that the exchange of heat between the
calorimeter and      surrounding
                         its         governedis           by
                                                   Newton's law,

perature, and that the resistance      the platinum wire used

cember, 1876, a resistance of 15-068 S. M. U., or, reduced to
the temperature 16°, of 15'035 S. M. U. At the end of twelve
more experiments, in which a current of about 6 absolute
units passed through the wire each time during about 45 mi
nutes, the latter showed, on the 28th March, at the tempera
ture of 16°, the resistance 15'031 S. M. U.
   Accordingly, under the influence of continual currents of
absolute intensity from 4 to 6 the platinum wire underwent
no demonstrable alterations.    A special investigation showed
that perceptible permanent alterations in the resistances of
metallic conductors only make their appearance from a definite
current-intensity onwards.
   Without further remarks, the following are the results of
the investigation.
   Here also I varied the experiments in several ways. First,
a series of twelve observations was instituted in        a pro          ºth
portionally feeble current passed through the wire in the calo
rimeter during a proportionally long period.         From these
twelve observations the following values were obtained for the
mechanical equivalent of the unit of heat (the numbers are
 based on the ordinary measure of work; and with each is given
the external temperature t, to which the heat-unit on which the
 result is based refers):—

                                             If         account                               on

becomes    J =424:39 metre-kilograms.      The sixty friction
experiments made quite recently        Joule have given almost     by
exactly the same result, 424.67 metre-kilograms.
  Unfortunately the total result Joule's friction-experiments,

136           Prof. H. F. Weber on Electromagnetic and
J-424.50       m.—k., cannot be compared at once  with that ob
tained from the behaviour of gases, J-428-95 m.-k. The
two values are referred to quite different units: the basis of
the former is 1° of Joule's mercury thermometer; that of the
latter is 1° of the air thermometer.    These two units may pos
sibly differ 1 per cent. Perhaps, on reducing his previous
and his recent friction-experiments to the indications of the air
thermometer, Dr. Joule obtains a final result as good as iden
tical with the value of         J
                             that follows from the behaviour of
gaSeS.
    On account of this disturbing circumstance,  hold the value   I
 J–428.95, drawn from the behaviour of gases, and immedi
 ately comparable with my above result, to be the most certain
 of those given by purely thermal determinations.       Conse
quently, from the heat-evolution of stationary galvanic cur
rents there comes as good as the same mechanical equivalent
of the heat-unit as from purely thermal processes". The hy
pothesis that the entire work consumed in the stationary cur
rent-flow appears in the form of heat has verified itself.
   There still remains to say a few words on the already men
tioned determinations, carried out by Joule and Von Quintus
Icilius, of the mechanical equivalent of the heat-unit by gal
vanic heat-evolution.
   Dr. Joule carried out 45 experiments, in three seriest.
He regards as the most trustworthy result that of the last
series, comprising 30 experiments—J-429.3         m.-k.    In the
calculation of this number the  specific heat of water at 18°4
was put = 1, and it was further assumed that the British unit
of resistance in fact possesses the        asserted value         10"     (º).if

According to our results this is not quite exactly the case :
                                                                          (º)
the ratio of the British unit to Siemens's is as 1 : 0.9536, then
the absolute value of the former is = 1.001.4                 x 10"                y
    * The two results, J-428-15 (derived from the galvanic evolution of
 heat) and J-428.95 (determined from the thermal behaviour of the per
 manent gases), refer, as was expressly remarked, to two different units of
 heat: in the former the unit is that quantity which can heat the unit of
mass of water from 17°5 to 18°5; in the latter it is that which can heat
the mass-unit of water from 14° to 15°. Therefore the two results will
only then be strictly comparable, when the variation of the specific heat of
water at variable temperature is certainly known. . The experiments
which  I  have, up to the present, instituted     for
                                                fixing this hitherto totally
uncertain quantity are not yet brought        perfectly satisfactory conclu

two values  J of     the same temperature will bring about only
                    to                                                 very   a

this measurement also, Joule took for the basis the degree of
the mercury thermometer, and not that of the air thermometer,

ours impossible. Thus much may, however, be regarded as
established, that so soon as Joule's mercury thermometer does
not differ very considerably from the air thermometer, a tole

zontal component of the earth's magnetic force (which alone
might make a difference of 2 units in the value of J), that he
has not reduced the indications of the thermometer he employed
to the air thermometer (a reduction which might make a dif
ference of 4 units), and that he used in his experiments very
powerful currents and very feeble resistances (a procedure
which must necessarily have been attended with some slight
errors), no great weight will be laid upon this small difference;
the previously startling discrepancy is removed.
   It can in two ways be shown that W. Weber, as we have
maintained, found the absolute value of Jacobi's unit of resist
ance about 8 per cent. too small.
  Bosscha, in 1856*, determined according to Ohm's method the
electromotive force of a Daniell's element in absolute electro
                                                                                   *)
magnetic measure. His measurements were based on a standard
of resistance the absolute value of which, 0.607 x 10"                                      y
was obtained by comparison with the above-mentioned copy
by W. Weber of Jacobi's unit. He found the absolute elec
tromotive force of a Daniell's element, in the mean out of
several measurements,
              = 10.258      × 1010

This result is proportional to the resistance taken as the basis

Which form of Daniell's element Bosscha used, unfortunately
he does not state; but we may assume as extremely probable
that he made use of the form ordinarily employed, to which,
according to my measurements, belongs the absolute electro
motive force
                   11:30   × 1010

This value is greater, in the ratio of 1:1016 to 1:0000, than
that deduced by Bosscha. Now, supposing that Bosscha has
carried out his measurements free from error (a supposition
which of course cannot be rigorously correct), then the abso
lute value of the resistance taken by him as the basis of his
measurements, i. e. the absolute value found by W. Weber for
Jacobi's unit, would be 10:16 per cent. too little.
   This calculation of the error is based on two somewhat un
certain assumptions, briefly indicated above. On this account
it is a great advantage that an error in W. Weber's determi
nation of the absolute resistance of Jacobi's unit, in the same
direction and of the same order of magnitude, can be deduced
 in quite another way. According to W. Siemens the ratio of
 Jacobi's resistance-unit to Siemens's is = 0-6618. From our
 numerous and multifariously varied measurements the absolute
value of the Siemens unit is 0.9550             x 10"

   Quercite.—The crystallography of Quercite has been already
determined by Sénarmont (Rammelsberg's Die neuesten For
schungen in der Krystall-Chemie); but it was a matter of
interest to determine whether any difference either in habit or
angles could be found in the crystals, obtained from the new
source. The crystals were found to show the same hemimor
phous habit (fig. 1) observed by Sénarmont; and but a slight
change has been made in the elements, which may probably
be explained by the fact that the crystals obtained by Dr.
Müller were very perfect.
   The crystal is positive; the optic axes        the plane          lie      in                 of
symmetry; the mean line lies between          and    and makes                 g,
an  angle   of about 20° with the normal          the dispersion to c    g,
(inclinee) being considerable, ×p. The angles

   Jordanite.—On a crystal of blende from the Binnenthal in
the British Museum two small crystals, the one of Jordanite,
the other of Binnite, are implanted.        The former, on measure
ment, was found to be a combination of the forms {001},
 {119}, {113}, {225}, {l 12}, {110}, {013}, {02 5},
 {012}, {023}, {011}, {312}, {311}, {31 0}. Of these
the forms {225}, {02 5}, {023}, {312}, {310} are,               I be
lieve, new. The middle index in these symbols corresponds
to the brachydiagonal usually denoted by the letter y and the
parameter b. This arrangement is not to be confounded with
that of Professor vom Rath, in which b corresponds to the
makrodiagonal and a to the brachydiagonal.           The angles be

    Binnite.—This mineral has occupied the attention of several
mineralogists, a summary of whose work on it is given by
Hessenberg in his Min. Notizen, ix., where he describes a very
beautiful specimen in his possession. Kenngott, after an ex
amination of the crystals in Wiser's collection, came to the
conclusion that the mineral was hemihedral, a conclusion com
bated by von Waltershausen.            After a careful study of the
distribution of the faces on his      crystal,  Hessenberg comes to a
conclusion opposed to that of           Kenngott;    for although the
forms {1,113, {211}, {321}, {411}, and {10, 1,                #   Were
incomplete, he found that the faces of {111}, {211}, and
 {321} were present in an irregular manner.               He has made
 no remark, however, on the fact that the faces of {411} and
 {10, 1, 1} are present in adjacent octants only.
    In the examination of the specimen in the British Museum,
 especial attention was paid to the distribution of the faces of
the different forms.       It consists of two crystals united together
in   parallel positions,   or possibly of one crystal whose free de
velopment has been prevented at one point by the presence of
 some body, and has the forms {1 1 0}, {211}, {100}, {111},
  {321}, x{411}, k{611}, k{711}, k{10, 11}, and cºz 33},
 of which k{7 11} is new. The forms {110}, {211} are well
 and about equally developed; the others are subordinate. The
 number of octants which could be examined was six; so that
 the question of the hemihedrism could be more thoroughly
 tested than it was by Hessenberg, who was only able to ex
 amine four.      The forms {1 1 0}, {211} were well developed
 in  adjacent   octants,  and are therefore holohedral.      The forms

  144                     Prof.   J.   Emerson-Reynolds on the
  {411}, {611}, {711}, {10, 11}, and {233} were found in
  alternate octants only, and are consequently hemihedral. The
  faces of {321} were for the most part badly developed, and
  did not permit of any certain conclusion being drawn.     Hes
  senberg found a plane of the form in each of two adjacent
  octants which excludes a hemihedrism with inclined faces.    I
  believe      it,
             from my observations,       holohedral.   to    be

with the aid of the two         pipettes, cork,  and  tubing,   which can
be easily procured through a druggist for about 3s., a medical
man can construct his own ureometer*.
   When in use the block g is secured to the board S, on which
the beaker T stands held by the wire W.
   Mode of using the Apparatus.-The vessels A and F are
disconnected, and F filled with water until it overflows and
the excess has ceased to drip from the tube under H.                   The
cork is removed from the bottle A, and two fluid-drachms of
the liquid to be tested measured off in a tall minim-measure,
and then poured into A ; one drachm of water is next used to
rinse the liquid adhering to the sides of the measuring-glass
into the bottle A : the total volume in A therefore should
measure about three drachms f.                For a reason which will
presently appear, it is desirable that no more water than one
drachm should be employed.                                     If
                                              a pipette delivering two
drachms be used, a drachm of water should be added ; but the

                    Rapid Estimation of Urea.                          149
inches to expel 63 drachms      of water, the volume of liquid in the
bottle A   being three drachms, and the hypobromite added ten
drachms.
    It may be mentioned that measures of capacity need not be
employed in the determinations of urea, as the water expelled
may be received in any suitable vessel which has been pre
viously weighed.      At the end of the experiment the vessel and
expelled water are weighed.           When the estimation was made,
under the conditions above       named,      one grain of urea was found
to earpel, as a mean, 365 grains of water by weight.                  This
number is easily remembered, as it happens to be identical with
the number of days in a year.
    Effect of the Degree of Dilution upon the Determination of
 Urea.—An apparently trifling observation led me to examine
the effect of dilution upon the yield of nitrogen obtainable from
a constant weight of urea; and the results arrived at are stated
in the Table given below.
    The quantity of pure dry urea operated with in each of the
following experiments was 2.222 grains; and the same volume
 (i.e. ten fluid-drachms) of a single sample of freshly prepared
sodic hypobromite was added in each case.                The experiments
were    completed   within three and a half          hours;   and care was
taken to avoid changes of temperature as much as possible :
 hence, while the barometer remained steady at 30-06 inches,
 the temperature varied within such very narrow limits (be
tween 50° and 52° F.) that corrections for alterations of
volume were unnecessary, as extreme accuracy in the measures
of the water expelled was not attainable with the vessels ad
                          I
visedly employed, as desired the results to be of such a kind
as a medical man could easily obtain in his own study.

   The weight of urea taken for each experiment is capable of
affording a volume of moist nitrogen gas at the temperature
and pressure above stated, which would expel 153 drachms of
water.     The maximum volume obtained from that weight of
  ure dry urea was 154 drachms.                Thus there is a minimum
 oss of 33 per cent.           e  maximum       observed loss in the fore
going experiments amounted to 14.9 per cent, and occurred
in the experiment in which the above-named weight of urea
was dissolved in ten drachms of water. The loss within the
above limits is tolerably regular, as the volume of nitrogen is
diminished by l of a drachm (nearly) for each drachm of water
 added to the urea in the decomposition-vessel A.

  rating-vessel D, which is a long and wide glass tube placed
  within the cylinder. The glass, T-tube E is connected
  means of rubber tubing with c, while one limb passes throu    %
  the india-rubber cork of D, and the other is connected by
  another piece of rubber tubing with the fine tube of the long

 way:—Having disconnected the T-tube E from c and the clip,
 the generating-tube D is taken out of the water of the cylinder,
 the cork carrying the pipette, &c. withdrawn, and then 5 cubic
 centimetres of the urea solution introduced into the tube D.
 Before replacing the cork the pipette F is filled with hypo
 bromite solution by suction above E, while the small glass
 tube opening on the underside of the cork is closed by a
 finger; the clip is then applied. The exterior of the pipette
 is now washed with a little water, and the cork, with the a
 paratus attached, is then replaced in position, the tube
 again immersed in the water of the large cylinder, and the
 connexion between E and c securely made. Before makin
 the connexion the water in the graduated tube should stand at
 the zero of the scale; but after making the joint the pressure
     º
 within the apparatus is usually greater than that without. As
 the air in the tube D cools down to the temperature of the
 surrounding water, contraction takes place; but should the
 water not return to the zero, equilibrium is at once restored
by             the fine india-rubber tube g for a few seconds,
and then    closing in such a manner as to-

with the pipette; the reagent then falls from a considerable
height and mixes thoroughly with the liquid at the bottom of
the tube D. Nitrogen is evolved and displaces water from c,

of gas produced in the reaction then read off on the graduated

Experimental Researches in Pure, Applied, and Physical Chemistry.
    By E. FRANKLAND, Ph.D., D.C.L., F.R.S. London: John Wan
    Woorst.   1877.
     R. FRANKLAND has laid his chemical brethren                under a
       great obligation by the publication of his researches in a col
lected and classified form.    That obligation may be best repaid by
the determined efforts of other chemists to explore those fields of
knowledge which have been left untrodden by the author of the
work now before us.
    The researches of the South-Kensington Professor extend over
a period of about thirty years; they are arranged in three sections
—Pure, Applied, and Physical Chemistry.
    In the division of Pure Chemistry, Dr. Frankland has rendered
himself famous by his researches upon the Alcoholic radicals,
Organo-metallic bodies, and Synthesis of the Acids of the Lactic,
Acrylic, and Acetic series. At the time when the earlier of these
investigations appeared, the chemistry of the Carbon compounds
was in a state of confusion: many facts had been collected, but
little breath of life had been breathed into these dry bones. Lau
rent and Gerhardt had scarcely made known the results of the appli
cation of their brilliant classificatory powers to the facts of organic
 Chemistry. The theory of radicals had indeed been advanced by
Liebig and Kane; but the unscientific use of hypotheses concerning
the nature of organic compounds was yet, for the most part, domi
 nant. Berzelius and his dualistic theory were masters of the field. In
 terms of this theory, Berzelius viewed Acetic Acid as a conjugated
compound containing the groups C, H, and C, O, (old notation). It
 is worthy of remark that the exceedingly imperfect and one-sided
 theory of Berzelius, as applied in the above-cited case, should
 have furnished an idea which, when worked out by Dr. Frankland
 in his researches upon the “Conversion of Cyanogen into Oxatyl,”
 led to results of much importance in advancing the more complete
 and more probable theories of modern Chemistry. The Radical theory
 of Liebig found great support by the publication of Frankland's
 memoirs upon the “Isolation of the Alcoholic Radicals.”          In at
 tempting to isolate the radicals Methyl, Ethyl, and Amyl by the
 action of metals upon the iodides of these bodies, Frankland ob
 tained results which he then regarded, and which, judging from the
 introductory remarks in the present volume, he seems still inclined
 to regard, as proof of the actual isolation of these radicals.  Frank
 land pointed out the analogy between Hydrogen and the radicals of
 the Alcohols; and, if the molecular formula of Hydrogen be H, he

154                Notices respecting New Books.
argued that the molecular formulae of Methyl and Ethyl should be
(CH,), and (C, H.), respectively. But the hydrides of these
radicals have respectively the formulae CH, H and C, H, H:
Schorlemmer has shown that C, H, H is identical, not isomeric,
with Frankland's Methyl (CH,).         Frankland's own investigation
upon the action of Chlorine upon Methyl (?) and upon Ethylic
hydride, led him to regard these bodies as isomeric only. We
had supposed that Schorlemmer's investigations had finally settled
this point; but from what Frankland says in the present volume,
he, at least, does not appear to regard the evidence as perfectly
conclusive either way.      Had the researches upon the Isolation of
the Alcoholic radicals been productive of no other effect than to
incite other chemists to attack the problems which they enunciated,
they would have deserved the warmest thanks of every student of
chemical science.     But they did more than this: in these researches
a  great  number of new and most important facts were added to
the science ; new instruments and new methods of research were
introduced to the chemist; and new generalizations were advanced,
which have most powerfully aided in the advancement of the true
scientific study of the carbon compounds, notwithstanding that some
of them have been unable to withstand the criticism, and have
failed to completely explain the facts amassed by later investigators.
    The analogy between Frankland's Alcoholic radicals, (CH,),
 (C, H,), &c., and Hydrogen (H,) doubtless led to important
 generalizations; it may, however, it seems to us, be pushed too
 far. If the molecule be the smallest part of a body which exhibits
 the properties of that body, then (CH,), and (C, H.), may be the
 molecular formulae of methyl and ethyl respectively.      In  entering
                                                                            *
 into chemical   action, these molecules  may  be regarded as splitting
 up each into two atoms, CH, and C,         H,  just as we regard the
  molecule H, as being divided into H H before a chemical combina
 tion takes place between hydrogen and another body. But if this
 be a true hypothesis concerning the molecular and atomic consti
 tution of Methyl and Ethyl, it would almost necessitate the view
 that, after all, transmutation or something analogous thereto is
 actually a fact, because the atom (if one may speak of the atom of
 a compound) CH, combines with another atom CH, to produce
 the same compound as is formed when the atoms C, H, and H
 combine together.
    At the beginning of the volume now before us is placed a paper,
 first published some ten years ago, on Notation. We cannot but
 regard it as a mistake on the part of Dr. Frankland that in collect
 ing his researches he has maintained that peculiar notation which,
 with  its thick and thin letters, with    itssmall O's and large C's,
 has never met with favour among chemists          in general, and the
 presence    of which in   the present work must surely somewhat
 narrow the influence for good   of  these memoirs.    This notation  is
 founded     on many somewhat sweeping generalizations:       it  really,
 we think, assumes   an  amount  of  knowledge which we     do not pos
  sess; and   indoing this it  tends, we are afraid, rather      hinder
                                                                to
 than to   advance the progress  of true inquiry.

In   his paper on Notation he brings forward the unhappy example of
Ammonium Chloride as illustrative of compounds in which
Nitrogen is pentavalent: in Nitrous Oxide he says Nitrogen is
monovalent. Surely such statements as these are far too rash:
we do not know the molecular formula of sal ammoniac; and
we are much more justified in saying that nitrogen is trivalent in
nitrous oxide, than in averring, as our author does, that the same
element is trivalent in nitric oxide.      Variation in valency seems to
take place by leaps: a trivalent element may, it seems, sometimes act
as monovalent, but rarely, if ever, as a divalent element. Such facts,
 says Frankland, “can be explained by a very simple and obvious
 assumption, viz. that one or more pair of bonds belonging to one
 and the same atom of an element can unite, and, having saturated
 each other, become, as it were, latent.” We fail altogether to see
that this “simple assumption ” explains the facts in any way; it
 merely restates them.        On pp. 24, 25 there appears a most unfor
 tunate list of mineral      compounds   formulated in accordance with
 Dr. Frankland's system. The formulae there given are pleasant
 to the eye; but that is all. For the most part they really have
 no known foundation in fact.
     Section II. includes    those papers which have been contributed
 by  Dr. Frankland to      Applied  Chemistry: these papers chiefly deal
 with subjects connected with Gas and Water. The practical re
 sults of the work collected in this section are known to all.       We
 are  certainly  largely  indebted to the author of these researches for
 many improvements in our lighting and in our water-supply. The
 memoirs now collected form a good example of the benefits which
 always accrue when science is adequately applied to technical sub
 jects.    They may furnish a powerful argument to those who are
 ever   urging  Government to expend a larger portion of the nation's
 money in investigations undertaken by really qualified scientific
 men into those problems of applied science which every one
 acknowledges must be solved, but which can only be solved by
 national effort.
     The papers upon Water-analysis recall the controversy between
 the upholders of the system of Wanklyn and those of the sys
 tem of Frankland.          Such a controversy should never have oc
 curred: happily there are signs that the bitterness is dying away;
  let us hope that the action of time will be as the action of a flow
  ing river upon the subject which has engendered this hostility,
  and that before long the clamour may be remembered only as a
  dream of “previous sewage contamination.”
     In the Third Section we are presented with the papers on Phy
  sical Chemistry contributed by Dr. Frankland to science: these
  papers, for the most part, contain the record of work done or sug
 gested during holiday excursions.         “The Influence of Pressure
  upon Combustion,” the “Spectra of Gases and Vapours,” the
  “Source of Muscular Power,” and “Climate" form the main sub
  jects dealt with in this section.     The results of Dr. Frankland's
  researches in these various fields have passed into the common stock

156                        Geological Society:—
of knowledge.      Some of these results have been called in ques
tion, more particularly those concerning Flame. The recent re
searches of Heumann have, we think, shown that Frankland was
much too sweeping in many of his assertions regarding the lumi
nosity of hydrocarbon flames, and have proved that those flames do
indeed owe their luminosity to the presence of solid matter.  Never
theless Frankland's experimental work on Flame remains a monu
ment of what may be done even in the time given to recreation by
a determined and loving student of Nature.
   The papers on Muscular Power embody the results of much
accurate and exceedingly valuable work; they are of interest both
to the chemist and to the physiologist.
   The publication of these collected researches cannot but increase
the fame which their author has already earned; it cannot but aid
in the advance of scientific chemistry by setting before the student
an example of what may be accomplished by steady honest work,
and by instructing him, both by precept and example, in the path
of true scientific research. The best return which can be made to
Dr. Frankland is that every worker in the field of chemistry should
                           dº
determine that he too will prove himself not unworthy of that
study to which he has            himself.

THE1.    “On the Building-up of the White Sinter Terraces of Roto
Mahana, New Zealand.”       By the Rev. Richard Abbay, M.A., F.G.S.
  The author described the structure and mode of formation of the
so-called “White Terrace” of Roto-Mahana, which is produced by
a deposit of silica from the water of a geyser situated on the side of
a small hill of rotten rhyolitic rock, about 100 feet above the
surface of the warm lake (Roto-mahana), into which the water from
the geyser finally flows, and the foot of the siliceous terrace projects.
The geyser-basin, which is between 300 and 400 feet in circum
ference, has steep walls, broken through only on the side towards
the lake, where the water pours down to form a succession of
terraces, which are really shallow basins, over the outwardly          in
clined edges of which the water flows, depositing the dissolved silica
in a white subflocculent form on the edges and bottoms of the
basins in proportion as the water cools.        The author showed how
this arrangement   produced  the  peculiarly  formed siliceous deposit of
the  terraces, and that, as the  growth   of the latter is evidently up
wards as well as   outwards,  it seems   probable   that the geyser-pipe
                                up

   The additional facts communicated by the author show that at a

David's there is another ridge of these rocks, which also runs nearly
parallel with            it.

base   of the Cambrians, everywhere in Wales, indicate that there
were beach- and shallow-water conditions over those areas at the time,
and that the sea was then encroaching on an uneven land, becoming
gradually depressed to receive the subsequent Cambrian sediment.

              THREE EXPERIMENTS WITH TELEPHONES.
                        BY PROFESSOR E. SACHER.
   N   order to ascertain what were the feeblest induced currents in
      the telephone that would be sufficient to produce in the ear     di

stinct sensations of sound, on December 27, 1877, made the fol
lowing experiments.
   1.  I led the closed current-circuit of the telephone, at 20 metres
distance, parallel with the wire, well insulated with linen and wax,
of an ordinary telegraph-apparatus.      The signals were given at first
by six, and afterwards by three Smee's elements (ºn H, SO.); and
they were, through the induced currents in the telephone, so dis
tinctly audible that the message (by the two signals, long and
short) could be understood.
   2.  I effected a division of the current by uncovering two places
in the insulated wire distant from each other 20 metres, and fixing
there the ends of a telephone-wire of equal strength and 120 metres
long.    Reckoning, in addition, the thin wires in the interior of the
telephone, certainly only a small portion of the current went
through it; and yet the rap was perceived with sufficient distinct
ness for the message this time also to be understood.      (Hence it is
easy to tap the messages of any open telegraph-line if one can learn
to read the Morse alphabet by hearing.)
   Experiment 1 succeeds also when the telegraph-wire is connected
with the thick, and the telephone-wire with the thin wire of a
Ruhmkorff.      If we wish to perceive the signals more distinctly, it
is advantageous to appropriate two telephones to the hearing; it is
then, moreover, better to close the other ear against external noises.
   3.  I connected the telephone-wire, about 40 metres long, with
the inner, thick wire of an ordinary induction-coil, and the wire,
120 metres in length, of a second telephone-system, with the outer
thin wire. To my great surprise, we could correspond both from
the first to the second telephone, and also (indeed apparently still
better) in the reverse direction, nearly as well as with the connexion
direct.                                                       I
           The words were heard still more distinctly when inserted

periment was a failure when a Ruhmkorff was employed in this
way; the sound was too faint.—Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissen

   ON   THE LIQUEFACTION OF HYDROGEN.             BY RAOUL PICTET.
                      (IN A LETTER To M. DUMAs.)
                                                Geneva, Jan. 11, 1878.
   I  have the satisfaction of  communicating   to you the result of an
experiment made on Thursday, January 10th, consisting in the

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                            159
liquefaction and solidification of hydrogen.          made use of exactlyI
the same apparatus as for the liquefaction of oxygen, employing
protoxide of nitrogen instead of carbonic acid.
    To obtain the hydrogen under pressure,                           I
                                                    employed the decom
position of formiate of potass by caustic potass.            The hydrogen
 was liberated without any trace of water, and the residue is not
 volatile—two conditions essential for the rigorous accuracy of the
 observations.      The temperature of the reaction is well defined, and
 did not rise.     The liberation of hydrogen proceeded with perfect
 regularity. The pressure reached 650 atmospheres before becoming
 stationary.      The hydrogen disengaged corresponded to 252 litres
 at zero. The cold was about — 140° (I have not yet effected the
 reduction of the measurement of the temperature).

                                                            When opened                         I
 the    stopcock,           hydrogen  issued with vehemence from the
 orifice, producing a sharp hissing sound.        The jet had a steel-blue
 colour, and was perfectly opaque for a length of about 12 centi
 metres.      At the same time a rattling was heard upon the floor like
 the noise made by hail falling upon the ground, and the hissing was
 changed into a whistling which resembled that heard when a piece
  of sodium is thrown upon water.            Almost immediately, the jet
  became    intermittent,  and shocks were felt in the cock at each issue.
     During the first stream the pressure fell from 650 atmospheres
  to 370. After closing the cock the pressure diminished gradually
  during several minutes down to 215 atmospheres; it then rose
  again slowly up to 225, at which it again became stationary.             re                         I
  opened the cock; but the jet issued in such an intermittent manner
  that it was evident hydrogen had congealed in the tube. This hy
  pothesis was demonstrated by the progressive exit of            the hydro              all
  gen when       had stopped the pumps and the production            cold.                     of
             I

     ON THE ELECTRICAL AFTERCURRENTS OF TRANSWERSELY
          MAGNETIZED IRON RODS.        BY PROF. H. STREINTZ.
    The  experiments  referred to in this paper were carried out by the
author in   conjunction  with Dr. F. Streintz.
    The phenomenon was discovered by Willari, that in a rod of iron
 or steel through which a galvanic current has passed, when agitated
after the interruption of this current, a galvanic current is again
generated the same in direction as that originally conducted through
the rod.     He subsequently investigated some properties of these
aftercurrents, and gave an explanation of the phenomenon:—namely,
 that the rod is transversely magnetized by the current; and if we
employ the notion of molecular magnets, these arrange themselves
in concentric circles around the axis of the rod.      Now, if the rod
be  agitated  after the  interruption   of the  current, the molecular
magnets obey the direction-force which tends to mingle them again
irregularly.    We can here avail ourselves of the representation of
the molecular magnets returning to the positions which they had
before the action of the current.     Now, in this return they generate
in the rod an   induction-current,  to which Villari gives the name of
“agitation-current,” but which may with equal suitableness be
designated as an aftercurrent.
   Afterwards H. Herwig studied the properties of transverse mag
netism on iron tubes.
   The author now shows that in a very simple manner the quantity
of the magnetizing force can be calculated which is exerted upon
the molecular magnets by the current originally conducted through
the rod.     Starting from Biot and Savart's theorem, that a recti
lineal current of infinite length acts upon a pole of a magnet with
a force inversely proportional to the perpendicular distance of the
pole from the conductor, the problem is reduced to one of the
plane; so that we have to calculate the action of a circular surface
with uniform mass (the rods investigated had a circular cross sec
tion) upon a mass-point situated in the surface.
   In accordance with the laws of force previously stated, however,
a circular line with uniform mass exerts no action on a point
situated in the enclosed surface, while it acts on an external point in
the same plane as if the mass of the circle were collected in the centre.
   Now by this the calculation becomes very simple, and we obtain,
as the force which is exerted upon a magnetic pole situated at the
distance    r from the axis,   p=., in which k is a constant,   and a the
semidiameter of the rod. The total moment upon          all
                                                         the molecular
magnets contained      inthe rod    then R=Kla, where
                                      is                      K,
                                                               again,  is
a constant, and denotes the length
                  l                         of
                                           the rod.
   The author has also investigated by experiment the properties       of
the aftercurrents; and      in   so

could  be foreseen from the theoretical developments, and also dis

              to carry forward the magneto-optic inquiry which
       formed the subject of my last communication         this                               to

                     proceeded to examine a lateral face of an                                       in
     tensely magnetized iron bar as a reflector, and had the pleasure
    of obtaining good effects in the first trial.        have lately    I
       erformed a series of careful experiments on the subject; and
     } propose to give an account of these and of their very inter
     esting results in the present paper.                  I
                                                mean to describe the
    experiments at sufficient length, for the guidance of any one
    who would like to repeat them. Most of them are,            think,                    I
    rather easier and more satisfactory than those described in my
    former paper.
        1. Apparatus.-The electromagnet is the same upright horse
    shoe that was used in my former experiments, a small but
    effective instrument constructed by Mr. Ladd.          Each coil
    contains about 200 turns of thick double wire.      The coils are
    put into circuit, through a good Ruhmkorff's commutator,
    with a series of six Grove's elements, the connexions being
    made in the usual way as for magnetization of the horseshoe.
        The reflecting bar is a rectangular prism of soft iron, 7
     inches long, 2 wide, § thick.         e iron was selected and
    specially forged; and            its

   When the incidence is between grazing and principal, 90°
to 85°, and the two Nicols are initially at pure extinction, any
very small rotation of the first Nicol may be neutralized per
fectly, or very nearly, in the polariscope, by a small rotation
of the second Nicol, provided the two rotations are both right
handed or both left-handed, and properly related to each other
in magnitude; but if the two rotations are one right-handed
and the other left-handed, the effect of one in the polariscope
is strengthened by the other ab initio.
   When the incidence is between principal and normal, 65°
to 30°, and the two Nicols are initially at pure extinction, any
very small rotation of the first Nicol may be similarly neutra
lized by a small rotation of the second Nicol, provided the
rotations are one right-handed and the other left-handed ; but
if the rotations are both right-handed or both left-handed, the
effect of one is strengthened by the other ab initio.
   When the incidence is about 75°, and the two Nicols are
initially at pure extinction, no small rotation of the first Nicol
                                               of its

  by compression left hand down. By a contrary strain with
  the same hand down in each of these cases, or by a similar
  strain with the other hand down, the effect of rotation of the
  first Nicol in the polariscope is very clearly strengthened ab
 initio. These observations with the slip of strained glass were
 described and explained in my former paper.             It may be re
 membered that a      right-handed   rotation of the first Nicol was
 there compensated by tension right hand down, and not, as
          i.
 here, by compression right hand down.            The reason of this
 difference is  obvious, the  plane of reflection being there vertical,
 but here horizontal.      I  proceed  now to the observations with
the magnetized mirror and the two Nicols, placed always as
 in the             (2).
     6. First   Experiment.—The      plane of polarization of the
light incident upon the mirror is constantly parallel to the
plane of incidence; and the initial extinction is made as pure as
p ossible.
     (1) The second Nicol is turned righthandedly through an
extremely small angle from the position of extinction; and the
 light thus restored faintly in the polariscope is watched for
changes of intensity when the reflecting bar is magnetized suc
cessively by contrary currents.
     (2) The second Nicol is turned lefthandedly through an
extremely small angle past the position of extinction; and the
optical effects of contrary magnetizing currents are observed
as in the former case.       The following is an accurate statement
of the results :—
     (1). The light restored from extinction by a very small
right-handed      displacement of the second Nicol is always
strengthened by a right-handed magnetizing current, and
always weakened by a left-handed current.
     (2) The light restored from extinction by a very small left
handed displacement of the second Nicol is always weakened
by a right-handed current, and always strengthened by a left
   anded current.
     The intensity of these optical effects of magnetization varies
very noticeably with the angle of incidence. About incidence
85° the effects are very faint, but perfectly regular and much
better than merely sensible ; about incidence 75° they are
more distinct, and very sensibly stronger; about incidences
65° and 60° they are comparatively clear and strong, a good
deal stronger than at 75°; about incidence 45° they are still
pretty strong, but very sensibly fainter than at 60°; about
incidence 30° they are again very faint, much the same as at 85°.
     Between 30° and the normal        I have made very few obser
vations, and these not satisfactory; between 85° and 90°              I

166             Dr.   J.   Kerr      on Reflection     of Polarized Light
have obtained no sure effect, nothing that could be recovered
with certainty; but within the preceding range of incidence,
85° to 30°,           I
                   have always recovered the effects easily, and
always in the forms now stated.
    The right-handed current conspires with (or strengthens the
effect of) a right-handed rotation of the second Nicol, and so
forward consistently, the optical effect of the current being
reversed by reversal of the current, and also by reversal of                              ro
tation of the second Nicol.
    7. Returning for a moment to the method of observation,
                                                                   .
suppose the second Nicol turned righthandedly                through a
                i.
small   angle  from extinction.
    (1) Only right-handed currents are applied, the circuit
being closed and broken at intervals.                     the circuit is
closed, the light is strengthened in the polariscope ; when the
circuit is            the light is weakened.
    (2) Only left-handed currents are applied. . When the
circuit is closed, the light is weakened; when the circuit is
broken, the light is strengthened.
    (3) Contrary currents are transmitted in succession, the
reversal being made by a rapid half-turn of the commutator.
In this case, the passage from left-handed current to right
handed strengthens the light in the polariscope, and the con
trary passage from right-handed current to left-handed weakens
the light.
   T.    magnetic changes of the bar in (3) are more than twice
as   great  as those in (1) or (2), because of the imperfect de
magnetization of the bar at the instant of break. It is observed
accordingly in the experiment, that the optical changes in (3)
are far superior to those in (1) and (2), generally much more
than twice as strong.        Sometimes, indeed, about the extreme
 incidence 85° or      30°, and when circumstances are unfavour

        Second Experiment.—The         plane       polarization

             incidence.      All the other arrangements, and the
 observations, are precisely                as
                                        the first experiment.

second Nicol is turned through an extremely small angle from
the position of extinction, first righthandedly,        then left
handedly; and in each case the effects of the two magnetizing
currents are observed in the polariscope.
    About incidence 85°, the light restored by a right-handed
rotation of the second Nicol is strengthened by a right-handed
current, and so forward, the effects being undistinguishable in
any way from those obtained in the first experiment at the
same incidence, except that (under equally favourable con
ditions) they are certainly and considerably fainter.       About
incidence 80° the effects are still of the same kind, but a good
deal fainter—so faint, indeed, that they cannot be brought out
                ...
very distinctly except under the most favourable conditions
 (the battery        the initial extinction very pure, and the dis
placement of the second Nicol extremely small).         About inci
dence 75° the    regular effects disappear.   About incidence 70°
they reappear very faintly, as faintly as at 80°, but quite dis
tinctly contrary to those obtained at 80° and 85°; the light
restored by a right-handed rotation of the second Nicol is now
 weakened by a right-handed current, and strengthened by a
left-handed current, and so forward.        At incidences 65°, 60°,
 45°, 30°, the effects are of the same kind as at 70°, still con
 trary, therefore, to those obtained at 85°; about incidence 60°
 they are comparatively clear and strong, though sensibly fainter
 than those obtained in the first experiment at the same inci
 dence ; about 30° they are faint but still distinct, and clearly
 stronger than the contrary effects obtained at 85°. . It appears
 thus that, in the second experiment, the optical effects of
  magnetization fall under two distinct cases :—
     (1) Between grazing and principal incidences, the law is
 the same as in the first experiment: the right-handed current
  conspires with a right-handed rotation of the second Nicol, and
  so forward.
     (2) Between principal and normal incidences, this law is
  simply reversed : the left-handed current conspires with a
  right-handed rotation of the second Nicol, and so forward.
     9. Any details that could be given as to the methods of ob
  servation in the second experiment would be a virtual repetition
  of article (7); but  some remarks are due to the case    of prin
  cipal incidence.    In my earlier observations at and about
  incidence 75° in this experiment, I was much perplexed with
  the results. The effects of magnetization were sometimes im
  perceptible, while in other cases they were quite sensible
  though faint.    Sometimes they were similar to the effects at
   85°, and sometimes similar to the contrary effects at 60°; but
   they were more frequently of another kind ; either the right

168        Dr.   J.   Kerr   on Reflection   of Polarized Light
handed current or the left-handed, sometimes one and some
times the other, conspired feebly with each rotation of the
second Nicol, the right-handed and the left-handed in succession.
The latter effects were certainly due to slight misplacements of
the first Nicol, which impaired the purity of the initial extinc
tion.    All these irregularities disappeared in the most carefully
conducted of my later observations, where due attention was
given to two principal conditions—the assignment of a proper
value (75° exactly or nearly) to the angle of incidence, and
the purification of the initial extinction by exact adjustment
of the first Nicol. Upon the whole, the result of my observa
tions is that, in the second experiment, at and about incidence
75°, neither magnetization has any regular effect in the pola
riscope.    I have little doubt that, with higher powers, magne
tization would have a distinct optical effect, and that effect an
increase of intensity in every case; but             I
                                                    merely describe
                             I
things at present as have seen them.
    10. Third Experiment.—The two Nicols are placed initially
at pure extinction, the plane of polarization of the light inci
dent on the mirror being parallel to the plane of incidence.
The second Nicol remains fixed.
    The first Nicol is turned through an extremely small angle
 from the position of extinction, first righthandedly and then
 lefthandedly ; and in each case the effects of the two magne
tizing currents are observed in the polariscope.
    About incidence 85° the light restored by a right-handed
rotation of the first Nicol is weakened by a right-handed cur
rent, and strengthened by a left-handed current; while the
light restored by a left-handed rotation of the first Nicol is
 strengthened by a right-handed current, and weakened by a
 left-handed current. The effects are fainter than those obtained
 at the same incidence in the first experiment, but they are
 distinct and perfectly regular.           About incidence 80° the
                 hi<U+017F>
                   regular and
 effects are                          the same kind, but very faint,
                                       of
 and requiring extremely small displacements              of
                                                        the first Nicol
to   bring them out clearly.      About incidence 75° the regular
 effects disappear; and some irregular effects, which make their
 appearance here        as  the second experiment, are eliminated
                             in
 by the assignment          of
                            proper value
                             a                the angle
                                               to               of
                                                            incidence,
 and  by  exact  adjustment       of
                                 the second Nicol.
    At incidences 65°, 60°, 45°, 30°, the effects are contrary
                                                         by
                                                                     to
 those obtained        85°; the light restored
                       at                                right-handed
                                                         a
 rotation  of  the first Nicol from extinction       strengthened
                                                     is              b
a   right-handed current, and           so
                                        forward.   At incidence 60°,
  und even  at  45°, the effects are very distinct and comparatively
 strong, but always fainter than those obtained            at
                                                          the same   in

             from the Equatorial Surface of a Magnet.         169
cidences in the first experiment.     It appears thus that in the
third experiment,   as in the second, the optical effects of mag
netization fall under two cases :—
     (1) Between grazing and principal incidences the right
 handed current conspires with a left-handed rotation of the
 first Nicol, and so forward consistently.
     (2) Between principal and normal incidences, the preceding
 law is simply reversed ; the right-handed current conspires
 with a right-handed rotation of the first Nicol, and so forward.
     11. Fourth Eaperiment.—The two Nicols are placed initially
 at pure extinction, the plane of polarization of the light   in
 cident on the mirror being perpendicular to the plane of inci
 dence.     All the other arrangements and the procedure are
 as in the third experiment: the second Nicol remains fixed;
 and the first Nicol is displaced through a very small angle
 from the position of extinction, first righthandedly and then
 lefthandedly.     The results are very similar to those obtained
 in the first experiment.
    (1) The light restored by a right-handed rotation of the
 first Nicol is always weakened by a right-handed current, and
always strengthened by a left-handed current.
    (2) The light restored by a left-handed rotation of the first
Nicol is always strengthened by a right-handed current, and
always weakened by a left-handed current.
    Very near grazing incidence, between 90° and 85°, the
effects are insensible ; about incidence 8.5° they are very faint,
but regular and quite distinct ; they increase in strength quite
evidently through the incidences 80°, 75°, 70°, to somewhere
between 65° and 60°, where they are,      I think, as clear and as
strong as those obtained in the first experiment; they then
diminish gradually to incidence 30°, where they are very
 faint, but still somewhat stronger than at 85°.
    It appears thus that, in the fourth experiment, the right
handed current conspires always with a left-handed rotation of
the first Nicol.
    12. The four experiments which have been described were
repeated at several incidences with mirrors of steel.        Some
finely polished knife-blades were tried, and several masses of
other forms.      The best was a small bar-magnet of hard steel,
which had one of    its narrow faces polished
                                                    on

         those large wheels used for sword-blades).     The curva
     of of

ture     this mirror was inconsiderable; and        polish was ex
                                                      its
tremely fine. The arrangements were           as the diagram (2),
the bar being laid stably from pole  to   pole     of in
                                                  the horseshoe.
   All the old effects were recovered regularly. Only one
thing new attracted my notice, which was, the greater superi

ority of reversal to break, and even of make to break, in the
case of steel, than in the case of soft iron (7); but I do not
know how far my judgment in this matter may have been                                          in
fluenced by expectation.
   13. Synopsis of the preceding Results—two                                Laws with two
Eacceptions.
   First Law. The right-handed current conspires with a small
right-handed rotation of the analyzer from extinction; and so
forward.
   Second Law. The right-handed current conspires with a
small left handed rotation of the polarizer from extinction; and
so forward.

incident on the mirror is perpendicular to the plane of inci

    The next two     experiments    afford  interesting  verifications                         of
former results,          they show that when two actions already
                        as
known      as  conspiring actions are applied separately, their
 optical effects are similar,         rather similarly directed.

 case and downwards            the other, the form and direction
                                 in                                                             of

             from the Equatorial Surface             of a Magnet.           171
the band being fairly preserved through large displacements.
In  the next two experiments,          I
                                   make use of this movement of
the band as a mere initiation of restoration from pure extinction
in the polariscope.          I
                         call it a mere initiation of restoration,
because the band has already undergone a large displacement
over the surface of the mirror, by rotation of the second Nicol
or otherwise, before there is any sensible restoration of the re
flected image from pure extinction.
   15. Fifth Experiment.—The        plane of polarization of the
light incident on the mirror is parallel to the plane of inci
dence; and the extinction in the polariscope is made as pure as
 possible, the old place of the reflected image being covered by
 an obscure cloud or band (art. 14). The observations now to
 be described in this article and in art. 16 have been made re
                            º
peatedly at the four incidences 70°, 65°, 60°, 45°, with con
sistent and uniformly distinct results.
   (1) The two Nicols are untouched, and remain in their
initial positions of pure extinction.   A left-handed current
sends the band up            a small distance very clearly ; a
right-handed current sends the band down ; contrary currents
in rapid succession act accordingly, and give larger displace
ments  of the band (art. 7).
  (2) With open circuit, a right-handed rotation of the second
Nicol through the position of extinction sends the band down
very clearly.   Compared with observation (1), this verifies the
First Law stated in art. 13, that the right-handed current con
spires with a right-handed rotation of the second Nicol.
   (3) With open circuit, a right-handed rotation of the first
Nicol through the position of extinction sends the band down
certainly, though           i.
                       effect is not generally so good as that in
(2).   #.   results in (1) and (3) verify the exception to the
second Law stated in art. 13, as the present incidences       be          lie
tween principal and normal.

                                   art. 15.
   (1) The effects          of
                           magnetization    obtained       art. in   are  15
simply reversed.         right-handed current sends the band

very clearly   ; left-handed current sends the band down; con
                   a
trary currents     rapid succession act accordingly.

Nicol sends the band down (exactly             art. 15). This agrees
                                                as   in
with the exception        the First Law stated
                            to                             in

Nicol sends the band down (exactly             art. 15). This agrees
                                                as   in
with the Second Law (art. 13).

      The reader would have a false view of these two experi
  ments, if he thought there was any thing uncertain about the
  phenomena, any mere guess-work in the observations.                 On the
  contrary, the effects are perfectly regular, almost invariably
 very sensible, and sometimes beautifully distinct.               In one or
                            I
 two trials which conducted in favourable circumstances alon
 with several friends,               I
                              found that the movements of the band,
 whether
 second    N.produced     by   currents or by displacements of the
                    were sufficient to make a strong, correct, and
 immediate impression upon an eye quite uneducated, and
 which had been merely directed to the right point.
     I  think that any discussion of the optical phenomena here
 utilized would be quite irrelevant.

hand down is strengthened by the right-handed current, and
weakened by the left-handed current, the actions of the currents

great deal stronger.   Each of the currents acts clearly now

two other lines of experiment which have tried without effect, I
and which ought to be briefly noticed.
   (1) The mirror, as formerly, an equatorial face of a magne
tized bar, the plane of incidence perpendicular to the lines of
magnetic force, and the incidence varying from near normal
to near grazing. The arrangements were of course somewhat
different from those already described ; but they were not more
difficult, and were made with equal care; and think that the                    I
experiments were altogether as delicate as any of the preceding.
Working in this way at different times, saw no appearance                 I
of optical effect of magnetization.
    (2) The mirror an equatorial face of a magnet, the incidence
normal, and the inclination of the plane of incidence to the
lines of magnetic force varying from 0° to 90°. As the normal
incidence was obtained by the employment of a mirror of un
silvered glass, the light was a good deal weaker than formerly;
but otherwise the experiment was as delicate as any of                                              §:

                         polarization lefthandedly, with reference
to to
   the principal  section     the analyzer.   And since the right
                                              of
handed current   conspires   with the right-handed  rotation    the                            of

                    from the Equatorial Surface of a Magnet.                                          175
analyzer, it adds actually to the virtual left-handed rotation
of the reflected ray, or turns the plane of polarization left
handedly.
    (2) The right-handed current conspires with a left-handed
rotation of the first Nicol.          But we have seen in art. 5, that a
left-handed rotation of the first Nicol is neutralized (near
K.razing incidence) by a left-handed rotation of the second
         ; and from this we infer that a left-handed rotation of
the first Nicol turns the plane of polarization of the reflected
ray lefthandedly.          And since the right-handed current con
spires with a left-handed rotation of the first Nicol, it adds to
the consequent left-handed rotation of the reflected ray, or turns
the plane of polarization lefthandedly.
    Of course this proof assumes, and the conclusion implies,
that the reflected light may be considered as approximately
plane-polarized in                  all
                               the preceding instances            conspiring       of

But against this we have what appears to be fairly established
by observation as a general truth in optics, that the specific
differences of reflectors become less and less marked as inci
dence approaches grazing, until at grazing they almost en
tirely disappear.
    26.      I
           shall not make any lengthened comparison between
the effects now observed in connexion with the equatorial sur
face and those formerly obtained in the case of the polar sur
face. The two sets of results are not inconsistent, nor do they
differ materially in any way, except that the present set con
tains a larger amount of detail as to the variations of optical
effect, variations extending even to reversal.             have no doubt             I
that this   enlargement      of results is due to better means and
improved arrangements in the present series of experiments.
It  will be remembered that a submagnet, separated from the
mirror by a very narrow chink, was found indispensable in
the case of the polar surface.             In the present experiments
there is no place for such an adjunct, and the reflector is fully
exposed to view at                     all
                              incidences, which           great improve        is

ment.     The new     arrangements      are also  simpler  and more ma
nageable upon the whole, and much better adapted for delicate
and exact optical observation.

      AM about to demonstrate a theorem which has been wait
       ing proof for the last quarter of a century and upwards.
 It is the more necessary that this should be done, because the
 theorem has been supposed to lead to false conclusions, and its
 correctness has consequently been impugnedf. But, of the two
suppositions that might be made to account for the observed
discrepancy between the supposed consequences of the theorem
and ascertained facts—one that the theorem is false and the
reasoning applied to it correct, the other that the theorem is
true but that an error was committed in drawing certain de
ductions from it (to which one might add a third, of the
theorem and the reasoning upon it being both erroneous)—
the wrong alternative was chosen. An error was committed
in reasoning out certain supposed consequences of the theorem;
but the theorem itself is perfectly true, as     shall show by an     I
argument so irrefragable that it must be considered for ever
hereafter safe from all doubt or cavil.    It lies at the basis of
the investigations begun by Professor Cayley in his ‘Second
Memoir on Quantics,' which it has fallen to my lot, with no
small labour and contention of mind, to lead to a happy issue,

Binaires, Turin, 1876, at the foot of page 150 occurs the following pas

 u'il résulte   des recherches du Prof. Gordan sur les nombres des cova

   The reader is cautioned against supposing that the consequence alleged
above does result from Gordan's researches, which are indubitably correct.

D(w:         i, j)=A(w: i, j) must be satisfied from the maximum
value of w down to the value 0, which proves the great hitherto
undemonstrated fundamental theorem for a single quantic.

pile in Wheatstone's scheme was taken by a sensitive galva
nometer; that of the resistance to be measured in Wheat
stone's plan was occupied by the pile whose resistance and
electromotive force were to be measured, the single tangent
compass (R=165-7 millim.), and the other wire resistances
which were included in the resistance wi. The resistances of
the measuring-wire and the galvanometer branch had been
accurately ascertained. With the bridge open and the rest of
the circuit closed the galvanometer and the tangent-compass
indicated certain deflections. The point of connexion of the
bridge-wire with the measuring-wire was now so chosen that
the deflection of the sensitive galvanometer remained invari
able whether the bridge was open or for an instant closed. As
soon as this point was found, according to known rules, first,
the resistance wi (in S. M. U.), could be determined, which the
pile employed, the tangent-compass, and the wires belonging
to them possessed at that determinate current-intensity        in
which had been indicated      by the  tangent-compass  with the
bridge open; secondly, the electromotive force exhibited by
the pile when traversed by the current i, could be calculated
in relative measure (founded on the absolute electromagnetic
current-unit and Siemens's unit of resistance).
   After this the absolute value of the same electromotive force
was determined, by means of the amount of heat which it ge
nerated in    circuit by current maintained constant (which
               its              a                 i,

further, this result but very slightly differs from that of another
group of observers who worked according to a fourth, essen

tained that the result so found is correct.
   In instituting this last series of experiments, besides ascer
taining the absolute value of the S. M. U., I pursued also, as I
have already intimated, another aim, which, in conclusion, I
will briefly explain.
  M. Favre has repeatedly determined with the aid of the
mercury calorimeter the quantities of heat developed by the
most various electromotive forces in their circuits during the
time in which they consume equal quantities of zinc–namely,
the quantity which is chemically equivalent to the unit of mass
of hydrogen. As the result of his experiments, he found that
the ratio of those quantities of heat gives quite another value than
does the ratio of the corresponding electromotive forces when
measured galvanometrically.       Thus, according to M. Favre,
the quantities of heat which the elements of Daniell and Grove
produce in their circuits during the time within which they
consume 1 equivalent of zinc are 23993 and 46447 units.
The ratio of these numbers is 1: 1-93, while the electromotive
forces of the Daniell and Grove elements stand (according to
of all
    galvanometric measurements hitherto executed)        the ratio           in
   from      1.68
                1:   1:1-70. This result

                   heat which the constant current calls forth            i
in the circuit during the time       then, according
                                                  z,       Joule's            to
law (which we have demonstrated under section                                 III.   to     be
correct),
                                      JQ= *w:;
or,      if,   according   to   Ohm's law, we put            iwi-E,
                                      JQ=iFz.
If
a    denotes the electrochemical equivalent   zinc, the quan       of
tity      m    of
          zinc which     consumed within the element during

                                          m   = 2iz.
Therefore the total heat             Q   produced      in   the entire circuit       by   the

electromotive force E during the time that within the element
the quantity m of zinc is consuming is
 Hence, if the galvanic laws of Joule, Ohm, and Faraday are
 universally true, the quantities of heat Q, and Q, which two
 different electromotive forces E, and E, develop in their cir
 cuits during the time they consume equal quantities of zinc
 must be in ea'actly the same proportion as the electromotire
forces E1 and E. Consequently M. Farre's measurements and
 the three laws mentioned are irreconcilable with each other.
    M. Favre's results are      refuted   by the above-stated determi
 nations.    The relative values of the electromotive forces, mea
 sured by a galvanometric method, have been found to be:—

 mined    simultaneously by the heat generated in the entire

explanation of these phenomena which does not take into
account the fact that the earth and other members of the solar
system are the electrified coatings of condensers, since, although
the mutual coefficients of induction between the different
members of the solar system may be very small compared
with the capacities of long telegraph-cables, still the differ
ences of potential between the sun and the planets may
be extremely great, so that the charges in the condensers in
question may be so large that a slight change in the capacities,
produced by rotations or changes in the positions of the pla
nets, may set up in the bodies themselves electric currents of
considerable magnitude.
   We are at present engaged in the solution of the problem to
determine mathematically what is the strength of the currents
produced in the earth as it rotates under the inductive action
of the sun; and we may mention that the moderate conduc
tivity of the earth, combined with the probability of the exist
ence of an iron core, will enable us very shortly to present the
results drawn from our theory in a numerical form.           In the
meantime, however, we desire to show how it follows from
this theory that movements in the atmospheres of the earth
and sun, and especially the motions of rain-clouds, or clouds
of vapour, are connected with the phenomena of atmospheric
electricity and earth-currents.    The connexion of these latter
phenomena with earthquakes, which we dwelt on in our recent
paper on observations of atmospheric electricity, will more
suitably be taken up again in our next paper.
   When a dielectric is composed of air at different pressures,
or of a mixture of gases, our experiments (recently communi
cated to the Asiatic Society of Japan in a paper on the
Specific Inductive Capacity of Gases) showed that K, the
specific inductive capacity of the medium, is different at differ

   Also if at any place there is a distinct separation by a sur
face of one            from another, ordinary air from very
moist air for example, then the resultant force on one side of
the surface must be greater than that on the other. Thus, if
the resolved part of the resultant force in a direction at right
angles to this surface be F in the first medium and F in the
second, and if K and K’are the specific inductive capacities,

changes may be predicted (see our paper on Observations of
Atmospheric Electricity, read before the Asiatic Society of
Japan, April 25, 1877). And we see from the above equa
tions why this should be the case, since changes in the state
of the atmosphere, whether brought about by actual motions,
or by alterations of density from cooling, or from other causes,
must produce changes in the specific inductive capacity of the
dielectric, and consequently alterations of the potential of the
earth in the neighbourhood.             Assuming dry air at 760 mil
lims. pressure and at 0°C. temperature to have a specific
 inductive capacity unity, then as we mix some aqueous vapour
 with it the specific inductive capacity increases and becomes
 larger than 1; and in addition, as some of the vapour con
 denses, we know that the globules of water, excessively small
 at the beginning, soon increase in size, so that, as the specific
 inductive capacity of water is some millions of times that of
 air, the mean specific inductive capacity of the space is im–
 mensely increased; and hence we see that the cooling of the
 atmosphere and the formation of clouds, or the approach of
 clouds, may occasion great changes in the distribution of
 atmospheric potential at any place, and consequently give rise
  to strong earth-currents. . And if the cloud has no charge of

      MY DEAR SIR,                                                        May 31, 1877.
Yo:       were kind enough to advise me, when I was in
      England, about the purchase of a large Ruhmkorff coil.
In using    it,
              have had the ordinary bichromate-of-potash cells
                I
to develop the electricity, and  course have had of suffer the                   to
inconveniences which attend the use of cell which falls off so

 just like the isobar, it has four angular points and two straight
  segments, the meaning of which is obvious when we consider the
  gradual transformation under an isothermal compression of a
  mass of water out of the state of superheated vapour, first into
  the solid and then into the liquid state of aggregation. The an
  gular point M corresponds to the passage of the vapour from
  the superheated to the saturated state; the straight segment
  MN exhibits the gradual passage from the vapour to the solid
  state of aggregation (snow-formation).           The point L. marks
  the  beginning     of melting   that only  starts under higher pres
 sure ; and the straight segment                 LK
                                            represents the gradual pas
 sage from the solid into the liquid state of aggregation.
     The isothermals of the ice-region are therefore distinguished
 from the isothermals for higher temperatures (that are repre
 sented in fig. 7 by the dotted line) by having three angular
 points N, L, K, instead of one,                     J,

 from the one       group  to the other at the isothermal which cor
 responds to a temperature higher than 0°C. by 0:00744°; and
 this isothermal must therefore be counted among those of the
 ice-region. This limiting isothermal corresponds to the tem

weight per square metre (or 133-6 atmospheres) corresponds
a lowering of the melting-point by one degree C., if the dif

band of the surface which lies between the frost-and melting
       and represents the mixture of ice and water (fig. 9),
makes a very small angle with the horizontal plane, since an
extremely small lowering of the isothermal for the melting
point corresponds to a very considerable increment of pressure.
The angle marked J in fig. 10 differs therefore only very little

        § 6.     Discontinuity on crossing the principal                            edge.
  In    general we may represent a given change of state by the
motion of a point along a definite line on the temperature
surface, and the law followed by the mass in changing state
defines the form of the path-curve.
   If  at every point of the temperature-surface the state of the
mass as well as the position of the point were defined without
ambiguity when the values of the three coordinates were given,
then might every line on the temperature-surface be consi
dered as representing a continuous change of state, since to
the passage along an infinitely small element of the path cor
responds only infinitely small variations in the magnitudes
that characterize the state of the mass.                        If
                                                the line were to cut
an    edge  of the  temperature-surface,   it might    still serve to
represent a continuous change of state even at the points of
intersection, although the law of change would in general un
dergo a sudden alteration as the edge was crossed.
    By $ 4, the principal edge represents along         whole length          its
the singular cases      exception wherein the above condition
                             of                                                                        is
not satisfied. To every given point                      of

change      of
             state can occur without   any  accompanying       change
 of coordinates.

for on expanding the (r-8)" portion of each term by the bi
nomial theorem, it has 8 as a factor in every term of the ex
pansion (of any one term in the latter formula) except the
first, which is the same power of r as occurs in the correspond
ing term of the original value of N.
    32. In obtaining the remainder to 8 of N, the formula in
art. 31 may be extended, by means of negative suffixes, into
    a  (r–8)"T"--an-(r–8)"-"+...+a;(r–8)*4-a,(r–8)
             +a;(r–8)"+a_1(r–8)T"--a_2(r–8)T"--...,
thus making it available for other numbers than whole num
bers.    In the operation for obtaining the remainder, the number
resulting from the first substitution of the digits in the formula
 is again subjected to the operation; then this last number is
 again treated in the same way, and so on, each treatment givin
 a number less than the previous one, and divisible by 8 wi
 the same remainder that N has. If this treatment be continued
 until a number less than 8 is obtained, that number is the uni
 tate of N to the base 8. This is according to the definition of
 a unitate given in the Philosophical Magazine for November
  1868, p. 346.
    33. This method of obtaining the unitate of N is general,
 and is therefore valuable. It also affords a means of compa
 ring the properties of U.N with those of N in a direct and
 satisfactory manner.
    The repetition of the process of reduction by the formula is
 peculiar to unitation; and it may be symbolized by U;"N,
 (n) being the number of times the formula is applied to a
 given determination of U, N in order that the ultimate value
 of U.N may be less than 8. This repetition has no analogy
 in the expression of a number by means of the formula N.
     The following examples illustrate the repetition of the pro
  cess of reduction:—
     I. If N=1234567,
         Ug<U+017F>  N = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6+7=28.
         U." N = 2+8 = 10.
         U."N=1+0=1.             Here (n)=3.

  duced powers of 3 be used,
     U." N =3". 1+3*. 2+3*. 3+3°.4+3*.5 +3.6+7=1636.

XXXI.         The Contact Theory of Voltaic Action.          By W. E.

        GENTLEMEN, -                   Tokio, Japan, December 14, 1877.
         HEN contributing his paper, “On the Difference of
             Potential produced by the Contact of Different Sub
stances,” to the Royal Society on May 22, 1877, Professor
Clifton, of Oxford, seemed to be quite unaware of the elaborate
series of experiments on exactly the same subject made by us
                *
in the winter of 1875, a full account of which was communi
cated in a paper on “The Contact Theory of Voltaic Action,
 Paper No.           to Professor Sir William Thomson, May 6,
 1876, who at the British-Association, Meeting at Glasgow of
 that year gave a public account of the method employed by
 us and the results we obtained, reserving our complete paper
 for the pages of the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
     If  the investigation in question had been of merely ordinary
 importance, we should not have deemed it necessary to point
 out the priority of our experiments to those of Professor
 Clifton; but when the fact is remembered (a fact not very
 evident from Professor Clifton's paper) that a series of expe
 riments such as we performed clears up the long-standing
 discrepancies between the chemical and contact explanations
 of voltaic phenomena, and so is of extremely great importance
  in the science of energy, we trust we may be pardoned for
  claiming the priority due to us. . Much of the ordinary original
 work performed in physical laboratories must, of course, be
 undertaken nearly simultaneously in different countries; and
  our great distance from Europe necessarily places us in the
  unfortunate position of being some months in time behird
  other men who publish papers in the same societies as our
  selves; but in this particular case the work was not of an
  ordinary kind, and we have not to ask for the indulgence of
  scientific men in making allowance for our residence in Japan,
  seeing that, first, our paper reached England exactly one year
  before Professor Clifton's communication was made to the
   Royal Society, and, secondly, Sir W. Thomson was so kind
  as to give an account of our method and results to the
   British Association several months before Professor Clifton
   appears to have commenced his earliest experiments on the
   subject.
      The method of experimenting employed by this gentleman
  is essentially   the same as that used by ourselves, with this im

220       Professors   W. E. Ayrton and     J. Perry on the
portant difference, that whereas Professor Clifton only removes
the plates of a condenser from a distance a apart to a distance
b apart, we removed them to an infinite distance apart, and
then put them in such a position that the original charge to be
measured was doubled ; so that in fact our method was by far
the most delicate, and was only limited in sensibility by the
natural imperfections of mechanism.            All this was clearly
shown in the carefully executed drawing that accompanied our
paper. The advantages we derived from the superior delicacy
of our apparatus are seen if we examine, as may easily be
done, the two papers paragraph by paragraph; for the metals
and liquids employed by Professor Clifton being the same as
 those used by ourselves, in every case that he in 1877 was
only able to detect the difference of potentials, we in 1876
published not only the sign but also the numerical value of
the difference in question (compare pages 301 to 305 of his
paper in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 182, with
 our paper).     Considering, too, that the quantities of electricity
 to be measured are so small, and consequently the slightest
 loss of electricity is so serious, we fail to see what benefit was
 derived from using six insulating stems instead of only the
two carefully protected rods of our apparatus.
    We observe that Professor Clifton assumes throughout his
 paper the “summation law of electromotive force,” and that he
was compelled to make such assumptions in consequence of
his inability to measure directly with his apparatus the differ
 ence of potentials between two liquids in contact.       But if this
be assumed, then we might have employed in our research the
 method of measuring the difference of potential of two liquids
 in contact that we have often, as early as 1874, employed as
 a lecture-illustration to indicate this difference.    This method
 consisted in attaching to the terminals of a quadrant-electro
 meter two platinum wires, of which the ends were respectively
 dipping into two liquids separated by a porous diaphragm;
 but to make any use of the observations obtained from such an
 experiment, it must be assumed that the observed deflection
 of the electrometer represents the algebraic sum of the three
 contact differences of potentials such as might be measured
 separately. At first sight, not to assume this might appear to
 be a refinement of caution on our part; but in reality it was
 imperative to prove experimentally that this assumption was
 true when it was taken in connexion with the statements ge
 nerally made by the supporters of Thomson's theory of con
 tact.   For example, Professor Fleeming Jenkin says, on p. 44
 of his ‘Electricity   and Magnetism’:—“When a single metal is
placed in contact with an electrolyte, a definite difference of

                         Contact Theory             of Voltaic Action.                                 221
potentials is produced between the liquid and the metal.                                                   If
zinc is plunged in water the zinc becomes negative, the water
positive. Copper plunged in water also becomes negative, but
much less so than zinc.                       If
                                        two metals be plunged in water
(as copper and zinc), the copper, the zinc, and the water form
ing a galvanic cell,           all
                             remain                 at
                                            one potential, and          charge                  no
is  observed      any
                   in   part      theofsystem.”      Consequently          1875                  in
we discarded our original proposed method                     experimenting,    of
which was         to
                  use         an
                            apparatus somewhat similar                that em              to

             Professor    Clifton,         far     as            as
                                                    we can understand                                      it
without drawing; and                     we
                                   constructed the apparatus described
in  our paper, which enabled                       us
                                              measure any single contact

have been since     devoting     much attention.          But we even went
further; for we found that even when the circuit was closed
directly after immersion, there was first               rise     difference

tentials to reach its maximum value; but it would be more
valuable if it gave in addition the time-rise of the difference.
We confess, however, that it is only with exceptional cells
that we have succeeded in getting on different occasions ex
actly the same results with the same combination.                                    Such a
table as we suggest, which would be a great improvement on
that given by Professor Clifton, could of course be constructed
by any one possessing an electrometer without employing any
special apparatus.
   In conclusion we notice, page 299, that Professor Clifton
sees the necessity of changing his apparatus, which could not
measure directly the difference of potential between two liquids
in contact, before he can obtain satisfactory measures of the
difference of potential in certain important cases. We may
mention that although the apparatus employed by us in our
investigation described in our paper of 1876 enabled us to do
this with considerable accuracy, still we thought it advisable,
 in the summer of that year, to construct a new apparatus, the
 accurate results obtainable with which will form the subject
 of our next paper on this subject.

Photographed Spectra. One Hundred and Thirty-six Photographs of
  Metallic, Gaseous, and other Spectra, printed by the Permanent
  Autotype Process. By J. RAND CAPRON, F.R.A.S. London: E. and
  F. Spon.
THE37 work  before us is a handsome octavo volume, consisting of
      plates of permanent photographs and 80 pages descriptive
of the Plates. There are about 85 photographs of metallic spectra,
and 50 of spectra of gases.
    The metallic spectra extend mostly from H to a little beyond F,
the red end of the spectra of course not being recorded by the pho
tographic process. They were obtained with a direct-vision spec
troscope with one compound prism of 5 prisms, and are thus spectra
of small dispersion, the interval F to G occupying about 13 inch in
the photographs.       The author remarks that his results “are not
intended to be      placed  by the side of photographs of spectra of
larger dispersion taken for comparison of the metals, study of the
solar spectrum, &c.; but they may perhaps prove useful to amateurs
and others working with spectroscopes of small dispersion, for
comparison of spectra in their general aspect, and for study of the
points and peculiarities attaching to most spectra which are gene
rally brought out in our prints.”                                -
    The spectra of the metals were    partly obtained from the  spark
between points of the metal, and partly from ignition of pieces of
the metal in the electric arc given by 40 pint Grove's cells.
    The former series includes Arsenic, Aluminium, Antimony, Bis
muth, Barium, Calcium, Cadmium, Copper, Indium, Iron, Lead,
Magnesium, Mercury, Nickel, Palladium, Selenium, Silver, Stron
tium, Tellurium, Thallium, Titanium, Tin, Zinc, Zirconium. The
 spectra obtained from the voltaic arc (the more interesting series)
are those of Aluminium, Antimony, Bismuth, Beryllium, Boron,
 Cadmium, Chromium, Cobalt, Copper, Didymium, Erbium, Gold,
Indium, Iridium, Iron, Lead, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybde
num, Nickel, Niobium, Palladium, Platinum, Rhodium, Ruthenium,
Silver, Thallium, Titanium, Tin, Tungsten, Uranium, Vanadium,
Yttrium, Zinc, Zirconium.
    Mr. Capron has earned the thanks of spectroscopists for the
large amount of useful work which he has performed for them, in
 the way of preliminary investigation.     No exact scale or measure
ments accompany the photographs; and they will be chiefly useful
 in indicating by comparison with each other the lines which belong
 to particular metals, and the conditions under which particular lines
 are produced.     In the investigation of the spectrum of any sub
 stance, it is a great saving of time to begin with small dispersion,
 and afterwards to apply higher powers when it becomes an object
 to determine exactly the wave-length of particular lines.
  But although no exact measurements are given, and although the

  The advantages of the photographic method are noticed by the
author as follows:—“Absolute truth is everything in spectroscopic
work;         and the very best draughtsman                           working with the most      per
fect micrometer cannot, even at the expense of a vast amount of
labour, equal in accuracy a good photograph of a set of spectral
lines.” Of course the photographic plate cannot miss or make mis
takes in lines actually presented to it; and Mr. Capron's work, as
already remarked, is very useful as preliminary; but the accuracy
obtainable by measurement of his photographs is not as great as the
author supposes. Indeed a greater degree of accuracy is attained
by eye-measurements with a good micrometer.       For measurement
of the photographs, the reviewer has employed a photographic re
duction (on glass) of a millimetre-scale having about 5 divisions to
a millimetre. For example, the wave-lengths of the Aluminium
lines obtained from an interpolation-curve drawn from the air-lines
gave 5047, 4660, 4528, 4510, and 4476; Thalén has for the same
lines 5056, 4662, 4529, 4511, and 4476. And similar reductions
of the iron-lines in the selenium-spark gave 4416, 4383, 4407,
4323, 4304, 4268, 4257, 4248, 4148,407.2, 4066, and 4048, where
Thalén has 4415,4383, 4404, 4325, 4307, 4271, 4260, 4251, 4143,

    Still very respectable results maybe obtained by careful measure
ment of these  photographs.
   There are several points of interest suggested by a study of these
“photographed spectra,”—why, for example, some lines of par
ticular metals are plainly marked, while others are absent. For                                      in
stance, in the Lead spark-spectrum the line 4058 is sharp and
bright, while there is no trace of the brighter line 4167.
   The photographs obtained from the electric light are particularly
interesting. This         far is,we know, the first extensive series
                                    as              as

the two bodies, the enunciation of which is eloquently treated by
our author; and no less interestingly is the maintenance of these
mighty forces presented to the reader in the chapter on Meteors
and Comets, which strongly reminds us of Haidinger's theory of
the                          system from the aggregation of “cosmical
     formation of the Solar
dust.”
   In treating of the special object of his work, the author calls
attention to the division of the orbs of the Solar system into two
classes, those of the minor and major planets, those nearer and
those further from the Sun; and he finds that among the nearer
orbs the conditions of life obtain to the greatest extent, while among
the four larger planets the conditions which he is able to detect are
incompatible with life such as we find on our own planetary abode—
but rather that the two which are most open to our scrutiny have
formerly borne, and may still to a certain extent bear, the relation
of suns to the systems of moons circulating around them, which he
considers may in           all
                      probability        constituted  be   sosustain life             as   to

                 considers are situated among the lucid stars—the two
classes, with the Nebulae, constituting one great system, the outer
boundaries       which our most powerful telescopes are quite unable

A   Treatise on the Stability of a given State of Motion, particularly
    steady Motion ; being the Essay to which the Adams Prize was
    adjudged in 1877, in the University of Cambridge. By E.    RouTH,                                 J.
    M.A., F.R.S., &c.     London: Macmillan and Co., 1877.       (Syo.
    Pp. 108).
    The question, to which this Essay is an answer, was proposed in
the following words:–“The Examiners give notice that the fol
lowing is the subject of the Prize to be adjudged in 1877: The
 Criterion of Dynamical Stability. To illustrate the meaning of the
question, imagine a particle to slide down inside a smooth inclined
cylinder along the lowest generating line, or to slide down outside
along the highest generating line.         In the former case a slight
derangement of the motion would merely cause the particle to
oscillate about the generating line, while in the latter case the
particle would depart from the generating line altogether.            The
motion in the former case would be, in the sense of the question,
stable, in the latter unstable.     The criterion of the stability of the
equilibrium of a system          that   is is,           its
                                           potential energy should                                                   be

                                                                                                           be is

    In  very brief outline Mr. Routh's answer         the question              to                                 is     as

 solving the equation, it can be determined whether the real roots
 and the real parts of the imaginary roots be negative.
    When the question has been treated thus far, a number of sub
 sidiary points come under notice: e.g. in the case in which the
 system has a force-function, the equation f(m)=0 contains only
 even powers of m. This case also presents several points for discus
 sion, such as the difference between oscillations about a position of
 equilibrium, and about a position of steady motion. Amongst other
points which come up for discussion we will instance one more, to
which a separate chapter is devoted, viz. the question under what
circumstances it is necessary to examine the terms of the second
order in order to assure ourselves of the stability of the motion;
for it is possible that some of these may have their periods so timed
that their effects accumulate until the character of the motion is
changed.
    It is well known that, though it was intended to be given every

that on the occasion of Mr. Routh's Essay the award was made for
only the fifth time since the year 1848. This is a fact which
renders any praise of ours superfluous.

 THE3.       “On some Precambrian (Dimetian and Pebidian) Rocks
 in Caernarvonshire.”      By Henry Hicks, Esq., F.G.S.
     In this  paper the author gave an account of the special examina
 tion of the    great ribs of so-called intrusive felspathic and quartz
 porphyries which are found associated with the Cambrian rocks in
 Caernarvonshire, made by him in company with Prof. Hughes, Mr.
 Hudleston, and Mr. Homfray last summer. He described sections
  at and near Moel Tryfan and across the mass from Pen-y-groes to
 Talysarn, in which he showed that instead of being of an intrusive
 nature, as hitherto supposed, the whole, with the exception of a few
  dykes at those parts, is made up of bedded voicanic rocks, lavas,
 breccias, &c., similar to those found in the Pebidian series at St.
 David's, and that the Cambrian rocks, instead of being intruded by
  this mass, rest everywhere upon it unconformably, and the pebbles
 in the conglomerate of the Cambrian at the base are, as at St.
  David's, identical with, and must have been derived from the rocks
 below.     Similar results were obtained in the examination to the
 north and south of Llyn Padarn ; and the conclusion, therefore, at
 which the author has arrived with regard to the great mass which

232                       Geological Society:—
extends from Llanellyfine in the south to St. Ann's chapel in the
north is that it is entirely Precambrian, and that it belongs to the
series described by him under the name Pebidian at St. David's.
   The other mass, extending from Caernarvon to Bangor, he con
sidered also entirely Precambrian; and from the mineral characters
exhibited by a portion of this mass directly behind Caernarvon, he
thought it would prove to be, at least at this part, of Dimetian age.
 The altered beds near Bangor and their associated quartz felsites he
 considered entirely of Pebidian age, as there is no evidence that the
 Dimetian rocks are exposed there.
    4. “On the Precambrian Rocks of Bangor.” By Prof. T. M. Kenny
 Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
    The author described a series of slates, agglomerates, and por
 phyritic rocks which, near Bangor, are seen to pass under the Cam
 brian and seem to rest conformably upon the quartz felsites and
 granitoid rocks of Caernarvon.       He thought that the Bangor beds
 were the   equivalents  of the felsitic and porphyritic series of Llyn
 Padarn; and, in order to bring his interpretation into harmony with
 the observations of Prof. Ramsay, he explained away the apparent
 melting of the ends of the Cambrian beds in that section by twists,
 faults, and dykes.     He referred the apparent unconformity recorded
 by Mr. Maw entirely to rock-structure, produced by cleavage on beds
 of different texture.
    He considered that in the main the Bangor      beds were the equi
valents of the Pebidian of Dr. Hicks, while the Caernarvon beds
 nearly represented his Dimetian.       But he thought there was as yet
 no proof of an unconformity between these formations.        He would
 explain the apparent unconformity at St. David's by a continuation
 of bends and faults and joints mistaken for bedding, and would refer
the brecciated rock of Low Moor, near St. David's, to the Pebidian,
 thus taking it on the wrong side of the supposed unconformity.      He
 thought that the green beds in the Dimetian were, in all the cases
where he had been able to examine them, originally dykes.
    He saw, therefore, no reason from an examination of other areas
to suspect any different explanation from that suggested by the ex
 amination of the Bangor and Caernarvon district, viz. that we have
in the Bangor and Caernarvon beds one great volcanic series, on
which the Cambrian conglomerates and grits rest with a probable
unconformability.

the rocks referred to accompanied this paper.

   4.  “The Chronological Value of the Pleistocene Deposits of
Devon.” By W. A. E. Ussher, Esq., F.G.S., of H.M. Geological
Survey.
   In  this paper the author endeavoured to work out the sequence of
events indicated by the Pleistocene deposits of Devonshire.            He
believed that during late Tertiary times subsidence extended to the
south-western counties; and to this he ascribed with some doubt
the accumulation of a patch of gravel on the north summit of the
Black Downs and of part of the old bone-breccia of Kent's Cavern.
In the Glacial period, with the increase of cold, snow accumulated on
the high lands, with formation of glaciers, which descended and
united to form a great ice-field, planing the surface of a district
composed chiefly of Cretaceous and probably Tertiary strata.           To
this   period  the author ascribed the formation of the         clay with
unworn fragments of flint and chert, and, doubtfully, part of the
clays of the Bovey valley, the clay of Petrockstow, and part of the
bone-breccia and the crystalline stalagmite of Kent's Cavern.         The
Postglacial phenomena he referred to three subperiods, in the first of
which, during a gradual amelioration of the climate and disappear
ance of the ice, large quantities of surface-water were set free,
redistributing and removing Tertiary outliers, partially destroy
ing the old ice-beds and moraine rubbish, and sweeping Secondary
deposits from Palaeozoic districts.      The deposits then formed were
supposed to be the old gravel patches of Colford and Orleigh Court,
the waterworn materials on the Blackdowns and Haldon, the sands
flanking the Bovey valley, and, with doubt, the redistributed
Triassic pebble-beds of Straightway Hill, and part of the cave-earth
of Kent's Cavern. The next subperiod he regarded as one of great
fluviatile action, the land being higher than at present, though
sinking, and the meteorological conditions such as to greatly increase
the volume of the rivers.        The subsidence having continued to the
level of the  present   raised beaches, reelevation took place, producing
greater cold and more extreme seasons, and culminating in the
production of continental conditions, permitting the southward mi
gration of a temperate fauna, and the advent of one requiring
greater cold.     During this period the gravels connected with the
formation of the present valley-system, the raised beaches, and the
“Head” were produced, and, doubtfully, part of the cave-earth and
the granular stalagmite of Kent's Cavern, and the clay of Petrock
stow and Roundswell.         In the last subperiod the author considered
that a subsidence took place, during which most of the valleys were

excavated to their present depth, and forest-growth took place upon
the old marine plain. The forests were then gradually circumscribed
by the encroaching sea and diminishing rainfall, which also led to
changes in the streams; and finally the sea entombed the forests and
swamps on the coasts, and produced the present cliff-line.       The
results of this period are the submarine forests, most of the river
valley gravels, and alluvial tracts bordering the present river

     1.
By Dr. C. Le Neve Foster, B.A., F.G.S.
   The author described the mode of occurrence of the stanniferous
deposit known as the Great Flat Lode, the mines worked in which
extend for a distance of 34 miles, and furnish about one eighth of
all the tin raised in Cornwall. The mines in question are Wheal
Uny, South Carn Brea, West Wheal Basset, South and West Wheal
Frances, South Condurrow, and Wheal Grenville ; and in all the
lode dips at a much less angle than the average of Cornish veins,
the dip at Wheal Uny being only about 46° S. Throughout the
lode contains a small leader, usually only a few inches wide,
occupying the space due to the shifting of the two sides of a fissure,
and filled partly mechanically, partly chemically. Above, or below,
or on both sides of this there is a mass of stanniferous schorl rock
from 4 to 15 feet wide; this contains from 1 to 3 per cent. of
cassiterite, in little grains, or in strings or veins.   Schorl rock, very
poor in tin (locally called capel or greyback), separates the lode from
the surrounding granite or killas, but passes on one side into the
lode, and on the other into the granite or killas, so that no wall is
recognizable.     From these characters the author inferred that the
lode and the capel are merely altered rocks, the fissure now occupied
by the leader having served to bring up vapours or solutions which

quartziferous syenite; the rest are syenites; and one contains so
much plagioclase as to be almost a diorite. One of the above, near
Enderby, is seen to be distinctly intrusive in an altered slaty rock,
which the authors have no doubt belongs to the Forest series. This
discovery proves the igneous character of these rocks also, and
extends the area of the slaty series 5 miles further south than was
previously known.    A section was devoted to the faults of the Forest
region.    Here the principal fault runs along the anticlinal axis,
with a downthrow on its eastern side which diminishes from
2500 feet at the north end to 500 feet at the south end. East of this
the beds seem undisturbed; but on the west they are shattered by
many faults, whose course cannot be traced. These are most
numerous near Whitwick. The anticlinal fault is Precarboniferous.
   In conclusion, the age of the clastic and of the igneous rocks was
discussed.   The authors inclined to the opinion that the former are
of the same age as the Borrowdale series of the Lake district
(Lower Silurian), but admitted that the recent discovery of agglo
merates in the Precambrian rocks of Wales, and in the probably
Precambrian ridges of the Wrekin district, weakens the argu
ments for this correlation.    They do not think that there is any
reason for supposing them Cambrian.        If the Charnwood series
is Lower Silurian, they think it most probable that the syenites and
the Quornden granite were intruded in some part of the Old-Red
 Sandstone period, and that the later dykes were very probably
Postcarboniferous   but Pretriassic.

ON SOME MEASUREMENTS OF THE POLARIZATION OF THE LIGHT
  COMING FROM THE MOON AND FROM THE PLANET VENUS.  BY
  THE EARL OF ROSSE, F.R.S."
 NEVERAL       years ago, at the suggestion of a friend, having ex
      amined some portions of the lunar surface with a Nicol's prism
with a view to the detection of small sheets of standing water, if any
such chanced to exist,   I was led on to make a rather extended ex
amination of particular portions of the surface with the polarimeter,
under the idea that if the precise position of elongation from the
sun where the polarization of a point of the lunar surface attains a
maximum could be accurately determined, it might be possible to
obtain an approximate value of the refractive index of the material
composing that surface, and so to distinguish between material of
a vitreous nature, ejected from volcanoes, and a surface of    ice and
SnOW.
  The subject has been invested with the greater interest from
the fact that Arago, having found the maximum          ofpolarization
of the whole  of the moon's   light    to
                                      occur  at   ornear quadrature,

result from the reflecting surface being gaseous; and he appears
to think that the polarimeter        afford us some information on
the question of the existence of a lunar atmosphere”.
   During the years 1872–75 we have at intervals made a rather
extended series of measurements with the polarimeter, of which
several different forms were tried, but one differing in little from
Arago's was found the more   satisfactory.

provisional.

   Similar but less numerous measures than those on which the
above table is based  were made for Mare Imbrium, Mare Sereni
tatis, Palus Somnii, and the region between Macrobius and Proclus
and other parts.   The polarization varies with the situation and
with the nature of the surface, being in general greater on the
plains than on the more uneven parts.
   Measurements of the light of the planet Venus made between
1872, March 12 and April 6, gave a mean value for the polarization
of 0.925, of which no regular variation was perceived during the
progress of the observations, although the change of phase which
occurred during the interval was considerable.

      GLAss-ENGRAVING By ELECTRICITY.                       By      M   PLANTÉ.
  I  have previously described an experiment in which a glass tube,
through which passes a platinum wire serving as electrode to a
powerful galvanic current, was found to be instantaneously hollowed
out in a conical or tunnel-shape within a voltameter containing a
saline solution.  In other experiments, on the luminous effects pro

duced by a current of strong tension, at the contact of the positive
or negative electrode with the sides of a glass or rock-crystal vessel
moistened with a solution of sea-salt,                            I
                                           observed that the glass or
crystal was powerfully attacked at the points touched by the elec
trode, and that the concentric luminous rings formed around re
mained sometimes engraved at the surface of the glass of the volta
meter.    On employing nitrate of potash as the saline solution,
much less electric force was required, than with chloride of sodium,
to produce these effects.
   These observations led me to apply the electric current to en
grave on glass or rock-crystal. The surface of a plate of glass or
crystal is covered with a concentrated solution of nitrate of potass
by simply pouring the liquid on the plate placed horizontally on a
table or in a shallow basin.   Next, a horizontal platinum wire, con
nected with the poles of a secondary battery of from 50 to 60 ele
ments, is immersed in the layer of liquid which covers the glass,
along the edges of the plate; then, holding in his hand the other
electrode, consisting of a platinum wire enclosed, except at      ex                                 its
tremity,         insulating sheath, the operator touches the glass,

latter, a series of greys could be produced at will.
   The compound black-and-white disk was now arranged so as to
furnish by rotation a grey which was decidedly darker than the
vermilion; this grey tint was then gradually lightened till the ob
server became doubtful as to the relative luminosities of the red
and grey disks; the angle occupied by the white sector was then
measured.     Next, a grey decidedly more luminous than the vermi

mann, Franz, and others, which consisted in observing the tem
            at different points of a long bar when one end had been
  rept at a constant temperature sufficiently long for the tem
   erature of any one point of the bar to have become constant.
    ut as the substances for experimenting on became less and
less conducting, the amount of heat lost by radiation becomes
larger and larger compared with that conducted along the
bar; so that this method of experimenting fails altogether for
a non-conducting substance like stone.
     In such a case the plan usually adopted has been to measure
the amount of heat conducted through a very thin wide sheet

arrangement of such a nature as would not add to or subtract
from the heat at the centre.
    One thermoelectric junction being at the centre of the ball,
the other may be either kept at a constant temperature, in
which case the electric current will be a function of the dif
ference of temperature between the junctions, their mean
temperature, the position of the neutral point for the two
metals employed, and the slope of their thermoelectric lines;
or the other junction may be immersed in a compensating-bath,
which, by being always kept at such a temperature that there
is no current, indicates at any moment the temperature of the
centre of the ball.
    This latter, or balance, method was adopted, as it has the
following advantages: first, the range of temperature through
which the ball falls may be large, and still the galvanometer
may be made as sensitive as we please ; second, the balance
method may be employed nearly without reference to the
“thermoelectric power” of the two metals at different tem
    ratures; and, thirdly, since there is no current, no heat is
added to or subtracted from the centre of the ball thermo
electrically, so that no vitiations of the theoretical conditions
to ensure accuracy could occur except by heat-conductivity
of the thin wires. In reality, of course, as it was impossible
to cool the compensating-bath at exactly the same rate as the
                                                         j
centre of the ball, there usually was a very weak current ; but
as the junction in the bath was as often a very little hotter as
a very little colder than that in the ball, the excessively small
gains and losses of heat produced by the currents balanced
one another.
    However, our balance method was employed chiefly for the
first two reasons, and not because we feared the abstraction
of heat through thermo-electric currents.
     II. Details of the Apparatus.-In Pl. IX. fig.  1, A is a stone
ball 138 (thirteen and eight tenths) centims, in diameter, rest
 ing on three points in a metal water-bath, B, 17:5 (seventeen
 and a half) centims. high and 18.3 (eighteen and three tenths)
 centims. in diameter. This bath had a tap, R, for letting in
cold water   of constant temperature from a cistern, and    a large
 opening, O, which could be closed by a cork, for
emptying B. The bath stood in a tub, W, to catch the over
 flow, as will be described further on. At the centre of the
 stone ball there was a thermoelectric junction, C, of iron and
 copper, the wires being carefully insulated from the water and
 from one another except just at their extremities, where the
 were bound together and soldered, and immersed in a
  drop of mercury to form good thermal contact with the stone.

The cylindrical hole in the stone through which the wires were
inserted was only made just large enough to receive them; and
the possibility of water entering the hole and making contact
with the junction was prevented by the surface of the insu
lated wires being smeared over with a paste composed of white
lead, red lead, and linseed-oil, which by hardening cemented
the wires to the stone.      The copper wire passed to a key, K,
which was connected with one terminal, T, of a delicate dead
beat reflecting-galvanometer of about three quarters of an ohm
resistance, which we had constructed for measuring thermal
currents.     The other end of the iron wire was bound and sol
dered at        J
              to another copper wire, which was connected with
the other terminal, T', of the galvanometer. , DD was a copper
compensating water-bath, by means of which the thermo
electric junction         J
                       could be always kept at the same, or nearly
at the same, temperature as the other junction at the centre of
the ball. To ensure the junction                        J

                                      and hung in the water with
out touching the sides or bottom of the bath. The bath was
divided longitudinally by a perforated copper plate, QQ, to
allow of the water being kept rapidly stirred (to ensure equa
lity of temperature) without risk of the Kew standard thermo
meter S, which hung in the water, being broken.
   This bath was fitted with two taps, U, V–the one for letting
in cold water from the cistern, the other for emptying the bath.

the object of taking the mean of a number of observations
being, of course, to calibrate the scale near the zero-point with
considerable accuracy.     This determination of the sensibility
of the galvanometer was made before every experiment; and it
was usually found that one division of the scale corresponded
to rather less than one fiftieth of a degree Centigrade differ
ence of temperature between the junctions when the junctions
themselves had a temperature of about 23°C. This amount
of delicacy was really more than was absolutely necessary,
since the thermometer in the compensating-bath could only be
read to the twentieth of a degree.

the end of the           outside the limits within which small
errors in K and E may be expected.

regarding errors.
    The above observations were made very early in the inves

importance of keeping the external temperature really con
stant; and hence the values of

radius, initially heated to 69°-62 C., the temperature of the
stream of water flowing outside being carefully measured at
every instant and plotted, giving the curve a a a, fig. 2, the
scale for time in both curves being such that OX represents
fifty minutes. To obtain K and E from these curves we em

  Now, as the present investigation was designed to show the
feasibility of the experiments, and the possibility of deducing
from them the numerical values of K and E, rather than to
obtain with the greatest possible accuracy the values of K and
E for one particular Japanese stone, we have not thought it
necessary before the publication of this paper to repeat the
experiments, using greater precautions to ensure perfect uni
formity of the outside temperature by making the water-bath
larger and the stream of cold water more rapid. And although,
had we done so, any one of the above four methods would
have given results differing extremely little from the truth, still
it would have been none the less interesting to have examined,
as we have done, what method of reduction is calculated to
give the most accurate results when there is a slight variation
in the external temperature during the course of an experiment.
    Where considerable accuracy is required we should advise
the employment of the fourth method; if still greater accuracy
 is desired, then, several sets of observations having been made,
 the values of K and E should first be calculated by the fourth
 method; then, the mean of                         allhaving been
        as

nine tenths) centims. radius, and found that the fourth method,
applied to the curve of falling temperature between 1050
seconds and 2100 seconds, gave

We did not             use the earlier             part of the curve, as we were de
sirous that            all
                  terms except the first should disappear          the                                   in
calculations.     The  portion after 2100 seconds we also did not
employ,           as more difficult then

    The considerable difference between the value of E obtained
 for the ball of 5% centims. radius and for that of 61%, centims.
 radius is due, to a certain extent, to the difference in the stone
 and difference in the surface, the smaller ball being of finer grain
 and having a smoother surface. The rock from which the balls
 were turned is a fine-grained variety of stone, which is largely
 used for building-purposes         in many parts of Japan. Our

with the largest value of E which would allow us with run
ning water to keep the outside temperature approximately
constant, the radius of an experimental ball to determine the
conductivity of copper would need to be greater than 500 cen
tims., and hence impracticable; but if a more effective method
could be employed of keeping the outside temperature con
stant, then, making E, say, 0-01, the radius of the copper ball,
to give satisfactory results, ought to be between 50 and 400
centims.    It is quite evident, from such considerations, that
our method of experimenting can only be used with substances
having a heat-conductivity between 0.0003 and 0.03.
   At the commencement of our investigation we chose rather
#.
vaguely balls of 5.5 and 6-9 centims. radius, being guided only
by former experience in numerical calculations under Sir W.
            not having at the beginning of our experiments
worked out Fourier's formula, and being quite unable to obtain
either Fourier's treatise De la Chaleur, or any mathematical
assistance in Japan.

   The galvanometer-scale having been calibrated, it was found
that a deflection of one division on the scale to the right from
the zero indicated that the junction at the centre of the ball
was cooler than that in the compensating-bath by 0:022 C.
when the temperatures of the junctions was about 23°C. The
ball was then kept at 70° C. until the whole was at the same
temperature.          The hot water was then suddenly removed and

  To illustrate the mathematical results in connexion with the
cooling of a globe, given by Fourier in his treatise De la
Chaleur, we have drawn figures 6 and 7. A ball of 6-9 cen
tims. radius, having an internal conductivity 0:00590 (centim.,
second) and an emissivity 0.00252, is supposed to have been
heated          all

                           a        On considering the subject, the
process here described quickly suggested itself.              based                             It    is

   That the effect     the Transient Induced Magnetism may

venient expression will probably be, the square of the number
of vibrations made in one minute of time), by the vibration,
either of the compass-needle if very finely mounted, or by the
vibration of a needle suspended by a silk fibre, the compass
being removed during this observation.
   It is almost unnecessary to say that the apparent bearing
of the ship's    head as referred to the disturbed compass, or
rather the    bearing  of the disturbed needle as referred to the
head-and-stern line of the ship, is to be observed.
   The circle represented in the accompanying diagram, Pl. XI.
(which, in practice, ought to be made from an engraving, in
order that a separate circle may be used for each separate cor
rection of compass) is to be conceived as attached to the ship's
deck, with the line H S parallel to the ship's keel.
   Then the operation proceeds as follows:—
   The ship's head is to be placed in three different azimuthal
directions; the most favourable will be three directions which
very rudely divide the horizon into three not very unequal
azimuths.      In each direction, the magnitude of the actual
directive   force, and the bearing of the disturbed needle as re
ferred to the head-and-stern line, are to be observed.
   In the first observation, let AO represent the magnitude
and direction of the actual directive force ; in the second and
third observations, let B O and CO represent similar quanti
ties.   Take the metallic T-square represented at the bottom
of the diagram ; apply                its
                                graduated edge       the points    andto

    The actual operation of correction will be the following:—
    1. The length of the correcting magnet must be parallel to
 0 P.           If
             it is to be applied end-on, it must be in the line O P.
 If it is to be applied                 (which is preferable) draw
 the line m m through O and at right angles to O          the centre                               P:
 of the magnet must be in that line.
    2. Join PC, and if necessary produce O C to Q.             Draw
 QR parallel to PC. Then Q OR is the angle through which
 the direction of the compass-needle is to be changed by the
 application of the correcting-magnet; and the distance of that
 magnet is to be changed (always preserving            direction,                              its                      as

porate, leaving films of greater or less tenacity.        He was
unsuccessful with collodion and with albumen. A solution of
gutta-percha in bisulphide of carbon gave better results.     The
system of films upon a cubical frame of 2 centims. side was
preserved for several months, but eventually fell to powder.
 The same substance refused to form a film upon a frame of 3
centims. side.     Glass, which in the single instance of the
spherical film or bulb is so familiar, presents too many diffi
culties to be applicable for the production of the film-figures.
   Schwartz" succeeded with much ingenuity in obtaining the
anticlastic film-surface upon a skew quadrilateral frame whose
sides were 3.5 centims. long, with gelatine.
   Prof. Macht imitated the system of films developed upon a
tetrahedral frame with thin laminae of caoutchouc covering
the sides, and drawn together when the air was exhausted
from within.
   Better results have been yielded by viscous liquids which
solidify at temperatures moderately low.
   M. Rottier, of Ghent, has obtained films of considerable
dimensions with a mixture, suggested by Böttger in 1838 for
blowing bubbles, consisting of 8 parts of resin (colophony) with
1 of linseed oil, and fusing at 97°.   But the films were always
found after a few hours to have broken by contraction.
   Machi has obtained films upon a tetrahedral frame of 5 cen
tims. side dipped in fused resin.     He has also obtained films
from solutions of alkaline silicates which hardened on exposure
                                               ..
to the air.
   M. Plateaus has found a mixture of 5           of resin with 1
part of gutta-percha superior to resin alone. A system of
films upon a cubical frame of 5 centims, side, prepared by M.

fragments.
   3. The author's first experiments were made with pure
amber-coloured resin fused. The resulting films were brittle
and of irregular thickness. When 10 per cent. of turpentine
was added, the liquid was too mobile at high temperatures to
form films, and at low temperatures too stiff to form them re
gularly.
  A mixture of pure resin with Canada balsam was tried,
with good results; and a series of experiments followed, to

ascertain the best proportions.    When the mixture contained
a less proportion of balsam than 35 per cent. the films were
too brittle, and irregular in form.             If
                                        it contained more than
70  per  cent. of balsam the films did not readily harden, and
were not formed without difficulty. A mixture of 55 per cent.
of resin with 45 of balsam, which fused about 85°, gave good
films, tough on cooling, but somewhat brittle. The mixture
yielding the most satisfactory results contained 46 per cent. of
resin and 54 of balsam. This mixture is sufficiently fused at
80° to be workable, but yields the best films at 93° to 95°.
At 105° films can be obtained; and they are thinner than those
formed from the more viscid fluid at 95°. At 110° films are
still obtainable; and they frequently exhibit chromatic pheno
mena, but usually burst before hardening.
   [The specimens exhibited to the Society are made with this
mixture. They include a cubical frame of 2.5 centims. side,
and a tetrahedral frame of 31 centims. side. Larger specimens
have been obtained, however, though they generally show
some imperfection of form.         I
                                  have had a flat circular frame
 of 11 centims. diameter covered with a film of beautiful trans
parency. Brass wire appears better than iron for the frames.]
   The films made with the mixture described are remarkably
tough, and if preserved from rough handling appear to be of
indefinite durability. A number of frames holding films have
been hanging for over two months unprotected upon the wall
of the laboratory of the writer, and are still intact. Brass
wire of 0.33 millim. in diameter has been employed for the
construction of the frames. When a thicker wire is used, the
films become irregular from the longer retention of heat b
the wire, and the consequent earlier cooling of the central
portions of the films.
   As with the soap-films, so with those of resinous matter,
success depends largely upon the purity of material employed.
Dust and oily matters must be scrupulously excluded ; and
the resin should be retained at a temperature near          boiling   its
point for some time,   to purify      it   of
                                         more volatile matter, before

                                                       has not yet been definitely
settled.
    1. The discoverer says, “The chemical or catalytic action
can only be supposed to take place, with ordinary platina-foil,
at the line or water-mark where the liquid, gas, and platina
meet”f. Nevertheless he showed that water containing oxygen

                 nitrogen   in the other and no oxygen being dis
solved in the     liquid,  hydrogen    was found to appear in the
nitrogen tube), as Mr. Grove does not say that there is a cur
rent, and as the presence of a current would contradict the
conservation of energy,              I
                               am inclined to think that the effect
is due to  diffusion,   and that it would occur whether the plati
nums were    joined    or not.
   2. Mr. Justice Grove says that the phenomenon does not take
place when the nitrogen is absent and               place filled by the
                                                                     its

   4. In one experiment Mr. Grove arranged his platinum
plates, which       I
                   believe were platinized, in such a way as just
to cut the surface of the liquid in the tubes: he got a strong
current until the liquid rose above the platinum, when it be
came very weak. M. Gaugain says, and,                              I
                                                   think, rightly, that
<U+017F>º
this is due to the   greater   thickness  of liquid through which the
gas must now pass in order to get at the         platinum—when      the
                                                                       |.
            is partly exposed the film along the line of junction
  eing extremely thin.
   5. M. Gaugain made a cell in which the platinum plates
were movable, and determined, by the method of opposition,
the electromotive force when the plates were partly exposed; he
then lowered them until they were wholly                        and de
termined the electromotive force immediately.           In this experi
ment the current was only allowed to flow for a few seconds.
He found that the two determinations were the same, and
concluded that the action of the battery depends entirely upon
dissolved gas. It            is,

meter of 6917 ohms resistance. The connexion through the
galvanometer was made without previously                 the                                cir

a deflection of 1 division indicated a current of 00000000050

   If we assume that the current in the short circuit is the
same as that passing through the galvanometer, an assumption
which later experiments show to be not far from the truth, we
shall find that 8 cubic millims. of hydrogen per week would
be required to keep up this current.     Now 32 cubic millims.

partly due to the inaccuracy of the assumption just made, and
partly to the fact that some of the hydrogen combines with
oxygen that has found        its

 In     this case a good deal        of gas       seems to have been lost                    by   dif
 fusion.
    The ratio of hydrogen lost to oxygen lost in the three cases
 is 4:8, 2:1, and 1.8 respectively.                      If
                                          we assume that 1:8 is the
 ratio of the gases lost through diffusion, and that the loss of
 oxygen in the first two cases is due solely to this cause, we
 shall find that 1.79 and 11 cubic centim. of hydrogen respec
 tively still remain to be accounted for in the two cases.                                           I
 attribute this loss to local currents in the second case, and
 partly to these but chiefly to the main current in the first
 case, most of the necessary oxygen being supplied by the air
 to the liquid.
    IV.      If
             the hydrogen in a gas-couple with submerged plates
 be warmed by the hand, the current is increased ; and if it be
 cooled the current is diminished: indeed it is very sensitive
 to changes of temperature, and of pressure also ; and hence it
 is hardly possible to determine                   its
                                        strength with much accu

     n is the distance between top of plate in hydrogen-tube and
surface of liquid in that tube, in millimetres; n =0 means
that the plate cuts the surface and rises about 1 millim. above
it: the plate in the oxygen tube was always at the same              dis
tance from the surface and was wholly immersed.                  C is the
final strength of current, usually several hours after introdu
cing resistance, given in deflections of the galvanometer, each
of which is about 00000073 weber. R is the resistance in
                      v
ohms; and E is
                     1000
     In  the first place, it seems that the increase of current con
sequent on causing the platinum to cut the surface is too
slight to oblige us to assume that a new force is thereby
brought into action ; in other words, the whole of the current
in the gas-battery is due to dissolved gas.
     I tried to express the relation between n, C, and E in a        for
mula obtained theoretically.                   I
                                        In this had but little success;
                  I
but perhaps may venture briefly to indicate the results:—
Let abscissae represent depth
below surface; ordinates quan
tity of hydrogen in solution at
any level, supposed uniform.
 Imagine a tube of uniform bore
open to air at D and to hy- A                    IB        C            n
 drogen at A. Suppose B C a uniform platinum rod, or rather
an indefinite number of infinitely near equal platinum plates.
 Consider them to form equal branches of a divided circuit, and
 suppose the strength of current the same in each.
     Suppose the number of molecules of hydrogen ejected from
any layer in a given time to be proportional to the total num
ber in that layer.         Let u, be the quantity of hydrogen in a
layer at distance a from A ; then, when equilibrium is attained,
 A”u,-, is proportional to the number of molecules destroyed
 in that layer in a given time; hence it is 0 between A and B
and between C and D, but it is constant between B and C;
or the curve representing quantity of hydrogen is straight,

except between B and C, where it is conic.            I
                                                 assumed that
there is no discontinuity, and that the electromotive force is
              to the mean quantity of hydrogen in any layer
  etween B and C, or, what is the same thing, to the total
quantity between those limits, and that the current is propor
tional to the total quantity destroyed per second.
deduced the formula
                     (1 +   na)C=b–(e–H nd).E;
                                                      Hence
                                                                277
                                                                   I
where a, b, c, d are constants depending on the lengths BC,
CD, on the rate of escape of gas at D &c. The layer A was
assumed to be always saturated.     In the actual experiment the
shape of the plates was by no means regular; and even had they
been quite regular, the assumption that the whole of each ho
rizontal layer is a uniform solution is far from the truth. So
I  wrote the formula in a little more general form,
                 (1 + na)C=b+ ne—(c-i-nd).E.
If  in this we put a = 0006, b=244-5, e=–32, c=-00725,
d=-0000715, we get the last column (called “C calc.”) given
above. We should expect the last two results to be higher than
the calculated values, since no allowance has been made for
the capillary film rising round the emerging platinum.          How
ever, the formula evidently cannot hold for depths much greater
than 63, and it would become necessary to introduce terms
varying as n° &c.
   VI. From the above Table it is clear that the electromotive
force is not constant, as in ordinary voltaic cells, but rises with
the resistance. The same thing happens with ordinary gas
couples with platinized platinum.        In one case, changing the
external resistance from 46 to 10,000 only lowered the current
from 423 to 157; in another case, changing resistance from
10,000 to 190,000 lowered the current from 690 to 140.            -
   When the resistance is    suddenly    increased the  strength   of
current suddenly falls, but it rises, at first quickly and after
wards more slowly, to near            its
                                    former value.    For when the
resistance    increased the current falls
                is                           by Ohm's law; but    it

For  the current rises      by
                           Ohm's law; but the increased cur

action occurs at the junction of liquid, gas, and platinum;
for the gas at that point remains of constant density, whatever
the resistance in circuit may be.
   VII. As an example of these views, an ordinary gas element
with platinized plates was joined through a resistance of about
10 ohms, including a galvanometer.            After about 14 hour the
  alvanometer was deflected 195 divisions; and after 19 hours
the deflection was 189. The gas-element was now slanted at
an angle of 40°, the plates forming inclined planes; the cur
rent rose gradually, and after 2% hours the deflection was 235,
after 23} hours it was 221. The element was now rotated 90°,
so that the plates were vertical, but their long diameter was
still inclined at 40° to the horizon; the current rose instantly
to 265, and after 44 hours the deflection was 262.
   When the plates form inclined planes the line of junction
between liquid, gas, and platinum is not altered; but the whole
surface of the liquid is increased, and the submerged plate is
brought nearer to it; hence the current is increased.              In the
last position an increased line of junction is added, and the eur
rent is still greater.
     VIII.  The current produced by the ordinary gas elements
which   I  used was always greater when the tubes contained
but little gas than when they were full of gas, the ratio being,
in three cases, 13, 7, and 18. This is because the greater the
distance between the surface of the liquid in the tubes and the
air the purer will the solution of gas near that surface be.
Perhaps also the greater length of the plate may enable it to
        .
catch gas that would otherwise escape: the internal resistance
between the most active parts, those near the surface, would
be rather increased than diminished.

    X. On another occasion I measured the electromotive force
of wholly submerged wires in a gas-couple by connecting them
to a condenser, and afterwards discharging the condenser
through a galvanometer. The electromotive force of thick
and thin platinum wires was the same ; but this was 15 times
that of a wire of gold.      Probably in the gas-couple, as else
where, platinum exerts some specific attraction on
     XI. W. Gaugain considers the falling-off in the strength of
a gas-couple after short-circuiting to be due to the deposition
of hydrogen on the positive wire, which hydrogen is produced
by the decomposition of water by hydrogen ; and he says that
when the electromotive force of a couple fell from 152 to 30,
                           .
that of the hydrogen-wire fell 26, while an antagonistic force
of 96 was developed by the wire in oxygen". From other
experiments of                                   I
                      Gaugain, infer that the potential of each
wire was compared with that of a third wire plunged in the
liquid between the two tubes of the couple. He does not                                      di
stinctly say that the positive wire of the couple actually became
 negative to the third wire, though this may perhaps be inferred
 from the expression “antagonistic.”                             I
                                                 consider the loss of
 potential to         !.
                 due to the   liquid   near the wires becoming im
 poverished of  gas;   and even should the oxygen-wire become
 negative to the third wire, it may only show that the liquid in
 its neighbourhood contains less oxygen than that surroundin
 the third wire.    But since     little hydrogen must have foun
 of its
     way into the oxygen-tube, this

  XIII.     A  gas-couple charged with chemically prepared oxygen
 and  hydrogen      was short-circuited through galvanometer            a  123                    of
 ohms    resistance,   and   subjected      various    pressures,

 the wire   in hydrogen being 5-7 centims. below the surface                 the                  of
liquid     in   its
                  tube, and that         the wire  of     oxygen   being in 5-4
centims. below the surface. At                  pressure     a       centims.,    of   76

                                a            144 centims, the deflection

   On some Physical Points connected with the Telephone.                                       281
gradually rose in 7 hours from 12 to 26. The hydrogen-wire
being 2:1, and the oxygen wire 1.9 centim. below the surface,
     at a pressure of 76 the current is 38,
          25    22
                      40      ,,   ,,   20 after 6 hours,

                                                    32    y.º.
    Now   pressure    divided   by  current for the last three cases
gives 2, 2, 2:2 respectively; or the current is directly as the
pressure.     In the last case 73 seems to be somewhat too low ;
but this may be attributed to bubbles of oxygen, which under
the low pressure were given off in the hydrogen tube. For
the first two cases, pressure divided by current gives 5:1 and
5.5 respectively.       It is possible that at the end of the second
experiment the current was very slowly rising: the further the
wires are from the gas, the longer, of course, does it take for
equilibrium to be attained.
    In this experiment the gases were introduced by stopcocks
into the upper parts of the branches of a U-tube, the platinum
wires were sealed into the lower parts of those branches, and
the bend of the tube had a tail by which the pressure was ap
  lied; so that the gases were introduced without coming into
contact with the wires. The same instrument, being
was used in § XII., where it is called a voltameter.
                                                                                             ..i.
   If   the action of the gas-couple depends entirely on solution,
it is natural that the current should be proportional to the so
lubility of the hydrogen—that                            is,
                                               the pressure.     But
                                                                 to                                if
 there    isreally  any   antagonistic   force kept           hydrogen          up    by
attached       the positive wire, we should expect that this force
               to
would not           be
                  altered                 by
                                pressure, and       the whole current so
 could not       proportional
                    be             the pressure.
                                               to   suppose that when,I
 by increased pressure, the electromotive force becomes equal
to   the maximum polarization, further increase          pressure would     of
 not alter the current.

phenomena.     The air cannot produce sound unless it is thrown
into vibration ; and the air itself cannot be thrown into vibra

The amplitudes of vibration of the particles of the air themselves
have never been measured, though the length of a sound-wave
(a very different quantity) is accurately known. Lord Rayleigh

amplitude of the vibrations be so small they are rapid.     Now
this rate of motion is sufficient to bend in the same ratio the
lines of force cutting a b, and thereby to produce currents of

 and at a given rate, the intensity of magnetism will increase
 and decrease with the same ratio and at the same rate.
The disk c is elastic, but it is rigidly fixed at its axis;
it being of iron, it is attracted at any moment with a force
dependent upon the intensity of the magnetism of the core
n s, and being elastic, it recovers, or tends to recover,
 its normal position whenever this intensity             magnetism                     of
ceases      or
           diminishes.     Thus,     the magnetic intensity varies,
                                                     if
the force        attraction varies, and the rate
                   of                                    motion                        of             of
the disk varies       the samein way.   Hence the disk will record
exactly the variations         the currents; and
                                           of          the currents                   as

single gutta-percha wire carrying two conductors made which
      nearly fulfils the conditions and gives excellent results.
    The extreme delicacy                          of
                                the instrument has introduced                                                      a
disturbance from another     cause,  viz. leakage.   Wires     poles                                   on
are  supported      glass,    by
                           porcelain,  and earthenware   insulators;
but the best support that was ever devised          but     poor                    is          a                  in
sulator        in
            wet weather.      Currents escape over their surface
from the wire they support; and these leakage currents find

                       connected with the Telephone.              280
their way into telephonic circuits. Hence a telephone circuit
which may work well in dry fine weather will prove absolutely
unworkable in wet weather.
   Another source of trouble arises from what are technically
called “bad earths.”     It is almost impossible to make a perfect
connexion with the earth. There is always some resistance
at that point; so that if two wires terminate on the same earth
plate, the one being a working circuit and the other a telephone
circuit, some currents from the former are sure to pass through
the latter and disturb the telephone. A- return wire perfectly
cures this evil.
   There are other disturbing elements that are peculiar.
Earth-currents, which are always present in the wires, produce
a peculiar crackling noise, similar to that produced by a current
from a single fluid battery such as a Smee or a Leclanché, not
unlike the rushing of broken water. This is due to the pola
rization of the earth-plate, as the sounds produced by a battery
                                               .
current are due to the polarization of the negative plate.
When auroras are present these earth-currents become very
powerful, and the sounds are much intensified.         The effects
of thunderstorms are very peculiar: a flash of lightning, even
though so distant as to be out of sight, will produce a sound;
and if it be near enough to be onl          lightning, it produces,
                         it.
according to Dr. Channing, of Providence, a sound like the
quenching of a drop of melted metal in water, or the sound of
a distant rocket.                he says that this sound is heard
before the flash is seen, proving the existence of some induc
tive effect in the air prior to the actual discharge. The tele
phone thus becomes an admirable warning of the approach of
a thunderstorm.
   Sometimes a peculiar wailing sound is heard, which an
imaginative correspondent of mine likened to “the hun
cry of newly-hatched birds in a nest.” I am inclined to thin}.
that it is due to the swinging of the wires across the magnetic
lines of force of the earth. It is not difficult to conceive that
these vibrations        may succeed each other in the necessary
rhythmic order to produce musical tones.
   The wires are never free from sound; and every change of
temperature or of the electric condition of the atmosphere is
recorded on this delicate apparatus.
   The expansion of the iron diaphragm under the influence
of  the warm and damp breath when the telephone is first raised
to the lips preparatory to talk is very marked ; it produces a
faint rustling shiver.
   Immediately on the introduction of the instrument, great
anxiety was felt to learn          its
                              performance            on
                                             submarine cables.

A telephone   was sent to Guernsey, and Mr. Willmot went to
Dartmouth, those two places being connected by a cable 60
miles long.     Conversation was carried on, the articulation
being perfect though slightly muffled. This was a surprise;
for it was felt that the static induction of a cable, by retard                                its
ing influence, would have prevented articulation                                  up by

and attract the disk d".       Now the effect of induction is to re
tard or prolong the effect of the positive current 1; but the
motion of the disk d" has itself produced a current in the re
verse direction to the first current; and this neutralizes the
prolongation due to induction, and so helps to clear the line
for the next signal, which passes through precisely the same
process; and hence the vibrations of the second disk tend to
produce currents which diminish materially the effects of induc
tion, and so render possible conversation to distances that far
exceed anticipation.
    The extreme delicacy of Bell's apparatus has been shown in
various ways; for instance        :-

    “I  made a    pair of telephones that work with copper dia
phragms:       it is on the revolving-copper-disk         principle of
Arago.
    “I find   that a copper diaphragm may replace the iron in
Bell's. Copper must be 3, in thick. It is very low with copper
in both; but if the receiver is one of the regular kind, and the
transmitter is a copper diaphragm, you can carry on conver

the talking is loud, as      I have several dodges on it.”
   I  repeated these experiments; but the effect was so feeble as
to be scarcely distinguishable, and, although interesting from
a scientific point of view, it was of no practical value.

    The following Table shows that, in planetary aggregation,
the interference-waves   have manifested their influence most
strikingly at luminous    intervals.  The denominators are ex
ponential, indicating roots which are to be extracted, instead
of divisions which are to be made. This is a natural conse
quence of condensation in and through an elastic medium.     It
will be noticed that the first six exponential denominators are
arithmetical means between the nodal divisors in the foregoing
Table, and that the others are formed by successive denomi

   The observed values are the mean planetary vector radii, in
 units of Sun's radius.    “Wen.-Mer.” is the arithmetical mean
bctween Venus's mean distance (155) and Mercury's secular
perihelion (64). Mercury “c. o.” is the centre of spherical
oscillation (V.4) of a nebula extending to Mercury's mean
distance.

298        Mr. S. T. Preston on                the Kinetic Theory              of Gravitation.
gravity in two masses immersed in the gas within the range
of free path. For since it has been proved from the kinetic
theory that the particles of a gas adjust their motions so as to
move uniformly or equally in all directions, and since the
particles within the range of free path are moving in unbroken
streams, it follows that two masses immersed in the gas at a
distance apart within this range will (owing to the one
sheltering the other) be struck with more particles on their
remote (unsheltered) sides than on their adjacent (sheltered)
sides, so that the two masses will be urged together.      This,
therefore, fulfils Le Sage's fundamental idea without the
necessity for accepting any of his postulates. We need not
accept the scarcely realizable postulates of streams of particles
coming from indefinite distances in space (at uniform angles),
each stream moving continuously in one direction ; but we
can substitute for this the natural conception of the normal
motion of the particles of a gas within the range of free path,

                  motion, yet the general character

                                              But then a difficulty at
once   presents  itself here.    When two masses (or molecules)
are gradually approached towards each other, instead of the
tendency to approach gradually increasing up to a maximum
(as we should expect from the theory), they begin to repel at
a certain distance, and very considerable force is in general
required to overcome this first repulsion, when the masses
then unite into one. Thus two freshly cut pieces of lead may
be made to unite with some pressure, also glass, or various
metals, with more or less pressure. There is therefore a neutral
point which has to be passed, when the tendency to recede
changes into a tendency to approach.           The same thing is ex
hibited (conversely) when a substance is broken into two
parts by tension.                   If
                           pulled (nearly) up to the neutral point,
the two   parts recoil or return into their old positions.    If pulled
beyond the neutral point, the parts repel and will not return
into their old positions, i. e. they separate permanently.         The
thing, therefore, to be explained is the existence of this neutral
point,      or, other words, the repulsion that exists
                  in                                            certain                     at  a

|.      of the aether particles was contained within compact
 imits, or was, at any rate, shorter than the length of the wave
itself.   It has been proved recently, in investigations by Mr.
Johnstone Stoney in connexion with the radiometer", that a
medium constituted according to the kinetic theory has a
º
special power of propagating a pressure unequal in various
directions, or that, when a layer of the medium (such as a layer
of air) is intercepted between two surfaces whose distance
apart is a small multiple of the length of free path of the
          of air, the layer can then transmit a pressure in the
 ine perpendicular to the surfaces which is in earcess of the
transverse pressure; and thus a repulsion is produced, account
ing for the spheroidal state, the motion of the radiometer, &c.
In fact it is evident (as pointed out) that, since in a medium
constituted according to the kinetic theory the particles move
in straight lines, the particles (when the distance of the opposed

backwards and forwards repeatedly between the opposed sur
faces, the increments of energy received by the particles
accumulating by successive                  so that the particles
produce a bombardment tending to separate the two opposed
surfaces f. The increments of velocity imparted by

   t   There is another point in connexion with the motion of the particles,
which no doubt, however, has been already noticed.              Under normal con
ditions, a body vibrating opposite to another tends (as is known) to pro
duce rarefaction in the intervening medium; but in the case of a film
whose thickness is near the range of mean path of the                   icles, there
would appear to be a special cause tending greatly to reduce this effect,
and even perhaps to produce the contrary effect, viz. a condensation
(which would greatly increase the repulsion). Thus, under the increments
of velocity received, there is a tendency for the molecules of the gaseous
film to be turned round so as to move more normal to the film. Suppose,
for instance, an elastic sphere to be rebounding obliquely between two
tº:
  lanes.   Suppose increments of velocity to be given to the sphere by
          one of the planes.      Then these increments of velocity given to the
sphere will evidently make it rebound more normal to the surfaces.                 So

   5. When the two surfaces (or two molecules) are pushed
up closer to each other, then the energy of the gravific medium
directed against the remote sides of the molecules prevails
more and more, since the mutual sheltering-power of the
molecules increases in an enormously rapid ratio as contact is
neared, and so the unbalanced energy of the gravific medium
directed with full force against the remote sides of the opposed
molecules at length outweighs the action of the intercepted
aether particles, and the two molecules are propelled together
(or unite).
   6. We may allude to a few examples serving to illustrate
the application of the above principles.          Supposing we take
the common case of the ignition of a gas jet. Then when the
gas is turned on, the molecules of gas and air mingle with
each other and are known to be exchanging motion and re
bounding from each other, and yet they do not unite.                 Ac

cording to the above principles the molecules, as they approach
each other in their encounters, are kept apart by               forcible
vibrations (which the molecules are known to possess") which,
through the increments of velocity imparted to the particles
of the intervening aether, produce a repulsion in the manner
described, as soon as the molecules in their encounters have
approached nearly within range of the mean path of the aether
particles.     When a flame is applied to the jet, the rapidly
moving gaseous molecules of       Nº.    the flame consists naturally
produce a disturbance, jostling some of the molecules of the
mixture of gas and air against each other, so that the neutral
point is passed, whereby the molecules are brought into such
proximity that their mutual sheltering action causes the
gravific medium to impinge with full energy upon their re
mote sides, thus urging the molecules together (producing
combination).       The molecules are thrown into forcible vibra
tion  by   the shock of approach, and become luminous through
the  energy    of the waves thus generated by them in the sur              |
rounding aether. These vibrations of the compound molecules
after combination naturally cause the forcible rebound of any
other molecules that happen to be in their proximity, the
disturbance thus set up sufficing to effect the successive
(practically instantaneous) combination of the entire jet of
gas.     The same considerations of course apply to the practi.
cally instantaneous combination (explosion) of a mixture (in
definite proportions) of gas and air, by an initial disturbance
   * The molecules of matter in the gaseous state are known to possess,
in addition to the translatory motion peculiar to that state, a vibrato
motion, in virtue of which the molecules generate waves of regular periods
in the aether (these periods having in many cases been measured by the
spectroscope).

  Mr. S. T. Preston  on the Kinetic Theory of Gracitation.    303
produced by a flame.      In the case of solid bodies, where the
molecules are fixed or under control, a forcible pressure or
concussion may serve to bring the molecules over the neutral
point (and thus effect combination), as illustrated by the effect
of the blow struck in “percussion ” powders. It would not
appear that matter in the gaseous state could ever be exploded
by pressure (so long as the gaseous state was retained); for
the molecules of gases cannot be pressed against each other by
any amount of pressure, since, the molecules being in free trans
latory motion among themselves, the only effect of pressure
would evidently be to put a greater number of molecules into
unit of volume, without thereby causing the molecules in their
encounters to approach nearer to each other than before. The
degree of approach of the molecules (in their encounters)
depends evidently on their momentum or velocity; and this
remains the same whatever the pressure.
    7. Heat could not apparently be said to augment the energy
}.
of chemical combination, since, in general, heat is known to
         the exactly opposite effect, or to disintegrate matter.
   he part played by heat in effecting chemical combination
would seem to consist simply in producing a molecular dis
turbance, whereby unavoidably some molecules are urged to
wards each other so as to pass the outer neutral point, which
is the necessary preliminary to combination.     No doubt, when
heated elements combine, the original heat adds itself to the
work thus to be derived, as the heat cannot be destroyed,
though it cannot increase the work of combination.          Heat
may (as is known) entirely prevent chemical combination, and
even dissociate combined elements.        The action of heat in
preventing chemical combination and producing dissociation
would on the above principles consist in the fact that, when
the vibratory motion of the molecules becomes excessive, this
vibratory motion generates such a pressure in the intervening
layer of aether on the approach of the molecules as to prevent
 them from passing the neutral point : or, indeed, no neutral
point may exist, provided the pressure or repulsion thus
 generated be such as to outweigh the action of the gravific
 medium, as appears actually to take place in the dissociation
 of matter by excessive heat. Thus it would appear probable
 from this, that when combination ensues in the case of a mix
 ture of gases previously considerably heated (but not so much
 so as to produce dissociation), the molecules on combination
 do not at once settle down into that full proximity (which
 belongs to a lower temperature), but they do so gradually as
 the temperature falls.   Thus the work of combination is pro
 longed over the falling temperature, and the cooling thereby

304      Mr. S. T. Preston             on the Kinetic Theory    of Gravitation.
somewhat retarded.      Precisely the same thing is illustrated in
the aggregation   of groups   of molecules (to form masses), as in
the aggregation of single molecules to form compound
molecules.    Thus when a bar of iron is welded by heat, the
molecules  (though  aggregated or combined) do not settle down
into their final positions  of proximity until the bar cools, the
bar being observed to contract on cooling. In this instance
also the cooling of the bar is somewhat retarded by the approach
of the molecules in the act of cooling.
   8. In the case of the ignition of a solid body, the same con
siderations no doubt apply as in the case of a gas. Thus, for
example, the molecules of oxygen are impinging against the
surface of a piece of coal, but do not produce ignition.        To
effect this a certain number of the molecules must be impelled
with sufficient energy against the coal so as to carry them over
the neutral point (i.e. beyond the initial repulsion).      The
application of a flame, which consists of matter in a state of
violent agitation, suffices to effect this, and, no doubt by
loosening some of the molecules of carbon (of the coal) and
giving them translatory motion and mixing them with the air,
facilitates the process.
   9.   As a further illustration of the exact similarity of behaviour
of single molecules and groups of molecules (masses) as regards
the existence of the above-mentioned neutral point, we may
take the case of the substance iodine.    This substance gives
off a visible vapour at normal temperatures. The single
molecules of iodine composing the vapour rebound from each
other without uniting; and this can only be due to the exist
ence of the above-mentioned neutral point, outside which there
is a repulsion.              If
                      the colliding molecules were to approach
within the neutral point, they would unite and form solid
iodine. . No doubt some of the molecules of the vapour (as
their velocities are known to be very diverse) do pass beyond
the neutral point; and thus molecules of vapour striking against
the fragments of solid iodine in the bottle, will sometimes
unite with the solid iodine and form part of                   it,
                                                     while, on the

pressed together will not readily unite; i.e. the neutral point,

306    Mr. S. T. Preston on the Kinetic Theory of Gravitation.
applicationof this theory to molecules in close contact (“co
hesion ” &c.), is necessary and inevitable, and it serves to cor
relate the molecular effects generally under one cause.             The
explanation of the fundamental condition capable of producing
the recession of molecules, as above given, rests upon experi
mental facts recently established, and upon a basis for the
constitution of the aether which is the simplest conceivable.
   12. We now propose to show some independent reasons in
support of this constitution for the aether, in addition to the
argument afforded by the numerous molecular effects which
this constitution, in principle, serves to explain.            First, if
the subject be reflected on, it will be apparent that, in principle,
a movement of the component particles of the medium in
straight lines is the only possible constitution for the ultimate
medium in space.        For a particle of matter cannot move in a

 the more is simplicity indispensable, and superfluity incom
 patible with precision and certainty in the results. To assume
 a constitution for the aether that could not be realized or
 clearly explained would surely be futile, since the explanation
 or clear conception forms the logical support of any theory,
 without which the theory resembles a mere dogmatic state
 ment incapable of being sustained by reason.
     13. There is one other     point which we would notice in con
  nexion with this   subject.    The idea would appear to be to a
  certain extent  prevalent    that the aether must have a constitu
 tion essentially different from the air, because the vibrations
 producing light are transverse, while those producing sound
 are longitudinal.       It seems to be sometimes inferred from
 this that the vibrations of the aether are only transverse, and
 those of the air only longitudinal. There would be no warrant
 for this conclusion ; and we think that it has done harm and
 greatly hindered any rational idea from being formed of the
 nature of the aether. According to the kinetic theory, which
 is known to represent the constitution of the air, the vibrations
 of the particles of air disturbed by a vibrating body and pro
 pagated in the form of waves, are not only longitudinal ; for
 since according to the kinetic theory the particles of air in
 their normal state are moving equally in all directions, it
 follows that these particles are accelerated and retarded both
 in transverse and in longitudinal directions at the passage of
 waves.     It is true that the transverse component of the motion
 probably may not affect the ear, on account of                   special           its
 structure.     It  would        wrong,
                                   be    however,        infer from this to
 that the transverse component                       of
                                            the motion did not exist.
 So  in  the case    of
                      the aether,     would
                                         it        unwarranted be   infer                 to
that the longitudinal component              the motion did not exist,
                                                     of
because this component was incapable                 affecting the eye.
                                                                    of
The eye and the ear may            very differently constituted; and
                                        be
a   motion that affects the one might not affect the other. Sir

Light" (“Popular Lectures                      on

sites of those vents.         In some cases the mineral characters of the
strata have been greatly altered, while their fossils have been occa
sionally wholly obliterated by the action of these same igneous forces
 during Tertiary times.
   In every case the survival to the present day of the patches of
 Secondary rocks can be shown to be due to a combination of most
 remarkable accidents; and a study of the distribution of the frag
 ments shows that the formations to which they belong originally
 covered an area having a length of 120 miles from N. to S., and a
breadth of 50 miles from E. to W.                     But it is impossible to doubt
the former continuity of these secondary deposits of the Hebrides
with those of Sutherland to the north-east, with those of Antrim to
the south, and with those of England to the south-east.                              From the
present positions of the isolated fragments of the Mesozoic rocks,
and after a careful study of the causes to which they have owed
their escape from total removal by denudation, the author con
cludes that the greater portion of the British islands must have
once been covered with thousands of feet of secondary deposits.
Hence it appears that an enormous amount of denudation has gone
on in the Highlands during Tertiary times, and that the present
features of the area must have been, speaking geologically, of com
paratively recent production—most of them, indeed, appearing to be
referable to the Pliocene Epoch.
   The alternation of estuarine with marine conditions, which had,
on a former occasion, been proved to constitute so marked a feature
in the Jurassic deposits of the Eastern Highlands is now shown to
be almost equally striking in the Western area; and it is moreover
pointed out that the same evidence of the proximity of an old
shore-line is exhibited by the series of Cretaceous strata in the West.

deposits, now described as occurring in the Western Highlands, is

    Although no traces of the Upper Oolite or the Neocomian forma
tions have as yet been detected in the Western Highlands, yet it
is argued that when we consider how enormous has been the amount
of denudation, and how singular the accidents to which all the ex
isting relics of the Secondary period have owed their escape from
total destruction, we cannot but regard it as a most rash and
unwarrantable inference to conclude that no deposits belonging to
those periods were ever accumulated within the district under consi
deration.
    The Carboniferous strata of the Western Highlands have been
detected at but a single locality, and even there, being exposed in
 a series of shore-reefs that are only occasionally well displayed,
 can only be studied under favourable conditions of tide and wind.
 They consist of sandstones and shales with thin coaly seams; and
 their age is placed beyond question by the discovery in them of
 many well-known plants of the coal-measures, including species of
 Lepidodendron, Calamites, Sigillaria, and Stigmaria.
    The Poikilitic strata consist of conglomerates and breccias at the
 base, graduating upwards into red marls and variegated sandstone,
 which contain concretionary limestones and occasional bands of
 gypsum.      These strata have not as yet, like their equivalents in
 the Eastern Highlands (the Reptiliferous Sandstone of Elgin and
 the Stotfield rock), yielded any vertebrate remains.             They were
 evidently deposited under similar conditions with the beds of the
 same age in England, and are not improbably of lacustrine origin.
     The Jurassic series presents many features of very great interest.
 The Infralias is better developed than is perhaps the case in any
 part of the British Islands; and in the district of Applecross a series
 of estuarine beds containing thin coal-seams is found to be inter
  calated with the marine strata.
     The Lower Lias, in                      its
                                 southern exposures, presents the most
  striking agreement with the equivalent strata                England, but    in

similar to those of Antrim, but in places passing into conglomerates

unfossiliferous sandstones, in which thin coal-seams have been
detected; and these are in turn covered by strata of chalk, converted
into a siliceous rock, but still retaining in its casts of fossils (Belem

ON GALVANIC CURRENTS BETWEEN SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENT
   DEGREEs of CONCENTRATION OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE, AND
   THEIR SERIES OF TENSIONS.           BY DR. JAMES MOSER.
         electromotive force of liquid galvanic series is influenced by
THE   the concentration of the liquids.        In order to determine the
nature of this influence,            I
                              have investigated, in the laboratory of
Professor Helmholtz, liquids with which it is possible to isolate
this influence of the concentration.        All chemical processes were
to be  excluded;    therefore  only   differences of concentration might
exist or   changes   in it occur   during    the passage of the current.
Likewise, for the elimination of all chemical actions, it was neces
sary that the electrodes should consist of that metal which was
contained in the solution.                          -
   Two glasses with    differently  concentrated solutions of the same
salt were connected by a siphon; and the circuit was closed by a
metallic conduction with the electrodes just mentioned.               then                                         I
observed, in       all
                  the cases investigated, that        current arises which       a
proceeds from the more dilute        the more concentrated solution.

of this electrode in glass 2, and in 4, there was always a deflection
produced—in the one case by the electromotive force 9, between
solutions of 45 and 60 per cent., in the other by the force 13, in
the opposite direction, between 45- and 15-per-cent. solutions.

  F   was a solution containing, in 100 parts, 30 of crystallized salt
(CuSO,--5H, O). One hundred parts by volume of this solution
were mixed in E with 33}, in D with 100, in C with 300, in B with
700, in A with 2900 parts of water.
   By these currents, going from the diluted to the concentrated
solution, metal is dissolved in the diluted, and separated from the
concentrated    solution.          Only when the concentration is the                             same
in both solutions does the current cease.
   For the work accomplished by the current we should have to                                     seek
the corresponding equivalent in the work of the force of attraction
between the salt and the water, which makes itself perceptible in
the thermal actions which can be observed on mixing different solu
tions of the same salt.
   Accordingly the current observed by me must be conceived as a
reaction-current against the migration of the ions, as the polariza
tion-current is one of reaction against the decomposition-current;
for whenever any salt is electrolyzed, the solution becomes more
concentrated at the anode, more dilute at the cathode. My expe
riments show that then arises an electromotive force which acts in
opposition to that of the electrolyzing battery.—Monatsbericht   der

ality, to the success of a research of pure science. M. Thomas has
kindly had treated according to our directions 4300 kilograms of
Bensberg blende, that ore being the richest known.
  The course adopted was as follows:—
  1. The blende, pulverized, is roasted in one of the bays of a
Perret oven kept at a sufficiently high temperature by the simul
taneous combustion of pyrites in the other bays. The gallium re
mains fixed, while the greater part of the indium appears to be
volatilized.

phuric acid sufficient to dissolve nearly          the zinc, leaving never     all

with   hydrosulphuric  gas, then slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid,
gives a precipitate consisting principally of sulphide of indium".
   10. The very slightly acid liquid being boiled with a large quan
tity of water, the gallium passes again into the state of a subsalt.
   11. The gallium is isolated by electrolysis of the potassic solu
tion of the subsalt. The deposition of the metal is effected advan
tageously only under special conditions.           The intensity of the
electric current,  for example,   should  vary  according to the state of
the liquor; but the surface of the negative electrode must always
be relatively small compared with that of the positive electrode.
In one of our operations, which produced 8 grams of gallium in
twenty-four hours, 40 Bunsen elements (18 centims. in height)
arranged in eight parallel series, each comprising 5 elements in
tension, put in action a negative electrode the double surface of
which did not exceed 15 square centimetres, while the positive
electrode presented an expanse of about 450 centimetres square.
   The metal, when deposited cold, often forms long files of crystals
resembling needles, normally fixed to the electrode by one ex
tremity; some of them attained the length of 3 centims. Above 30°
the metal trickles in drops, which collect at the foot of the electrode.
   By operating in the manner above described, we collected 62 grams
of crude gallium.             If
                         account be taken of the inevitable losses, and
of some    grams  of  gallium  which still remain in our various pro
ducts, the content of the Bensberg blende may be estimated at soisa,
or nearly 16 milligrams per kilogram.         This minute proportion of
material  capable  of extraction accounts for the operations requiring
so  long a time.
   We purified the crude gallium by filtering it through linen of a
close texture, agitating it in hot water acidified by hydrochlorie
acid, and repeatedly crystallizing             it.
                                             From this we afterwards
prepared the crystals, plates, and superfused mass        gallium which of
we have the honour         presenting
                               of         the  Academy.

at the common surface of two fluids, and have measured the
capillary constant, or tension, a12, of this common surface; by
various methods.

ready mobility, in order that the condition of equilibrium may
be rapidly attained. This                          is,

   The laws established formerly" by me, relative to the surface
common to two or three fluids, may, if the foregoing consi
derations are just, be henceforth extended also to the case
where one fluid is replaced by a solid body.
    Let the three common surfaces of a solid body 1 and of two
fluids 2 and 3 intersect in a curved line; then, upon a particle
P in the intersecting line there act three forces lying in the
plane normal to the element P of the curved line of intersec
tion under consideration.       These forces are equal to the capil
lary constants or surface-tensions of the three capillary surfaces,
and are in equilibrium; consequently they fulfil the conditions
of the   equation

           1 shows the contrivance as   it is  used.  Several liquids
may at the same time form drops near one another. The un
used drops are caught by a square glass trough, upon the
upper cut edge of which a small strip of plate-glass G, is laid
to serve as a table. This table is set exactly horizontal with a
spirit-level and small wooden wedges.
    The glass plate with the drops is then placed upon a hori
zontal rectangular plate of plate-glass, near which is set a ver
tical divided circle, having a movable arm of light straw of
350 millims. length and carrying a sight of black paper.           On
rotating the apparatus, the sight, which has an aperture of 2
       *
millims. diameter, describes a vertical circle, in the centre of
                                                               -

    A luminous flame being placed at several metres distance,

                                        proportion   as the id    Sur
 face is more curved.        If the arm with the sight be turned
 forward beyond the line A R, in which the last portion of the
surface of the drop reflects the light, the little image of the
 flame suddenly disappears; and this position is read off to the
 exact minute of arc, with a vernier, upon the vertical divided
 circle. The arm bearing the sight must be turned back through
 an angle 26 in order to receive the image of the flame reflected
 from the level surface of the plate. The last-named position is
 determined once for all, and only verified as often as appears
 necessary; so that a single reading suffices to determine the
 edge-angle 6.
    The exactness of this first method admits of being easily
 further increased by the employment of a telescope; yet              I
 have found the apparatus, in the simple form described, com
 pletely adequate for my rather long-sighted eye, so long as
 values of 6 which do not exceed 40° are in question.
     For larger edge-angles, the method described has the disad
 vantage that the flame-images in the strongly-curved surface
 of the drops are very small and, especially in daylight, difficult
  to perceive.
      t is therefore more convenient to measure the edge-angle
 by a second method, with a simple goniometer of the following
  construction.

328           Prof. G. Quincke on the Edge-angle and
of 110 millims. length and 2 millims. diameter, is fastened
with cork a mirror S (of silvered glass) of 30 millims. height
and 15 millims. breadth, and upon the other side a vertical
divided circle K, of 45 millims. diameter, printed on card and
divided to whole degrees. An arm B C of the same steel wire
serves to rotate the divided circle and mirror in a hole CD
bored through a large cork which has been forced tightly onto
a vertical glass rod G, of 250 millims. length and 8 millims.
diameter. Two diametral arms of brass, MM1, which are like
wise fastened into the large cork, allow - the rotation to be read
off to 0°-1.
    That the reflecting surface S stands parallel to the axis of
rotation A A1 is verified, as in the ordinary goniometer, by
rotating through 180°.
   The mirror S must be placed horizontal and near to a larger,
straight-edged, horizontal mirror Gº, so that the images of a
horizontal window-bar parallel to A. A1 reflected in each mirror
 may coincide. . Upon the horizontal mirror G, and as near
as possible to the mirror S, is laid the fixed plate with the flat
drops whose edge-angle is to be determined.            The eye is
lowered until the reflected    image   of the sky-lit  window has
just disappeared at the curved surface of the drop ; and the
 mirror      is turned about the axis A. A1 until the upper edge
 of the bright   image of the window appears on a level with the
edge of the drop.      Then the mirror stands parallel to the last
element of the free surface of the drop, and the rotation from
the first position to the second, measured on the divided circle,
  ives directly the acute edge-angle 6 with a precision sufficient
  or the purpose in question.
    4. Influence of Height of Fall and of Impurities upon the
Edge-angle.
    The edge-angle 6 is found to be the smaller as the height h
from which the drops fall upon the plate is greater.
    For water, and a glass plate carefully cleansed with alcohol,
water, and a clean linen cloth,    I found:—
       h=0   millim.        20 millims.        130 millims.
       6=22° 34'            129 44/               7o 13'
 With another plate of the same glass plate better cleansed :—
      h =0 millim.           10 millims.        100 millims.
       6= 12°29'              90 8/                5° 54/
And two minutes later, repeating the experiment on another
spot of the same    plate:–
       6–16° 49'        |    1.4°           |     8° 41'

                Spread of Liquids on Solid Bodies.                                               329
When the glass was replaced by a silver plate (a mirror-glass
silvered by Martin's process) the values were:—
            h–0 millim.              50 millims.
            6 = 12° 49'               6° 26/
By had      must be understood a fall of the least possible height.
   If the   drop  of water is left to evaporate, or if a portion of
the water be removed by a clean thread of glass, the drop be
comes thinner and the edge-angle smaller, the surface of con
tact with the solid remaining practically unchanged.
    When with greater heights of fall the drop becomes more
flattened by striking upon the flat surface, the same mass of
fluid acquires a greater surface of contact with the solid. This
surface of contact retains                    its
                                     original dimensions, and                                    6   is
found too small.
  If   fresh fluid    added
                      is         the drop, the surface
                                       to                     contact                   of
grows more slowly than the altitude          the drop, and the edge

angle acquires the same value          with minimum height
                                                    as            fall.                      of
    The   following  measurements,    when       not expressly stated
                                                               it    is

or   of  maximum edge-angle.       The size, and the velocity with
which the falling drops follow one another, have only slight                                 a
influence upon the edge-angle. The deviations are           least not                   at
greater than are shown             by
                                similar drops upon the most homo

Should an alteration take place, it is sometimes positive, some
times negative, and seldom amounts to more than 1%. Con

spar, mica, &c.—similarly as towards glass. Here also the
edge-angle is smaller as the surface of the solid body is cleaner.
    The surface of glass is never obtained clean by rubbing it
with a clean linen cloth and with alcohol, nor by longer im
mersions in alcohol.         The best course is to treat the glass
with hot concentrated sulphuric acid, wash this off with dis
tilled water, let it                lie

    Other metals were scraped with a clean knife, and the flat

   After waiting a longer or shorter time T after the prepara

In the case of water and aqueous saline solutions the difference

           following inquiry was suggested by some observa
       tions recorded in a paper of         William Thomson's on
the Electrodynamic Qualities of Metals, in the “Philosophical
Transactions’ for 1856; and the object in view was to investi
gate the conditions under'which thermoelectric currents are
produced in a circuit composed of a single metal when one
portion   of the metallic conductor is subjected to     a strain and
the junctions of the strained and unstrained portions are main
tained at different temperatures.

                                       having been obtained from -

   Two tin cans were obtained open at the top, and pierced at
the bottom by necks into which india-rubber corks were            in
serted; and through slits in these the wires were passed.        The
wire was fastened by a clamp in the lower can, and was grasped
in the upper one by a pair of wire-drawing dogs attached to
the shorter arm of a lever, to the longer arm of which was
attached the weight by which the strain was produced.              In
the earlier experiments ordinary weights were used ; but ulti
mately these were rejected, as it was found impossible to apply
and remove them in a sufficiently gradual manner to prevent
a certain amount of shock, which introduced complications.

Physique, 4th series, vol.     201 (1867). He obtained   x.
results of the same nature as Thomson—with the notable

       Currents in Wires subjected to Mechanical Strain.      341
difference that in iron and steel wires he got a current from
strained to unstrained across the hot junction, while in copper
wire the current was from unstrained to strained across the
hot junction. On comparing the descriptions of the experi
ments, it appeared that Thomson had always made his expe
riments with comparatively small strains, while Le Roux had
strained his wires very nearly to the breaking limit. This at
once suggested a possible explanation of the apparent discre
pancy between their results; and on making the experiments,
it was found that as the strain was gradually increased the
current was increased, as in Thomson's experiments, but only
up to a certain limit. When the strain was increased beyond
this limit there was a gradual decrease in the current; and if
the strain was very carefully increased, the direction of the
current was reversed shortly before the breaking strain was
reached.
    During the experiments, it was very soon observed that after
a  weight  had been added the current did not remain constant,
but   gradually  diminished; while at the same time there were
variations of small period in the strength of the current, which
were greater when the weight was added suddenly, and scarcely
perceptible when it was very carefully and slowly added by
pouring in shot; these variations gradually ceased when the
apparatus was not disturbed.      A very gentle and gradual ad
dition of  weight  diminished these variations, which always died
away more rapidly when there was a heavy strain on the wire.
Clutching the wire in the “dogs” also set up these variations,
which were allowed to subside before beginning the experiment.
These results suggested that the production of the current
might be due to a process of change in the molecular state of
the wire; it was found, however, on examination that there
was a permanent effect which could not, as far as I can see,
be produced in that way, whatever may have caused the tem
porary effect.
    Where the results obtained at different times had not to be
compared, the current is generally given in terms of the de
flections of the galvanometer; but where such comparison was
necessary, the value of the deflections was determined at each
 experiment in terms of a standard current, obtained by send
 ing a current from a Daniell’s cell through a definite resist
ance.                                        -
    For  the sake of brevity, U.S. will be written  for “from un
 strained to strained across the hot junction;”    and the  oppo
 site direction of the current will be denoted     by S.U.    The

that already described. These experiments        {..., are not
described here) gave a general idea of the phenomena to be
looked for. The alteration of resistance from strain is not
taken into consideration, as H. Tomlinson's experiments, Proc.
Roy. Soc. 1876 (vol. xxv. p. 451), have shown that it is too
small to have an appreciable influence upon the results.

It will be observed that the current does not reach its full
strength immediately upon the application of the weight, but
rises rapidly to a maximum, and then gradually falls to a
strength at which it remains steady.

    It will be observed that the direction of the current changes
just before the wire breaks.
    Some steel wire was now taken; and as it was found almost
 impossible by the most careful annealing to get a piece of wire
 arranged in the apparatus which should give no deflection

   The effect of rapidly putting on and taking off the weight
a number   of times in succession was then tried; and it was
found that each time the weight was put on the deflection
diminished, while each time that it was taken off the deflection
was increased up to a certain limit. The immediate increase pro
duced by taking off the weight was greater than the immediate
decrease produced by putting it on ; so that on the whole there
was a large increase in the current, the deflection being got

flection barely perceptible S.U. Weight of 30 lbs. left on
about 40 hours.
    It was observed that at the time of making the experiment
the weight was making small oscillations; and this appeared
to be the cause of the deflections making small oscillations
about a mean value. At the end of an hour and a half the
oscillations of the weight and also of the deflection had ceased,
the latter remaining steady at 5, indicating a current :007
U.S. The weight was now made to perform vibrations of
small amplitude, upon which the oscillations of the deflection
were greatly increased both in number and amplitude, and
the mean deflection was at the same time somewhat increased.
 If the vibration of the weight be suddenly stopped, it is some
little time before a decrease is perceived in the oscillations of
the deflection.
    After setting the weight in gentle vibration, the effect in
 causing oscillations in the deflection was observable in less
than a minute.      If the vibrations of the weight are kept up
for some   time,  the mean deflection is increased up to a certain
limit, as before described.      If  the vibrations of the weight are
increased in amplitude, the oscillations of the deflection become
much more irregular, and the limits of variation become
greater.                                  -

         deflection 4 U.S.         On    attaching      the empty can for
 containing the shot to the end of the lever the deflection in
creased to 20 U.S., falling to 14-5.             The strain was gradually
increased   by  pouring    shot into the can until the wire broke.
The deflection changed very little until the wire began to
stretch, when the deflection fell very rapidly, passed through
zero, and went up to about 40 S.U.
    The more rapid the stretching the stronger is the current
produced. When the strain was slightly lessened, so as to stop
the stretching, the deflection fell very quickly to 20 S.U. On
removing the strain the deflection fell rapidly, passed through

 slowly.     The deflection almost instantaneously changed to
 about 2 S.U., which increased slightly until the wire broke.

XLVIII.       On Galvanic Currents occasioned by Differences of
    Concentration—Inferences from the Mechanical Theory of
    Heat. By Professor HELMHoLTz".
WE ion     will  regard as the electro-chemical equivalent of an
               that amount of it which is separated at the corre
sponding electrode, in the unit of time, by the chosen unit of
current.
   The transport-number        n, referred to the cation  (Hittorf's })
gives, as with Wiedemann, that fraction of the equivalent of
the cation in question which is carried by the unit of current,
during the unit of time, through each cross section of the cur
rent's path in the solution, to the cathode. On the other hand,
the quantity (1—n) of the anion goes in the opposite direction,

by which (1—n) of the cation at the cathode becomes free—
which, combined with the amount n of cation brought to this
side, gives the quantity 1 set free at the cathode.       In like
manner the   quantity n of the cation is conveyed away  from the
other side, by which n of the anion is set free. To this is added
(1—n) of the anion brought over. Now, when the cation is a
metal which can deposit itself on the electrode, (1—n) of the
metal disappears there from the solution, and (1—n) of the
salt-forming acid is conveyed away; consequently from there
(1—n) of the salt is removed.                             On the other side the liberated
anion combines with the metal of the electrode; and therefore
1 equivalent of new metal here enters the solution, while n of
the metal is carried away and (1–n) of the anion is brought
over.    This gives here an increase of the quantity of the salt
by (1–n) of the equivalent for the unit of time and unit of
current.    If the metal of the electrode is the same as that
which is contained in the solution, the total result of the elec
trolysis is the same as if one equivalent of metal were carried
from the anode to the cathode, and (1–m) equivalent of salt
in    the solution from the cathode to the anode.
      If,
       then, the salt-solution     more concentrated
                                                 is        the cathode             at

of the same kind of metal and filled with a solution of that
metal, there is brought about a transfer of the salt in the elec

 differently concentrated portions of the solution could be re
 duced to a minimum by inserting narrow connecting tubes,
 without altering the electromotive force of the apparatus, which
 we wish to calculate.
    We can, on account of this, neglect these two irreversible
                        .#.
 processes, and apply Carnot and Clausius's law to the reversible
 ones.    Since        bodies taking part in the process are each
 to have the same constant temperature, no heat can be converted
 into work, nor can any work be converted by the reversible
 processes into heat.    The sum of the work gained and lost
 must   therefore, taken by itself, be equal to nil, as must also
 the sum of the heat withdrawn and supplied.         Hence result
 two equations.
   The one, which refers to the heat, expresses nothing but
 what can be obtained without consideration of the electrolytic
 process—namely, that the same amount of heat is generated
 when the metal of the electrodes comes into a concentrated
 salt-solution which is gradually diluted as when                                it    enters
 directly into the dilute solution.
   The second equation expresses that with the above-described
 reversible process the mechanical work must be equal to nil.

   The great deviations which occur, especially with the higher
concentrations, may probably be accounted for partly by the
rise in the value of (1-m) for the denser solutions, and partly
by the more considerable diminution of the vapour-pressure.

been investigated,                I

enormous discrepancies between the results of observations
made at different points along the range from Hallet's Point
are reconcilable by taking into account the difference in mag
nifying-power of the different seismoscopes there employed.
It seems to me, however, that this proposed explanation, if
critically examined, would be found wholly insufficient to
account for the enormous discrepancies between the observa
tions made at the several stations, still less to reconcile the
transit-velocities recorded with the well-established and inter
dependent physical conditions of the transit of sound, or ana
logous elastic waves, in liquids and solids.
   Few physical data have been better established experimen
tally than the rate of transit of sound in water (approximately
Sturm in the     il.
about 4700 feet per second), as determined b
                      of Geneva,  and confirmed  by
                                                             8.

                                                    Wertheim by
a different method. Yet the     transit-velocity in discontinuous
water-logged shingle is given by observation No. 5 at 5309
feet per second; and it is suggested that the rate is increased
by the presence of the water. How these conditions are re
concilable with each other, or with the well-known physical
conditions by which the circumstances of transmission of
sound are interdependent and linked together,            I
                                                     am unable to
imagine.     The proposed smoothing-down of the discrepancies
by referring them to the differences in magnifying-power of
the seismoscopes employed is insufficient to account for dis
crepancies so enormous; and the proposed explanation seems
to me only to amount to this—that if different observers note
the instant of arrival as indicated by different parts of the same
seismoscopic wave, they will necessarily obtain discordant
results, and such as, in my judgment, no ingenuity of discus
sion of the observations recorded can reduce to the position of
reliable scientific data.

itself—the duration of sensible disturbance as seen in the in
strument being much dependent upon the dimensions, form,
material, and other details of construction of the mercury
 trough and other parts of the instrument.     All the observa
tions of velocity of wave-transit referred to by General Abbot
 were made in completely discontinuous material, or in rock
 more or less water-logged, and with the directions of stratifi
 cation, lamination, and fissuring imperfectly known and not
recorded.
   If  General Abbot will refer to my experiments at Holy
head (Phil. Trans. 1861 & 1862), he will find the enormous
retardation of transit-velocity produced by fissuring and dis
continuity, amounting in some instances to an extinction of .
of the velocity in the material of the rock if perfectly unfis
sured.    The velocity of wave-transit, therefore, in absolutel
discontinuous shingle can be but a small fraction of that
the material of the shingle itself could transmit.            General
                                                                            ..
Abbot may satisfy himself of this by experiment upon this
shingle by methods altogether independent of the use of the
 seismoscope. The velocity recorded in observation No.                            5–
 5309 feet per second (Amer. Journ. p. 179), cannot, as it
         ..
 seems to me, have been derived from the discontinuous shingle,
 and seems more likely to be an over-rated velocity of the wave
 derived from the water itself.       Yet the velocities supposed to
 be obtained approach, in most instances, those given as the
 results             by the greatest experimental physicists for
 the velocities of sound in media as uniform, dense, and elastic
 as are many metals.           If
                               General Abbot will consult the works
 of  Wertheim,   of  Biot,  not to name other renowned physicists,
 and will   compare    the sound-velocities in solids as given by
 them with those recorded in relation to the Hallet's-Point
 experiments, I think he will see grave reason for doubt, at
 least, as to the validity of the latter. To me, indeed, it seems
 that, if they are to be accepted without further and radical
  modification or explanation, we must cast aside nearly           that     all
  has been  accepted   and     still held true

my own experimentally obtained velocities in various rocks
long previously obtained, but appear to me wholly irrecon
cilable with those assumed as resulting from the Hallet's-
Point observations. Is this probable? or is it not much more
likely that some grave and still undiscovered sources of fallacy
and error exist in these experiments, on which I have felt it
incumbent on me thus to animadvert?
   Physical infirmity has prevented my examining the subject
with that fulness I could have desired; loss of sight has com
pelled me to confine myself to placing before General Abbot,
and scientific men in general, some of the difficulties which
his Hallet's-Point experiments present to me and,         must                                 I

harmonies is shown (1) in the synchronism of planetary revo

major axis of the modulus-atmosphere.

condensation, based upon forces which are now operating
within the solar system. It shows some new and interesting
relations between three cardinal planetary centres, viz. the
centre of greatest annular condensation (£), the centre of pla–

 368         Prof. R. B. Clifton on the Difference of Potential
    The unsatisfactory nature of the explanation of voltaic action
 given in modern treatises on electricity has induced Profes
 sors Ayrton and Perry to undertake the investigation to
 which they draw attention in their letter; and the same cir
 cumstance led me to give special attention to the subject;
 we even refer to the same passage in the textbook by Pro
 fessor Fleeming Jenkin as an instance of statements requiring
 further explanation.         It is therefore not extraordinary that
 there should be a great resemblance between the series of
 metals and liquids selected for examination by the two Profes
 sors and by myself; but as they were working perfectly inde

My    apparatus enabled me not only to observe the sign of the
difference of potential due to metal-liquid contacts, but also to
obtain quantitative determinations; as, however, some of these
differences of potential are very small, and a slight error in

the construction of the condenser, which believed to exist,
would probably produce considerable errors in the values
            for the potentials,  I thought it best not to introduce
quantitative results in which        I      little confidence into my
paper, which     I only regarded as a preliminary notice.
    Between most     .the   results obtained by Professors Ayrton
and    Perry  and those    published    by myself, there is a fairly
satisfactory agreement from a qualitative point of view ; but
between such quantitative measures as admit of comparison
there seem to be considerable descrepancies: these                I trust
will  disappear   when we introduce into our        respective  methods
the improvements which we each admit to be necessary.
    Several of the criticisms on my paper, which have been
introduced into the letter of Professors Ayrton and Perry, do
not appear to me well founded ; but I must for want of time
postpone the discussion of them; and possibly the more
thorough investigation of the subject, which we each con
 template, may render this discussion unnecessary.
    As the value of any results we may obtain in the future
would be much increased by a ready means of comparison,                 I
venture to suggest that we should adopt the same difference
                                                                  .
of potential as the unit.       If I am right as to the variation in
the difference of potential exhibited by the terminals of Clark's
standard cell, it will clearly be undesirable to employ this cell;
and   I should suggest the use of the standard Daniell's cell
referred to in my paper, viz. copper in a saturated solution of
copper sulphate, and amalgamated zinc in a mixture of one
 part by weight of pure sulphuric acid and four parts by
of distilled water. This cell seems to me to give a remarkably
constant difference of potential when prepared on different
occasions; and the accurate expression of this difference, in
volts, when obtained, would at once allow all our results to be
translated into terms of the latter unit.

PROBLEM       I.—A fire       is lighted on a small portion of an
   uninterrupted plane        boundary of a mass of rock of the
precise quality of that of Calton Hill, and after burning for a
certain time is removed, the whole plane area of rock being
then freely exposed to the atmosphere.     It is required to deter
mine the consequent conduction of heat through the interior.
   Problem           II.-It
                     is required to trace the effect of an unusu
ally hot day on the internal temperature of such a mass of
rock.
  Problem            III.-It
                    is required to trace the secular effect con
sequent on a sudden alteration of mean temperature.
  Problem            IV.-It
                    is required to determine the change of
temperature within a ball of the rock consequent upon sud
denly removing it from a fluid of one constant temperature
 and plunging it into a fluid maintained at another constant
 temperature.

LIII. On the           Electric Conductivity and Electrolysis                         of Chemical

HITº            states, as a result of his investigations on elec
       trolysist, that electrolytes are characterized by corre
sponding ions in them being capable of replacing one another.
They are consequently salts in the sense attached to the term
by modern chemistry; and during electrolysis exchange takes
 lace between the same constituents of their molecules as in
double elective affinity.   With the difficulty of this exchange
he connects the resistance of the electrolytes to electrical con
duction; so that on this account water, for example, and
prussic acid are such bad conductors.     In Magnus's theoryf
the  replaceability of hydrogen by other substances is especially
taken into consideration                      it
                                therefore appeared to me desi
rable both to test the consequences deduced from Hittorf's
experiments and to try whether the presence of hydrogen
replaceable in the compound either by metals or atomic groups
(radicals) is connected with capability of electrolysis.   If                                  so,
the latter should be absent when the above-mentioned chemical
exchange does not take place.        selected the simplest com

376            Dr. L. Bleekrode        on the Electric Conductivity
not needing any high pressure to liquefy them, were enclosed
in short straight tubes; so that small quantities sufficed. The
conductivity of the electrolyzed substances was estimated from
the deflections of the needle of a galvanometer the coil of which
was of thin wire, and in which the current from a couple of
wires, zinc and silver, immersed in distilled water gave a de
flection of 5°, and of two silver wires in water, which were
inserted in the circuit, a deflection of 2°. The current for
the experiments on electrolysis was generated by:-first, a
galvanic battery of twenty large Bunsen-Deleuil elements;
secondly, a battery of forty elements, which liberated in the
voltameter 600 cubic centims. of oxyhydrogen gas per minute;
and, thirdly, a battery of eighty elements,
840 cubic centims. per minute.

                               spark-length   of 15 millims., and
a second, the spark of which attained a length 42–70 millims.
   No currents of such intensity have, to my knowledge, been
employed for electrolytic purposes, especially with the sub
stances investigated by me, except in the experiments of

of-silver battery furnishes currents of far greater intensity;
my experiments with it shall be discussed in a separate section.
   The current was led through the liquid and at the same time
through the galvanometer; but it might be questioned whether
the deflection was not conditioned by conduction of the cur
rent in the glass tubef, and by a metallic, not an electrolytic
conduction.       In order to determine what was the amount (if
      of conduction along the glass, if the galvanometer showed
...)
only a slight deflection, the liquid was removed from between
the electrodes by inverting the tube; the circuit could then be
closed only by the glass sides. The deflection now produced
I have named the glass-conduction. . As, with the exception
                                                  i.
of alloys, no experiments had shown that compound substances
conduct in metallic fashion only, and not at the same time
electrolytically,   I thought      I
                                 could infer from the deflection of
the galvanometer, not only the conductivity of the compound,
but also   itsliability  toelectrolysis,           for the most part
I could not observe     any  polarization-current.

  It follows from these experiments that most of the hydrogen
acids are extraordinarily bad conductors of the galvanic cur
rent. This behaviour is the more remarkable as the compounds
here present are, when dissolved in water (likewise a very
bad conductor), some of the best conductors and electrolytes.
For this very reason, because a slight trace of water is sufficient
to much increase the conductivity, the negative result may be
regarded as a proof of the adequate purity of the condensed
  ases".  The only exception is hydrocyanic acid, it being
                      º

ments.      I
           endeavoured to condense the gas perfectly dry by
decomposing dry cyanide of mercury with dry sulphuretted
hydrogen and conducting the gas formed over
anhydride before it entered the condensation-tube.        At the
negative pole             was evolved ; and at the positive pole
#.latinum cyanide was probably formed, which coloured the
        yellow.    Moreover this compound is readily decom
posed chemically; it is even decomposed by light, with forma
tion of ammonia.
    These bodies retain their insulating properties when sub
mitted to electricity of high tension ; for only the more
powerful spark-discharges can take place in them when the
distance between the electrodes is from 2 to 4 millims.       The
conduction of induction-currents     is in this case complicated,
since it is difficult to decide whether a merely mechanical
discharge takes place, occasioning, by the production of heat,
a sort of dissociation of the compound, or whether it is ac
companied by a proper electrolytic action.
   W.     hydrochloric acidf, even when moderate induction
currents were employed, an effervescence was observed at the
electrodes.    In order to determine the cause of this, the               in
duction-currents    (spark-length 15 millims. in air) were
directed   through  the liquid acid during four hours; but no
spark-discharge took place. The part of the tube containing

observation made by Becquerel, who was able to decompose alcohol with
a battery of 50 elements if only    ºr gº

that of distilled water. The same fact has also been pointed out by

accompanied      by
                  chemical action.   Gore, however, thinks that the liquefied
     was not perfectly pure. Hydrofluoric acid, with gold electrodes, ex
hibited almost no conduction.

the acid was placed in a freezing-mixture, by which the
temperature was kept down to 0° É. at least.   At the close
of the experiment no alteration could be perceived on the
surface of the platinum electrodes.  On very strongly re
frigerating the tube no effervescence could any longer be
observed, but instead an undulatory motion of the surface :
this phenomenon will be considered in a subsequent part of
this paper.     The tube being now taken from the freezing
mixture and    exposed to the temperature of the air, the effer
vescence soon     reappeared  at the electrodes.   This shows
that the gas-evolution was only a consequence of the heating
of the electrodes by the discharges.      No polarization was
afterwards manifested   by  the galvanometer;   nevertheless the
liquid may have been so far conducting that the current
passed through at the opening and closing of the circuit; or
the resistance of the liquid may have been too great to permit
a polarization-current to produce a deflection.

different from their conductivity when in the state of solution,
so is their chemical character very different.          have been             ...

might, perhaps, be thought that this difficulty resulted from

and acting as a protecting film ; but Gore (l.c.) has established
other             of a feebler chemical activity—viz. that liquid
hydrochloric acid has no action on quicklime, acts but very
slowly on metallic oxides and carbonates, with the exception
of carbonate of calcium, and that liquid hydrofluoric acid acts
only on potassium and sodium, not on other metals, producing
a brisk liberation of hydrogen".
   Lastly, the extremely slight solubility of the newly formed
substances in the liquid acids might, perhaps, have some in
fluence; they appear, even when dissolved, to diffuse very
slowly, and finally to settle at the bottom of the tube.         In
favour of this idea may be alleged an experiment of mine, in
which calcium carbonate was decomposed by ordinary diluted
hydrochloric acid, even under a pressure of 50–60 atmo
spheres; here the water could immediately act as a solvent
on the calcium chloride formed. It is therefore very doubtful
if the difficulty of exchange of the hydrogen in the liquefied
#.ases depends on their special chemical character; and hence
       is no substantial reason for connecting their feeble con
ductivity with         Besides,

           This Table embraces three groups of anhydrides—namely,
        the anhydrides in which the oxygen is combined with a metal
        loid, the anhydrides of the organic acids, and the anhydrides
        containing metals.           The first group includes very bad con
        ductors: with the sulphurous and sulphuric anhydrides the
        conduction is hardly perceptible—deflection, with 80 Bunsen

                     and Electrolysis of Chemical Compounds.                                       383
elements, only 2°; and this may arise from a trace of water,
since the preparation of the first compound was effected by a
freezing-mixture, and the second, although it forms a well
crystallized substance, is extremely hygroscopic: it is there
fore with difficulty protected from the aqueous vapour of the
air. This is more successfully accomplished                   carbonic            M.
anhydride, which then exhibits no conduction at all".
    Of the chemical reactions of these bodies little is known.
With the aid of a little heat, various metals act reducingly on
them. Gore says that liquefied carbonic anhydride exerts no
chemical action, has but very slight solvent power, and is re
duced only by the alkali-metals.
    The anhydrides which contain metals belong (so far as is
known) to the good conductors, with the exºption of osmic
anhydride. This compound, which fuses at 40°C. is not de
 composed by a very powerful galvanic current (80° B. e.),
although             its
                 chemical properties are similar                                              of

384          Dr. L. Bleekrode       on the Electric Conductivity
of my experiments, conductors, although it cannot be main
tained that facility of chemical decomposition is connected
therewith.  In acetic anhydride the hydrogen is expelled by
potassium and by zinc ; the corresponding decomposition of
other compounds, however, takes place only at higher tem
peratures: in benzoic and phthalic anhydrides the entire
molecule often passes without decomposition into the new
compound.
      5. Electrolysis   of Amines and Amides (Ammonia-substi
                                    tutes).
      The   first of these    I                            The
                                  examined was ammonia itself.
chlorides of silver and calcium were saturated with the    gas;
and with them quicklime and sodium were enclosed in the
condensation-tube, in order, on expelling the gas by heating,
to remove the last traces of water.       The separated liquid
      #
ammonia was several times     poured   back over the sodium by
inverting the tube, and redistilled *.
           ammonia is a good conductor, and is decomposed by
the current.    Twenty Bunsen elements gave a deflection of
from 5° to 10°, which with 80 elements rose to 90°. There
upon was seen the peculiar phenomenon of the liquid becom
ing of a bright blue colour simultaneously with an abundant
liberation of gas. This colour disappeared as soon as the
current ceased; and the liquid became hot. Ammonia, then,
behaves as an electrolyte.    The positive electrode was black
ened; and a polarization-current was afterwards very perce
tible.  It was not possible to decide definitely respecting #.
decomposition-products;    a splitting into H and NH3 is pos
sible, although   NH,   is only known in combination with
metals f. The results with substances analogous to ammonia
are given in Table        III.

contamination with aqueous vapour from the air and the formation of
sulphite of ammonia were more to be feared.

at a temperature of from 12° to 14°C. The commencement of decompo

         To this series belong two condensed gases only—the am
    monia and the methylamine; the other substances are either
    liquid at ordinary                               or fusible without decomposi
    tion.       Definite electrolysis takes place with ammonia, ethyl
    amine, and methylamine, as even the discharge of 5 Bunsen
    elements is followed by a polarization-current.                             The com
    pounds in which the alcohol-radical has                          replaced   more than
    one atom of H (di- and triethylamine                                  exhibit a dimi
    nution of conducting-power, which may be in accordance         sº
    with the weakening of the capability of chemical reaction.
    Thus, in the secondary and tertiary amines the basic pro
    perties are less, the solubility diminished, &c. The phenyl
    amine (aniline) series comprises very bad conductors; and,
    indeed, induction-sparks of 70 millims, will not strike through
    naphthylamine.
              e chemical behaviour of these bodies in respect of easy
     exchange of hydrogen for metals is not always in accordance
     with their conductivity.              In phenylamine, for example,                  hy
     drogen is directly expelled by potassium, copper and mercury
     compounds form at the ordinary temperature by elective affi
     nity; while with gaseous ammonia the exchange of hydrogen
     for potassium and sodium, and also for silver, takes place only
     on the temperature being raised ; and in the                          <U+017F>º       state its

chemical properties seem to be lessened.        It appears from
Gore's observations" that this liquid possesses a tolerable sol
vent power for certain inorganic salts, as well as for potassium
and sodium, but without being decomposed by them; Weyl
found no alteration after it had been for twenty-four hours in
contact with mercury and zinc.; and yet ammonia exhibits a
better conduction than phenylamine.         The phenomena of
elective affinity are of little importance here, since these
bodies mostly act as bases without being themselves decom
posed.    For the double decompositions very high tempera
 tures are often necessary, for example, in the action of am
monia upon acetate of ethyl, forming acetamide at 130°–or
 upon chloracetyl, forming acetamide and hydrochloric acid,
at not less than 120°. On the other hand, the action of phe
 nylamine upon chloracetyl is very energetic at ordinary tem
 peratures, with formation of acetanilide.

importance, as these woºl. one or both of them, appear in nearly

Nerinaea.     In the western part of the Salt range conglomerates
 composed of great blocks are regarded by the author as evidence of
proximity of land. The Jurassic deposits are local in their distri
bution, and consist of shales, sandstones, and limestones, containing
abundant fossils, such as Belemnites, Ammonites, and Saurians.        A
dark limestone contains also     Gryphaeae and Trigoniae.    The Creta
ceous   deposits, when  present, are conformable to the Carboniferous;
 they are variable in thickness and fossil contents, and are not re
cognizable near Attock between the Jurassic and Nummulitic
 groups.    Further east a group, supposed to be Cretaceous, includes
clays with boulders of crystalline rock, which the author regards
as derived from land to the south.      One of these boulders presented
glacial striae.    The Eocene rocks are generally limestones, and
lie conformably upon the subjacent formations. The Nummulitic
 series of the Salt range includes gypseous and coaly shales. The
salt beds sometimes attain a thickness of over 1000 feet. The Mio
 cene and Pliocene deposits are of immense thickness, and contain
only fossils of terrestrial and freshwater origin, so that the deposits
 were formed in lakes and inland seas. The Tertiary epoch closed
with the elevation of the Himalayas and Salt range, which was
followed by a long period of change, during which various deposits
were produced, some including great quantities of erratics, which,
however, the author believes were brought to their present position
rather by floating ice than by the extension of glaciers.
    2. “Description    and Correlation   of the Bournemouth Beds.-
Part I. Upper or Marine Series.”        By  J. Starkie Gardner, Esq.,
F.G.S.
    The author stated that nothing had been written on this subject
since   Prof. Prestwich's paper, in which the beds at Hengistbury
were described as of the Barton series. No attempt had hitherto
been made to correlate the beds at Alum Bay or Whitecliff Bay with
those of the mainland; and no reference was to be found anywhere
to the origin and sequence of the beds between Hengistbury Head
and Bournemouth, or to their contained fossils.      He had now corre
lated these bed for bed with the strata at Alum Bay, and found
that there is a sequence, and that the Hengistbury beds are higher
than those of Bournemouth and do not reappear on the coast. They
are all of marine origin, and were deposited by a sea advancing from
the south, as is shown by the slope of the shingle beds and the lenti
cular patches of clay which mark old channels parallel to the former
shore and at right angles to the present cliff-line. They contain
numerous fossils—fruits, leaves, Mollusca, and Crustacea—the fruits
resembling those of Sheppey and forming a group of similar cha
racter. The Mollusca are of Bracklesham type; and the fossils in
clude three genera of Bryozoa, two of which are new to the Eocene.
The Crustacea have not yet been examined.
   The author comes to the conclusion that the whole group is
contemporaneous with the Bracklesham beds, and is not of Lower

Bagshot age.     Similar shore-conditions probably extended into the
London    basin; and the beds mapped by the Survey as Lower Bagshot
are  probably  of the same age as those at Boscombe, in which case
nothing more than the Bracklesham is to be met with in the London
basin.    The similarity of the leaves, &c., from Bovey Tracy to those
obtained by the author leads him to infer that the former also are of
Eocene, and not of Miocene age.           The author increases the thick
ness of the London Clay at Alum Bay at the expense of the Bagshot
beds, and diminishes that of the Bracklesham beds at Whitecliff Bay
by transferring part of them to the Lower Bagshot.
   3. “Notes on certain Modes of Occurrence of Gold in Australia.”
By Richard Daintree, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author stated that he had in a previous paper (Q.            J. G. S.
vol. xxviii. p. 271) proved the occurrence of gold in the Devonian
rocks of Queensland, and, further, that the auriferous tracts were
certainly confined to those districts in which the Devonian rocks
were penetrated by certain plutonic rocks, principally pyritous
diorites.   These conclusions had since been confirmed by Mr. W. C.
Wilkinson and Dr. G. H. F. Ulrich        ; and the facts thus established
are of the  greatest practical  importance    to miners.    With regard to
the  epoch  when the auriferous     pyrites  was  deposited   in the rocks,
the author   expresses the  opinion  that most of the    pyrites is contem
poraneous with the consolidation of the rocks in which it occurs,
although some may have been subsequently introduced by infil
tration; but this is not common in Australia. A more common case
is the separation of gold generally diffused through a rock into local
fissures, forming strings and veins. The author thinks that all the
evidence goes to show that the Australian auriferous veins were
chiefly formed during the earliest era of great volcanic agitation
indicated by the condition of the stratified rocks, namely the
Devonian, but that they were enriched during a subsequent Tertiary
(probably Miocene) period of intense activity. No traces of auri
ferous veins have yet been found in any Mesozoic or Gainozoic
deposits in Australia.
   4. “Notes on the Geology of the Island of Mauritius and the
adjacent Islets.” By W. H. T. Power, Esq., B.A.
    The author stated that the island of Mauritius consists of an
elevated central plateau, bounded by an incomplete wall of volcanic
rock, round part of which there is a coral reef and coral sand-rock,
and also rocks of various colours produced by the decomposition of
volcanic rocks.    Outside is a living coral reef. In the middle of the
island the old crater-wall can be distinguished, although broken ;
two secondary craters are also noticed. On the north slope of the
island there is a flow of columnar basalt to the sea.           There is an
opening in the old coral-reef, as in the existing one opposite the
mouth of the Black River. Gabriel Island consists of a coral reef
and detrital coral rock upon a foundation of basalt, the section
showing in descending order:—1. Coral stone; 2. Conglomerate of

coral, with some basalt pebbles and shells; 3. Compact limestone,
with thin         layers
                    of basalt at base. The author described the
supposed         trees noticed in this island by Messrs. Ayres and
                fossil
Clarke (Q.        J.
                G. S. xxiii. p. 185) as composed simply of hard
portions of coral rock left outstanding by the weathering of the
softer intervening parts; they show the same stratification as the
rock below. The islet known as Gunner's Quoin consists of co
lumnar basaltic lava, capping volcanic sand, below which is a
browner volcanic sand with seams of coral fragments.     Flat Island
is in part the remains of a volcanic crater, and the rest consists of
volcanic sand strewn with coral blocks. There are basaltic dykes in
the hill, the top of which appears to show traces of one or more
plugs. The author concludes that Mauritius was once an active
volcano, now elevated with the old reef. The islets also formed
part of a volcano or volcanoes, and have also been elevated with
reef-material.

ON THE PITCH OF A TUNING-FORK IN AN INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUID.
                   BY FELIX AUERBACH.
      HEN         a tuning-fork is struck and then quickly immersed in
        a vessel  containing   water,   there is heard, especially if the ear
be applied to the resonant table, a tone the height of which does
not accord with that of the tuning-fork in air.
   This phenomenon, which seems to have hitherto excited but little
notice (I have found a remark in reference to it only in Chladni's
Akustik), follows as a necessary consequence from the fact that the
dissipation of the kinetic energy takes place in the so-called incom
pressible fluids under other circumstances than those which subsist
in gases. For into                 all

We   employed a method the principle of which had been indicated
by the latter, and which is that used in experimental physiology to
test the excitability of nerves. This method consists in determin
ing the minimum of excitation necessary to be applied to the nerves
in order that they may react. Now light is the normal excitant of
the optic nerve, and the luminous sensation           special mode       re               its                              of

402       Mr. R. Sabine              on some          Electrical Erperiments
     In preparing  the selenium plates, care was taken to obtain
as  good  a surface as possible.      It was found that this might
be effected   by melting   the amorphous selenium between edge
strips of glass upon a piece of bright platinum foil, upon which
it was annealed; the unequal contraction of the selenium and
platinum prevented any adhesion after removal from the an
nealing-pot, whilst the selenium acquired a bright metallic
surface.
   Mercury Contacts.-It is necessary to discriminate between
the resistance of the selenium and the resistance of the junc
tions.    A plate of selenium was annealed at 200° C. with
platinum end wires.       Each end was then inserted in the side
of a  cup  formed   by a  pill-box,  where it was secured by means
of shellac in such a way that mercury could be introduced into
the cup to make connexion with the measuring-apparatus.
Before the mercury was poured in, the resistance between the
platinum wires was 124,300 ohms. After the cup at one end
was filled with mercury, the resistance was found to be reduced
to 82,300 ohms; and when the second cup was supplied with
mercury, the resistance further diminished to 60,100 ohms.
    In a subsequent experiment, a plate of selenium with plati
num-wire connexions, having a resistance of 20 megohms,
was found to have only 14 megohms resistance when the butt
ends were in contact with mercury.           The resistances of some
plates, however, were not greatly altered by this application
of mercury connexions at the ends.                                  -
    Resistance of Junctions, and want of homogeneity of the mate
rial.—The resistance of the junctions between the selenium
and the platinum wires imbedded in it was found to be very
various, but not to depend upon the manner in which the wires
 were imbedded in the selenium previous to             being crystal        its

  The resistance of each of the wires (except the end ones)
with      which       the plates          of selenium were provided was ap
proximately ascertained in this way; and, by deducting the
resistances of the junctions, the resistance of the intervening
selenium was also ascertained.
   A plate of selenium was provided with four platinum wires
0.5 centim. apart, annealed at 170° C. The resistances were
measured with + and                   –
                             currents, and the means assumed to
be  sufficiently near for the purpose.

   This is an instance of high selenium resistance in the middle
and low resistance             the ends in an otherwise appa
rently homogeneous plate, and of low junction resistances.
The two junctions were made at the same time, in the same
manner, by melting the selenium upon the wires; and yet one
of them has nearly twenty times the resistance of the other.
   A second plate of selenium, provided with six platinum
wires and annealed at 150° C., was measured with + and —
currents in the same way, mean values being taken. This
gave the following results:–

   It appears from this, that the resistances of junctions and
selenium are both affected by variations of temperature in
nearly an equal ratio.
    Resistance of Selenium altered by the inversion of the Current.
—The fact that the current strength in the circuit of a bar of
selenium and a battery is subject to change when the direction
of the current is reversed has been pointed out by Professor
Adams and Mr. Day.                           I
                                      made an attempt to determine
whether this      change    is due to electromotive force or to re
sistance, by carefully measuring the change on inversion
while the current in the selenium was kept constant; but the
total resistance of the circuit and the battery were increased
in equal ratios. By this means the change, whatever it                                      is,
remains constant while all the other factors are different; and
when the change            sufficient, there should

    The agreement is in favour of the selenium, the mean resist
ance of which does not appear to change by decreasing the
current-strength: the mean resistances of the
ever, increased, one of them considerably; and it is therefore
probable that in them, and not in the selenium, lies the change
in question.
    Resistance altering with strength of Current.—Professor W.
G. Adams has pointed out that when the battery-power is                   in
creased the apparent resistance of the selenium is diminished.
In some of the specimens of selenium which tested, found    I          I
 that while the current was weak, up to a certain limit, the
resistance increased in one direction and decreased in the other
direction; but after passing the limit in question, the resist
ance decreased in both directions             for any further increase of
 current.
    One plate of selenium, annealed at 200° C., was kept at a
 constant temperature and measured in a Wheatstone bridge,
 the proportional resistances of which were respectively 1000
 and 100,000 ohms. The selenium was inverted each time b
 a commutator, so that measurements were repeated in bot
 directions, whilst the currents in the bridge-resistances always
 went in the same direction.

    In each case   it was found that the resistance of the selenium
had somewhat increased during the measurement, due probably
to heat generated by the current.
    The behaviour of the selenium in these experiments is open
to one of two interpretations.          If due to resistance, the altera
tion is  possibly   a  consequence    of the operation of the Peltier
effect; if due to electromotive force, it is probably a simple
 consequence of electrolytic polarization.
    When the current passes through the selenium, it encounters
 a compound conductor analogous to that in which Peltier
 observed the cooling and heating effects of the junctions be
 tween antimony and bismuth.              The crystals round the point
 of contact which cools contract, and have a tendency therefore
 to recede and to make the contact with their neighbours still
 worse ; the crystals about the heated contact expand and
 improve the conduction.          The effects are opposite, but not
 necessarily equal, because one junction may be more susceptible
 than the other.         It is of course questionable how far this
 heating and cooling of an uncertain number of points of bad
 contact between the crystals of a selenium plate near the
 electrode would be sufficient to produce a sensible effect.
 But it is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the doubtful
 contacts which we are probably dealing with, and which the
 smallest conceivable approach or recession may improve im
 mensely or break entirely.
    When the direction of the current in a compound conductor
 is reversed, the heat or cold produced at one of the junctions
 has to disappear, and the opposite effect to be developed, before
 the resulting change can be completely observed.                   It was
 found that when the bridge resistance was adjusted, in anti

                      with Crystalline Selenium.                                 409
cipation of a changed (increased or decreased) resistance,
before inverting the selenium, the galvanometer (introduced
immediately after the inversion) showed a deflection always
indicating that the resistance had not entirely changed but
had still a value in the direction of that last measured; and it
required two or three minutes to arrive at the settled value
corresponding to the new conditions.                 This difference was
small but distinct, and would be such as would correspond with
change from heat to cold or vice versa.
    On removing the battery and inserting a galvanometer, the
discharge current which issues from the selenium is in the
opposite direction to the battery current, and agrees with the
thermoelectric current which would result from the Peltier
effect.
    On the other hand, the supposition that the behaviour is
                                  .
due to polarization is the more probable.             The increase of the
 resistance with increasing current (when weak) in one direc
tion, indicates the existence in the selenium of a small inde
pendent electromotive force, and leads to the suspicion that a
                                        º
 portion of the material in contact with one of the platinum
 electrodes is in an electrolytic condition, or both perhaps, one
 being more so than the                    As the measuring current              in
 creases in    strength,   it  appears   to polarize the electrodes in the
 selenium, as in an ordinary electrolytic conductor, and the
 small independent current is overpowered and lost sight                          of.
 The apparent decrement           ofresistance     by
                                                   increasing the battery,
is  probably due    to   the fact that the polarization increases                in
                                                                                  a
 less ratio than the measuring current,            so
                                                   that when this current
is   weak the     polarization     is                   stronger, and the
 apparent resistance higher, than when the measuring current
     strong.     The discharge after removing the battery               such
as is

410      Mr. R. Sabine on some Electrical Experiments
be opened to admit   light to the uncovered face of the selenium.
A   pole of platinum foil was placed in the tube, and distilled
water sufficient to nearly cover the selenium plate.          This
selenium  (galvanic)  element,  when in the    dark, gave an elec
tromotive force of 0.112 volt, the selenium being positive to
the platinum.    On admitting diffused daylight, the direction
of the current was changed, the selenium becoming negative
to the platinum, with an electromotive force of 0.056 volt; so
that by the admission of diffused daylight the selenium sur
face had become very much less electropositive than it was in
the dark.
   Two similar plates of selenium were prepared and placed
side by side in a suitable cell, which was enclosed in a light
tight case with two shutters, by means of which light could be
admitted to one or the other of the plates at pleasure.   Distilled
water being poured into the bottom of the cell, so as to reach
about three fourths up each plate, the electromotive force
between them was measured with an accumulator, discharge
key, and galvanometer.
   Both plates in the dark gave a very slight current.

                                                             Then
light was admitted by one of the shutters being opened. The
      on which the light fell instantly became electronegative.
  he consecutive readings were :—
                           –0'05   volt
                           –0.04     ,
                           —003      ,
  Then that shutter was closed and, after a few minutes, the
other opened.  The readings were now :—
                                    ,
                           + 0-09 volt
                           +008
                           +007     ,
   On connecting a galvanometer direct between the poles and
observing the deflection, it was found that the current imme
diately following each reversal was higher, and that it subsided
to a lower reading in a short time.    This is probably due to
polarization of the plates, and is exactly what might be ex
p ected.
   Action of Light and Heat the same.—The next experiment
was to ascertain if the effect of light upon the surface is the
same or the reverse of that of heat.      Two short lengths of
glass tube, a a and a'a', fig. 4, were stopped at the lower
ends with corks, b and     b',through which strips     platinum
                                                      of

   Therefore the effects of light and heat upon the surface of
crystalline selenium are identical.   Both heat and light render
the contact-surface between     crystalline selenium and water
more electronegative; and therefore we may surmise (although
the experiment does not amount to a proof) that the surface
does not become more metallic, as has been assumed as                                                         ac

   Effect of Light on Conductivity.—The object of the following
experiments was to determine whether the effect of light upon
a plate of selenium when in a galvanic circuit, in increasing
the current, is due to a photo-electromotive force in the same
direction as the battery current, or to a decrement of resistance.
   Let the resistance between the wires of the selenium plate
in the dark and of the galvanometer be r, the electromotive
force of the measuring battery be E, and the observed cur
rent c. On admitting light the current increases to       and one                              c',

    The battery consisted of twelve similar Daniell's cells of
large surface. They were connected with a commutator, by
which, with a single movement, they could be connected up
either in series or six and six parallel.   In this way, by using
the same elements in each measurement, the effect of any
slight accidental difference in their electromotive forces would
be, to a great extent, neutralized.       No difference could be
observed by the discharge of an accumulator; and therefore                                          I
assume they were in every respect equal. The currents were
measured by means of a reflecting galvanometer.
    A selenium plate with six elements in the dark gave a cur
rent c=0.498 microweber.         When the battery was doubled
and the constant resistance ri added, the current observed was
c1 =0.508 microweber.
    Diffused daylight admitted to the selenium, with the six
double surface elements the current increased to c' = 0.860
microweber; with the twelve elements in series and resistance
ri the current was cº–0-643 microweber.

    Itappears from the above, that the agreement between the
calculated values representing the change, on the supposition
that it is due to a decrement of resistance, is much greater
than that between the values calculated on the supposition
that it is due to an electromotive force set up in the selenium
in the same direction as the battery current.

416             Prof. G. Quincke on the Edge-angle and
    That the phenomena produced by the same liquids may
change with the nature of the solid substance follows from
the researches of Chevreul”, in which, when air was excluded,
olive-oil was driven away by water in porous porcelain, while
in porous whitelead water was driven away by olive-oil.
       is circumstance is therefore worthy of notice, since it
has often been said that fluids with a lesser capillary constant,
or tension of the free surface, drove away from solid bodies
the fluids with a greater capillary constant of the free surface.
If   the fluids are brought into contact with the air, besides
being brought into contact with one another and with the
solid substance, then indeed the water is driven away by most
of the fluids 2 with which the researches recited above were
conducted; and               I
                        have already previously completely dis
 cussed f the cause of this phenomenon.               Hence it follows
 that the contact of air with fluids 2 and 3, which are in con
 tact with a solid body 1, may promote or initiate the driving
 away of fluid 3 by fluid 2 from the surface of a solid body,

    In fact the first occurs, since, as I formerly" proved by
the change of height of capillary ascent, in a capillary tube

away the olive-oil, and         spreads upon the surface of the

strongly ignited carbon; the former exhibits, according to
the researches of Graham", a very strong selective absorption,
the latter an absorption scarcely perceptible.
   On account of the difficult mobility of saline solutions on
the surface of glass, and the residual attraction of water to a
concentrated saline solution (here disregarded), the concen
trated saline solution may certainly become partially dissolved
away and removed from the surface of the glass; and this
solution leads directly to a theory of diffusion at the surface
of solid bodies.
   11. Brücket has founded his theory of the diffusion of a
liquid at the surface of solids upon researches with turpentine
and cotton-seed oil, which were brought into contact with one
another in a space bounded by nearly-adjacent surfaces of
glass.
  According to Brücke the turpentine drives the cotton-seed
 oil
   from the glass surface. The liquid filling the capillary
space may    divided into three films,
                    be                     which the middle                  of
one consists  turpentine and cotton-seed oil, and the surface

    Such a porous partition behaves similarly to a more or less
completely closed valve, and permits, according to its nature
or chemical properties, the liquid 2 to flow towards liquid 3,
or liquid 3 towards liquid 2.
    The experiments mentioned show that

         a (water,  indiarubber) > 2 (alcohol, indiarubber).
    The surface-tension at the boundary of a liquid and a solid
body appears, like the surface-tension at the boundary of two
 liquids, to be less in proportion as one liquid is the more able
to dissolve the other body.
    Besides, it is in most cases very difficult, in single experi
 ments, to distinguish the surface-diffusion through the inter
 position of the solid partition from the free diffusion which
 occurs between two liquids without the interposition           of the
 solid partition.    That is also the reason why these processes
 have hitherto been so little investigated.
    Since the friction of the liquid particles against one another
 decreases with augmenting temperature, with an augmenting
 temperature the diffusion must increase for equal differences
 between the magnitudes 21s and als, where again the solid
 is denoted by 1 and the diffusing liquids by 2 and 3. And
 experience generally" agrees therewith.
    12. Imperceptibly thin films of liquid.        Creeping of salts.-
 Many times already have        I drawn attention to the want of
 harmony between theory and the observed facts, and at the
 conclusion of $9 have inferred therefrom that imperceptibly
 thin films of a foreign substance upon the surface of the solid
 body may be the cause of this accidental circumstance.
    On account of the numerous observations, and the accuracy
 of the methods employed, it is specially remarkable that in
 the measurements upon air-bubbles in aqueous saline solutions
 an edge-angle of from 20° to 30° is generally found, and yet
 by the direct method of reflexion a much smaller value is
 found.
    It implies this, according to my thinking :—that clean
 liquids spread instantly upon the clean surface of solid bodies,
just as clean fluids spread instantly upon the clean surface of
 mercury; and that if no spread occur, and the edge-angle
 differ from 0°, the surface of the solid body, like that of the
 mercury, is always coated with an excessively thin film of a
 foreign substance which hinders the spread.
    This thin film (which itself escapes observation, because it

      These experiments show that, other circumstances                                                being
 alike, the time of discharge of the electroscope was less as the
 edge-angle was smaller or the surface of the solid substance
cleaner.
    Since the times of discharge for the same liquid were dif
 ferent in the different experiments, they cannot be due to the
 deposited drops alone, but must depend upon the state of the
 surface of the solid substance, which is modified in different
 ways by the substances deposited upon                              it.

    14. Influence of the relocity of the falling drops upon the
thickness of the thin films of liquid.
    The time of discharge of the electroscope appears to vary,
amongst other conditions, according as the drops have formed
swiftly or slowly.
    On two siphons of equal diameter (1:006 millim.) (see § 4)
there were formed respectively 10 drops and 40 drops of water
in a minute, of 19 mgrms. and 19.67 mgrms. weight each ;
so that in one minute about 3.28 square centims, and 14-15
square centims. of free surface of liquid were respectively
formed per minute.
    As before, the times of discharge to and r of the gold-leaf
electroscope were determined for a distance of 8 millims. be
tween the platinum electrodes, without and with drops of
water, upon a clean glass plate. The edge-angle was also
measured at the same time, according as the drops were formed
slowly or rapidly.
    Z signifies the time which had elapsed since the cleansing
of the glass plate.

 Whence it appears that a rapidly formed drop of water
 spreads upon a freshly cleansed glass plate in a thicker film
 than a slowly formed drop of water. The difference is imper
 ceptible in old surfaces of glass cleansed some time previously.
        e edge-angle appears to be less for rapidly-formed than
 for slowly-formed drops.
     In   the case of aqueous solutions of calcium chloride
 (a = 1.1639), potassium carbonate (a = 1.4444), and concen
 trated sulphuric acid,       I    have not been able to prove with
 certainty this difference of time of discharge between rapidly
 and slowly formed drops.              In the case of the solutions of
 potassium carbonate and concentrated sulphuric acid, to was
 found greater than t ; hence the time of discharge of the

                                                  .
This would indicate that a thin film of liquid already previously
existing upon the glass (probably moisture from the atmo
sphere) was driven away by the deposited drop of solution
and repelled from the surface of the glass.

                Spread    of Liquids   on   Solid Bodies.             429
of silver of various thickness upon glass were, amongst others,
measured.
   The substance 2 of the thin film upon the surface of the
solid body 1 may therefore consist, as experience teaches, either
of solid or liquid.
    That it may also consist of gaseous matter or condensed
gas cannot be doubted, since           I  have completely established
the influence of    electrolytically     separated    films of gas on the
bounding surface of mercury and water, or of various acids
and saline solutions".
    Consequently, the surface 1 may belong to a solid body or
to a liquid, and the thin film may consist of solid, liquid, or
  aseous matter.
    If  the vapour of a liquid 3 be allowed to deposit upon the
cooler surface 1 of a body rendered impure by a thin film 2,
the condensed drops possess an edge-angle varying according
to the thickness of the film 2; the places where the edge
angles have different values reflect the light in different ways;
                            º
and thus the various thicknesses of the film 2 can be estimated
indirectly.
    When aqueous vapour settles upon a plate of glass or metal,
we obtain a so-called breath-figure, such as have been investi
                                                            If mercury be
 #.      principally by Moserf and Waidelet.
   eposited upon a film of iodide or bromide of silver modified
 by light or exposure in a camera, we have a so-called photo
graphic image (“light-figure”) or Daguerreotype, a breath
 figure produced by vapour of mercury.
     In order that the                         may appear plainly, the
 thickness of the film 2 must be less than the maximum thick
 ness D mentioned above.
     For the production of the breath-figures it is therefore
 advantageous to employ the cleanest surface possible of the
 body 1.     Surfaces of solids must therefore be freed as much
 as possible from the adhering film of substance 2 by polishing
 with alcohol, tripoli-powder, &c.
     Waidele found that freshly polished surfaces of silver gave
 the breath-figures best when they condensed the moisture
 with a blue tint, and worse when with a brown tint.                  This

 blue or brown tint observed on the thin film of water which
 spreads near a drop of water upon a freshly cleansed surface
 of glass or silver.       In the former case a portion of the drop
 of water spreads in a thicker film upon the solid surface before
 the liquid on the outer edge of the film has disappeared by

evaporation than in the latter case. In the former case the film
exhibits a tint of higher order on Newton's scale than in the
latter—blue of the 1st order corresponding to a thickness of
air of about 0.0002 millim., brown of the 1st order corre
sponding to a thickness of about 0.0001 millim., on the
supposition that the thinnest place of the film in reflected light
must appear white).
   A drop of alcohol deposited upon a plate, and which more
readily spreads (compare S 6 above) into a thicker film, even
with a less-pure surface exhibits, like water, by reflected light,
the blue of the 1st order.
   The greater or lesser purity, and the greater or lesser
capacity of the solid surface to give breath-figures, may
therefore be estimated by the greater or lesser readiness wit
which water spreads, or by the greater or lesser thickness of
the film of water which forms on breathing.

therefore, be surprising that the electric discharges meeting a
surface of glass in greater or less intensity from the elevated
or depressed parts of a coin, remove the adherent liquid or
gaseous film more or less strongly.      Add to this the heating
action of the discharges passing across the film of air between
the coin and the glass.       The elevated and depressed parts
must when    again   breathed on be distinguished in the breath
figure as places of greater or lesser edge-angle.

possible surface of a recently melted plate of pitch.

    5. The edge-angle may be determined indirectly by de
 ductive calculation from the measurement of the form of flat
 drops and bubbles, or directly by reflection of light.
    6. The edge-angle of the free surface of various liquids,
 such as water, alcohol, etc., and aqueous or alcoholic solutions
 of salts, upon clean surfaces of glass, crystals, or metals appears
 to be 0°. The liquids spread upon the clean solid surfaces.
    7.     If
            the edge-angle has, as is usual, greater values, then
the solid surface has been covered with an (imperceptibly)
thin film of a foreign substance, with the thickness of which
the edge-angle alters,
   8. The thickness of this thin film, however, cannot exceed a
certain maximum value D, which is as great as, or greater
than, the radius of the sphere of sensible action of the
molecular forces.
  9. This thin film adherent to the surface of the solid body
may consist of solid, liquid, or gaseous matter.
  10. It may also itself consist of the liquid deposited, and
may be demonstrated, besides by the edge-angle, by the so
called “creeping

LIX.      On the Influence of Temperature on the Passage of Air
    through Capillary Tubes.        By FRANCIS GUTHRIE, LL.B."
IN may  using “Marsh's" apparatus for testing
              be noticed that, when heat is applied
                                                         for arsenic, it

to decompose the arsenuretted hydrogen, the liquid rises in
the tube which supplies the sulphuric acid, thus leading to the
supposition that the passage of the gas through the exit-tube
is checked by the increase of temperature, thereby producing
increased pressure. This observation suggested the following
experiments on the effect of heat on the passage of gases
through capillary tubes.

     The apparatus used was as follows:—From a vessel, A,
 water drops into a funnel, b, causing a continued overflow.
 The overflow falls into the concentric funnel B, and escapes by
 the tube C. The middle of the funnel-tube is removable, and
 may be replaced by tubes of any required lengths.            The lower

but glide along the inner surface of the tube.               But these
bodies are    decomposed     through    elective  affinity (by  caustic
potash for instance) only after a long time and with the aid
of heat; and acids act on them only when a metal is present.
This behaviour is in accordance with Hittorf's theory; and
with respect to the part which hydrogen might play in elec
trolysis, it is to be remarked that these nearly insulating
compounds are precisely those which contain no hydrogen".
8. Electrolysis   of  some Hydrocarbons and       Haloid Compounds
                       of the Alcohol-Radicals.
   Only two of these compounds which I have investigated
(diethyl and dimethyl) required to be condensed.              This was
easily effected, as they were prepared by Frankland's method
from iodide of ethyl and iodide of methyl by decomposition
with zinc, heating them in closed tubes. The results are
collected in Table VII. (pp. 442, 443).            As some of these
bodies are indifferent to acids and do not exchange their
hydrogen for metals, while others exhibit reciprocal decom
position, they afford an opportunity, for again testing the
before-mentioned hypotheses. The hydrocarbons examined
 behave to the galvanic current as very bad conductors.           Their
                       ji.
 chemical behaviour to the strongest acids, such as nitric and
 sulphuric, varies. Diethyl is quite indifferent, and undergoes
 no decomposition; and so is dimethyl to sulphuric acid;
 amylene is split up by sulphuric acid; and these substances
 form derivatives only by combining directly with the halogens.
 Benzol, toluol, and                  are extremely bad conductors,
 and   therefore   would    probably    be   also chemically   neutral.
 But in these the hydrogen is readily replaced by the halogensf:
 they are directly decomposed by sulphuric or by nitric acid,
 water being separated and sulphacids or nitro-compounds
 produced; otherwise the alkalies do not attack them, or only
 at high temperatures. As, then, here neither is hydrogen
 exchanged for metals, nor does decomposition by proper
 elective affinity take place, these compounds support my
 pothesis, as well as that of Hittorf; and this holds good for
                                                                     º
 their substitutes also, as bromide of benzol (a bad conductor
 which is not decomposed by caustic potash or acetate of silver),
 and also for nitro-compounds.
    * The same remark holds good for the anhydrides consisting of oxygen
 and a metalloid (Table II.) and for NO,.
    t Phenate of potass (C, H, OK) is decomposed even by the current of
 5 Bunsen elements, with brisk liberation of gas.

the same time there was abundant liberation            gas. As soon        of
as the current was interrupted the blue vanished and the liquid
was clear again.

        Benzol-With 3240 cells strong vibratory motion a

of a  moderate induction-coil. This proceeded from the longer
electrode, which, extending the whole length of the tube, could
move somewhat freely : the passage of the current set it in
vibration ; and undulations were seen at the surface of the
benzol.      This phenomenon was most pronounced when the
longer electrode was the negative pole ; the surface of the
liquid was then depressed around the wire; but when it was
positive, the reverse was the case—the vibrations feebler, and
the fluid ran up the wire.          We found no indication of a
º
polarization-current.
    This peculiar phenomenon of the vibrations is analogous to
a remarkable experiment previously discovered by Warren De
la Rue : when one electrode of the battery of 8040 cells ends
in a horizontal flat disk of copper and the other in a very thin
             wire placed above it a little beyond the striking
  istance, the electricity streaming out of the wire sets it in
oscillation so that       its
                            extremity describes luminous circles,
often   ellipses.   If the platinum   wire    positive, the vibrating
                                                        is
motion     is  feebler and consequently the luminous circles
smaller.
    IV. Stannic tetrachloride.—The current from 8040 cells
transmitted through the liquid produced strong vibrations
when the longer wire was the negative electrode            when posi
                                                             ;

5640 cells directly through the gas condensed               the liquid

state. With the small space between the electrodes this dis
charge was too                since     brisk succession

                                                                sparks
appeared, the heat produced              by
                                      which caused the tube        ex  to
plode.      Notwithstanding, the conclusion was thereby justified
 that liquid carbonic acid          very bad conductor, since with
                                   is

fluids.
     VI.Hydrochloric acid—The condensed acid was prepared
in            tube from dry chloride of ammonium and con
     the closed
centrated sulphuric acid,           by
                              which the gas was deprived                    of
moisture simultaneously with     evolution.  its

            a         2160 cells was used, but without result,
                         of
no action being perceptible.  We then tried the current from
3240 cells, when the vibrations    the liquid were evidenced
                                                   in
by the undulating surface. Finally 5640 cells were employed;
and now the peculiar humming sound from the vibrating
electrode was also heard. Taught                        by
                                        the preceding experi
ment, we did not employ the entire battery, for fear                   of   an
explosion  ; but without this the present experiment was

decisive for the conclusion that this gas (which when dissolved
in water is one of the best conductors) opposes when liquefied
by condensation a formidable resistance to an extraordinarily
         galvanic current, and is not sensibly decomposed
  y   it.
     VII. Cyanogen.—The current from 3240 cells produced                                            no
effect      on
            the liquefied gas.         With 5640 cells the vibrations
were very apparent, and the same difference between the
negative and the positive electrode was observed                     the case        as   in
of  benzol     the liquid ran

with the positive pole. No polarization could                   detected.        be
     VIII. Zinc-ethyl.—In this liquid vibrations were excited                                       by
3240 cells.       They were especially distinct when 5640 cells
were employed         and ;    the same time the temperature
                                     at                                    the                 of
fluid was sensibly raised.         Afterwards we detected             current              a
             by                    the electrodes, which produced

caused         polarization                                                                          a

reason       conclude that electrolytic action took place, which

    IX. Benzol.-The previously mentioned experiment (III.)
 with benzol was repeated,              order     in ascertain,  to possible,         if
 whether     a galvanic   current could      pass    through     compound            a

employed; and the discharge was accompanied by sparks be

distance. The current was maintained                 during  two minutes:
 there was        no
                 spark; but the liquid was             continual vibration,

ever, not the slightest polarization-current             could      detected              be

a copious amount of gas was immediately evolved, but no
vibratory motion was perceptible in the liquid : this (as
already remarked) appears only to come into play with a
certain degree of insulation and a determinate         of
   tential between the electrodes. It is very possible that we
  ave then to do with the discharges named by Faraday
“carrying discharges,” in which the greater portion of the
electricity is mechanically conveyed by the molecules without
their splitting up as in the case of electrolysis.

   The chief object of this investigation was to establish the
possibility of electrolysis of a great variety of compounds, in
order to determine the part which might be taken by hydrogen
in electrolytic conductivity in consequence of           chemical               its
character.     Now      appears from the foregoing experiments
                            it
that upon this definitive conclusions cannot         established           be                   ;
and even elective   affinity has    preponderating no
                                                    influence.
   It    true that the hydracids, with the exception
         is                                                hydro                     of

far from being proved          their chemical properties

liquefied state are very feeble     but this may result from ex

of  the liquefied gas. The frequent coincidence therewith                                       of
the insulating property may therefore        regarded          be

conductivity and other physical or chemical properties (mole
cular weight, molecular volume, &c.). The main proposition
of Hittorf's theory of electrolysis, according to which the
difficulty of exchange of the constituents is connected with
the resistance of electrolytes, derives no support at   from                               all
my experiments.      Hittorf always tried the compounds                                          in
solution    and for that very cause

deduce therefrom definite conclusions          respecting    their con
ductivity.        has recently been proved
                     It                                    Kohlrausch, by   F.
Herwig, and others, that liquids which are bad conductors
become more conductive through mixture with other sub
stances, even when these are themselves bad conductors.

which   easily exchange     their constituents with    salts,  acids,                            or
water, and yet behave          very powerful electromotive forces

hypotheses respecting the qualities of the aether and of atoms

of any substance are conceived to be inert, spherical, and of

it may be mathematically treated as a simple continuous fluid
of unlimited dimensions, susceptible of variation of density,

of the body, in order that it may be in equilibrium there must
be (as Poisson first indicated) a diminution of density through
a small superficial stratum in the direction towards the surface.
Within this stratum the resultant atomic repulsion from within
to without is controlled by molecular attraction from without
to within. The latter force is due to aethereal currents extend
ing beyond the boundary of the substance, being, in fact, the
force which gives rise to the phenomena of capillary attraction.

Theorems I. and II.,           I
                            take occasion to add that whereas in
the  phenomena    of frictional electricity the condition of grada
tion of atomic   density  is produced by disturbance of the super
ficial atoms of the electrified body, in the case of the phenomena
of galvanic force the same condition is a necessary accompani
ment of the chemical action going on in the battery; and in
the case of the magnet a gradation of interior atomic density is
maintained by the mutual counteraction of atomic repulsion
and molecular attraction, and with more or less persistence
according to the quality of the magnet and the degree of
magnetization.      In all three classes of phenomena aethereal
currents are   produced   by reason of the gradation of atomic
density, and as these currents are subject to the condition of
circulating, it follows, as a consequence of such motion, that
polarity is recognizable in electric, galvanic, and magnetic
phenomena.       This theoretical inference is confirmed by ex
periment.

     Viz. those which support light powders in heated capsules, or liquids
in the “spheroidal" state, including the case of drops upon the surface of a
liquid (see Phil. Mag, for last December, p. 441 et seq.). The theory of
unequal stresses in polarized gas has thus fulfilled an anticipation which
Mr. Crookes elitertained so long ago as 1873, that whatever theory would
account for the motion of radiometers would probably also explain the
spheroidal state of liquids, and the mobility of finely divided precipitates
in heated capsules; for he enumerates these among phenomena probably
due, at least in part, to the same “repulsive action of radiation" as is
manifested in radiometers.      (See Philosophical Transactions, vol. clxiv.

only half-past nine, the sun had been shining brightly on the
exposed beach. The upper surface of each of the little pebbles
was perfectly dry; and the groups which they formed were
slightly depressed in curved hollows of the liquid. The tide
was rapidly rising; and, owing to the narrowness of the channel
at the point where I made my observations, the sheets of float
ing sand were swiftly drifting further up the river into brack
ish and fresh water.   On closely watching the rising tide at
the edge of the strand, I noticed that the particles of sand,
shells, and small flat pebbles, which had become perfectly dry
and sensibly warm under the rays of the sun, were gently up
lifted by the calm, steadily rising water, and then floated as
readily as chips or straws.”

contact with the glowing mass; and accordingly it receives
heat from below only by diffusion and radiation, in quantities
far short of what it would receive from actual contact; and as
it loses much heat by radiation upwards, it may be able for a
considerable time to maintain a sufficiently low temperature to
continue floating.

white-hot poker, the dipping of the fingers into molten metal,

Th;       ammonia process of water-analysis provides an index
      to the nitrogenous organic matter in drinking-water; but
it does not deal with the non-nitrogenous organic matter, and
some method whereby the non-nitrogenous organic matter
might be reached is still a desideratum. This desideratum the
Frankland-and-Armstrong combustion process aims at sup
plying, but (as is now pretty well understood among chemists)
fails to supply.  The old permanganate process, which we owe
to Forchhammer, which notoriously failed in practice, would
accomplish the object in view if the practical difficulties which
beset it could be overcome.

allowed to elapse before making the final readings.
  The modifications whereby we                            have       completely altered the
character of the Forchhammer process are as follows:—
  Instead of simply mixing the standard solution of perman
ganate with the water to be examined, we distil a given vo
lume of the water (say, 1 litre) with a considerable excess of
standard solution of permanganate, and thereby get more oxi
                                     º
dizing action than in the ordinary operation. We find ad
vantage in having the liquid strongly alkaline during the
distillation ; but we render acid before titrating the residue.

to use a considerable excess; and finally he titrates back
with the standard permanganate, and thus becomes provided
with numerical data expressing how much oxygen has been
used up by the litre of water.
    We have just directed that 1 litre of water should be taken
for an operation; and that quantity will be found convenient;
but, as will strike the chemical reader who reflects on the con
ditions which limit the accuracy of analytical processes, there
is nothing to forbid resort to a much larger scale if the highest
 degree of delicacy and accuracy were desired.             In such a case
ten litres successively introduced into the same retort would be
advantageous.
    We have worked        on 4 litres successively introduced.
    On   applying    the process, we have obtained the following
 results :—
                                                 Oxygen consumed
                                                 per litre of water.

 which show     a  striking difference between common drinking
 water and water      of the purest description.
    Experiments on dilute solutions of cane-sugar have given
 results approximating very well to theory.                           in
 deed, we have subjected to a course of oxidations ranging over
 a very varied scale—from 5 milligrms. to upwards of 10 grims.,
 at a single operation. The reaction is precise,          viz.:-
    (1)   Cia Hºs   Oil + Ogo=11 (H, O) +4 (CO2) +4 (C, Os);
    Equation (1) is valid if the action be restricted to the alka
 line solution; and equation (2) is valid when the oxidation has
 been carried forward       so as to be finished in the acid liquid.
 We   postpone    the  publication   of the experiments, and content
 ourselves with the general statement that we can by means of
 solution of permanganate effect perfect combustions of a num
 ber of organic compounds, the combustions taking place
 whilst the organic matter remains in aqueous solution.

general equation for that action; but carbonic acid would certainly
be formed ; it may probably be affirmed that chromic acid would
be reduced to chromic oxide, which would then combine with
organic matter to form an insoluble compound.         Where changes

to explain them in somewhat general terms than attempt to                                                         tie

THE1.    “On the Geology of Gibraltar.” By Prof. A. C. Ramsay,
LL.D., F.R.S., and James Geikie, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.
  In this paper the authors, after giving some account of the
physical features of Gibraltar, described in detail the various rock
masses of which the peninsula is composed.      The chief rock is a
pale grey bedded limestone, overlain by shales containing beds and
bands of grit, mudstone, and limestone.   Fossils are very rarely met
with in the limestone, and have never as yet been found in the
shales.  The only recognizable fossil they obtained from the lime
stone was a Rhynchonella, which, Messrs. Etheridge and Davidson
think, is most likely Ith. concinna. This would make the beds of
Jurassic age. The limestone forms the great eastern escarpment,
and dips west under the shales, which form the lower slopes upon
which the town is built. The dips vary from 12° or 20° up to
vertical.   The connexion of these strata with the rocks of the
adjoining districts in Spain and the opposite coast of Africa was
traced; and it was shown that the Gibraltar Limestone reappears in
Ape's Hill in Barbary, while the overlying shales and the sandstones
of Queen-of-Spain's Chair form         the ground   all          Ape's
                                                                        of to

saturated by water derived from melting snows, and so were caused
to flow en masse down the mountain-slopes      and over the gently
inclined ground at their base.
   The caves and fissures of Gibraltar were then described. It was
shown that the true bone-breccias were confined to these.        Many of
these fossiliferous breccias are of later date than the great agglo
merate, since they are met with in fissures and caves that intersect
the limestone and limestone-agglomerate alike.          When the mam
inalia tenanted Gibraltar, Africa and Europe were united, and the
climate was genial.
   All round the rock occur platforms, ledges, and plateaus, which
are evidently the work of the sea. These erosion-terraces              are
covered in many places with calcareous sandstones containing recent
species of Mediterranean shells.        Such marine deposits occur up to
 a height   of 700 feet. The movement of depression was interrupted
by pauses of longer or shorter duration; and the climatic conditions
were probably much the same as at present.
   After the rock had been reelevated, the subaerial forces modified
the surface of the marine sands that covered the limestone plat
forms, so that they came to form long sand-slopes.       The land at this
period was of greater extent than it is now, and some grounds exist
for believing Europe to have been again united to Africa; for
mammalian remains occur here and there in the deposits that overlie
the limestone-platforms. These relics, however, it is just possible, may
be derivative.    The climate was probably still genial, like the present.
   Overlying the marine and subaerial deposits just referred to
occurs an upper and younger accumulation of massive unfossiliferous
limestone agglomerate.       This deposit the authors believe to owe        its
origin      severe climatic conditions.
           to                              After the marine deposits that
cloak so much    of   the eastern side of the rock had been weathered
into subaerial sand-slopes, large blocks were detached from the cliffs
and steep slopes; and these duopped down upon the sand and we               e
soon drifted over.     By-and-by the blocks fell     such quantities that
                                                            in

lying sands were hardened into sandstone. These sandstones con

   This later agglomerate bears every stamp        great antiquity, and

characterized   bythe absence         of

ditions, and that even a former much greater elevation of the land,
combined with the appearance of a Sahara sea, would fail to supply
us with the severe winter climate that was necessary to produce the
great            agglomerates.          They   thought         that       the most probable          ex
planation of the phenomena described is that the cold conditions
referred to were contemporaneous with that general refrigeration of
climate which took place-over so vast an area in our hemisphere
during Pleistocene times. The limestone-agglomerates they look
upon as the equivalents of those glacial deposits that occur so
plentifully in our own and other countries; and the bone-breccias,
which are intermediate in date between the lower and upper lime
stone agglomerates, are paralleled by the interglacial                                    beds   of the
British Islands, Sweden, Switzerland, &c.
  2. “Notes on the Geology of Japan.”    By J. G. H. Godfrey,
Esq., F.G.S.
  The author stated that Yesso, the most northern island of the
Japanese group, had been geologically surveyed under the direction
of Mr. Lyman, but that the geology of the other islands was chiefly
known from Itichthofen's general description.          He finds that the
classification of formations proposed by Lyman for Yesso holds good
in      all
        the other islands.   Thus, going from newer         older deposits,     to
he  distinguishes:–
       New alluvium, formed                     by
                                     existing rivers.

 ON TELE         DIFFUSION OF CARBONIC ACID THROUGH WATER AND
                        ALCOHOL.  BY PROF. STEFAN.
   When carbonic acid is parted from the atmospheric air by a
liquid cylinder, it diffuses through the liquid into the external space.
If  the carbonic acid be kept under constant pressure, the rate of
diffusion will be constant; the amount of carbonic acid issuing in
the unit of time will be to the cross section of the cylinder directly,
to   its
       length inversely proportional.

and can be determined from such observations.
  A   second method for determining               consists     itthe observation   in
