          I. Energy and Vision.       By S. P. Langley*.
WHILE it is quite a familiar fact that the luminosity of
          any spectral ray increases proportionately to the heat
in this ray, and indeed is but another manifestation of the
same energy, I have recently had occasion to notice that there
is, on the part of some physicists, a failure to recognize how
totally different optical effects may be produced by one and
the same amount of energy according to the wave-length in
which this energy is exhibited.
    I should not perhaps have thought it advisable to make this
last remark, were it not that there has appeared in a recent
number of Wiedemann's Annalen a paper by H. F, Weber on
" The Emission of Light," in which he tacitly makes the
assumption that the luminosity of a colour is proportionate
to the energy which produces it, an assumption which it is
surprising to find in a paper of such general merit and interest.
   In another article of the same number of the journal the
mistake was pointed out by Professor F. Stenger, who re
marked that M.Weber's assumption was inconsistent with the

investigations of the present writer. Still the fact that there
could be such a misapprehension at the present day led me to
tive ocular effects of a given amount of energy in different
parts of the spectrum. I have undertaken, therefore, during
the last few months an experimental reinvestigation of this
subject, with such a statement especially in view.
   We shall evidently need two correlated sets of experiments;
the first set to determine the amount of energy in each ray,
the second to show the corresponding visual effect.
   For the first of these, since energy only shows itself through
absorptive media which more or less disguise it, we must
select that manifestation which disguises it least ; and in this
respect beyond comparison the thermal one stands first, as the
heat dispersed by a glass prism and shown by a thickly lamp-
blacked thermometric apparatus is, throughout the visible
spectrum, very nearly proportionate to the energy itself. For
these first or thermal experiments, whence the energy is
readily deduced, with close approximation, we shall rely prin
cipally upon a very elaborate investigation made here some
time since and already published, where the bolometer is used
to deduce in terms of lampblack absorption the relative
amounts of solar energy in various wave-lengths throughout
the visible spectrum and a little beyond ; and which has been
supplemented by a new investigation of the same kind in the
present connexion.
   Our second sot of experiments will consist of a recent
parallel series of photometric solar measurements taken at the
same wave-lengths as the thermal ones, and which we may
say gives this energy in terms of what I may perhaps be
allowed to call, provisionally, "retinal" absorption.
   The thickly lampblacked surface, then, and the retinal
screen provided by nature in the eye, both exercise selective
absorption ; but the first, whose absolute absorption is here
nearly total, does so in relatively so small a degree that we
may, in the visible spectrum, provisionally neglect it, and
consider the bolometric effect as here proportional to the
energy itself.
   It is evident that these two series once made, and reduced
in both cases to the normal spectrum, would give us for any
individual human eye the means of stating the visual effect in
terms of absolute energy. The visual effect is known to vary
in a very minute degree with the absolute amount of this

            Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.             3
energy, at least if we admit the physiological influence of
what has been called "the colour of brightness ;" but for the
comparatively feeble lights employed, this physiological effect
seems to be almost negligible, and it is nearly immaterial
within the limits of the experiment what unit of energy we
take.
   The object of these experiments, then, is to take some one
constant amount of energy, to actually or virtually display it
successively in different portions of the spectrum, and to
observe in what proportion the optical or visual effects of this
fixed amount of energy vary, according to the wave-length in
which it is conveyed. While the measurements which insure
this constancy are best made by thermal methods, and while
the prism is, on the whole, far more convenient for them than
the grating, it is nevertheless desirable to reduce the whole
measurements to what they would have been if taken directly
 in the normal spectrum. The writer's measurements, already
 published and here cited later, afford the means of doing this
 with precision. These show that the energy is far from being
 distributed equally even in the normal spectrum ; and that,
 according as it varies from one part of the spectrum to
 another, we must, by opening the aperture through which it
 is admitted where it is weak, and by narrowing it where the
 energy is strong, or by other like device, maintain it abso
 lutely constant, or else (what is far better) let it enter through
 one fixed aperture, and use the subjoined table to apply a cor
 rection for the actual irregularities. Let it be remembered
 that we are now speaking of absolute energy, not of those
physiological effects of it on the organ of vision which we call
light ; and it is to the value of this absolute energy for dif
 ferent wave-lengths in the normal spectrum which the sub
joined table refers. This table, which gives the energy as
 derived from thermal experiments, rests on many thousand
 observations, taken, however, all with what is called a high
 sun, i. e. with a sun more than 30° above the horizon. As
 the distribution of this energy varies somewhat from day to
 day, and particularly in the violet and beyond, we have sup
 plemented it by a series of direct observations taken with the
 bolometer on April 6, 1888, using the same glass prism em
 ployed in the photometric work described later. As those
 observations show a fair accordance with the others, it is not
necessary to repeat them.

       What has just been given in Table I. refers to the distribu
    tion of energy in terms of lampblack absorption, i. e. as
    " heat." We now proceed to attempt to find it in terms of
    retinal absorption, i. e. as " light." It is well-known that
    colour photometry offers peculiar difficulties. My own ex
    perience, after a long employment of the Rumford photometer
    for comparing the relative intensity of different coloured
   lights, is most unfavourable to it, and I have also tried the
    Bunsen photometer with almost equally unsatisfactory re
   sults. I have also experimented with the ingenious photo
   meter described by Masson (Ann. de Ch. et de Ph. se"r. 3,
    t. xiv. p. 129), in which a disk of paper marked with black
    and white sectors is revolved with such rapidity that it as
    sumes a uniform tint when viewed by the coloured light in
    question, but when illuminated by the electric flash displays
    the sectors again. It is evident tbat the reappearance of the
    sectors under the flash will be conditioned by the nature of
    the light which furnishes the steady illumination. But though
    on trial this has seemed to yield better results than the
    ordinary photometers, the method is of difficult application
    in connexion with the particular apparatus about to be de
    scribed. I have therefore, after considerable experiment,
    decided in favour of what may seem, at first, to be a cruder
    method, but which is, I believe, for the present purpose
    preferable to any of the foregoing ; I mean the determination
    of the intensity of light necessary to read a table of loga
    rithms or to discern any arbitrary characters.
                      Description of the Apparatus.
       The measurements have all been made in a dark room from
    which every source of outside light is excluded except that
    which enters the slit of the spectroscope.
       The light from the siderostat mirror M (fig. 1) passes
    through a small aperture in the north wall and falls on the
    slit      (which has doubly moving jaws, 34 millim. high,
    set in these experiments at a standard distance of 0*1 millim.),
    then on the great collimating-lens {I) of 755 centim. focus
    (aperture 11*9 centim.), tt being a paper tube to prevent the

 lateral diffusion of light from dust particles, p is a glass
 prism *, m, the concave mirror of 148 centim. focus, which
 here forms upon a second slit (s8) a spectrum about 7 millim.
 high and 90 millim. long in the easily visible part from A to
 H. The prism and mirror are mounted on the spectro-
 bolometer already elsewhere describedf, and which is pro
 vided with a circle reading to 10" ot arc. By setting this
 circle, any colour can be brought on the slit (s2). The light
 which the mirror has converged into that part of the spec
 trum overlying this slit passes through it, diverges and falls
 upon a black paper (fig. 2), in which is a central aperture
 1 centim. square, occupied by part of a table of logarithms,
 Erinted in small black type on white paper. This table can
   e adjusted to bring different figures in view, but is other
 wise fixed relatively to the black paper screen which (with this
 central square centimetre occupied by figures) is mounted on
 a slider. The rod (r) on which the slider moves is a prolon
 gation of the spectroscope arm, made of a light wooden rod
 graduated so that one can read the position of the slider to a
 centimetre by feeling of notches in the dark. The zero of
this rod is at slit 2 on which the spectrum is thrown.
    It is to be observed that it is necessary that the square of
 figures should be small in order that it may be slid nearly to
 the apex of the cone of light and remain covered thereby.
    It is to be noted also that at a constant distance and in a
feeble light, these small figures may be invisible to the naked
eye and most distinctly visible to the same eye with a magni
fying glass. For two eyes of different foci, the amount of
light with which the same figures will be read will probably
vary. It follows that even if the same person read from
beginning to end of the series, his readings will not be com
parable unless they are all taken under the same optical
conditions, e. g. all with the naked eye or all with glasses of a
certain strength.
    In these measurements a magnifying glass of 4-7 centim.
focus was used by all the observers, and in addition, two who
were near-sighted wore spectacles correcting this defect.

   The observer, in a room completely darkened, except for
the minute light diffused from the particles in the reflected
beam, and himself shielded even from the feeble light diffused
from the surfaces of the lens, the prism, and the mirror, by
the thick black curtain shown on the plan, waited until his eye
had become quite sensitive before making the readings. An
assistant outside the curtain set the circle by the aid of a dark
lantern, and adjusted the siderostat from time to time so as to
keep the light exactly on the centre of the lens and prism
face. The passage of the slightest wisp of cirrus cloud was
noted and the observer warned.
   Although the light diverges from slit 2 and not from a
point, the " cone of rays " above referred to, is, as regards the

of the distance from the slit to the screen. The nearest
position of the screen brings it within 20 centim. of the slit,
the furthest is over 300, so that we have the power of
                              (300 \ 2

however, is by no means a sufficient range for the comparison
of the light in the yellow-green with that in the extreme red;
and because the graduated rod was not long enough to thus
give the desired range, a photometer-wheel was introduced
in some of the measurements between the siderostat mirror
and the remote slit (sj). This photometer-wheel is capable
of reducing the light from "50 to -05 or further, and is more
fully described in Memoirs National Academy of Sciences,
vol. iii. Memoir on the Temperature of the Moon. We have,
then, without altering the slit, a range of adjustment through
        225
over —— or over 4500 times. The slit «j where the light
        '{Jo
first enters has doubly moving jaws, controlled by a micro
meter-screw. Its standard opening in these experiments for
light comprised between \=0^-40 (violet) and \=Ou-65
(red) was 01 millim., but it has been opened for supple
mentary experiments to 5 millim., so that we have by opening
or closing it a range of light from 50 to 1. It was, however,
constantly kept at the standard opening of 0'1 millim. until
the main series of experiments was completed, so as not to
vary the light by attempting to reset it by the screw. Ad
mitting, however, that for any given prism, transmitting any
given ray, the light is sensibly proportional to the width of
the slit (which may vary from 50 to 1), to the disposition of
that coming through the photometer-wheel, which may vary
from 20 to 1, and to the inverse square of the distance of the
slider from slit «3 (225 to 1), wo have a possible range of
50x20x225 = 225,000 to 1. This, however, it will be
understood, has only been employed in our supplementary
measurements.
   In the following table all observations, whether made with
or without the photometer-wheel, or with a wide slit, as in
the case of the supplementary observations in the most feebly
luminous portions at the extremities in the spectrum, have
been reduced to these standard conditions :—

      Table III. is a table for tho selective absorption of

   year 1881, and for the method of its preparation the reader

is referred to the footnote.* It will be seen from this table
that while such a silver film exercises a considerable selective
absorption in the ultra-violot, and even at the blue end, it
exercises less as the wave-length increases, and in fact an
extension of it would show a still enhanced power of reflexion
for infra-red rays. It is with these infra-red rays that our
measurements in previous researches on radiant heat at this
 Observatory have been hitherto mainly made. Accordingly
 our measurements of the selective reflexion in the ultra-violet,
 to which we have given comparatively little study, have not
 been repeated with all the care which the subject deserves,
 and we recommend a more complete determination of tho
 selective absorption of silver there as an interesting field still
 open for experiment to those engaged in the study of that end
 of the spectrum.
     By means of this graphic construction, which is amply
 accurate for the immediate purpose, and by the use of the
 formula already described (in Memoirs of the National
 Academy, vol. ii. p. 161), we can also pass from the actually
 observed prismatic spectrum to the effect which would have
 been observed in a truly normal one ; and it is by the use of
 these constructions, founded on these formula?, that the final
 reductions here given have been obtained. It is here assumed
 that no sensible selective absorption is exerted by the prism
 or any other portion of the apparatus.
     We now give a summary of the photometric observations.

  masses were :—

    * The selective absorption of silver has been deduced by bolometric
  measurements in the solar spectrum, with a Rutherfurd grating, by pro
  ducing multiplied successive reflexions of the light from silver before
  allowing it to enter the slit of the spectroscope and determining succes
  sively the variation in the intensity of different rays according to the
  number of reflexions. The observations are reduced by a logarithmic
  formula.

             In this table we have, first, the wave-lengths corresponding
          to the observed angles of deviation, these values reaching
          from (V'35 in the ultra-violet to 0|1,77 near Fraunhofer's A on
          the extreme border of the visible red. It is to be observed,
          however, that the great mass of the observations which were
          taken without disturbing the slit reach from O^O in the
          deep violet to (f'70 in the deep red. The figures correspond
          ing to CT35, 0"'38, (V-75, 0"-77 are extremely difficult to obtain
          with precision and are given here as supplementary to the
          others. There are four observers :—
             S. P. L., whose eye is somewhat long-sighted (making
          convenient the use of convex glasses of half-metre focus) and
          not sensitive to very feeble light ; eyes otherwise believed to
          be in normal condition.
             F. W. V., near-sighted, using glasses whose negative focus
          is 14 centim. The eye appears to be much less sensitive to

14           Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.
the red than to the violet. The retina of this eye is somewhat
deficient in black pigment.
    B. E. L., near-sighted, using glasses whose negative focus
is 42 centim.
    E. M., a boy of fifteen whose sight is perfect as far as
known.
    It will be remembered that throughout this table from (y-40
to O^O the light enters through a slit whose aperture is con
stant. If under these conditions the logarithm table can be
just read when the slider is one metre from the second slit
(s2), the light would be represented by unity ; if at two
metres, by 4 ; if at three metres, by 9 ; and so on. As,
however, we have already explained, the length of the rod
 being limited to but little over three metres, for the higher
values we are obliged to introduce the photometer-wheel.
 For instance, the strongest light observed by F. W. V. was
in the prismatic yellow-green corresponding to a wave-length
of O^S, where 193" 8 was noted. Had the rod been really
 indefinitely prolongable, the slider would have needed to have
been removed to the length of nearly 14 metres. To avoid
this the photometer-wheel was interposed, reducing the light
to       and the actual distance of the slider from the slit (s2)
was, as we may easily see, v/~^^~ or ^H metres.              The
 feeblest light which has been here measured with the standard
 slit is that by F. W. V. on April 2nd at wave-length C-40,
 which is put down at "13, corresponding to a distance of
 36 centim. from slit (*s).
    To make clear the way in which we pass from Table IV. to
 Table V., let us take any particular observation, for instance
 that already cited of April 4th by F. W. V. at0*-55 of 193"8.
 Referring either to the graphic construction, or to Table I.,
 we find the value of the tangent (at X = O1-55) = 0,62 approxi
 mately, and 193-8 x "62 = 120-16. Our Table shows the
 reduction-factor for two surfaces of silver to be 1*22, whence
 the final reduced value becomes
                       1-22x 120 16 = 146-6.
    And in this manner, from Tables II. and III. the remain
 ing values in Table V. are derived from those in IV. ; but
 here let it be observed that these values in Table V. do not
 yet represent what we wish, since they do not correspond in
 any exact sense to one constant amount of energy. It is true
 that they might at first sight appear to do so, since one

              Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.                   15
   constant quantity of solar energy actually or virtually entered
   through the same constant width of the slit to produce them,
   and passed through one constant aperture at the second slit,
   and since, finally, the prismatic values are reduced to those in
    the normal spectrum ; but, as the writer has shown, not only
    by theoretical deductions, from what is observed with the
    prism, but by very numerous measurements in the normal
    spectrum from a grating by means of a bolometer, the solar
    energy in the normal spectrum itself is very unequally distri
    buted (see Table I.).
       Since thermal and luminous effects vary proportionately in
    the same ray, it is to be observed that the values in Table I.
    furnish for each wave-length a divisor which gives not only
    the heat but the brightness which would have been observed
    had the prism dispersed the energy which fell on it in such a
    way that the same amount of energy fell in one part of the
    spectrum as in another, and thus we finally obtain the values
    in Table VI.

       It will be observed that no correction has been introduced
    for selective absorption in the substance of the prism itself, as
    this is absolutely negligible within the limited range of the
    spectrum we are discussing.
       This table exhibits the relative effect upon very different
    eyes of a given amount of energy in the form of radiation of
    various wave-lengths.
       Quite notable differences exist between the different ob
    servers, not only as to the absolute sensitiveness of the eye,
    but also as to the relative efficiency for different colours.
    This seems to be, to some extent, a function of the age of the
    observer, if we may draw any conclusion from so few compa-
         * The observations of S. P. L. are here omitted from the mean.

 risons, the younger eyes being much more sensitive to the
 rays of shorter wave-length. Beyond this, any unsual effi
 ciency for a particular part of the spectrum is, perhaps, apt
 to be balanced by a deficiency in another part, which, if
 strongly pronounced, would be termed colour-blindness. Prof.
 J. Clerk-Maxwell, employing pure spectrum-colours, formed
 white by combining 26*3 per cent, of red with 30*2 per cent,
 of green and 43*5 per cent, of blue (Phil. Trans. It. Soc.
 1860, p. 79) ; and on another occasion, with a slightly different
 apparatus (loc. cit. p. 74), the same observer made white by
 mingling 21*9 per cent, of red with 33*3 per cent, of green
 and 44'8 per cent, of blue. The Allegheny observers 1 . W.
 V., B. E. L., and E. M., with whom this experiment was
 repeated, required from one fourth to one tenth less red and
 one sixth to one eighth more blue than Maxwell, forming
white by mingling 20 per cent, of red with 30 per cent, of
 green and 50 per cent, of blue. Since, in order to make
 white, more of that colour is required for which the eye is
 most sensitive, we may, perhaps, infer that Prof. Maxwell was
 somewhat less sensitive to blue than these observers, although
 it should be remembered that the relative intensity of the blue
and red in the solar spectrum is liable to undergo considerable
 fluctuations, so that where direct comparison of individual eyes
 is impossible, some uncertainty must remain.
    We have selected for comparison with our results the fol
 lowing by Capt. Abney (using a different photometric method),
 which we have here reduced to the normal scale. (See
 " Transmission of Sunlight through the Earth's Atmosphere,"
by Capt. W. de W. Abney, R.E., F.R.S., Phil. Trans. R. Soc.
vol. clxxviii. (1887), A., pp. 274-276.) From the mean of
the observations of July 1st, July 5th, and July 21st, 1886,
made with an average air-mass of 1*33 atmospheres, we obtain
these photometric values for the normal spectrum :—
        X= 0'1-40 0"45 0*-50        0^55    0*-60 0^-65 0"-70
    Light = 0-8      2-8    25-0     82-0   66-5 12-3       0-5
    The general form of this curve agrees with that of S. P. L.
(curve a, fig. 4), showing a maximum sensitiveness near \=
0"-57. The light-curves of F. W. V. (curve c, fig. 4) and of
E. M. (curve b, fig. 4) have their maxima respectively near
X=0"-52 and X=0»53.
    Everything which has preceded has had reference to the
relative luminous effects produced by any (moderate) constant
quantity of energy. It may, however, be interesting to make
the novel calculation as to the actual amount of energy either
in horse-power or any other unit, required to make us see,

 18        Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.
and we can obtain an approximate estimate of this amount of
energy as follows :—
    Actinometric measurements made during the progress of
 the photometric observations showed a solar radiation of
 1'5 calories per square centimetre per minute. Of this amount
 of heat the slit (s{), being 3*4 cm. high by 0-01 cm. wide, re
 ceived the fraction 0"034. The visible spectrum, from A to
 H included, according to the bolometer, measures about 21
 per cent, of the total energy, the absorption of the lower infra
 red by the great thickness of glass in the prism being large.
 We estimate that nearly 20 per cent, had been lost by reflexion
 before the bolometer was reached. The spectrum formed had
 a length of 86 mm. from A to H. The average energy which
 passed through the millimetre-apeture of slit s2 was there
 fore (witbin these limits and expressed as heat)
                 1-5 cal. x 0-034 x 0 21 x 0'8 x tL
                                                 8b
or approximately y^'oB calorie, let us say 4000 ergs per
minute.
    At 1 metre from slit ss this energy is further spread out over
an illuminated area of 28 sq. cm., of which the square centi
metre of fine priut, being placed at an angle of 45° with the
path of the ray, occupies only about ^q. If a length of one
millim. of the standard spectrum receives an average energy of
TO ooo calorie per minute, the actual working part of the screen,
consisting of the little square of fine print, will receive at a
distance of one metre ^ooVoo calorie per minute. But this
by no means gives the amount of energy requisite to produce
vision, since the eye is able to receive a distinct visual im
pression in less than one half second of time. We may say,
therefore, that a luminous energy of 5o"ooVotfo~ calorie is suffi
cient to give a distinct view of the small square of figures in
the brightest part of the spectrum, even after the immense
loss of light by absorption and diffusion in the paper, which
may amount to A jj of the whole.
    Even less light is needed to give the bare impression of
luminosity. The sensitiveness of the human eye is indeed so
extraordinary, that the chief difficulty in measuring its power
is to find means for sufficiently reducing the intensity of sun
light which are at the same time capable of even approximate
numerical estimation. Out of numerous plans tried, the follow
ing has given the most reliable result :—
    In front of the first slit, in the path of the rays from the
siderostat, was placed a plate of glass very liylttly smoked,

           Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.                  10
whose transmission for different kinds of light was first pho
tometrically measured and found to be
       For violet light (X=0*-40) transmission 0-000210,
        „ green „ (\=(f-55)                  „         0-000655,
        „ red        „ (\=0"-65)             „         0-002350.
    The photometer-wheel was next interposed, its aperture
being sometimes reduced until only 2 per cent, of the light
received passed through it.
    The slit was at first kept as near the standard width of
0-l mm. as possible ; but it was afterwards deemed best to
secure the final adjustment for the minimum visibile at the slit,
as it was evident on trial that the inaccuracy due to the vary
ing loss by diffraction was small, compared with the inevitable
 uncertainty of the observer himself.
    Finally, the larger part of the necessary reduction was
 secured by reducing the aperture of the collimating-lens by
 means of a metal plate pierced by a minute aperture whose
area, 0-00015 sq. cm., was 0-000003 of the fully illuminated
 area of the lens.
    The aperture of the human eye, according to Du Bois-Rey-
 mond's photograph (see Nature, May 3, 1888, p. 15), is about
 0'7 sq. cm., when fully expanded, or the same as that of the
 foreshortened disk of figures previously employed. The size
 of the light spot at the standard distance beyond slit s3, when
 the minute aperture is placed over the collimating-lens, is
 reduced so that about two thirds of the light enters the eye
 placed 1 metre behind the 1 mm. slit on which the spectrum
 is formed.
    The following reductions of sunlight were needed in order
 to give a light which approximated to the minimum visibile,
 defining this to be not the smallest light whose existence it is
 possible to suspect, or even to be reasonably certain of, but a
  light which is observed to vanish and reappear when silently
  occulted and restored by an assistant without the observer's
  knowledge.
     Referred to the standard spectrum employed in the previous
  photometric work, the observer F. W. V. found :—
     Fraction of standard* violet light (\=(f-40) required for

    The measurement of the minimum visibile is subject to
variations of a much wider range than those of the photo
metric method, and may perhaps be in error by 100 per
cent.*
   * The relative sensitiveness of the eye of the observer in question
(F. W. V.) for the extreme red or violet, as compared with its power of
detecting green light, appears to be somewhat less when determined by
the method of minimum visibile than by the reading of fine print.

as on the 19th but possibly less uniform."
    For a large part of the spectrum the probable error of a
single reading does not exceed 4 per cent., but the error may
considerably exceed this for the violet rays, the eye requiring
a much longer time to regain its sensitiveness for light of this
colour than for any other, so that for measurements in this
region an hour's stay in the darkened room is none too much
to develop the full power of an eye which has recently been
exposed to the full sunshine.

22          Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.
required for the perception of very faint-coloured lights was
investigated. The method was an electrical one. There was
automatic registration on a chronograph of the instant of
exhibition, and determination of the instant of response as
the observer pressed a key. The interval of course includes
quite a train of distinct operations. According to Menden
hall (American Journal of Science, [3] vol. ii. p. 156'), that
portion of the action of brain nerve and muscle which pro
duces the mechanical effect, and which may be called auto
matic, takes place in certainly but little over one tenth of a
 second. But the sensations which demand a conscious con
 centration of the attention, and especially those which require
 for their registration a decision of the judgment, occupy an
 interval several times as great. The perception of a light just
 at the verge of visibility probably involves an exercise of
judgment—an answer to the question, " Do I see the light or
do 1 not ? "—although the question may not be consciously
propounded, and accordingly this kind of perception may bo
 included in that class of combined sensation and mental
 operation which involves a choice. Professor Mendenhall
 found for the time required to decide between red and white
 0443 sec, and to decide between a circle and a triangle
 0494 sec. We have found for the average of over 1000
 observations of the disappearance or reappearance of a very
 faint light (perhaps 20 times as bright as the faintest per
 ceptible), O507 sec, but corresponding measurements with a
 moderately bright spectrum, the light being about 10,000
 times as intense as that called " very faint," gave 0'242 sec,
a number which is intermediate between the times found by
 Professor Mendenhall for the appearance of a white card
 (0*292 sec.) and that of an electric spark (0-203 sec). We
may therefore conclude that distinct vision for a very faint
 light demands about one half second of time, while the per
ception of light of ordinary brightness requires only about
 half that interval. It is possible that differences in the
 rapidity of the perception for lights of different colours might
 be detected on more exhaustive study, but none have been
 noted in these experiments other than those which were
attributable to the variation of intensity.
    It will be seen that quantitative measurements of the effect
upon the eye of different rays whose luminosity varied in the
proportion of 200,000 : 1, were actually obtained, and that it
would have been possible to considerably exceed these limits,
especially when it is considered that the photometric measure
ments were confined to lights of feeble intensity. Since it is
possible to look directly at the sun for as short a time as one half

            Prof. S. P. Langley on Energy and Vision.                       23
second, it is certain that the eye, by the combined adaptability
of the iris and retina, can perceive lights whose intensities
vary in the ratio of 1 to 1 000 000000 000000* (10)15.
    It will be understood that the writer does not profess any
competency in physiological optics, and that the preceding
observations, and the conclusions reached from them, are
both to be understood from the purely physical point of view.
This being premised, we will summarize the paper in the
following conclusions :—
    The time required for the distinct perception of an exces
sively faint light is about one half second. A relati/ely very
long time is, however, needed for the recovery of sensitive
ness after exposure to a bright light, and the time demanded
for this restoration of complete visual power appears to be
greatest when the light to be perceived is of a violet colour.
     The visual effect produced by any given constant amount
of energy varies enormously according to the colour of the light
in question. It varies considerably between eyes which may
 ordinarily be called normal ones, but an average gives the
following proportionate results for seven points in the normal
spectrum, whose wave-lengths correspond approximately with
those of the ordinary colour divisions, where unity is the
amount of energy (about jo'off erg) required to make us see
light in the crimson of the spectrum near A, and where the
preceding wave-lengths given correspond approximately to
the six colours violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red :—
     Colour.      Violet. Blue. Green. Yellow. Orange. Bed. Orims.
Wave-length.. "-40 »-47                 "-53   "-58        "-60      "-65 "-75

(Visual effect.)
     Since we can recognize colour still deeper than this crimson,
 it appears from this that the same amount of energy may
produce at least 100,000 times the visual effect in one colour
 of the spectrum that it does in another, and that the vis viva
 of the waves whose length is QP'75, arrested by the ordinary
 retina, represents work done in giving rise to the sensation
 of crimson light of 0-0000000000003 horse-power, or about
O'OOl of an erg, while the sensation of green can be pro
 duced by 0-000000,01 of an erg.
    * It may be interesting to check this result by an entirely different
 method. The light of the sun is, according to Pickering, equal to that of
a star of — 25'5 stellar magnitude, or 4400,000000 times that of Sirius
 (mag. — 1-4) which again is about 910 times that of a sixth magnitude
 star, ordinarily considered the faintest visible to the naked eye. Here
the light of the sun is to that of the minimum visibile as 1 to 4,000000,000000
 (4x10"), but the difference seems accounted for by the fact that the
 ratio by this latter method is found for an eye exposed in starlight, by
 the former for an eye in absolute darkness.

II. A Design for a Standard of Electrical Resistance. By J.
   A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc, Professor of Electrical Technology
   in University College, London*.
                            [Plate I.]
IN designing a standard of electrical resistance the two
      points to which attention is directed are the choice of
the material in which the standard is embodied, and the form
or disposition of the instrument.
   Experience is yet far from complete as to the entire per
manence of wires of alloys over prolonged periods of time when
employed as standards of electrical resistance ; but having
regard to the inconveniences which attend the use of mercury
in standards intended to be conveyed about, evidence, as far
as we have it, points to the tolerable permanence of the
platinum-silver alloy (66 p.c. of silver + 32 p.c. of platinum)
when drawn into wire, for use as the material substance of
which the actual standard is made.
    A definite length and gauge of standard wire has then to
be so arranged that, whilst kept at a constant temperature,
currents can be passed through it and the resistance between
certain points ascertained.
    The form which has hitherto been chiefly manufactured,
and which is in most general use, is the form of standard
which was designed by the Committee of the British Associa
 tion on the original introduction of the B.A. unit, and shown
 in plate 4 of the ' Reprint of Reports on Electrical Standards,'
 by Prof. Fleeming Jenkin. In this form of standard the
 actual coil is wound on a bobbin consisting of a tube of thin
 brass having ebonite cheeks. Attached to these cheeks are
 the two long bent copper rods which serve as the electrodes,
 held in position by a distance-piece of ebonite. In order
 that the coil may be immersed in a medium of known tempe
 rature it is further enclosed in a thin shell of brass consisting
 of a double tube (see fig. 1), and the whole shell filled up
 with paraffin wax or ozokerit. Some makers then place a
 thin lid of ebonite on the top of the shell.
    Experience gained by a rather extensive use of standards
 of resistance ot this form has indicated to the writer that this
 edsign can be, with some advantage, modified. The disad
 vantages of the present B.A. form of standard are as follows:—
 When in use the standards must be placed in water of a known
 temperature or in melting snow or ice. After a sufficiently
prolonged time the temperature of this water can be taken,
and the temperature of the water will be the temperature of
   * Communicated by the Physical Society : read November 10, 1888.

         Design for a Standard of Electrical Resistance.        25
the wire of the standard, assuming that equilibrium of tem
perature has been attained. If a current is now passed through
the coil in order to take a measurement of its electrical resist
ance, the temperature of the wire is raised, and its resistance
is altered.
   Other things being equal, the best design of coil is that in
which this electrically developed heat is got rid of by diffusion
as quickly as possible. The embedding of a coil in a large
mass of badly-conducting material like paraffin or ozokerit is,
from this point of view, a great disadvantage.
    Sufficient electrical insulation has to be provided ; but this
should be achieved without the use of more enveloping insu
lation than necessary.
   The two chief objections to the B.A. form of standard are,
however, these :—
   First, it cannot be placed in water with the shell wholly
underwater or under ice without short-circuiting the electrodes,
and, when used as intended, whilst the narrow or bottom
 portion of the coil is in the water, the upper and more massive
 portion is in the air, and therefore may be at a different tem
 perature to the bottom portion. Hence arises a doubt as to
the actual temperature of the coil of wire. It has to be borne
in mind that the limitation of accuracy in such comparisons of
 standards of resistance is determined by the difficulty of ascer
 taining temperature, and not in the mere measurement of
resistance. Uncertainty as to the actual temperature of the
 wire to the extent of one or two tenths of a degree Centigrade
renders nugatory elaborate arrangements for very accurate
measurement of resistance.
   Second. The standards, as at present constructed, are liable
to another defect. If the standard is being used in melting
ice or snow, and therefore cooled to 0° Cent., deposition of
dew will take place upon the upper surface, whether the
ebonite lid or paraffin-wax surface, through which the copper-
rod electrodes protrude. The copper rods are originally lac
quered or varnished, but when the lacquer wears off, any film
of moisture so deposited will short-circuit the electrodes and
reduce the observed resistance. In comparing standards in
melting ice, either then the whole shell must be as far as pos
sible placed under the melting ice, in which case stirring the
liquid may splash water on to the surface of the paraffin, or
else the shell has to be only partly immersed, in which case
ambiguity exists as to the actual temperature of the coil of wire.
   These and some other difficulties, such as that of keeping a
rather deep vessel of melting ice at a constant temperature,
have impressed on the writer the necessity for modifying the

26            Prof. J. A. Fleming's Design for a
form of the standard, and one form which has proved itself to
be very satisfactory in use is as follows :—The case or shell
which contains the coil is in the form of a ring (see fig. 5).
This ring consists of a pair of square-sectioned circular troughs
provided with flanges which can be screwed together so as to
form a square-sectioned, hollow, circular ring.
   From this ring proceed upwards two brass tubes about
five or six inches in length. Down these brass tubes pass the
copper electrodes or rods, and these rods are insulated from
the tubes at the top and bottom by ebonite insulators. The
insulator at the bottom of the tube, where it enters the ring,
is a simple collar, that at the top has the form of a funnel
corrugated on its outer surface. The use of this funnel will
be referred to presently. The actual resistance-coil is a
length of platinum-silver wire three-fold silk-covered. The
silk-covered wire is first baked above 100° C. to dry it com
pletely, and then immersed in melted ozokerit or paraffin.
   The so insulated wire is cut about the proper length and
laid double or folded once upon itself and then rolled up on
a wooden mandril so as to form a circular coil of diameter
suitable to drop into the hollow of the brass ring. The wire
being wound double, its coefficient of self-induction is rendered
very small. This coil of wire is then wrapped over with
white silk and again dipped in melted ozokerit. The ends of
the wire are next soldered into nicks in the ends of the copper
rods, they having been previously pushed a little way through
the brass tubes for the purpose, and afterwards drawn back
into proper positions. The coil is then packed into the
circular groove, and, after adjusting the resistance to the
proper value, the bottom half of the ring is placed over it.
A thin wpsher of indiarubber is inserted between the flanges,
and the whole screwed tightly together. The resistance-coil
is thus enclosed in a thin ring of metal, and can be placed
wholly be'ow the surface of water or ice. In order to test
the tightness of the joints, a little test-pipe is provided on the
upper surface of the ring. By placing the ring coil below
water and blowing into the test-pipe, the good fitting of the
joints can be assured. The aperture of this test-pipe is after
wards closed by solder or a screw (see fig. 6).
   Apart from the insulation of the coil itself it will be appa
rent that the insulation is limited by the amount of insulation
resistance secured at the ebonite insulators at the top end of
the brass tubes. Any leakage from the copper rod over these
insulators to the brass tube destroys to that extent the insula
tion of the coil. The object of making these external
insulators funnel-shaped is to prevent surface creeping, due
to condensation of moisture on them, by placing paraffin oil
or insulating liquid in the funnel-shaped cavity. When this

                Standard of Electrical Resistance.              27
is done, even if dew should collect on the outer surface of the
funnels, the inner surface is kept dry by the paraffin oil
placed in them, the action being the same as that in the well-
known Johnson and Phillip's fluid insulator.
    The ring-coils when in use are placed in rather shallow
zinc troughs, which can be filled with water, and which are
closed with a wooden lid. When so placed the whole of the
actual coil or resistance part is down beneath the liquid at
one level, where the temperature can be accurately ascertained.
The insulators and point of emergence of the electrodes are
away up above the level of the water, and well protected
 from any action which might permit of leakage over them.
 The large metallic mass of the ring assists in bringing the
 resistance-coil quickly back to the temperature of the sur
 rounding water, and the coil therefore " tests quickly." In
 all other respects these standards of resistance are as compact
 and portable, and not more expensive to construct than the
 old form of B. A. standard, whilst obviating the difficulties
 which present themselves in the use of the old form in very
 accurate comparisons of resistance.
    Other forms of standard coil which have been tried are
 indicated in figs. 2, 3, and 4, but have not proved themselves
 to be as convenient as that above described and illustrated in
 figs. 5 and 6.
    It is quite possible to have two or moro coils of wire
 inside the same ring, each coil having its separate pair of
 electrodes. A useful coil of this form can be made up con
 taining 1, 10, and 100 ohms, so that comparisons can be
 quickly made at the same temperature with these three mul
 tiples of the same unit of resistance.
    The adjustment of the coils to a certain value presents no
 great difficulties. The wire is in the first instance cut a little
 longer than required, and its resistance nearly adjusted ; when
 the two ends of the coil have been soldered to the lower ends
 of the copper rods, the resistance is again taken from the ends
 of the electrodes. This resistance should be a little greater
 than the final value required. The middle point of the wire
 or extreme loop is now stripped of its silk and the loop
 twisted up with the pliers, the resistance being carefully taken
 at intervals. When just a very little in excess of the value
 required the twisted coil is touched with solder, and having
 been bound over with insulating material the coil is completed.
  In the construction of standards it is obvious that it is not
  so important that the resistance should have an exact integer
  value at any temperature as that its value at some tempera
 ture and its coefficient of variation of temperature should bo
  exactly known.

 III. A Continuous Heat and Electrical- Current Measuring-
    Instrument. By Frederick J. Smith, M.A., Millard
    Lecturer, Trinity College, Oxford, and Lecturer in the
    University in Experimental Mechanics and Physics*.
  W'HEN a quantity of heat given to a known mass of liquid
          causes it to rise through a certain number of degrees
 of temperature, this quantity of heat can be determined ;
 but if heat be continuously applied, then the liquid would
 reach a temperature quite inconvenient for experimental
 purposes.
    By means of the following device, which the author thinks
 might be perhaps of interest to those who may be working in
the same direction, heat may be imparted to a mass of liquid,
 while the quantity of heated liquid may be measured, cooled,
and reheated continuously. In the figure is shown a section
through the middle of the instrument.
    A B C is a U-shaped tube furnished with
a branch at D. The leg, C, is surrounded
 with a large tube, through which water at
 any required temperature may flow when
required. The leg, A, is surrounded with
cotton-wool or any good nonconductor of
heat ; at B there is a stopcock. Either
two parallel wires or a coil of wire extend
through nearly the whole length of the
leg A. The instrument is used thus :—
The stopcock B is opened, and the U-tube
is filled with mineral oil up to about 5
millim. from the top of C. An electrical
current sent through the coil or wires
causes the liquid in A to be heated, and
therefore to increase in length. When it        I;
reaches the branch D it runs over and
drops into the leg C, which is always at a
lower level than D, owing to its being at
a lower temperature, and consequently
having a greater density than the liquid
in the leg A. The number of drops in a
given time, under certain circumstances,
becomes an index of the heat given to the
liquid in A, and therefore of the current
by which the heat is produced.

            On Maxwell's Electromagnetic Equations.             29
   The author finds that, by making the leg A about 2 metres
long, abundant length can be obtained between D and 0 to
place a small fluid meter, by which means the weight of liquid
which passes from D to 0 can be accurately measured. The
instrument works either with a continuous or alternating
current. The stopcock B is used to contract the cross section
of the U-tube ; without some check a violent oscillation is set
up between the two columns of liquid.
   The first experimental instrument constructed by the author
consisted of a continuous rectangular-shaped tube, one part of
which was heated while the rest of the tube was kept cool.
The liquid circulated, and its rate of circulation, when pro
perly interpreted, would have been a measure of what was
required ; but it was given up, as it appeared nearly impos
sible to cause the current of liquid to mechanically record its
rate of flow with any amount of accuracy.
   Several rather interesting results, which at present are not
complete for publication, have cropt out of experiments made
with the instrument. Of these, perhaps, the most promising
was an illustration of the conversion of work into heat. The
meter devised for determining the flow is one by which the
weight of the oil is indicated, not the volume.
IV. The General Solution of Maxwell's Electromagnetic
   Equations in a Homogeneous Isotropic Medium, especially
   in regard to the Derivation of special Solutions, and the
   Formula for Plane Waves. By Oliver Heaviside*.
1. EQUATIONS of the Field.—Although, from the diffi
           culty of applying them to practical problems, general
solutions frequently possess little practical value, yet they may
he of sufficient importance to render their investigation desi
rable, and their applications examined as far as may be prac
ticable. The first question here to be answered is this. Given
the state of the whole electromagnetic field at a certain moment,
in a homogeneous isotropic conducting dielectric medium,
to deduce the state at any later time, arising from the initial
state alone, without impressed forces.
   The equations of the field are, if p stand for djdt,
                        curl B. = (±irk + cp) E,               (1)

 current in terms of the magnetic force H, k being the electric
 conductivity and c/Att the electric permittivity (or permittance
 of a unit-cube condenser), and E the elecuric force ; whilst
 the second is the equation introduced by me* as the proper
 companion to the former to make a complete system suitable
 for practical working, g being the magnetic conductivity and
 fi the magnetic inductivity. This second equ- 'on takes the
 place of the two equations

 of Maxwell, where A is the electromagnetic momentum at a
 point and ¥ the scalar electric potential. Thus ¥ and A are
 murdered, so to speak, with a great gain in definiteness and
 conciseness. As regards however, standing for a physically
 non-existent quality, such that the medium cannot support
 magnetic force without a dissipation of energy at the rate
gH2 per unit volume, it is only retained for the sake of ma
thematical completeness, and on account of the singular tele
 graphic application in which electric conduct'vity is made to
perform the functions of both the real k and the unreal g.
    Let
              Pi = ivk/2c, p=Pl + p2, v = {fic)~K |
              p2 = iirgl2ii, <r=Pl—p2,                    ) '
    The speed of propagation of all disturbances is v, and the
attenuating effects due to the two conductivities depend
upon pi and p2, whilst a determines the distortion due to
conductivity.
    2. General Solutions.—Let q1 denote the operator
                         q*=-{v curl)8 + <72;                         (5)

work which it is not necessary to give, that, given E0, H0, the
values of E and H when f = 0, and satisfying (1) and (2),

          Equations in a Homogeneous Isotropic Medium.           31
    A sufficient proof is the srtisfaction of the equations (1),
(2), and of the two initial coud:tions.
    in alternative form of (7) is
             E = e-"'[cosh qt + ^-2? O + p)]E0,"(
                                  • I ,              }   •  •  (7a)

showing the derivation of E from E0 and pEo in precisely the
same way as H from Ho and pH0. In this form of solution
the initial values of jdEo and joHo occur. But they are not
arbitrary, being connected by equations (1), (2). The form
(7) is much more convenient, involving only E0 and H0 as
functions of position, although (7 a) looks simpler. The form
 (7) is also the more useful for interpretat'ons and derivations.
    If, then, Eo and Ho bo given as continuous functions ad
 mitting of the performance of the differentiations involved in
 the functions of qi, (7) will give the required solutions. The
 original field should therefore be a real one, not involving
 discontinuities. We shall now consider special cases.
    3. Persistence or Subsidence of Polar Fields.—We see im
 mediately by (7) that the E resulting from Ho depends so'ely
 upon its curl, or on the initial electric current, and, similarly,
 that the H due to E0 depends solely upon its curl, or on the
 magnetic current. Notice also that the displacement due to H^
 is related to H0 in the same way as the induction -=— 4w due
 to E0 is related to E0. Or, if it be the electric and magnet'c
 currents that are considered, the displacement due to electric
 current is related to it in the same way as the induction
 -t-4tt due to magnetic current is related to it.
    Observe also that in passing from the E due to E0 to the H
 due to H0 the sign of a is changed.
     By (7) a distribution of H0 which has no curl, or a polar
 magnetic field, does not, in subsiding, generate electric force ;
 and, similarly, a polar electric field does not, in subsiding,
 generate magnetic force. Let then E0 and Ho bo polar fields,
 in the first place. Then, by (5),
 that is, a constant, and using this in (7) we reduce the general
 solutions to
                      E=E0e-2"'<,      H = H0€-^'                 (8)
     The subsidence of the electric field requires electric conduc
  tivity, that of the magnetic field requires magnetic conductivity;

32       Mr. 0. Heaviside on Maxwell's Electromagnetic
but the two phenomena are wholly independent. The first of
(8) is equivalent to Maxwell's solution . The second is its
magnetic analogue.
    As, in the first case, there must be initial electrification, so
in the second, there should be " magnetification/' its volume-
density to be measured by the divergence of the induction
-t-Att. Now the induction can have no divergence. But it
might have, if g existed.
    There is no true electric current during the subsidence of
Eo, and there would be no true magnetic current during the
subsidence of H0. In both cases the energy is frictionally
dissipated on the spot, or there is no transfer of energyf. The
application of (8) will be extended later.
    4. Purely Solenoidal Fields.—By a purely solenoidal field
I mean one which has no divergence anywhere. Any field
vanishing at infinity may be uniquely divided into two fields,
one of which is polar, the other solenoidal ; the proof thereof
resting upon Sir W. Thomson's well-known theorem of De
terminancy. Now we know exactly what happens to the
polar fields. Therefore dismiss them, and let 1^ and H0 be
solenoidal. Then
                               q*=v*V* + a*,                              (9)
where V2 is the usual Laplacean operator. Of course cosh gt
and g~] sinh gt are rational functions of g*, so that if the dif
ferentiations are possible we shall obtain the solutions out of
                 .

 polar electric and magnetic fields be equal. We then have

 in the solutions (7). The fields change in precisely the same
 manner as if the medium were nonconducting, as regards the
 relative values at different places ; that is, there is no distor
 tion due to the conductivities ; but there is a uniform subsi
 dence all over brought in by them}, expressed by the factor
 e-*1'. This property I have explained by showing the opposite
 nature of the tails left behind by a travelling plane wave
 according as <r is + or — .

is the required condition. Therefore c and fi may vary any
how, independently, provided k and g vary similarly*. The
impressed forces should subside according to e-,)', in order to
preserve similarity to the phenomena in a nonconducting
dielectric.
    Observe that there will be tailing now, on account of the
variability of (/*/c)* or pv. That is, there are reflexions and
refractions due to change of medium. The peculiarity is that
they are of the same nature with as without conductivity.
    6. First Special Case.—A special case of (11) is given by
taking /* = 0 and g=0 j that is, a real conducting dielectric
possessing no magnetic inductivity, in which k/c is constant.
If the initial field be polar, then
                      E^e-?',                 H=0                  (12)
This extension of Maxwell's before-mentioned solution I have
given before, and also the extension to any initial field,
and the inclusion of impressed forcesf. The theory of the
result has considerable light now thrown upon it.
    If the initial field be arbitrary, the solenoidal part of the flux
displacement disappears instantly, therefore (12) is the solu
tion, provided E0 means the polar part of the initial field; that
is, E0 must have no curl, and the flux cE0/47r must have the
same divergence as the arbitrarily given displacement.
    Now an impressed force e produces a solenoidal flux only.
Therefore it produces its full effect and sets up the appropriate

was described only in reference to a homogeneous medium.

34       Mr. 0. Heaviside on Maxwell's Electromagnetic
steady flux instantaneously ; and all variations of e in time
and in space are kept time to without lag by the conduction-
current in spite of the electric displacement.
    This property is seemingly completely at variance with ideas
founded upon the retardation usually asLOciated with combi
nations of resistances and condensers. But, being a special
case of the nondistortional theory, we can now understand it.
For suppose we start with a nonconducting dielectric, and put
on e uniform within a spherical portion thereof, and send out
an electromagnetic wave to infinity and set up the steady flux.
On now removing e, we send out another wave to infinity,
and the flux vanishes. Now make the medium conducting,
with both conductivities balanced, as in (10). Starting with
the same steady flux, its vanishing will take place in the same
manner precisely, but with an attenuation factor e-'''. Now
fradually reduce g and fi at the same time, in the same ratio,
   he vanishing of the flux will take place faster and faster,
and in the limit, when both fi and g are zero, will take place
 instantly, not by subsidence, but by instantaneous transference
 to an infinite distance when the impressed force is removed,
 owing to v being made infinite.
    7. Second Special Case. —There is clearly a similar property
when k=0 and c= 0, that is, in a medium possessing mag
netic inductivity and conductivity, but deprived of the electric
correspondences. Thus, when g/fi is constant, the solution
due to any polar field H0 is
                       "H=H06-"<,        E = 0;   ....       (13)
wherein p=4vglfi. But a solenoidal field of fiE disappears at
once, by instantaneous transference to infinity. Thus any
varying impressed force h is accompanied without delay by
the corresponding steady flux, the magnetic induction.
    When the inertia associated with /i is considered the result
is rather striking and difficult to understand. It appears,
however, to belong to the same class of (theoretical) pheno
mena as the fol'owing. If a coil in which there is an electric
cuirent be instantaneously shunted on to a second coil in
which there is no current, then, according to Maxwell, the
first coil instantly loses current and the second gains it, in
such a way as to keep the momentum unchanged. Now we
cannot set rp a current in a coil instantly, so that we have a
contradiction. But the disagreement admits of easy re
conciliation. We cannot set up current instantly with a
finite impressed force, but if it be infinite we can. In the case
of the coUs there is an electromotive impulse, or infinite elec
tromotive force acting for an infinitely short time, when the

         Equations in a Homogeneous Isotropic Medium,             35
coils are connected, with corresponding instantaneous changes
in their momenta. A loss of energy is involved.
   It is scarcely necessary to remark that the true physical
theory involves other considerations on account of the dielectric
not being infinitely elastive and on account of diffusion in
the wires ; so that we have sparking and very rapid vibrations
in the dielectric. The energy which is not wasted in the
sp-rk, and which would go out to infinity were there no con
ducing obstacles, is probably all wasi^d practically in the
heat of conduction-currents in them.
   8. Impressed Forces.—Given initially E0 and H0, we know
that the diverging parts must either iemain constant or sub
side, and are, in a manner, self-contained ; but the solenoidal
fields, which would give rise to waves, may be kept from
changing by means of impressed forces e0 and ho. Thus let
Eq and Ho be solenoidal. To keep them steady we have, in
equations (1), (2), to get rid of pE and pTL. Thus
                     curl (H0-h0)=47r£E0, -\
                      curl (e0-Eo)=47r#Ho, J ••••<.'
are the equations of steady fields E0 and H0) these being the
forces of the fluxes. Or
                   curl h0= curl Ho— 47tAEo, 1
                    curl e0=curl E0 + 47ryHo, J
gives the curls of the required impressed forces in terms of
the given fluxes, and any impressed forces having these curls
 will suffice.
    Now, on the sudden removal of e0, ho, the forces E0, H0,
 which had hitherto been the forces of the fluxes, become, in
 stantaneously, the forces of the field as well. That is, the
 fluxes themselves do not change suddenly, except in such a
 case as a tangential discontinuity in a flux produced at a sur
 face of curl of impressed force when, at the surface itself, the
 mean value will be immediately assumed on removal of the
 impressed force. We know, therefore, the effects due to
 certain distributions of impressed force when we know the
 result of leaving the corresponding fluxes to themselves with
 out impressed force. It is, however, the converse of this that
 is practically useful, viz. to find the result of leaving the fluxes
 without impressed force by solving the problem of the esta
 blishment of the steady fluxes when the impressed forces are
 suddenly started ; because this problem can often be attacked
 in a comparatively simple manner, requiring only investigation
 of the appropriate functions to suit the surfaces of curl of the

impressed forces. The remarks in this paragraph are not
limited to homogeneity and isotropy.
   9. Solutions for Plane Waves.—If we take z normal to the
plane of the waves, we may suppose that both E and H have
x and y components. This is, however, a wholly unnecessary
mathematical complication, and it is sufficient to suppose that
E is everywhere parallel to the £-axis and H to the y-axis.
The specification of an initial state is therefore E0, H0, the
tensors of E and H, given as functions of z; and the equations
of motion (1), (2) become
                     -d^=(_M + cp)E, )

                     ___=(4^+^)H. )
   Now the operator q3 in (5) becomes
                         <f = viy* + o3 ;                     (16)
where by V we may now understand djdz simply. Therefore,
by (7), the solutions of (15) are
    E = e-*[(cosh qt- | sinh ?<)eo- ™±2il H0].
                                                              (17)
   H = e-<*[(cosh qt+ * sinh qt)H0- 6^^E0].
                                                           }
When the initial states are such as aebc, or a cos bz, the reali
zation is immediate, requiring only a special meaning to be
given to q in (17). But with more useful functions as ae-*1*,
&a, &c, there is much work to be performed in effecting the
differentiations, whilst the method fails altogether if the initial
distribution is discontinuous.
   But we may notice usefully that when E0 and H0 are
constants the solutions are
                 E = e-*>'E«,        H=e-WH0, . . . (18)
which are quite independent of one another. Further, since
disturbances travel at speed v, (18) represents the solutions in
any region in which E0 and H0 are constant, from t = 0 up to
the later time when a disturbance arrives from the nearest
plane at which E0 or H0 varies.
   10. Fourier Integrals.—Now transform (17) to Fourier
integrals. We have Fourier's theorem,

and E0, H0 are to be expressed as functions of a, whilst E and
H belong to z. Discontinuities are now attackable.
    The integrations with respect to m may be effected. In
fact, I have done it in three different ways. First by finding
the effect produced by impressed force. Secondly, by an
analogous method applied to (17), transforming the differen
tiations to integrations. Thirdly, by direct integration of
 (21) ; this is the most difficult of all. The first method was
given in a recent paper* ; a short statement of the other two
methods follows.
    11. Transformation of (17).—In (17) we naturally consider
the functions of qt to be expanded in rising powers of a9, and
therefore of V3, leading to differentiations to be performed
upon the initial states. But if we expand them in descending
powers of V> we substitute integrations, and can apply them
to discontinuous initial distribution.
    The following are the expansions required :—

(36) and H in (37) must be true on both sides of the origin; on
expanding them in powers of z we consequently find that the
coefficients of the odd powers of z vanish, by the first of (28),

in powers of z we get rid of the even powers of z, and produce
the solutions given by me in a previous paper", which, how

to the above distributions, we find those due to initial E0da at
the origin, or H0da, by differentiation to z ; and for this we
do not need the firsts of (36) and (37) but only the seconds.

Thus, in (48) if z>vt, since first term vanishes, so do all the
rest, because their values are deduced from that of the first by
integrations to t, which during the integrations is always < z/v.
Therefore the value of the left number of (45) is zero -when
z>vt. In another form, disturbances cannot travel faster
than at speed v.
   But when z < vt in (48), it is clear that whilst t' goes from

    15. Interpretation of Results.—Having now given a con
 densation of the mathematical work, we may consider, in
 conclusion, the meaning and application of the formulae. In
 doing so, we shall be greatly assisted by the elementary theory
 of a telegraphic circuit. It is not merely a mathematically
 analogous theory, but is, in all respects save one, essentially
 the same theory, physically, and the one exception is of a
 remarkable character. Let the circuit consist of a pair of
 equal parallel wires, or of a wire with a coaxial tube for the
 return, and let the medium between the wires be slightly
 conducting. Then, if the wires had no resistance, the problem
 of the transmission of waves would be the above problem of
 plane waves in a real dielectric, that is, with constants       c,
 and k, but without the magnetic conductivity; i. e. #=0 in
 the above.
     The fact that the lines of magnetic and electric force are no
  longer straight is an unessential point. But it is, for conve
  nience, best to take as variables, not the forces, but their
  line-integrals. Thus, if V be the line-integral of E across the
  dielectric between the wires, V takes the place of E. Thus
  &E, the density of the conduction-current, is replaced by
  KV, where K is the conductance of the dielectric per unit
  length of circuit, and cEjiir, the displacement, becomes SV,
  where S is the permittance per unit length of circuit. The
  density of electric current cpE/irr is then replaced by SpY.
  Also SV is the charge per unit length of circuit.
     Next, take the line-integral of H/47T round either conductor
  for magnetic variable. It is C, usually called the current in
  the wires. Then j*H, the induction, becomes LC ; where LO
  is the momentum per unit length of circuit, L being the
  inductance, such that LSw8=/*cc*=l.
     A more convenient transformation (to minimize the trouble
  with 4*r's) is
                        A*toL,     etoS,     47r£toK.

44       Mr. 0. Heaviside on Maxwell's Electromagnetic
    Now, lastly, the wires have resistance, and this is without
any representation whatever in a real dielectric. But, as J
have before shown, the effect of the resistance of the wires in
attenuating and distorting waves is, to a first approximation
 (ignoring the effects of imperfect penetration of the magnetic
field into the wires), representable in the same manner exactly
as the corresponding effects due to g, the hypothetical mag
netic conductivity of a dielectric*. Thus, in addition to the
above,
                         47r<7 becomes R,
R being the resistance of the circuit per unit length.
    16. In the circuit, if infinitely long and perfectly insulated,
the total charge is constant. This property is independent of
the resistance of the wires. If there be leakage, the charge
Q at time t is expressed in terms of the initial charge Qq by
                             Q=Qoe-K,/s,
independent of the way the charge redistributes itself.
   In the general medium, the corresponding property is per
sistence of displacement, no matter how it redistributes itself,
provided k be zero, whatever g may be. And, if there be
electric conductivity,
                 ^J — tn        » — go   /
where D0 is the initial displacement, and D that at time t,
functions of z.
   In the circuit, if the wires have no resistance, the total
momentum remains constant, however it may redistribute
itself. This is an extension of Maxwell's well-known theory
of a linear circuit of no resistance. The conductivity of the
dielectric makes no difference in this property, though it
causes a loss of energy. When the wires have resistance,
then
                                               6—R</L
expresses the subsidence of total momentum ; and this is
independent of the manner of redistribution of the magnetic
field and of the leakage.
   In the general medium, when real, the corresponding pro
perty is persistence of the induction (or momentum) ; and
when g is finite,

        Equations in a Homogeneous Isotropic Medium.            45
   In passing, I may remark that, in my interpretation of
Maxwell's views, it is not his vector-potential A, the so-called,
electrokinetic momentum, that should have the physical idea
of momentum associated with it, but the magnetic induction B.
To illustrate, consider Maxwell's theory of a linear circuit of
no resistance, the simplest case of persistence of momentum.
We may express the fact by saying that the induction through
the circuit remains constant, or that the line-integral of A
along or in the circuit remains constant. These are perfectly
equivalent. Now if we pass to an infinitely small closed
circuit, the line-integral of A becomes B itself (per unit area).
But if we consider an element of length only, we get lost at
once.
   Again, the magnetic energy heing associated with B,
(and H), so should be the momentum.
   Suppose also we take the property that the line-integral of
 —A is the E.M.F. in a circuit, and then consider —A as the
electric force of induction at a point. Its time-integral is A.
But this is an electromotive impulse, not momentum.
   Lastly, whilst B (or H) defines a physical property at a
point, A does not, but depends upon the state of the whole
field, to an infinite distance. In fact it sums up, in a certain
way, the effect which would arise at a point from disturbances
coming to it from all parts of the field. It is therefore, like
 the scalar electric potential, a mathematical concept merely,
not indicative in any way of the actual state of the medium
anywhere.
   The time-integral of H, whoso curl is proportional to the
displacement, has equal claims to notice as a mathematical
 function which is of occasional use for facilitating calculations,
 but which should not, in my opinion, be elevated to the rank
 of a fundamental quantity, as was done by Maxwell with
respect to A.
    Independently of these considerations, the fact that A has
 often a scalar potential parasite, and also the other function,
 causes sometimes great mathematical complexity and indi
 stinctness ; and it is, for practical reasons, best to murder the
 whole lot, or at any rate merely employ them as subsidiary
functions.
    17. Returning to the telegraph-circuit, let the initial state
 be one of uniform V on the whole of the left side of the origin,
 V=0 on the right side, and C = 0 everywhere. The diagram
 will serve to show roughly what happens in the three principal
 cases.
    First of all we have ABCD to represent the curve of V0,
 the origin being at C. When the disturbance has reached Z,

46        Mr. 0. Heaviside on Maxwell's Electromagnetic
that is when < = UZ/u, the curve is A L 1 1 1 Z f there be no
leakage, when R and L are such that e_i" =£. At the
 origin V = |V<» at the front V = £V0, and at the back
 V=|V0.
    Now introduce leakage to make R/L = K/S.                    Then
 2 2 2 2 1 Z shows the curve of V, provided e-K'/s =£. We
 have V = £V0 on the left, and V = £V0 in the rest.
    Thirdly, let the leakage be in excess. Then, when V0 has
 fallen, by leakage only, to £V0 on the left, the curve 3 3 3 3 1 Z
 shows V ; it is -jV^o ^ the origin, — |V0 at the back, and
 ^V0 at the front.
     Of course there has to be an adjustment of constants to
 make e -(- KtL + ->
                  2S be the same \ in all cases, viz. the attenua
 tion at the front.
     18. Precisely the same applies when it is C0 that is initially
 given instead of V0, provided we change the sign of <r. That
 is, we have the curve 1 when the leakage is in excess, and the
 curve 3 when the leakage is smaller than that required to
 produce nondistortional transmission.
     19. Now transferring attention to the general medium, if
 we make the substitution of magnetic conductivity for the
 resistance of the wires, the curve 1 would apply when it is E0
 that is the initial state and g in excess, and 3 when it is defi
  cient ; whilst if H0 is the initial state, 1 applies when g is
 deficient, and 3 when in excess. But g is really zero, so we
 have the curve 1 for that of H and 3 for that of E.
     This forcibly illustrates the fact that the diffusion of charge
 in a submarine cable and the diffusion of magnetic disturb
  ances in a good conductor, though mathematically analogous,
  are physically quite different. They are both extreme cases
  of the same theory ; but they arise by going to opposite ex
  tremities ; with the peculiar result that, whereas the time-
  constant of retardation in a submarine cable is proportional to
  the resistance of the wire, that in the wire itself is proportional
  to its conductivity.
     20. Going back to the diagram, if we shift the curves bodily

          Equations in a Homogeneous Isotropic Medium.                   47
through unit distance to the left, and then take the difference
between the new and the old curves, we shall obtain the curves
showing how an initial distribution of V or C through unit-
distance at the origin divides and spreads. In the case of
curve 2, we have clean splitting without a trace of diffusion.
In the other cases there is a diffused disturbance left behind
between the terminal waves, positive in case 1, negative in
case 3. But I have sufficiently described this matter in a
former paper*.
   October 18, 1888.
                               Postscript.
        On the Metaphysical Nature of the Propagation of the
                                Potentials.
    At the recent Bath Meeting of the British Association there
 was considerable discussionf in Section A on the question of
 the propagation of electric potential. I venture therefore to
 think that the following remarks upon this subject may be of
 interest.
    According to the way of regarding the electromagnetic
 quantities I have consistently carried out since January 1885,
 the question of the propagation of, not merely the electric
 potential          but the vector potential A, does not present
 itself as one for discussion ; and, when brought forward,
 proves to be one of a metaphysical nature.
     We make acquaintance, experimentally, not with potentials,
 but with forces, and we formulate observed facts with the
 least amount of hypothesis, in terms of the electric force E
 and magnetic force H. In Maxwell's development of Fara
 day's views, E and H actually represent the state of the
 medium anywhere. (It comes to the same thing if we con
 sider the fluxes, but less conveniently in general.) Granting
 this, it is perfectly obvious that in any case of propagation,
 since it is a physical state that is propagated, it is E and H
 that are propagated.
     Now, in a limited class of cases, E is expressible as — V^r.
  Considerations of mathematical simplicity alone then direct

48       Mr. 0. Heaviside on Maxwell's Electromagnetic
(except in the very artificial form of balanced exchanges).
 When there is propagation, and H is involved, we have
                          E = -V^-A.
Now this is, not an electromagnetic law specially, but strictly
a truism, or mathematical identity. It becomes electromag
netic by the definition of A,
                           curl A=/aH,
leaving A indeterminate as regards a diverging part, which,
however, we may merge in — V^- Supposing, then, A and
"9 to become fixed in this or some other way, the next ques
tion in connexion with propagation is, Can we, instead of the
propagation of E and H, substitute that of "9 and A, and
obtain the same knowledge, irrespective of the artificiality
of "9 and A ? The answer is perfectly plain—we cannot do
so. We could only do it if 9, A, given everywhere, found £
and H. But they cannot. A finds H, irrespective of ^9, but
both together will not find E. We require to know a third
vector, A, Thus we have "9, A, and A required, involving
seven scalar specifications to find the six in E and H. Of these
three quantities, the utility of A is simply to find H, so that
we are brought to a highly complex way of representing the
propagation of E in terms of ^9 and A, giving no information
about H, which is, it seems to me, as complex and artificial
as it is useless and indefinite.
   Again, merely to emphasize the preceding, the variables
chosen should be capable of representing the energy stored.
Now the magnetic energy may be expressed in terms of A,
though with entirely erroneous localization ; but the electric
energy cannot be expressed in terms of 9. Maxwell (chap,
xi. vol. ii.) did it, but the application is strictly limited to
electrostatics ; in fact, Maxwell did not consider electric
energy comprehensively. The full representation in terms of
potentials requires SP and Z, the vector-potential of the mag
netic current. [This is developed in my work " On Electro
magnetic Induction and its Propagation," Electrician, 1885.]
This inadequacy alone is sufficient to murder         and A, con
sidered as subjects of propagation.
   Now take a concrete example, leaving the abstract mathe
matical reasoning. Let there bo first no E or H anywhere.
To produce any, impressed force is absolutely needed. Let it
be impressed e, and of the simplest type, viz. an infinitely
extended plane sheet of e of uniform intensity, acting nor
mally to the plane. What happens ? Nothing at all. Yet

         Equations in a Homogeneous Isotropic Medium.         49
the potential on one side of the plane is made greater by the
amount e (tensor of e) than on the other side. Say 9 = %e
and — ^e. Thus we have instantaneous propagation of "9 to
infinity. I prefer, however, to say that this is only a mathe
matical fiction, that nothing is propagated at all, that the
electromagnetic mechanism is of such a nature that the ap
plied forces are balanced on the spot, that is, in the sheet, by
the reactions.
   To emphasize this again, let the sheet be not infinite, but
have a circular boundary. Let the medium be of uniform
inductivity fi, and permittivity c. Then, irrespective of its
conductivity, disturbances are propagated at speed r=(fj.c)~i,
 and their source is the vortex-line of e, on the edge of the
disk. At any time t less than a/r, where a is the radius of
 the disk, the disturbance is confined within a ring whose axis
is the vortex-line. Everywhere else E = 0 and H = 0. On
the surface of the ring, E=/trH, and E and H are perpendi
cular ; there can be no normal component of either.
   Now we can naturally explain the absence of any flux in
the central portion of the disk by the applied forces being
balanced by the reactions on the spot, until the wave arrives
 from the vortex-line. But how can we explain it in terms of
9, seeing that "9 has now to change by the amount e at the
disk, and yet be continuous everywhere else outside the ring?
We cannot do it, so the propagation of 9 fails altogether.
Yet the actions involved must be the same whether the disk
be small or infinitely great. We must therefore give up the
idea altogether of the propagation of a 9 to balance impressed
force. In the ring itself, however, we may regard the pro
pagation of* (a different one), A, and A ; or, more simply,
of E and H.
   If there be no conductivity, the steady electric field is
assumed anywhere the moment the two waves from opposite
ends of a diameter of the disk coexist ; that is, as soon as the
wave arrives from the more distant end (Phil. Mag. May
1888*). But this simplicity is quite exceptional, and seems
to be confined to plane and spherical waves. In general
there is a subsidence to the steady state after the initial
phenomena.
   If it be remarked that incompressibility (or something equi
valent or resembling it) is needed in order that the medium
may behave as described (i. e. no flux except at the vortex-
line initially), and that if the medium be compressible we
shall have other results (a pressural wave, for example, from
the disk generally), the answer is that this is a wholly inde-

 though perhaps needing consideration in some other theory.
 But the moment we let the electric current have divergence
 (the absence of which makes the vortex-lines of e to be the
 sources of disturbances), we at once (in my experience) get
 lost in an almost impenetrable fog of potentials. Maxwell's
 theory unamended, on the other hand, works perfectly and
 without a trace of indefiniteness, provided we regard E and H
 as the variables, and discard his " equations of propagation "
 containing the two potentials.

 V. On the Upper Limit of Refraction in Selenium and Bromine.
                 By Rev. T. Pelham Dale, M.A.*
 IN my former paper read before the Society f I showed that
        the value of the limit could be found by the solution of
 the equation
                            asin#= sinwitf;
 where a is the ratio of wave-lengths in free aethor, and 6—
h being what I there called the molecular distance, and I the
corresponding wave-length within the medium. If a sin 6 be
greater than unity, the solution is imaginary.

If on further examination this upper limit should be estab

    Now since sin (ir— ff) is equally a solution of the equation,
 a sin 8= sin m6, it is probable therefore that this solution may
 have a physical meaning.
    It was noticed in my former paper that, of the substances
 for which data were at hand, selenium alone had its upper
 limit within the visible spectrum. Accordingly a fresh cal
 culation of the values of 0k, v, and Xt were made and the
 results given below (Table I.).
    It will be seen from the table that the limiting wave-length
 which is transmissible is X= 5295*7. This is a little below
 XE, which is 5269'13. It was of great interest to observe how
 far this purely theoretical result would be supported by obser
 vation. As neither temperature nor specific gravity of spe
 cimen were given, and the indices of refraction to the third
 place of decimals only, it was evident that, as a preliminary
experiment, all that could be sought for was a general
 agreement.
    With this in view I had a Browning amateur spectroscope-
eyepiece fitted to my microscope, an old instrument constructed
many years ago by Troughton and Sims. After a few trials
I succeeded in obtaining a tolerably uniform film of selenium
mounted as an ordinary microscope-slide. The film when
cold was quite transparent, and transmitted a deep ruby tint.
This film was found under the spectroscope to transmit rays
nearly to the line D. Another and thinner slide was prepared.
Under the microscope the thinner portions were found to bo
of a more orange tint, due to a spectrum reaching to the
beginning of the green. Even in brilliant sunlight no sen
sible extension beyond this took place. In parts of the film
were holes. If these were in the field they appeared as
spectra extending to the violet end, but with sharp well-
defined sides, showing apparently that a very thin film was
effective to stop all the upper rays. Thus, then, the agree
ment of theory and observation seems as satisfactory as could
be anticipated, considering both the data and instrumental
means employed.
    The examination of sulphur gave similar results. Here the
limiting wave-length lies beyond the visible spectrum. A
film of melted sulphur transmits yellow light. This film
darkens rapidly as the temperature rises, and when the sul
phur begins to boil, it, as is well known, assumes a brownish
tint. Examined under the spectro-microscope, it is seen that

            ofRefraction in Selenium and Bromine.              53
the absorption is confined to the violet end. If the film be
placed boiling under the spectro-microscopo, the spectrum is
seen to be generally darkened till near the red end, and tho
violet quite cut off. As the film cools, the resulting dark
cloud seems to recede towards the violet. If the film be very
thin it appears colourless to the eye, and under the spectro
scope the violet is visible. It remains colourless after the
sulphur has crystallized, appearing nearly white to the eye.
Selenium also darkens rapidly by heat and then transmits a
greyish light, which is probably due to its breaking up into
crystals. It has, however, the property of becoming more
transparent as it cools. Thus the optical properties of these
two substances are as remarkably similar as are their che
mical relations.
   It will be observed that the quantity V t~, though by no
means the same in both selenium and sulphur, are not far
apart. There is, however, another relation which exists ; it
is expressed by the formula, that in selenium,
                       Ka.-l=(va-l) j;
where vs is limit of refraction of sulphur, E its equivalent, and
d its density. That is, that the refraction-equivalent of sele
nium can be found by multiplying the refraction-equivalent
of sulphur by tho equivalent of selenium divided by the den
sity of that element. This is worthy of remark, as it appears
that the same relation within five or six units in the second
place of decimals between isobutyl iodide as compared with
isobutyl chloride, and orthobromotoluine compared with eldoro-
toluine and benzyl chloride. With regard to benzyl chloride,
I may mention that calculation for the upper limit has revealed
an error due to extracting the wrong logarithm of sin 0A. The
correct result given below agrees better with the rule that
v— 1 .
—^— is constant in isomeric bodies. As in the case of two
isomeric bodies, the equivalent is the same in both, it will be
seen that this result is in agreement with the relation be
tween selenium and sulphur stated above.
    It is worthy of note that chlorine and bromine resemble
sulphur and selenium in tint of transmitted light. The index
of refraction for the line A in bromine is /tA = l,6260. It
 occurred to me that it would be possible to obtain a probable
 idea of the spectrum of this element by assuming an upper
 limit of refraction. Taking this limit as D and 1, to which
I subsequently added G, I found that F gave f?A = 3lJ° 44',

54         Rev. T. Pelham Dale on the Upper Limit
v= 1-4988, and the refraction-equivalent 13'1. Dr. Gladstone,
calculating from A, gives as a probable value 15*3, which
would necessarily be greater than that obtained from the limit.
A refraction-equivalent for v obtained from orthobromotoluine
showed that for this substance the refraction-equivalent for v
was between 14 and 15. If we assume G- as the limit, then
bromine comes out as 13"7. I subsequently procured a spe
cimen of bromine. In as thin a film as I could produce, the
spectra of bromine and selenium were almost indistinguish
able ; but the tint of bromine is decidedly more orange, and
its vapour transmitted rays up to F certainly, and perhaps
beyond ; but in the brightest sunlight, and even when mixed
with air, there was no indication of violet rays. So far as
these very imperfect observations extend, they seem to support
the conclusions previously arrived at by calculation. Without
venturing, then, to speak at all decisively, the subject seems
a promising one and likely to repay further investigation.
   In the absence of data as to the spectrum of liquid chlorine,
it is useless to make calculations as to any relations which
might be found to subsist between it and bromine. It is,
however, of importance to observe that its yellow tint is so
similar to that of sulphur, that it is not improbable that the
same portions of the spectrum would bo affected in both. If
this on further examination should turn out to be the fact, it
would be one step more towards the attainment of the form
of the function /i = $(\), which would probably reveal rela
tions of great interest toward determining the chemical con
stitution of bodies.
   In the case of the critical angle the imaginary sine corre
sponds with the change from refraction to total reflexion.
And this, again, to alteration of phase in the wave of the
polarized ray. Is there anything similar in the limit of refrac
tion ? I think there is. If a mirror be constructed by melting
selenium on a glass slide and then pressing on it a somewhat
cooler glass, we shall obtain a reflecting surface on remo
ving the glass, and also another on the corresponding surface
attached to the glass. At angles near perpendicular incidence
the reflected light has a certain greenish tint. This is more
apparent on the side next the glass than on the free reflecting
surface, but is very evident in both. It is no doubt to be
expected that light not transmitted should in certain cases be
reflected. If it be absorbed there must be an expenditure of
energy within the medium, which we have every reason to
believe acts on the wave-length within the medium and the
velocity of its transmission. Ihe importance of selenium is
that it is a manageable substance, in which the critical point

              of Refraction in Selenium and Bromine.                        55
of transmission lies near the middle of the luminous spectrum.
Bromine would no doubt prove equally interesting, but is by
no means a pleasant substance to handle.
   I should hardly have ventured to come before the Society
¦with these very rough experiments, had I not hoped that
some who possessed the instrumental means would be induced
to make the observations. For my own part I am more than
content with the humble though somewhat laborious office of
computer between mathematical investigator and observer.

    The above investigation was undertaken in connexion with
 a measurement of a resistance in absolute measure by the
 method of Lorenz, which I propose making in the Physical
 Laboratory at Cardiff. The standard coil which I have con
 structed for this purpose consists of a helix of copper wire, of

62    Capt. Abney on the Measurement of the Luminosity and
diameter "02 inch, wound in a screw-thread of pitch "025
inch, cut in our Whitworth lathe on a brass cylinder of dia
meter 22 inches, the number of turns of wire being 185. For
such a coil it seemed probable that Lord Rayleigh's formula,
which is a first .approximation, might not give a result of
sufficient accuracy for the purpose in view ; and when Lord
Rayleigh, with whom I had the privilege of speaking on the
matter last summer, expressed this opinion, it became clear
that a formula embodying a closer approximation would have
to be worked out. This might be done by considering the
helix as a current-sheet, and proceeding to a second approxi
mation on this hypothesis. But it seemed to me preferable
to make a direct attempt at integration for the case of helix and
circle, though I hardly anticipated that I should arrive in the
result at a formula of such simplicity as that given above.
    It is interesting to observe that, by Lord Rayleigh's for
mula, the coefficient of mutual induction of the circle and
helix taken above for purposes of calculation comes out to be
                            nx53-317.
The difference between the two results is about one tenth per
cent.

VII. On the Measurement of the Luminosity and Intensity
    of Light reflected from Coloured Surfaces. By Capt. W.
    de W. Abney, C.B., R.E., F.R.S*
IN a communicationf to the Royal Society General Festing
       and myself have shown how to compare the light of the
different parts of the spectrum reflected from a white surface
with that reflected from a coloured surface, and we gave the
results of measurements of various colours, and from these
constructed their luminosity curves by means of the lumi
nosity curve of the spectrum of white light, which we had
ascertained from our previous researches on Colour Photo
metry (Bakerian Lecture 1886). From the areas of these
curves we deduced the total luminosity of these colours, com
pared with that of a white surface. Certain colours were
combined by means of rotating sectors to form a grey, and
this was matched with the grey formed by rotating sectors
of black and white. By noting the angular value of each

     Intensity ofLight reflected from Coloured Surfaces.       63
coloured sector, and of the black and white sectors, it was
found that the luminosity curves of the colours were correct.
   This is an indirect, though very accurate, method of
ascertaining the luminosity of a coloured surface, and re
quires more time than can often be spared with that object
in view. Professor 0. Rood, in his " Modern Chromatics,"
indicates the manner in which he proceeds, which is as follows.
He finds " that with the aid of rotating disks tho second con
stant of colour (luminosity) can often be determined. Let us
suppose we wish to determine the luminosity of paper painted
with vermilion : a circular disk about six inches in diameter is
cut from the paper and placed on a rotation apparatus . . On
the same axis is fastened a double disk of black and of white
paper, so arranged that the proportions of black and white
can be varied at will. When the whole is set in rapid rota
tion the colour of the vermilion paper will of course not bo
altered, but the black and white will blend into a grey. This
grey can be altered in its brightness till it seems about as
luminous as the red." He then proceeds to give examples.
This method must not only bo difficult to mnnage, but also
must be tedious before the match can be determined. A
method based on the same plan is given later in this paper,
which makes the matching of the luminosities more easy.
   The following plan, however, I venture to think is much
simpler and more certain in result, and is essentially founded on
the method which General Festing and myself adopted in mea
suring the luminosity of the spectrum itself. In that we found
that any coloured light might be compared with any other or with
white light by rapidly changing the luminosity of one colour,
when the two were in juxtaposition, making it first decidedly
too light and then too dark, and then gradually diminishing
the oscillations until an equality of luminosity was obtained.
The two colours were placed alongside one another, it may
be recollected, by means of the Kumford method of shadows.
In the case of the spectrum the rapid diminution in lumi
nosity from the yellow to each end of the spectrum enabled
the change of luminosity to be quickly made by sliding the
card containing the slit (which allowed a slice of coloiired
light to pass and to subsequently form a patch of that colour
on the screen) along tLe spectrum on each side of the maxi
mum, and then noting the position of the colour, which
balanced a white light of known intensity. In the case of
the measurement of the luminosity of coloured paper, this
method evidently was inapplicable, and it remained to devise
some other.
   In our former experiments of the measurement of light

64   Capt. Abney on the Measurement of the Luminosity and
reflected from coloured surfaces, General Festing and myself
employed rotating sectors, movable when in motion, but the
motion was slow, being effected by means of a screw. Mr.
Hilger, in whose hands was placed a rough design for an
improved set of rotating sectors, produced an instrument in
which the sectors would be opened and closed rapidly by
means of a simple lever arrangement without any screw-
motion. The instrument is shown in the accompanying
figure. A, B are the sectors which can be opened at pleasure
by means of the lever, D, moving along an arc, C, on which
is a scale of degrees. The sectors are rotated by a small
electromotor, with sufficient speed to prevent scintillation.
   The apparatus at once got over the difficulty of getting a

      Intensity ofLight reflected from Coloured Surfaces.      65
Supposing the luminosity of a vermilion-coloured surface had
to be compared with a white surface when both were illumi
nated, say, by gas-light, the following procedure was adopted :—
A space of such a size was cut out of black paper that one
side was rather less than twice the breadth of the rod used
to cast a shadow. One half of the aperture was filled with
a white surface and the other half with the vermilion-coloured
surface. The light L was caused to illuminate the whole of
this, and the rod R placed in such a position that it cast a
shadow on the white surface, the edge of the shadow being
placed accurately at the junction of the vermilion and white
surfaces. A fiat unsilvered mirror M was placed at such a dis
tance and at such an angle that the light it reflected cast a
second shadow on the vermilion surface. Between R and L
were placed the rotating sectors A B. The white strip was then
caused to be evidently too dark and then too light by altering
 the aperture of the sectors, and an oscillation of diminishing
 extent was rapidly made till the two shadows appeared equally
 luminous. A white screen was substituted for the vermilion,
 and again a comparison made. The mean of the two sets of
 readings of angular apertures gave the relative value of
 the two luminosities. It must be stated, however, that if
 the screen remained open, as represented, the values would
 not be correct, since any diffused light which might be in the
 room would relatively illuminate the white surface more than
 the coloured one. To obviate this the receiving screen was
 placed in a box in the front of which a narrow aperture was
 cut just wide enough to allow the two beams to reach the
 screen. An aperture was also cut at the front angle of the
 box through which the observer could see the screen. When
 this apparatus was adopted its efficiency was seen from the
 fact that when the apertures of the rotating sectors were
 closed the shadow on the white surface appeared quite black,
 which it would not have done had there been any diffused light
 in any quantity present within the box. The box, it may be
 stated, was blackened inside and was used in a darkened

 66    Oapt. Abney on the Measurement of the Luminosity and
 chamber. The mirror arrangement was useful, as any varia
 tion in the direct light also showed itself in the reflected light.
 Instead of gas-light, reflected sky-light, the electric light, or
 sunlight can be employed by very obvious artifices ; for it
 must be remembered that the comparison-light may be of any
 kind, and distinct, if necessary, from the light illuminating
 the coloured surface.
    General Festing and myself had measured with great
 care the luminosities of emerald green, vermilion, and ultra
 marine, which we had combined in a rotation apparatus
 to produce a grey. The total luminosity of these three colours I
 measured by the apparatus described, using as the source of
 light to illuminate the colour, the patch of white light
 formed by a recombination of the spectrum, the comparison
 light being an ordinary gas-light.
    The following table gives the values obtained by the spec
trum method and also by the method I now introduce. It will
be seen that the coincidence between the two values is very
close :—

    The exactitude of the latest method is again exemplified,
but it is not pretended that it is quite so accurate as the
older method.
    The method described is particularly adapted to a coloured
surface of small dimensions. Where, however, a circle of
some 3 or 4 inches in diameter can be utilized, the following
modification of Rood's method may be adopted. Behind the
sectors iind on the spindle of the rotating disks, a disk of
white card can be placed. The sectors being blackened on the
 other side, when revolved we can produce any shade of grey,
 from half black and half white to all black. On the other
 side of the sectors can be placed a smaller disk of coloured
 card, to be measured, and this will rotate with the sectors.
 Should the colour be a fairty dull one, the match of luminosity
 can be made by altering the shade of grey by rapid oscillation
 in aperture of the sectors, and the luminosity of the colour
 in terms of white determined when the amount of white
 light reflected from the black surface has been measured.
 Should the colour be more luminous than the grey given by
 half black and half white, the coloured disk can be toned
 down by means of a black semi-disk, adding a known quantity
 of the black surface by Maxwell's plan. The luminosities of
 the surfaces are then measured, and the true luminosity of the
 coloured surface in terms of the white surface, calculated after
 allowing for the added black.
    This same plan may be adopted for measuring the intensity
 of the light of" the various parts of the spectrum reflected from
 a coloured surface, in comparison with that reflected from a
 white surface. Colour patches of monochromatic light are

       Method of Determining Electromagnetic Capacity.             69
formed by the method given in the Philosophical Magazine
for 1885 (vol. xx.), which fall on the coloured disk and tha
rotating sectors, which form a grej' in white light. There is
less difficulty in this case than in ascertaining the luminosity,
as the colour falling on the mixture of black and white is the
same as that falling on the pigment. In this case, too, it
may be necessary to add a fixed amount of black to the coloured
disk in order to get a reading.
VIII. Note on a Modification of the Ordinary Method of
    Determining Electromagnetic Capacity. By J. W. W.
    Waghorn, D.Sc*
THE object of the proposed modification of the ordinary
        well-known method is to enable the capacity of a con
denser or other conductor to be determined with sufficient
accuracy without the costly apparatus generally employed.
    The usual process consists, as is well known, in reading the
" throw," dlt of a galvanometer-needle under the impulse due
to the flow of a quantity of electricity which charges the con
denser to the potential of a certain battery, and in afterwards
reading the steady deflexion, d2 (not very different from
when the galvanometer is connected in series through a total
resistance it.
      Then the required capacity, F (in farads) = ^-Yid- '
where t is the time of one complete vibration of the needle.
    But as " damping " reduces the throw of the needle, the
logarithmic decrement has to be determined and allowance
made accordingly.
    In attempting this determination of capacity with a sensitive
galvanometer not specially designed for ballistic observations,
the difficulties occur that in the first place the resistance, R,
must be very great if d\ is not to be very different from d3 ;
 if the capacity of the condenser is £ microfarad, for example,
 and the time of vibration two seconds, the resistance required
 is more than 600,000 ohms, and these large resistances are not
 always available. Secondly, by reason of the shortness of the
 fibre suspension and its imperfect elasticity, the needle does
 not immediately take up its true position under the forces
 acting upon it, an imperfection which causes the deflexion
 due to the throw of the needle to be unfairly lessened in com
 parison with the steady deflexion against which it is compared;
    * Communicated by the Physical Society : read December 8, 1888.

70         Dr. Waghorn's Modification of the Ordinary
the final result being that in ordinary cases the capacity of
the condenser may work out one, two, or even four per cent,
 less than its true value.
    The first difficulty, the use of very high resistances, can be
 avoided, as suggested by Prof. Ayrton, by reducing the E.M.F.
 of the battery in a known ratio when obtaining the steady
 deflexion ; but the second seems more troublesome to avoid,
 unless we are supplied generally with Mr. Vernon Boys's
 quartz fibres ; but the difficulty may be turned if, instead of
 reading the permanent deflexion of the galvanometer, the
 throw on completing the circuit is read. This throw would, of
 course, if there were no damping, be double the permanent
 deflexion, and the damping need not be allowed for, since it is
 (at least very approximately) the same in the two observations
 made ; that is, in the throw due to charging the condenser and
 also in the first elongation of the needle due to the alteration
in the permanent field.
    The requisite apparatus becomes then very simple, and such
as is always likely to be at hand whenever such observations
 are required, and involves merely resistance-coils of, say, from
 1 to 10,000 ohms with wandering leads, a sensitive galvano
 meter, and battery. A Pohl's commutator or rocking key is
very convenient, but of course not indispensable, for com
paring in rapid succession the two throws which form the
actual experiment.
    The ordinary form of this commutator slightly modified, as
shown, is very conven'ent in all the numerous electrical ob
servations which require a comparison between any two

        Method of Determining Electromagnetic Capacity.        71
deflexions, either steady or momentary, of an instrument such
as a galvanometer or electrometer.
   Let a be the resistance in that part of the resistance-coils
between which the condenser circuit is applied, b the resistance
in that part of the coils between which the permanent current
is applied . The galvanometer itself forms a sufficient resistance
to insert in the permanent-circuit branch, but its resistance
must be known at the temperature at which it is used.
                    „             txdxxb
                    F now =        „    .    .
                              7T x G x d2 X a
   The above expression is not strictly accurate, because damp
ing occurs on an open circuit when the condenser is being
charged, and on a closed circuit when the permanent current
is flowing ; but in a galvanometer with any approach to bal
listic properties the error may be considered as negligible for
ordinary purposes ; for example, the logarithmic decrement
of a galvanometer of 2000 ohms used in this operation on
closed circuit was '0428, on open circuit "0415, involving an
error of only one part in 2000, if the damping is entirely
neglected in the two cases. With a Thomson galvanometer,
in which the decrement reached the value of "56 on open
circuit, the error involved would, however, amount to one per
cent.
   The imperfect elasticity of the fibro may still exert a
small influence, because the needle is swinging for a quarter
period in the condenser charge and for a naif period in the
permanent-current observation ; but if the error is not entirely
obviated, it is brought down to very small limits.

72         Mr. J. Parker on Tltermoelectric Plienomena.
    Any sensitive galvanometer whose time of vibration exceeded
 two seconds, and in which there was not excessive damping,
 would probably be suitable for this determination ; if the
 period is 100 small, among other difficulties, that of self-in
 duction, delaying the passage of the permanent current, would
occur.
    With the apparatus connected as shown to a galvanometer
 whose resistance is known, the actual determination need not
 take more than two or three minutes, and involves but very
 little more trouble than is necessary to determine the capacity
 in terms of a standard condenser, without reposing the confi
 dence which is required in that case. With a galvanometer
 not specially chosen for the purpose, the capacity of a half
 microfarad condenser, tested on several different occasions by
 different observers, gave "497 for the lowest value and '501
 for the highest ; but tested by the ordinary steady-deflexion
 method, the value determined was only -485, the error in
 this case being due entirely to the imperfect elasticity of the
 short fibre suspension.
    The plan is not, however, suggested as a means of stand
ardizing condensers where more refined means are available,
but in the numerous cases where long-fibre ballistic galvano
meters are not at hand and where an accuracy of, say, one
half or one quarter per cent, is deemed sufficient.
  IX. On Thermoelectric Phenomena. By J. Parker, B.A.,
         late Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge*.
THE present short paper is necessary to complete the paper
        which I published on the same subject in the Philoso
phical Magazine in October 1888.
    In that paper, a constant k was discovered which was tacitly
supposed to have different values for different metals. Since
then, however, owing to a suggestion made by Prof. Liveing,
I have been led to reconsider the subject, and I now find that
the constant k must have the same value for all metals. This
remarkable discovery introduces some important simplifi
cations.
    Let two condenser-plates, x, y, of any the same metal be
joined by three wires, A, B, A', as in the figure ; A, A' being
of the same metal as x and y, and B being different. Let the
plates (x, y) and the junction of the wires (B, A') be kept at
the same absolute temperature <0, and the junction of the
wires (A, B) at the absolute temperature i, where t— 10 is
indefinitely small, and = r, say.
                   * Communicated by the Author.

         Mr. J. Parker on Thermoelectric Phenomena.            73
   Parallel and close to the plates (x, y) place equal plates of
any metal whatever, as iron, and connect these iron plates by-
long iron wires with a large distant mass of iron in the neutral
state.
                       A       B          A'
   By slowly separating the plates x, and slowly bringing the
plates y nearer together, let unit charge be made to pass from
x to y, without altering the potential of either x or y. By
equation (o"), the heat absorbed at the junction of the hot and
cold parts of the wire A will be
and at the junction of the hot and cold parts of the metal B,
                         -(*+£)*
Now let the wires A, B, A' be removed ; secondly, reduce the
potential of the plate y to equality with that of x ; thirdly,
make the unit charge return from y to x in a reversible
manner; finally, bring the potential ofy back to its original
value. All this may be accomplished without producing any
thermal effect. A complete reversible cycle of operations
having been performed, we have, by Carnot's principle,

   But we have already seen that

Hence (15) becomes

   Thus, if two portions of the same metal, at different absoluto
temperatures t, t0 respectively, be in contact, and if V, V0 bo
the potentials which they assume, then

where k is a constant which has the same value for all metals.
In other words, the difference of potential depends only on
the temperatures, and is the same for all metals. If, however,
unit charge be made to cross the junction, the heat that must

74                     Geological Society :—
be imparted to the junction to keep its temperature constant
will be different for different metals.
    From the important equation (7) it follows that, supposing
the constant k not to be zero, when contact is made between
two pieces of the same metal at different temperatures, there
will be a temporary current across the junction which is in
the same direction for all metals. From this rule those metals
are excepted which, on being heated, undergo some permanent
molecular change, so that their state is not completely defined
by the pressure and temperature.
    When a thermoelectric circuit is formed of two metals,
equation (9) for the electromotive force takes the simple form
                             E = S-S0,                         (17)
which gives at once the well-known equation
                              n=«f.          ......            a*)
    When the temperatures of the two junctions differ by an
infinitesimal quantity t, we have, instead of (10), the following
form for the electromotive force :—
                            U=".t,                             (19)
a result due to Sir W. Thomson.
    In general, if a thermoelectric circuit be formed of any
number of different metals, and if 8 be the abrupt rise of po
tential at any junction as we travel in the direction of the
current, then evidently       E = 2S                           (20)
If the junctions be all at the same temperature, we have 28=0,
and therefore E = 0.
    I wish to add, in conclusion, that I have lately learned that
the subject of thermoelectricity has been already considered
by Duhem (Annal. de Cliim. Dec. 1887), and that the results
at which he has arrived are in complete accord with those
which I have obtained in my two papers on the subject.

 -*- 1. " The Permian llocks of the Leicestershire Coal-field." By
Horace T. Brown, Esq., P.G.S.
    The author considers that whilst rocks belonging to the Car

        The Permian Rocks of the Leicestershire Coal-field.           75
boniferous and Trias have been mappod as Permian, true represen
tatives of the Permian do exist in the district to a considerable
extent. The Bunter conglomerates rest for the most part upou
the truncated edges of Carboniferous strata ; but intercalated
between them and the Carboniferous, at various points, are thin
beds of purple marly breccias and sandstones seldom exceeding
from 30 to 40 ft., but differing in lithological character from the
overlying and underlying rocks. The brecciated series rests with
striking unconformity upon the Carboniferous. Moreover, tho
Boothorpe fault, which throws the Coal-measures 1000 ft., affects
the overlying brecciated series to an extent of not more than from
20 to 30 ft. The unconformity between the brecciated series and
the Bunter is less obvious. Sections establishing the double un
conformity were described in considerable detail. Attention was
also called to other localities within the Coal-field where Permian
rocks exist, the author having in many cases mappod their boun
daries.
    He further called attention to certain beds which have been
erroneously classed as Permian by the Survey. The first of these
is a patch at Knowle Hills. Making extensive use of the hand-borer,
he found that the greater part of the so-called Permian consists of
 a wedge-shaped piece of Lower Keuper let down by a trough
 fault. The so-called Moira grits belong to aud are conformable
 with the ordinary Coal-measures of the district.
    The lithological characters of the Leicestershire Permians are suf
 ficient to differentiate them from the Trias and Carboniferous.
They consist of red and variegated marls, bands of breccia, and beds
of fine-grained yellowish sandstone ; the breccia fragments are of
great variety and little waterworn. These are imbedded in a bluish-
grey matrix, hard or soft, which consists of insoluble matter united
by the carbonates of lime and magnesia with some hydrated ferrous
oxide, which on exposure becomes oxidized.
    The breccias have a tendency to die out northwards. The most
 abundant materials are quartzo-felspathic grits with associated grey
 flinty slates (Older Palaeozoic), with in addition vein-quartz, volcanic
ash, and igneous rocks. The Carboniferous rocks afford argillaceous
limestone, Mountain Limestone, grits, and htEmatite. At Boothorpe
nearly 90 per cent, is made up of the old Palaeozoic material, whilst
at Newhall Park 28-8 per cent, consists of Carboniferous grits and
haematite. The quartzite fragments resemble those of the lower
part of the Hartshill series, but the existence of " strain shadows "
indicates a difference subsequently explained. Avery few fragments
may be referred to the Charnwood rocks.
    The bulk of the material has a southern origin, and the irregu
larity of the fragments proves that they cannot have come from a
distance. Evidence is given of the probable existence of a ridge of
older Palaeozoics, from which the Carboniferous rocks had been
stripped, beneath the Trias of Bosworth. (There is an actual out
 crop of Stockingford shales at Elmesthorpe.) The direction of this
 line is parallel with the Nuneaton-Hartshill and Charnwood axes of

76                      Geological Society :
elevation, and also with the general direction of the major folds and
faults of the Leicestershire Coal-field. The northern part of this
ridge, which is apparently a faulted anticlinal, is a very probable
source of the angular fragments occurring in the Permian breccias
5 or 6 miles to the north-west.
   The author concluded that the Permian rocks of the Leicestershire
Coal-field belong to the same area of deposition as those of War
wickshire and South Staffordshire, all having formed part of the
detrital deposits of the Permian Lake which extended northwards
from Warwickshire and Worcestershire, and which had the Pennine
chain on its eastern margin. He pointed out the dissimilar nature
of these deposits to those of the eastern side of the Pennine chain
from Nottingham to the coast of Durham. There were proofs
of the existence of a land barrier, owing to the uprising of the
Carboniferous, between the district round Nottingham and the
Leicestershire Coal-field. The most northerly exposure of the Lei
cestershire Permians is 13 miles S.W. of those of South Notts.
He indicated the probable course of the old coast-line of the western
 Permian Lake. Denudation had bared some of the older Palaeozoics
 of their overlying Coal-measures, and it is the rearranged talus
 from the harder portions of these older rocks which now form the
 brecciated bands in the Leicestershire Permians.
   In an Appendix some igneous rocks found in the Bosworth
borings were described.
   2. " On the Superficial Geology of the Central Plateau of North
western Canada." By J. B. Tyrrell, Esq., B.A., F.G.S., Field
Geologist of the Geological and Natural History Survey of Canada.
   The Drift-covered prairie extends from the west side of the Lake
of the Woods to the region at the foot of the Rocky Mountains,
rising from a height of 800 feet on the east to 4500 feet on the
west, the gentle slope being broken by two sharp inclines known
as the Pembina Escarpment and the Missouri Coteau, giving rise to
the First, Second, and Third Prairie Steppes.
   The author described the older rocks of this region, referring
especially to his subdivision of the Laramie Formation into an
Edmonton Series of Cretaceous age, and a Pascapoo Series forming
the base of the Eocene, and then discussed tho Superficial Deposits
in the following order : —
   1. Preglacial gravete occurring along tho foot of the Rocky
Mountains, composed of waterworn quartzite pebbles, similar to
those now forming and, like them, produced by streams flowing from
the mountains.
   2. Boulder-clay or Till, having an average thickness of 50-100
feet, and filling up preexisting inequalities. Tho clay is essentially
derived from the material of the underlj ing rocks. The smoothed
and striated boulders of the western region are largely quartzites
derived from the Rocky Mountains ; these gradually disappear
towards the east, and are replaced by gneisses and other rocks
transported from the east and north-west. Towards the north
west several driftless hills over 4000 feet high appear to have stood

          Superficial Geology of North-western Canada.              77
as islands above the 6heet of ice. Some of the surface erratics of
gneissose rock have doubtless been derived from the Till, whilst
others are connected with moraine deposits, and others, again, appear
to have been dropped from bergs floating in Beas along the ice-
front. The Till is sometimes divisible into a lower massive and
upper rather stratified deposit, separated occasionally by
   3. Interglacial Deposits of stratified material, with seams of im
pure lignite, and shells of Pisidium, Limnaa, Planorbis, &e.
   4. Moraines, which are intimately associated with the Boulder-
clay, and represent terminal moraines of ancient glaciers which
originated upon or crossed the Archaean belt. One of these is the
well-known Missourie Coteau.
   After pointing out the derivation of quartzite pebbles in the
drifts of the eastern region from Miocene conglomerates, and not
directly from the Rocky Mountains, the author described
                         o
   5. The Karnes or Asar generally occurring at the bottoms of
wide valleys, and which resemble in structure those of Scandinavia.
   6. Stratified Deposits and Beach-ridges which have been formed
at tho bottoms and along the margins of freshwater-lakes lying
along the foot of the ice-shect. The principal of these occupied tho
valley of the Red River, and has been called Lake Agassiz ; it had a
length of 600 miles and a width of 170 miles. The author described
in detail the gravel terraces formed around this lake, and showed
that a slow elevation had taken place towards the north and east
Bince their formation. He favoured the view that the waters of
the lake were dammed by the ice towards the north. An account
was given of some quartzite flakes, apparently chipped by human
agency, in one of the terraces of this lake. On the recession of the
ice the southern drainage-channel was abandoned, and a northerly
one opened out.
   7. Old Drainage-channels.—Throughout the whole region old
drainage-channels appear to have been occupied by southerly run
ning rivers (where the present drainage is northerly), and are con
sidered to have carried away the waters draining from the foot of
 the ice. Some of these valleys have been blocked by moraines in
the Duck Mountains, the result of local glaciers.

    W. Whittaker, Esq., B.A., F.R.S., F.G.S., who exhibited a scries of
 specimens from the deep boring at Streatham, made some remarks
upon the results obtained, of which the following is an abstract: —
    After passing through 10 feet of gravel &c, 1 53 of London Clay,
 88| of Lower London Tertiaries, 623 of Chalk (the least thickness
 in any of the deep borings in and near London), 28| of Upper
 Greensand, and 188£ of Gault, at the depth of 1081 J feet hard
 limestone, mostly with rather large oolitic grains, was met with.
 This, with alternations of a finer character, sandy and clayey, lasted
 for only 38| feet, being much less than the thickness of the Jurassic
 beds, either at Eichmond or at Mcux's boring. The general
 character of the cores showed a likeness to the Forest Marble, and the
 occurrence of Ostrea acuminata agreed therewith.

78            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   At the depth of 1120 feet the tools entered a set of beds of much
the same character as those that had been found beneath Jurassic
beds at Richmond, and beneath Gault at Kentish Town and at
Crossness. The softer and more clayey components were not brought
up ; the harder consist of fine-grained compact sandstones, greenish-
grey, sometimes with purplish mottlings or bandings, and here and
there wholly of a dull reddish tint. With these there occur hard,
clayey, and somewhat sandy beds, which are not calcareous, whilst
most of the sandstones are. Thin veins of calcite are sometimes to
be seen, and at others small concretionary calcareous nodules ; but
no trace of a fossil has been found.
   The bedding is shown, both by the bands of colour, and by the
tendency of the stone to fracture, to vary generally from about 20°
to 30°.
   In the absence of evidence it is hard to say what these beds are,
and the possibilities of their age seem to range from Trias to De
vonian. It is to be hoped that this question may be solved, as on
it depends that of the possibility of the presence of Coal-measures
in the district ; and Messrs. Docwra, the contractors of the works,
have with great liberality undertaken to continue the boring-opera
tions at their own expense for at least another week.
   Details of the section will be given in a forthcoming Geological
Survey Memoir, in which, moreover, the subject of the old rocks
under London will bo treated somewhat fully.

ON THE EXCITATION OF ELECTRICITY BY THE CONTACT OF
   RAREFIED GASES WITH GALVANIC INCANDESCENT WIRES. BY
   J. ELSTER AND H. GEITEL*.
 TN a series of experimental investigations published in Wiede-
     mann's Annalen, the authors had treated the case of the
excitation of electricity on the contact of gases and ignited bodies
for the case in which the gases were either under the pressure of
the atmosphere or under a pressure of at least 10 millim. mercury.
In the present investigation it is attempted to establish the pheno
menon for very minute pressures.
   It results that, in accordance with previous results, using gal
vanic incandescent platinum wires of over 0-2 millim. in thickness,

oxygen is positive even at the highest rarefaction, but hydrogen
is negative. Air, aqueous vapour, sulphur, and phosphorus vapour
appear, when pure, to be excited positively, but more feebly than
oxygen ; mercury, on the contrary, appears to be indifferent. The
products of decomposition of fatty vapours, which, from using
greased stopcocks and connexions, penetrate into the receiver of the
mercury-pump, acquire stronger negative charges than hydrogen.
By continued action of the ignited wires the deportment of the
rarefied gases, as well as of the wires, varies, especially if they are
thinner than 0-2 millim. ; their molecular structure is altered by
continuous ignition.
    The nature of the electrodes is of small influence ; in like manner
the occlusion of gases by wires, as well as the detachment of solid
particles during ignition, appears to play no essential part. Only
by using ignited carbon threads does the disengagement of the gases
absorbed by the carbon come into play ; incandescent carbon-fila
ments in a glow-lamp always electrify negatively the residues in the
Burrounding medium.
    Incandescent platinum-iridium, palladium, and iron wire do not
 differ essentially from platinum wire.
    The electromotive force is further dependent on the action of
 extraneous magnetic forces. In rarefied hydrogen it is influenced
 by the occurrence of Hall's phenomenon ; the existence of which
 could not be shown with the same certainty in oxygen. In the
 latter gas the magnet produces in general an increase of the
 positive, in hydrogen, acting in the same direction, a decrease of
 the negative, electrifications up to the change of sigu ; at the same
 time the position of the poles exerts some influence.
    The phenomena of unipolar conduction display themselves in
 rarefied gases like those of normal density ; that electricity is
 always more easily discharged whose sign is opposed to that excited
 by the process of ignition in the gas. In the magnetic field the
 conductivity of the gas in contact with the ignited wire increases
 for negative electricity ; here also the position of the poles has a
 determining influence.
    The authors attempt to bring the results of their investigation
 in agreement with Schuster's theory of the electrolytic conductivity
 of gases, and under the influence of a dissociation of the gaseous
 molecules at the ignited body.

      ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THIN SOLID LAMINAE.
                            BY G. QUINCKE.
     The common boundary of two liquids has the tendency to

80            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
become as small as possible. The force ala, which is at work in
the common boundary of the liquids 1 and 2, has been called the
surface-tension. Eighteen years ago I described several methods
of determining it*.
   Analogous forces must be assumed to exist at the boundary of a
solid with air, or with another liquid. These surfaces also have
the tendency. The phenomena at the boundary of a liquid and of
a solid are essentially different from those at the boundary of two
liquids, for in the former there is no lateral displacement of the
particles of the solid.
   While the boundary of two liquids forms spheres or spherical
shells, if we disregard the action of gravity, the boundary of a liquid
and of a solid forms folds, and under certain conditions cylindrical
forms, or tubes.
   I obtained thin solid laminae by allowing albumen or aqueous
solutions of glue, or alcoholic solutions of resins, to dry on mercury
the surface of which had been covered with a trace of fat.
   The periphery of the solid lamina forms thus a sine curve, which
lies upon a vertical cylinder surface, and is connected with the
centre of the lamina by radial straight lines. The periphery of the
solid lamina is then alternately higher and lower than the original
horizontal surface of mercury.
   On the periphery there can be n elevations and n depressions,
where n is any whole number 1, 2, 3, 20, 100, or more.
   The thinner the lamina and the greater its diameter, the greater
in general is », and the smaller the vertical height of the elevations
and depressions.
   The edge of the solid lamina may also be periodic in several
ways. Thus, for instance, there can be simultaneously two or
three great folds, and twenty-four or still more small folds at the
periphery.
   The magnitude and shape of the solid lamina depends on the
surface-tension of the fatty surface of mercury, that is to say, on
the thickness of the fatty layer on mercury, on the temperature,
and on the radiation, so that heliotropism can be discovered on it.
   Solid laminae, the thickness of which is less than 0*000045
millim., may modify the form of the surface and exhibit a folded
surface. The thickness may be so small that it can no longer be
perceived with the microscope.
   If flat air-bubbles in water or flat drops of mercury in air are
coated with very thin s*)id lamina?, the form of the bubbles and
drops are modified in the same way as by a coating with a solid
lamina.
   Thin solid lamina? of glue, resins, soap, albumen, thin metal
layers, formed cylindrical shapes or tubes on the surface of mer
cury, water, chloroform, or fatty oils, with air or with other liquids,
if the surface tended to become as small as possible, and was pre
vented from assuming the spherical shape by not being able to
move laterally.— Berliner Berichte, July 12, 1888.

XII. On the Polarization of Sky Light. By James C,
    McConnel, M.A., Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge",
                               [Plate VII.]
THIS " mysterious and beautiful phenomenon," as it was
        called by Sir John Herschel, must be now admitted to
have been satisfactorily explained. It has been shown by
Briicke (Pogg. Ann. vol. Lxxxviii.), Tyndall (Proc. Roy. Soc.
Jan. 1869), and others, that an artificial blue sky ma}- be
produced in water or air by the introduction of myriads of
very minute particles of some denser substance, and that the
light scattered by these particles in a direction perpendicular
to the incident beam is completely polarized in the plane of
incidence. Lord Rayleigh has placed the matter on a more
satisfactory basis by deducing the same results from the elec»
tromagnetic theory of light t. He further defined accurately
the colour of the scattered light, showing that the amount
scattered of different kinds of homogeneous light varied
inversely as the fourth power of the wave-length. With
regard to the intensity and polarization of light scattered in
different directions he obtained the following results. To
find the nature of the light deflected in any given plane,
   * Communicated by the Author.
   t He first employed a form of the " elastic solid " theory in which the
 density of the ether is supposed to vary in different media (Phil. Mag,
 Feb., April, June, 1871). In a later paper (Phil. Mag. Aug. 1881) he
 showed that the electromagnetic theory led to the same equations.
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 27. No. 165. Feb. 1889.                  G

82                  Mr. J. C. McConnel on tJie
divide the incident ray into two parts, that polarized in the
plane of deflexion and that polarized in the perpendicular
plane. Of the former the proportion deflected is the same in
every direction, but of the latter the proportion deflected
varies as the square of the cosine of the angle between the
 original and the new directions of propagation, being zero
when this angle is a right angle. It may be added that the
proportion of light thrown straight backwards is independent
 of the direction of the original polarization, as is indeed
obvious from symmetry. For the truth of these laws it is
essential that the particles should be small compared with the
wave-length of the kind of light involved. I gather that
they would be practically accurate for particles which were not
larger than a tenth part of the wave-length, while with
roundish particles whose diameter reached half a wave-length
quite different phenomena would set in.
    The experimental verification of these laws in the case of
the sky cannot be expected to be very accurate, owing to the
.complexity of the problem. Still sufficient has been accom
plished to render it almost certain that the greater part of
the light from a good blue sky has been scattered by small
particles, small, that is, compared with a wave-length. Lord
Rayleigh has compared the colour of sky light with that of
sunlight diffused through white paper, obtaining very fair
agreement with the law of the inverse fourth power of the
wave-length (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1871). Further, Abney has
found, on measuring the relative intensities of the various
components of sunlight on different days and with different
altitudes of the sun, that the very considerable variations
could be explained on the assumption that practically the
whole of the light lost in traversing the atmosphere had been
scattered according to the above law *. This of course was
only the case when the atmosphere was quite clear. These
observations show not merely that the sky light is due to small
particles, but also that the true absorption (other than
scattering) of the visible radiation by the atmosphere is very
small.
    So much for the colour of the sky. With regard to the
polarization we find, as we should expect from the theory,
the maximum polarization at points in the sky about ninety
degrees from the sun. Rubenson, at Upsala, took eighteen
measures of the position of the point of maximum polariza
tion in the vertical plane through the sun on different days
and at different hours. The distance from the sun varied
   • Phil. Trans. March 1887. He mentions, however, that Langley's
bolometer observations do not support this law.

                    Polarization of Sky Light.                 S3
between 88° 23' and 92° 8', the mean being 90° 2'. Of course
the polarization even at the maximum point is far from being
complete. For light reaches the scattering particles from the
sky and the earth as well as the sun. Every ray that im
pinges on a particle sends a scattered ray to the observer.
And these scattered rays are polarized, some partially, some
completely, in all sorts of different planes. The net result is
a quantity of subsidiary light that dilutes the completely
polarized rays scattered from the direct sunshine.
   At points in the sky near the sun or antisolar point the
polarization of the light scattered from the direct sunshine
is very weak, according to Lord Rayleigh's laws, explained
above, and here we find that in the vertical plane through
the sun it is overpowered by a residual horizontal polarization
in the subsidiary light just mentioned. Thus are formed the
neutral (t. e. unpolarized) points discovered by Arago, Babinet,
and Brewster. Bosanquet (Phil. Mag. July 1876) has investi
gated the direction of the polarization in the neighbourhood of
the neutral point, and his results point to this conclusion. He
found for instance that a little to the right or left of a
neutral point the polarization was inclined at forty-five degrees
to the vertical. Let us see if our explanation leads to this
result. Neglecting the unpolarized part of the subsidiary
light, we have at the neutral point two equally bright beams
polarized at right angles to each other. Just to the right or
left the beams are still equal, but the planes of polarization
 are not quite at right angles, and it is obvious from symmetry
 that the resultant polarization must bisect the angle between
them.
    An explanation of the residual polarization of the subsidiary
 light is not far to seek. Take the light scattered by a particle
 A in the horizontal direction AB. Light reaches the particle
 from the sky and the earth. The ground below may be
 roughly regarded as appearing equally bright in all directions,
 and therefore, as I proceed to show, it will produce no
 polarization. If A were in the centre of a uniformly bright
 spherical envelope, the light scattered along AB would be
 obviously unpolarized. The light from the upper and lower
 hemispheres must from symmetry be polarized in the same
 way, and, since the sum is unpolarized, each must be un
 polarized. The lower hemisphere is equivalent to the
 uniformly bright surface of the ground ; so my point is.
 established. There remains therefore the light from the sky
 to A to be considered. For obvious reasons the sky is much
 brighter near the horizon than in the zenith, and it is clear
 that the light scattered along AB from any point in the

                      Mr. J. C. McConnel on the
horizon (except exactly in the line AB) is more or less
polarized in a horizontal plane. Hence the resultant of all
this subsidiary light is slightly polarized in a horizontal plane.
The case is not very different when AB is inclined somewhat
downwards. As to the strength of this residual polarization
I shall have something to say later.
    Since the imperfection of the polarization at the maximum
point is due to light reaching the particles from the earth and
sky, we ought to find a great effect produced, as Lord
Bayleigh has suggested, by the presence of snow on the ground.
Again, at high altitudes above sea-level, owing to the dark
ness of the sky, the polarization should be more perfect.
During the past year, having been resident for the most
part at tolerably high altitudes, I have taken a good many
measures of the maximum polarization with the object of
examining these two points. Though the measures are
rough, they are, I feel sure, free from large error. This is
more than I can say for any other measures of the kind
that I have come across, as I shall now explain.
        Criticism of Brewster's and Bubenson's Measures.
   The most extensive series of measurements on record are
those of Brewster and Bubenson. Both used a pile of thin
glass plates, tilted at such an angle as to depolarize the sky
light, and tested the depolarization with a Savart polariscope.
Brewster* seems to have relied on the formula :—
   Batio of principal intensities after passing through plates
      = cos*"(i— i!) x ratio before entering, where n is the
   . number of plates, and tt' are the angles of incidence
      and refraction.
This can be readily derived from Fresnel's expressions for
the refraction of polarized light, but it only applies to tho
portion of light that is refracted directly through the plates.
Besides this there are other portions, twice reflected, four
times reflected, &c. which ultimately get through the plates.
  * Phil. Mag. Aug. & Sept. 1865. Brewster does not fully describe in
these two papers how he calculated the polarization from the readings
of his polnrimeter. He refers to other articles which I have not had
the opportunity of looking up. But a little further on he quotes a
formula equivalent to the above (with a misprint of n for 2?») without
any reservation. Besides he obtained values of the polarization which
are quite extravagant. He uses the measure R where tan2 (46° — R) =ratio
of principal intensities, which I call r. At mid-day on June 10th, 1841,
at St. Andrews, he found R = 30|°; whence r=-07. While to judge
from Bubenson's observations, which I have analysed below, it seems in
the highest degree unlikely that r was really less than -20.

                     Polarization of Sky Light.                    85
With ten or twenty plates the number of these portions is
very great and, though they are individually faint, the aggre
gate is considerable. Thus, of light polarized in the plane of
incidence about seven times as much actually traverses
twenty plates as is directly refracted through, when the angle
of incidence is forty degrees. But of light polarized in the
rectangular plane, that traverses the same plates, the re
flexions only furnish about one seventh part. In the case of
ten plates with an single of incidence of fifty degrees, the
corresponding proportions are three and a third times as
much and an infinitesimal fraction. Brewster used from six
to twelve plates and Rubenson twenty.
    Rubenson* avoided Brewster's error, but fell into another
connected with the reflexions. He determined not to rely on
theoretical calculations of the polarizing power of the plates,
especially as it would have been difficult to measure the
index of refraction with sufficient accuracy, and ho employed
an excellent method, due to Arago, of standardizing his
instrument, i. e. measuring its depolarizing power for various
positions of the pile. Ho took a fairly thick plate of quartz,
 cut parallel to the axis, and placed it with its principal plane
 coincident with the plane of incidence on the pile. Behind
 this he put a Nicol prism attached to the vernier of a graduated
 circle. Let. the plane of polarization of the light incident on
 the quartz make an angle <p with the principal plane ; then the
 light emergent from the quartz is partially polarized, and the
 ratio of the principal intensities is tan2<£. To secure com
 plete depolarization by the pile of plates, it is essential that
 there should be no definite phase relationship between the
 two components of the partially polarized light. If the
 quartz plate had been thin this difficulty might have occurred;
but in a fairly thick plate the phase relationship is so com
 pletely changed by a slight alteration of wave-length that,
 except with homogeneous light, the two components are
 practically independent.
     So far, then, his method was admirable, but he never seems
 to have remembered that the reflected light which comes
 through the plates is more or less thrown to one side and
 that, therefore, the aperture which admits light must be
 large. If it bo small only a proportion, and that a very
 uncertain proportion, of the reflected light reaches the eye.
 Rubenson had a large aperture in his observations on the sky
 and a small one when he was standardizing. The Nicol

8G                   Mr. J. 0. McConnel on the
itself limited the aperture considerably, and, to stop light
reflected from tho sides of the Nicol, he put a diaphragm
between it and the quartz. The diameter of the aperture,
according to the engraving which he gives, was less than
half the thickness of the pile of plates. I have tried to
approximate to the amount of error involved, and have con
vinced myself that it must have been considerable. He him
 self was led to suspect some fault in his standardizer for
the following reason :—Let us call the reading of the plates
when they neutralized the polarization of the sky on a certain
occasion Q-,. Then, when the plates were tilted in the
 opposite direction, they again neutralized the polarization at
a reading G2. The absolute values of the polarization corre
sponding to tho readings Gx and Ga should of course have
been identical, but according to the standardizer they were
always markedly different {e.g. such as to give r='250 and
r="225)*. He was unable to find any explanation of these
discrepancies, but they led him to regard his observations
as only comparable with each other when the pile had not
 been dismounted in the interval. Further he specially says
 (p. 56) that his measures of the polarization are not to
 be compared with measures obtained with other instruments,
 or, in other words, that they are not absolute values at all.
We can see now that he was right, and that these discre
 pancies were only a sign of a much larger error. Owing to
 some slight want of symmetry, more of the reflected light
 must have been thrown out of the field of view on one side
than on the other.
    When I first appreciated the meaning of this oversight in
 Bubenson's work, I thought it would render his elaborate
 series of measures quite useless except for intercomparison.
 But I have since discovered that the polarizing power of a
pile of glass plates varies very slowly with the index of refrac
 tion. 1 do not know how this result will strike others, but
 to me it was most unexpected. However, it enables us to
 obtain a fair idea of the real values of the polarization that
 Bubenson observed. There is a very simple formula, due to
 Prof. Stokes f, for the polarizing power of a pile, taking into
account all the reflexions. Once found it may be easily
verified. Let a be the proportion of light, polarized in the
plane of incidence, reflected from a single surface ; then the
   * He aimed at a probable error less than -002, and would no doubt
have succeeded if the error had not been systematic.

proportion of light, polarized in the plane of incidence, which
traverses a pile of n plates is

                            l + (2n-l)a
A similar formula holds good for the light polarized at right
angles to the plane of incidence. In this case let us write
b for a. Thus if a broad beam of ordinary light enter a pile
of plates, the ratio of the principal intensities in the emergent
beam is
                        1-a          l + (2w-l)6
                   l+(2n-l)a             1-6       '
   So far the formulae are perfectly general and independent of
the truth of any particular laws of the reflexion of polarized
light. To proceed further we must assume certain values of
a and b. Now Fresnel's laws are known to be at least
approximately true, and these give
                    _sin2(t— i!)          tan2(t— t)
                  ""snT^T+T')'            tans(t + *')'
Using these values I have calculated the following figures
for the ratio of the intensities in the beam emergent from
twenty plates when the incident light is unpolarized :—

I presume that we may safely assume that Rubenson's plates
(of which he gives no special description) had an index of
refraction nearer l-52 than 1*56. The most uncertain point
seems to be the truth of Fresnel's laws. In working out the
following results from Rubenson's figures I have assumed
their truth as well as the index 1"52. It must be distinctly
understood that these results are only rough approximations.
   There are several different methods of expressing the
strength of partial polarization, and it is not easy to choose
between them. If A, B be the intensities of light polarized
in the two principal planes, of which B is the lesser, the most
natural expression seems to be the simple ratio B/A. I shall
call this r. In completely polarized light r=0, in unpola
rized light r=l. But in the special subject of this inquiry
it will be often convenient, though not very accurate, to
regard sky light at the maximum point as composed of some
completely polarized light, A — B, consisting of scattered sun-
fight, and of some unpolarized light 2B, consisting of

88                Mr. J. C. McConnel on the
scattered earth and sky light. 1 shall therefore denote the
ratio 2B/(A— B) by the symbol s. In completely polarized
light s=0, and in unpolarized light « = oo. In the time of
Rubenson it seems to have been the established custom to
call the ratio (A— B)/(A + B) of the polarized light to the
whole light " the polarization." This expression has the ad
vantage that it increases with the strength of the polarization
and vanishes when the light is unpolarized. But it seems to
be for most purposes inconvenient, and I shall not uso it
at all.
            Remits deduced from Rubenson's Work.
   Rubenson's observations were made at Rome, and may
therefore be taken as a fair sample of the polarization at the
sea-level. Rome is sufficiently far (some thirteen miles) from
the sea to prevent serious disturbance from the reflexion on
the water. Ho found the polarization strongest in the morn
ing and evening, attaining a maximum about mid-day, some
times before and sometimes afterwards. About mid-day the
rate of alteration is of course slow, and he noticed that slight
perturbations, i.e. sudden irregular variations, were most
frequent about that time. The increase of polarization be
came more and more rapid towards sunrise or sunset. He
has collected into a table his readings on many different days
at noon and at sunrise or sunset, in summer and winter.
Between May 22nd and July 27th, 18(52, the strongest mid
day polarization was (July 5th) r='276 (s=*76), whilo there
were ten days with r less than -34 (s<l"03). With the sun
on the horizon the strongest polarization was r=-218
(* = -56), while there were seven days on which r fell as low
as *25 (s = -67). In winter the polarization was much stronger.
Between Oct. 21st, 1861, and Jan. 8th, 1862, there was one
noon (Nov. 5th) at which r was "20 (* = '50), while on ten
occasions r at noon was less than "25 (s<"67). With a
horizontal sun the strongest polarization was given by r=*156
 («=\37), and there were eleven days on which r was less than
•19 (s<"47). Not much difference is noticeable between
sunrise, and sunset.
   I have only cited the days on which the polarization was
strongest, for these always have the most perl'ect skies, as any
observer must very soon convince himself. Any modifying
circumstances, such as haziness of the sky, smoke, the faintest
cloud in the field of view, the presence of large clouds
scattered about the sky, serve invariably to diminish the
polarization. The increase of s, as the sun mounts from the
horizon to its highest altitude, in summer from "56 to *76,

                    Polarization of Sky Liglrf.                  89
and in winter from "37 to -50 is clearly due to the increase
in the earth light. But it is not so easy to explain tho
difference between winter and summer with a horizontal sun.
It must depend on some material difference in the atmosphere.
It is possible that the brightness of the sky is augmented in
the ratio 5b' to 37, owing to an increase either in the number
of the fine particles or in their average size. The size is
particularly important, as the light scattered by a fine particle
is proportional to the square of its volume ; so a little mois
ture deposited on dust particlos would increase their light-
giving power enormously. On the other hand, the difference
might lie due to tho sky never being as pure in the summer
as in the winter. The presence of dust particles larger than a
wave-length would of course depolarize the scattered light.
   Rubenson gives a few observations at Rome of the polariza
tion in the vertical plane at distances from the sun other than
90°. They were taken for the sake of fixing the maximum
point, but they are interesting to us for another reason.

   These are all in the vertical plane through the sun. Let us
compare these values at (30° and 120° with those deduced from
 Rayleigh's laws on the assumption that the particles are all
 small. We must presuppose something about the polarization
 of the subsidiary light. Now, from Brewster's observations
at St. Andrews, tho neutral point below the sun (called after
his name) is at an angular distance of about 10°, when the
 sun is at 54° above the horizon. This supplies what we
 want, at least approximately. Let u, v be the components
 of the light which reached the particles directly from the sun,
 and x, y the components of the subsidiary light, polarized in
 the vertical plane and in a plane at right angles thereto re
 spectively. At the neutral point we have
                  y—x=u — v=u—u cos210° = ,03«.

 90                M-r. J. C. McConnel on the
 This gives the polarization of the subsidiary light below the
 sun at a zenith distance of 46°. It is rather loose reasoning
 to apply this result to points opposite to the sun at zenith
 distances of 26°, 55°, and 83^°; but the consequent errors will
 probably be small and should have opposite signs in the first
and third cases. Taking the mean of the readings at 90°,
 we have
                          y = '293(u + «).
 From these two equations we have x='373u, y = -403« at 90°
 from the sun. At 60° and 120° we have
                   r= v~^y and « = ucos860°.

 Inserting the values of x andy we find 7*="477, which agrees
 with the observed values of r quite as well as could be ex
 pected, considering the uncertainty of my interpretation of
his i readings. A similar process applied to the afternoon
 observations gives at 70° and 110° r=*366.
                    Description of Apparatus.
     The arrangement of my polarimeter will be understood
 from PI. VII. fig. 1. The light entered through the aperture A,
 and traversed the movable pile B of five glass plates, the fixed
pile 0 of three glass plates, and the thick plate D of Iceland
 spar, cut at right angles to the axis. It was then reflected
 by the mirror E, and reached the eye through the Nicol F.
Thus B and G depolarized the light, while the depolarization
was tested with the polariscope DEF. On turning the five
plates the black cross became gradually fainter and finally
disappeared, being soon replaced by four black spots. I took
the reading hallway between the disappearance of the cross
and the appearance of the spots. Those spots were of course
the spaces between the white cross and the first white ring.
The optic axis of D gave a fixed direction for the observed
light, so the angle of incidence on the plates C remained
constant so long as 0 and D were undisturbed. It was about
50°. The plates B were fastened to two uprights a b, pro
jecting from a round disk of tin plate, dotted in the figure,
resting on the side of the box. From the centre of the disk
a spindle passed through the side of the box carrying a
pointer c, shown in fig. 2, by whose means the plates could
be rotated about the spindle and their angular position read
oft'. The instrument was roughly made and had various
defects. The Nicol and Iceland spar I got from England,
but the rest was made either by myself or by such workmen

                    Polarization of Sky Light.                91
 as I could find in these Alpine villages. The sensitiveness of
 the polariscope was no doubt seriously diminished by the
 insertion of the mirror E, which was a piece of ordinary
 looking-glass. Of course it ought to have come between the
 Nicol F and the eye. To add to the difficulties of reading,
 there were some large dents on the faces of the Iceland spar.
    These things must be my excuse for not reaching the same
 degree of accuracy in reading as others have. Still I seldom
 found two readings of the same thing differ by more than 2°,
 which corresponds roughly to a change of 0"02 in the ratio r.
 For each observation I took four readings of the angle of
 incidence, two on one side of the zero and two on the other.
 So the probable error of the mean is certainly not greater
 than 1°. The object of separating the glass plates into two
 piles was to increase the power of the instrument by diminish
 ing the amount of transmitted reflected light. Thus, for an
 angle of incidence of 50° on the five plates, my arrangement
 gave r=0"25, while eight plates in one pile would for the
 same angle of incidence only have given r=034. These
 values are calculated, 'not observed. The plate of Iceland
 spar was about 23 millim. thick. This great thickness was
 of importance, bringing the four black spots near together.
    It was necessary, not merely to be able to point the polari-
 meter to the required part of the sky, but also to make the
plane of rotation of the glass plates pass through the sun.
 This was secured by the mounting shown in fig. 2. The
Eolarimeter was fastened with a screw-bolt G to a board,
  inged at HH to another board, itself fastened with the
screw-bolt K to the head of a tripod belonging to a photo
graphic camera. By rotations about K and H it was easy to
point the edge ed to the sun. Then, by turning the polari-
meter about the bolt G, observations could be taken of any
point of the sky distant 90° from the sun. With the same
mounting I could have observed the polarization at any point
of the vertical plane through the sun. But I have not done
so hitherto, chiefly because it would have required accurate
pointing of the instrument and another graduated circle. Since
the polarization reaches a maximum about 90 degrees from the
sun, an error of two or three degrees in the pointing is of no
consequence there. Figure 2 shows how the position of the
Nicol, and therefore of the mirror E, added much to the con
venience of the observer as well as to the simplicity of con
struction, though it was prejudicial to the sensitiveness of
observation.

92                 Mr. J. C. McConnel on the
                   Observations at St. Moriiz.
    Most of my observations were taken at St. Moritz during
the autumn of 1887. For a proper appreciation of them
some description of the country is necessary. The Engadine
may be roughly represented by a straight nearly level trough,
running from south-west to north-east, whose steep sides are
about three thousand feet high. On either side of the trough,
especially on the south, there are extensive mountain-ranges.
The place of observation, viz. the Kulm Hotel, is situated on
the northern slope, about 300 feet above the bed of the valley
and 6000 feet above sea-level. Immediately below, the bed
of the valley is occupied by a lake above half a square mile
in area. On October 20th the snow covered the opposite slope,
coming right down to the water's edge, though the uniform
whiteness was a good deal broken by woods. The northern
slope was nearly free from snow up to perhaps 8000 feet
above sea-level.
    All the observations refer to points ninety degrees from
the sun, and, unless the contrary is stated, to the highest of
such points in a cloudless sky. The chief results are
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. G denotes the angle of incidence on
the five plates when neutralization takes place ; r and s are dif
ferent measures of the polarization defined above. The manner
in which they are derived from G is explained below under
the heading Standardization. The error in r, due to bad
 setting of the pile, is not likely to exceed "01 except when G
 is greater than 55°, and the probable error in standardization
 is of about the same magnitude.
     1. The polarization is weakest towards noon.

 polarization then was not so strong as at the highest point
 (see 2).

    After this I seldom took readings except near the middle

  The point of observation was perfectly clear, though there
  were a few scattered clouds about. An hour later the sky
  was nearly covered with clouds, so the weak polarization on
  this day may be partly attributed to that circumstance
  (see 4). I will therefore cite also :—

  so all day. The white covering on the ground was more

                                October 21.

      9.30        53£ -205 '51 Near hills to the right.
   The altitude of the points observed in the second and fourth
of these readings may have been about 5°. In this instance
the polarization was materially stronger near the horizon.
This was due to the instrument being pointed down the
long straight valley, which was nearly clear of snow and
was bordered by dark woods. Later on in the same day this
general principle led to an opposite result.
                                October 21.

        1.10         48         -249 -67 Near hills to the right.
   The weaker polarization in the two last observations was due
to the line of sight passing over neighbouring and far-
reaching tracts of snow. On the following day similar
 results were obtained.

                   Polarization of Ski/ Light.                95
weakening of the polarization. I found later that the same
thing had been noticed by Rubenson. On October 20, at
10 a.m., at the highest point in a cloudless sky, the reading
was 49°, while, judging from the two succeeding days, it
should have been 51£°. By 11.45 A.M. the sky was nearly
covered with cirrus, but through a clear rift near the highest
point I obtained the reading 45£°. It seems probable that
the ice particles of the cirrus were present in considerable
numbers at 10 A.M., but, though as thick or thicker than a
wave-length, they were too small and too few to be visible as
cloud.
   Generally speaking the polarization was much the same on
two successive cloudless days, unless there had been a mani
fest change in the whiteness of the ground. This is very
different from Rubenson's experience, but is only what might
be looked for in the clear atmosphere of the high Alps.
                Observations at Thusis and Davos.
    During the spring other work intervened, and, indeed,
 owing to the bad weather, there were few opportunities, so
 that I did not take any more readings till after leaving St.
 Moritz early in April for Thusis. During the journey the
Iceland spar unfortunately got shifted, but I was able to
measure the consequent alteration in the angle of incidence
 on the three fixed plates in the following manner :—At St.
 Moritz the average difference of the readings on the right and
left sides of the zero was about 2°. At Thusis it was about
G°. To produce this change the axis of the crystal must have
been shifted through 2°, and the angle of incidence on the
fixed plates must have been diminished by 2°. It is true that
for the journey I dismounted the movable pile ; but, owing to
 the method of attachment, it must have been replaced in prac
 tically the same position with respect to the pointer of the
 graduated circle. Further on I shall explain how I made
 allowance for this change of 2°. Since the observations at
 Thusis nothing in the polarimeter has been disturbed.
    The village of Thusis (2450 feet above sea-level) lies at the
 southern end of a broad open valley running due north. To
 the south there are high wooded cliffs separated by the narrow
 cleft of the Via Mala. Here I had another opportunity of
 testing the effect of snow on the ground. Two or three days
 of heavy snow were succeeded by a glorious day. At first it
 was cloudless, but by 11.30 A.M. a few small clouds appeared
 to the west.

   11.30        35£    •406 1-37 At highest point.
   At the time of these readings the snow, though rapidly
yielding to the sun, still covered the valley for a mile from
Thusis ; further north it had gone from the lower slopes as
well as the valley-floor, so that to east and west the country
was very white, while to the north there was a long stretch of
brown and to the south there lay the black woods. Thus the
snow was placed advantageously for diminishing the polari
zation about noon. It is interesting to note the diminution
of the polarization looking over the snow to east and west.
The altitudes given were estimated by eye.
   Two days afterwards the snow had gone for some distance
up the slopes, especially to the east, but the sky was not so
perfect ; thero were a good many small cumuli near the
horizon.

had gone rather more.

   One may say, therefore, that the extra snow on the ground
on the 14th as compared with the 17th reduced the reading at
 10.10 from 40° to 36° and at 11.30 from 38£ to 35£°. Of
course on the former day a good deal of snow disappeared
between 10 A.m. and 11.30 a.m.

crept up to a height of 1200 feet on the hills close by.

   By 6.20 a good many small clouds had come over the sky.
At 6.25 both the clouds and all the mountains in sight were
in shade, and the polarization was too strong to be read. I
estimated it at G = 64°, r=,15, s = '35.
   I have taken a few observations at Davos during the summer,
altitude 5100 feet above sea-level. The situation is not unlike

   This was a few days after twenty inches of snow had fallen,
and the covering was fairly complete except for the bare trees.
There were a few clouds about, but none near the point of
observation.            G        r    «
  Dec. 2, 12.5 a.m. 44^° -295 -84 Sky almost cloudless.
   This was after some fresh snow. The covering was rather
more complete and the trees were slightly sprinkled with
snow.
                        January 2, 1889.
                     G.       r.     8.
         12.42 p.m. 53°     -220    -57. Sky cloudless.
   At this time there was unusually little snow for the season
of the year. The north side of the valley was in great part
bare even up to the mountain-tops. Though the snow-
covering was more complete than on May 12, the value of «
was less than half that on the former date. This of course
was duo to the low altitude of the sun.
   Comparing the values of s on Aug. 9 and Dec. 2, we see
that the subsidiary light is nearly doubled by the replacement
of the green grass by the white snow, notwithstanding the
much brighter light on the former. It seems fair to conclude
that the greater part, at least three quarters, of the subsidiary
light in December comes from the snow. The ratio of the
subsidiary light to the whole being 84 : 184, wo deduce that,
of the light from the sky near the point of maximum polari
zation, at least one third has been previously reflected from
the snow on the ground.
    It must be only too obvious to a reader of my observations
that I was much hampered by the limited power of my instru
ment. It was barely able to deal with the polarization in the
middle of the day at St. Moritz and Davos, so that we are
still in ignorance of the strength of the polarization at sun
rise or sunset. This is unfortunate, for the most striking
difference between the polarization at high altitudes and at
the sea-level would naturally be when the earth-light was
weakest. I am taking steps, therefore, to fret a more powerful
instrument. Meanwhile we may notice that, even at noon,
the difference is in favour of the high altitudes when the
ground is nearly free from snow. The strongest mid-day
polarization found by Rubenson at Rome was r=-20 on
Nov. 5. Compare this with r=,185 at Davos on Aug. 9.
I should not like to lay much stress on the slight difference
between these numbers ; but, even if they were equal, it is to

                   Polarization of Sky Light.                   9!)
be remembered that at Davos the sun was much higher (57°
instead of 32°), and the ground consequently more than half
as bright again.
   Any marked deviation of the plane of polarization from the
  lane through the sun was shown in my instrument by the
  lack cross gradually being transformed into the white one
without even disappearing. While the point nearest neutra
lization was being passed, the black cross was rotating through
forty-five degrees and changing its appearance, so that the
four arms of the black cros3 became the dark spaces between
the arms of the white cross. I believe that with proper pre
cautions very accurate measurements of the position of the
plane of polarization of partially polarized light might be
made on this principle. I found that, with large clouds
about, the deviation might reach, perhaps, three or four degrees;
but in a clear sky, e. g. in all the measurements I have recorded,
it was insensible. It was curious to find that it was easy to
point out the position of the sun behind a mountain with
considerable accuracy by applying the same principle. It
was done thus. First putting the planefd e (fig. 2) vertical,
I turned the instrument round the bolt K till there was no
rotation of the black cross on neutralization. This insured
the plane fd e passing through the sun. Then, having turned
the box about G till a point near the horizon was under
observation, I opened or shut the hinge H, till fde again
passed through the sun. Then the sun lay in the direction
ed.
   In the observations cited above I have measured the average
polarization of all the different colours which go to make up
the light of the sky. There remains the question how the
polarization varies with the wave-length of the light. Since
the imperfection of the polarization is due to light reaching the
particles from the sky and earth as well as from the sun, we
should expect the polarization to increase with the wave-length.
For sky light is blue and earth light can hardly be redder than
sunlight. I tried at Thusis the effect of interposing orange
glass, which, according to my estimate, should have increased
the reading G by several degrees, but did not find any decided
change. I cannot account for this result. Though I hope to
repeat the observations, I should like to call the attention of
other workers to this point. The effect ought to be greater
at sea-level on account of the increased brightness of the sky.
Another theoretical result, which might be easily tested by any
one with a suitable polariscope, is that the position of the
neutral point should change considerably with the wave-length
of the light under examination.

100                 Mr. J. C. McConnel on tlie
                          Standardization.
    As has appeared frequently in -what precedes, a great diffi
 culty in these observations is to translate the readings of the
 pile into absolute measure. It is impossible at present to do
 this satisfactorily by calculation, for we do not know the laws
 of the reflexion of polarized light at the surface of glass with
 sufficient accuracy. Each instrument must therefore be
 standardized by direct experiment. Three methods have been
 proposed for doing this:—The first, by the aid of photography,
 was suggested to me by Capt. Abney, who has used platino-
 type paper for measuring the brightness of the sun and sky.
 It consists in exposing sensitive paper to the light from a small
 portion of the sky for measured intervals of time, interposing
 a Nicol prism in the path of the light. By placing the Nicol
 in the two rectangular positions, we could determine the ratio
 of the principal intensities, while simultaneous observations
were being made with the optical polarimeter. Difficulties
 might occur in the light reflected from the sides of the Nicol
 and in the great length of exposure, and at any rate the
 method would require a good deal of preliminary testing.
 Bosanquet has proposed another method, viz. to mix common
 and completely polarized light in known proportions with the
 aid of a divided object-glass (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1875), and then
 take the reading with the polarimeter.
    The simplest and most convenient method, and with proper
precautions the most accurate, seems to be that invented by
Arago and already described as being used by Rubenson,
and it is the one I have adopted. Bosanquet throws some
suspicion on the method as resting on an uncertain theoretical
basis, but this suspicion is by no means deserved. The main
assumption involved is that a beam of plane polarized light
may be treated as composed of two beams, polarized in rect
angular planes, of intensities proportional to sins and cos3 <f>,
where d> is the angle between one of these planes and the
original plane of polarization. This is a direct consequence
of the principle of the superposition of small motions, which
is universally admitted to be applicable to light. This assump
tion granted, we have only to add that in the thick plate of
quartz one component is retarded with respect to the othor by
a large number of wave-lengths, and that, therefore, after
leaving the quartz there is in homogeneous light no permanent
phase-relationship between the components. The emergent
light, then, is partially polarized in the principal plane of the
quartz, and the ratio of the principal intensities is tan2 <j>. A
certain amount of light is, of course, lost by reflexion at each

                      Polarization of Sky Light.                     101
 surface of the quartz, and a somewhat smaller proportion is lost
 of that polarized in the principal plane than of that polarized
 in the perpendicular plane ; but the difference is very small.
 The former proportion is about 0*0460 and the latter 0*0472.
 These are for a single reflexion. Therefore, owing to the
 double reflexion, the tan8 <f> should be multiplied or divided by
the factor l-0025. This correction is quite negligible in such
work as the present.
    My standardizer consisted of a wooden framework to hold
 the quartz plate, with a round hole over the quartz just large
 enough to let the brass tube of the Nicol turn freely. To
 the Nicol were attached two pointers for taking the readings
 on opposite sides of a carefully graduated circle. The frame
work was screwed onto the polarimeter, care being taken to
set the principal plane of the quartz as nearly as possible
parallel to the plane of rotation of the glass plates. The outer
end of the Nicol was closed with a glass cap to keep out dust;
 but between the Nicol and the quartz or the quartz and the
 pile of plates no glass intervened. The quartz plate was
nearly an inch thick. It was one of the pieces (plate iii.) I
used in a research on the wave-surface of quartz (Phil. Trans,
parti., 1886).
    The readings were taken by setting the pile at a known
angle of incidence and then adjusting the standardizer till the
polarization was neutralized. This could be done in four
different positions of the Nicol, corresponding to the four
quadrants, since tan8 <f> attains any given positive value
four times while <f> is changing from 0° to 360°. I gradu
ated my circle suitably, two opposite points being called 0°,
the two rectangular points 90 , and four intermediate points
45°. Averaging the readings in adjacent quadrants eliminated
any error in the position of the zero-point, while averaging
the readings in opposite quadrants eliminated, at least approxi
mately, the error arising from the axis of rotation of the Nicol
not being truly parallel to the incident light*. I did not take
any large number of readings, as it seemed not worth while
to aim at any high degree of accuracy in standardizing obser
vations of such a variable character as those I have given.
Moreover, in optical observations there is always some risk of
the errors being systematic. In the following Tables are given
the means of the readings in the four quadrants for different
values of the angle of incidence Or on the five plates. The
upper line gives the readings when the plates were tilted to
the right, i. e. the same way as the fixed plates, the lower

102                  Mr. J. C. McConnel on the
when tilted to the left. In the first determination I used sky
light, but, finding that on Fresnel's theory the depolarizing
power of the pile of plates was almost independent of the
colour of the light, I decided in the second determination to
avail myself of the much greater brightness of sunlight reflected
from a sheet of white paper.

    These various readings are not as accordant as I should
have wished. The probable error of the figures given is nearly
twice as great as that of single observations of the sky. This
increased uncertainty arose from the smallness of the field of
view in the standardizer. The aperture of the polarizing Nicol
was about 15 millim. by 10 millim., and its distance from the
 eye about 33 centim. On the other hand, in taking a reading
 at a high angle of incidence, such as G-=60°, the standardizer
 had an advantage in that there was no difficulty in getting a
 complete reversal, changing the black cross into white, or vice
 versa. Whereas in taking an observation of a strongly pola
 rized skv, the plates had to be moved, and this difficulty always
 occurred. For this reason observations of the sky for which Gt
 approaches or exceeds 60° are somewhat untrustworthy.
    It will be noticed that I had to follow liubenson's example
in using a much smaller aperture for standardizing than for
observing. I used a pile of five plates only * while Eubenson
   * My pile of five plates was about 10 niillim. thick, which is less than
the aperture of the Nicol in the direction which was of importance ; Ru-
benson's pile was apparently more than twice as thick as his aperture
was wide,

used twenty, so that, a priori, the resulting error might be
expected to be much smaller in my case. Still I thought it
desirable to apply some test to see how great the error was.
So I prepared a diaphragm with an aperture about half the
apparent breadth of the Nicol, and took observations of the
sky with and without the diaphragm, with the five plates
inclined the same way as the three. The observations with
such a small aperture were very difficult ; but I satisfied my
self that the change produced by the diaphragm, at G = 50°
did not exceed 2£• , and was probably less. With the actual
aperture of the Nicol the error is certainly less than 1°,
 and when the two plates are inclined the other way the error
 should be negligible. Thus the mean error should De less than
 J°, and for G==50° I have made no correction. For G=60°
 it was impossible to determine the error in this way. But
 some correction is probably necessary. So I have added "01
 to the value of r, being partly guided by the value of r deduced
  from Fresnel's laws.
     In the following Table the first line gives the mean observed
 value of <j>, the second the corresponding value of tan2<f>, i. e. r,
  the third and fourth the greatest and least observed values of
  tan2 <j>, the fifth the value of r calculated from Fresnel's laws
  on the assumption that fi=V52, and the sixth the value of r
  finally adopted. The angle of incidence on the three plates
  was found by a careful measure to be 47 and this angle was
  used in the calculation.

     The intermediate values were obtained by interpolation,
  using second differences where necessary. By calculating on
  Fresnel's tlieory the values of the ratios for three plates under
  the incidences 47^° and 49^° respectively, I found that to
   make this Table apply to the readings at St. Moritz five per
   cent, had to be subtracted from the values of r.

method, if carried out with suitable care and precautions,
might be usefully applied to test Fresnel's values of a and b,
especially the former. For instance, by using first a pile of
five plates and then a pile of eight, two independent equations
in a, b would be obtained for each angle of incidence. The
plates should be thin and the Nicol large.

XIII. On the Suppressed Dimensions of Physical Quantities.
                By A. W. Ruckeb, M.A., F.R.S*
IN the calculation of the dimensions of Physical quantities
       we not unfrequently arrive at indeterminate equations in
which two or more unknowns are involved. In such cases
an assumption has to be made, and in general that selected
is that one of the quantities is an abstract number. In
other words the dimensions of that quantity are suppressed.
    The dimensions of dependent units which are afterwards
 deduced from this assumption are evidently artificial, in the
 sense that they do not necessarily indicate their true relations
to length, mass, and time. They may serve to test whether the
 two sides of an equation are correct, but the}' do not indicate
 the mechanical nature of the derived units to which they are
 assigned. On this account they are often unintelligible.
    Another difficulty is caused by the fact that the units
 which we find it convenient to use are sometimes themselves
 of an artificial character, and not such as would have been
 chosen had those who originally defined them possessed a
 clear conception of the nature of the phenomena with which
 they were dealing.
    The obstacles which the study of the subject presents to
 students would, I think, be1 greatly reduced if in develop
 ing it symbols were retained in the formula? to represent the
 quantities the dimensions of which are suppressed, and if the
 artificial appearance of the dimensions of many quantities were
 more clearly traced to the artificial character either of the
 quantities themselves or of the assumptions on which these
 dimensions are calculated.
     It is probable that, as the mechanical explanation of phy
 sical phenomena proceeds, the use of units based on simple
 mechanical conceptions will be extended, that some quantities
 now employed will be dispensed with or regarded from a
 different point of view.
    * Communicated by the Physical Society : read November 24, 1888.

                Dimensions of Physical Quantities.           105
    Thus the satisfactoiy expressions of the dimensions of the
various thermal units is not possible so long as there is any
doubt as to the mechanical definition of temperature.
    The equation
                      [ML2T-a] = [JMc0]
leads, if we regard c as a number, to the result
                        [J] = [L,T-a0-1].
The quantity 0 can hardly be taken as an abstract number,
because the scale on which it is measured affects the numerical
value of J, but, on the other hand, temperature as measured
on the ordinary thermometer-scales has no relation to the
units of length, mass, or time. No change in these units
would affect the magnitude of the degree Centigrade or
Fahrenheit. So long, therefore, as we adhere to the system
of measuring heat in terms of calories instead of in ergs, tem
perature must be regarded as a fundamental quantity in the
sense that the unit of temperature, though necessary for the
expression of other thermal units, is itself independent of the
units of length, mass, and time.
    If it were sufficiently certain that the analogy offered by
 the theory of gases might be extended to all cases, it would
 follow that temperature depended only on mean energy of a
particular kind (in gases the mean energy of translation)
 possessed by the molecules. The mean value of a quantity
 is of the same dimensions as the quantity itself, and thus
 temperature might be regarded not only as being measured
 by, but as being the mean energy of translation of a mole
 cule, or of a standard number of molecules. The dimensions
 of temperature would thus be [ML2T-a]. The number
 which expressed a given temperature would depend on the
 fundamental units, because they determine the magnitude of
 the unit of energy. It would be independent of the concrete
 mass or velocity of the molecules of any particular gas.
     In the case of air at 0°C. and at atmospheric pressure
 V=48,500 centim. per second. If then, exempli gratia,
 the unit of temperature were that necessary to produce an
 increase of 1 erg in the mean total energy of translation of
 the number of molecules contained in 1 cub. centimetre of gas
 at 0° C. and at atmospheric pressure, the absolute tempera
 ture of melting ice on this scale would be
                £ x -001293 x 48500*= 1-5207 x 10'.
 Absolute temperatures Centigrade could be converted into
  this scale with considerable accuracy bv the multiplier 10*/18 ;
  for, dividing 1-5207 x 10" by this number, we get 273-7,

106          Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Suppressed
which is the absolute temperature generally accepted as equi
valent to 0° C. Heat absorbed by a gas at constant volume
would be at once expressed in dynamical measure by the
product of the change in temperature and of two abstract
numbers, viz. the ratio of the number of molecules to the
standard number, aud the ratio of the increase of the total
energy of a molecule to that of the energy of translation.
Even if some such system should ultimately be adopted, our
knowledge of the molecular construction and dynamics of
solids and liquids is as yet too imperfect to warrant an attempt
to place thermal units on a natural and mechanical basis.
Until such a reform can be carried out, I think it would be
best to place temperature in a class of secondary fundamental
units, which, owing either to our ignorance or to our artificial
methods of measurement, cannot be expressed in terms of
length, mass, and time, and which must therefore be regarded
as fundamental to other derived units which depend upon
them.
   The thermal units could then be tabulated in a more syste
matic manner than is usual, and the arbitrary character of the
system would be emphasized by the symbol employed to
represent the dimensions of temperature. If 6 be the symbol
chosen, if specific heat be taken as a number, and the unit of
heat be defined with reference to the unit mass of water, the
following results are obtained :—
      Quantity of heat                          [M0]
      Mechanical equivalent of heat . . .       [L* T~2
      Specific heat                               1
      Latent heat                               [0]
      Thermal capacity                          [Ml
      Coefficients of expansion
      Coefficients of abso.pi.ion and emission   ML-2T-n
      Coefficient of conductivity ....           ML"1 T-1]
      Entropy                                    M]
   Gravitation units hardly come within the scope of the
present paper, but as they are important in their applications
to thermal quantities I may indicate a method of dealing with
them.
   We must distinguish between the nominal unit of mass in
such a system (M) and the real unit (M7), where 7 is the
abstract number which expresses the acceleration of gravity
in terms of the units of length and time. The three funda
mental units in such a system are length, time, and force.
Mass is a derived unit subject to the condition that [L T-2]

                Dimensions of Physical Quantities.          107
is a given concrete acceleration. The only practically im
portant cases are those of force, work, power, and the
mechanical equivalent of heat, and if we multiply the number
expressing any one of these quantities in a gravitation system
 by (the abstract number) y, and remember the condition that
7 [L T-2] is constant, transformations can be effected as
usual.
   Thus, if J, J', and J" be the numerical values of the
mechanical equivalent expressed in an absolute, and two
gravitational systems, we have
  J [La T-3         = J' y [L« V-2 ff-1] = J" 7" [L'ra T"-2
    Thus to find the numerical value of J in the C.G.S. system
 when it is given in the English gravitational system,
  J=773-2 x 32-2 ( foot V ( j6^6 ffg^ Wl6 x 107.
                     V. centim./ V, degree r aur. )
    To find J in the metre-kilogram-second gravitational sys
tem, when it is given in the British gravitational system, we
 reduce the last two of the above expressions by the relation
i [1/ T'-2] =y"[L" T"-2] to the form
                    J'[L'^/-1]=J" [L"
 so that
             J=773-2                      getnt-W24.
                         \metre/ \<iegree r abr./
    To reduce power from an absolute to a gravitational system,
 or vice versa, we have
               n, [Mx W Tr3] =n2 [y3 M2 Ls* T3"3] .
    Thus to find the number of ergs per second which corre
 spond to one H.P.,
          /4=33000 x32-2/P^-d)(^)8=7-46xl0».
                 bU           \ gram
    It is noticeable that although the statement that J is inde
 pendent of the unit of mass is in general true, it holds good
 only when the unit of heat and the unit of force are defined
 with respect to the same un;t of mass. In a gravitational
 system this is not really the case, e.g.'m the English system
 the unit of heat is defined with reference to the pound, while
 the employment of the gravitational measure of force involves
 a unit of mass = 32 "2 lbs. Hence, even when the nominal
 unit of mass has disappeared, the number which expresses
 the ratio between the real and nominal units on the gravita
 tional system remains in the expression for a quantity such

  108         Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Suppressed
 as J, which is based upon others which have themselves
 involved the introduction of mass.
     The open admission in the symbols employed that the
  dimensions of some of the quantities are unknown is more
 important in the case of the electrical and magnetic than in
 that of the thermal units.
    As Maxwell showed, the independent relations between
 these quantities are one less than the number required to
 determine them completely. The electrostatic and electro
 magnetic systems are therefore deduced from assumptions
 which are equivalent to suppressing the dimensions of induc
 tive capacity and magnetic permeability respectively. It
 would, I think, be better to retain in the tobies of dimensions
 symbols which represented these quantities as secondary fun
 damental units. The student would thus have brought more
 clearly before him the cause of the difference of the dimensions
 in the two systems, and the factors necessary to transform
 from the one system to the other would be indicated.
    Thus if, instead of suppressing the dimensions of inductive
 capacity, we treat it as a secondary fundamental unit of
 unknown dimensions, we have the equations
             [S€]=[ML-iT-3], [®] = [Kg];
whence
                     [S)] = [M*L-*T-1K*];
                     [€]-[M*L-*T-lK-»].
    In a precisely similar fashion we get
                      p»] = [M*L-*T-V*],
                      [£] = [M*L-*T-i /*-*].
   By means of these relations all the units can be expressed
in turms of M, L, T, K and M, L, T, /i, and the dimensions
of M, L, T are those of the electrostatic and electromagnetic
systems, according as the first or second mode of expression
is adopted.
   For since
            [S] = [>L-3], .-. [e] = [M5lJT-iK'1];
and since
           [2?]=[mL-2],      .-.  [m] = [MiL'T~V1]j
and from the dimensions of [e] and [to] those of all the other
units can be found.
   Maxwell has given a Table in which the dimensions of each
of the electrical and magnetic units are expressed in terms of

                 Dimensions ofPhysical Quantities.          109
M, L, T, and of either electrical quantity or the strength of a
magnetic pole. My suggestion amounts to nothing more
than that we should use a similar list in which the unknown
quantities are K and fi instead of e and m. The dimensions
in terms of L, M, and T will then be those in the electrostatic
and electromagnetic systems, and, instead of suppressing K and
(i, we should retain them as representing dimensions which are
unknown in terms of the fundamental units.
    In cases where it is necessary to indicate whether the
quantity represented by a symbol is understood to be expressed
in terms of K or /t, we may use the letters s and m subscript
to distinguish between them. Thus e, and em are not quantities
whose dimensions are fundamentally different, but quantities
the dimensions of which are unknown and are expressed in dif
ferent ways in terms of other unknowns. The letters s and m
indicate which of the two methods which are in practical use
is employed.
    By equating two such expressions for the same quantity, or
by using any general relation between any two of the derived
quantities, we get a necessary relation between the dimensions
 of the secondary fundamental units in terms of the primary
 fundamental units of length, mass, and time.
    Thus we have from any one of Maxwell's equations (1) to
 (12) (p. 241) the general relations
                          [em] = [ML2T-1].
     If we choose to express e in terms of K and m in terms of
 ft, the relation still obtains, and thus
       [e m] = [M* L! T"1 K*] x [M* L* T~V] = [M L2 T"1] ;
                           [K-»m-*] = [LT-i].
     It is obvious that there must be such a relation, for since
 only one equation is wanting for the complete determination
 of the dimensions in terms of L, M, and T, we cannot have
 two independent methods of expressing them.
     If, then, we use the letters s and m subscript in the sense
 above explained,
             [e, mm ]   [M» V T-1 K*] x [M* L3 T"1
              [e. m,]   [MfttfT^K^xrtftfK-*],
                        [M»L*/i-l]x[M*L*K-*],
             [emmm]     [M^V^xCM^T-1/**] ;

110           Prof. A. W. Riicker on tlie Suppressed
and if we employ the relation
                       [K-^-i] = [LT-'],
we see that the right-hand sides of these expressions are all
equal to each other and to [M L2 T-1].
   In this case the secondary fundamental units disappear from
the final expression. This would not always be the case for
the product of any two units chosen haphazard, but it would
always be true that any product or quotient of units could, by
the relation
                       [K-»/*-»] = [LT->],
be reduced to the same dimensions in terms of M, L, T, and
either K or fi, whether they were or were not originally ex
pressed in terms of one of these two last quantities only.
   The method can be applied, not only to express more
clearly that the absolute dimensions of the electrostatic
and electromagnetic systems are the same, but to transform
the numerical expressions for given concrete electrical or
magnetic quantities from the one system of units to the other.
   In order to transform a length from one scalo to another by
the relation 7i)[L1] =n2[L2] we must know not only n, or nj but
also the numerical value of the ratio L,/L2. In like manner, to
transform electrical quantities from a system expressed in
terms of K to a system expressed in terms of fi, we must know
the numerical value of the ratio
                          K-i/t-i/LT-1.
   If, then, v be the numerical value of the velocity of light
expressed in terms of the units L and T, we can transform
both dimensionally and numerically by the relation
                      [K-*/t-i]=r[LT-1].
Thus, to find the number of C.G.S. electrostatic units in y
C.G-.S. electromagnetic units of quantity, we have
                x\V- M* T-1 K»] =y x [L* M* ^ ;
               .-. /^[L-'TK-^-*]
                     =3/[L-'T]xi'[LT-'] = t^.
   To find tlie number of C. G.S, Electromagnetic Units ofResist
ance in 20 C.G.S. Electrostatic units.
   Working this out from first principles we have, by Maxwell's
equations {loc. cit.) (2) and (4),
                       _[E] =  _ [MLaT-1e-2] ;
                   [R] =
                          .0]

                Dimensions of Physical Quantities.           Ill
whence, substituting for e in turn in terms of K and /*,
                 [R] = [L-1TK-1] = [LT"V]-
Hence
                  a-[LT-V] = 20[L-1TK-1].
                     or=20[L-3T2K-V-1].
And since
                     [K -V_1]=^[L2T-2],
                              x=1W,
which is correct.
   In these cases the fundamental units of length, mass, and
time, and the medium with respect to which the unit charge
and the unit pole are denned, are the same in both systems of
units ; but the method can be extended to cases in which
these conditions do not hold, and which are far more complex
than those which are likely to occur in practice.
   If the unit charge were denned to be such that two
unit charges at a distance of 1 metre in a medium of which
the inductive capacity was twice that of air, repelled each
other with a force which would, in one second, produce in a
centigram a velocity of 1 metre per second, we may find the
number of ordinary electrostatic units to which it is equivalent.
We have the general relation
           ajV Mx* Tr1 Ki»] = 1 x [IV M2* T2-' K2J] ;
                  _ /metre\i/centigram\*/K2\i
                    \ cm. / \ gram / \Kj
                  = 103xl0"1x ^2 = 100^/2.
   Thus if it were desired to find the number of C.G.S. elec
 tromagnetic units of charge in the unit electrostatic charge
 above defined, we should proceed as follows :—
              ^[L^ Mi* /*!-*] = ! x [L,» M^V'Kf*].
 But
                                K^LjT,-1 ;
        .-. ^[L,1 Mi* Tr1 K,»] = 1 x [L2> M,* T2-' K2»] ;
 where, as before, quantities with 2 subscript refer to the new
 unit. Of course i\ must be expressed in terms of centi
 metres and seconds, as these are the magnitudes of Lj and Tx
respectively.
    .-.     sx3xl010=10V2,            .'. *=^xl0-8.
    As a final example we may take the following problem, in
 which the data are chosen merely for the purpose of illus
 tration:—Find the number of C.G.S. electrostatic units of

112          Prof. A. W. Riicker on the Suppressed
magnetic induction in 10 electromagnetic units of a system
in which the units of length, mass, and time are the metre,
centigram, and second respectively, and in which the specific
inductive capacity and the refractive index of the standard
medium with reference to air are 2 and 1*5 respectively.
Assume that K-* /*-* is proportional to the velocity of light
in the medium.
   We have already seen that
            [2?] = |M* L-* T-1      = [Mi L-i K-4] .
   Hence if a subscript refers to air,
x [(grain)*(cm.)-* K„-i]
                         = 10 [ (centig.)* (metre) ~* (sec.)-1 /**].
   We may now make the substitution
                K„-*=3x 1010/4(om.) (sec.)"1 ;
or else calculating the velocity of light in the medium from
the refractive index, we may write
                     1*5 K-i (metre) (sec0-
              ^= 3x10"
   By the first substitution we get

 by the method of dimensions extended to secondary funda

 change in the method of exhibiting the dimensions of electri

           In conclusion, then, I think it would be well to introduce
       symbols for what I have called secondary fundamental units
       instead of suppressing their dimensions, for the following
       reasons :—
           (1) We thereby generalize the method of determining by
       dimensional equations the relation between a change in the
       magnitude of the units and in the number of which a given
       quantity is expressed.
           (2) In the case of the electrical and magnetic units the
       method indicates clearly the cause of the difference be
       tween the dimensions in terms of M, L, and T of the same
       quantity in the two systems.
           (3) It indicates that the dimensions of different quantities
       in the same system, which are apparently the same with re
       spect to M, L, T, really are or may be different, as their
       dimensions with respect to K or fi are different ;
                        e.g. [25] = [L-*M4T-lK*]
                              [g] = [L-» MiT-1 K-»].
           (4) It suggests an explanation of the artificial and unin
        telligible character of the electric and magnetic units. If the
        dimensions of K and jm were known, they would probably bo
        simplified.
           (5) Lastly, I think the symbols are thus made to express
        the limits of our knowledge and ignorance on the subject
        more exactly than if we arbitrarily assume that some one of
        the quantities involved is an abstract number.

XIV. On the Definition of the Terms "Energy" and "Work."
                     By Simon Newcomb*.
THE accepted definitions of the terms " kinetic energy "
       and " work " are substantially these :—
   The kinetic energy of a moving body is measured by half
the product of its mass into the square of its velocity.
   The work done by a force acting upon a body is the pro
duct of the intensity of the force into the motion of the body
in the direction in which the force acts.
   It will be noticed that the terms " velocity " and " motion "
are here used as if their measures were absolute. But it is
universally understood that motion, and therefore velocity,
are relative terms ; that no body considered in itself can bo
said to be either in motion or at rest, because motion and rest
can be defined only as the motion or rest of one body rela
tively to some other body, real or imaginary. It follows that
we may assign to any one body any arbitrary motion we
choose.
    Such being the case, it would seem to follow from the above
definitions that the energy of a moving body considered by
itself is an entirely arbitrary quantity ; that the same is true
of the work done upon a body ; and that, when we consider
 the kinetic energy of a system, its amount will depend upon
 the origin to which we refer the motion of the system. The
 value of the kinetic energy will be a minimum when the
 motion which we assign to the centre of gravity of the system
 is zero, and may be greater than this minimum by an amount
 which will depend upon the motion of the centre of gravity
 relative to the point of reference. Not only is the work done
 by a force acting on a moving body arbitrary for the same
 reason, but we cannot assign any value to the work necessary
 to change one given motion A into another given motion B,
 though the relation of B to A be completely given.
    The question now arises, In what form are we to define
 these seemingly arbitrary quantities so as to make their
 amounts definite? This requires an improved statement of
 Newton's third law. As usually formulated, this law implies,
 but does not completely express, a universal condition of the
 action of every mechanical force with which we are acquainted,
 namely :—
    No force ever acts except between bodies ; and every force so
 acting on a body A is a mutual action between that body and
 some other body B, such that the actions on the two bodies are
equal and opposite.
                  * Communicated by the Author.
                               12

116     Definition of the Terms "Energy " and " Work."
   The lack of explicitness in the current statements of this
law is noteworthy. The first clause in Newton's statement of
the law, " Actioni contrariam semper et sequalem esse reac-
tionem," does indeed imply, but does not explicitly state, that
the reaction is exerted upon a body from which the action
must emanate. In all the authorities which I have noticed
even the implication is wanting, the law being stated in the
hypothetical form—when one body acts upon another, the
other acts upon it, &c. This statement can scarcely be said
even to imply that there is never any action upon one body
except such as emanates from another body.
   We may now give precision to the definition of work by
putting it in this form :—
   The work done by a force is the product of the intensity of
the force into the amount by which the two material points
between which it acts approach to or recede from each other ; the
work being positive when the approach or recession is in the
direction of the force, negative in the opposite case.
   The quantity of work thus defined is independent of the
point to which we refer the motion of the two bodies, since
only the relative motion is involved, and since two bodies
must, and two only can, come into play in the case of any one
force.
   The case is different with energy. It cannot be defined in
terms of the relative motion even of two bodies ; because, in
this simplest case, if the masses are different the energy will
be greater when we refer the motion to the body of smaller
mass. Hence, in defining the quantity of energy, we must
always implicitly assume some point of reference ; and this
point being arbitrary, the total energy either of a body or of
a system is necessarily an arbitrary quantity.
   Moreover, whether the work is done upon a body or by a
body in changing its motion from one state to another, depends
altogether upon the mass and motion of the foreign body from
which the action emanates. The law of the conservation of
energy assumes that we refer the motions of all the bodies
whose energy is considered, to some foreign body of infi nite
mass, from which emanate the forces which give motion to
the system. The energy of the system is then equal to the
work it would do by being brought to a state of rest by forces
acting between its own parts and the body of reference. In
the familiar problems of kinetic energy we take as our body
of reference a point on the surface of the moving earth, and
then regard the energy of the moving body as the work done
or to be done upon it by reaction against the earth, or some
body fixed with reference to the earth.

                 On the Magnetization of Nickel.                  117
   I cannot but think that sound philosophy would be pro
moted could these limitations of the doctrine of the conser
vation of energy be made clear to those philosophers who see
in the doctrine only a special case of a general law of mind
and matter.
XV. Combined Effects of Torsion and Longitudinal Stress on
   the Magnetization of Nickel. By H. Nagaoka, Rigukushi,
   of the Imperial University, Japan. With a Note by J. T.
   Bottomlet, F.R.S., and A. Tanakadate, Rigakushi *.
                            [Plates II.-V.]
THE effect of torsion in altering the induced magnetism
        of iron has long engaged the attention of many phy
sicists. Among the experimenters in this field of research
may be named Wertheim, Wiedemann, Thomson, and Tom-
linson (whose latest work on such subjects I have not yet seen).
The experiments of Wiedemann were made by twisting and
untwisting the wire, which was placed horizontally, in a mag
netizing solenoid, till the changes of magnetism became cyclic.
But it was Thomson who first investigated the effect of torsion
on the magnetism of iron, the wire being at the same time
subject to definite longitudinal stresses. In his experiments
the soft iron wire was placed vertically in the earth's field.
No one seems to have made similar experiments in different
 magnetizing fields. Scanty though this kind of investigation
has been for iron, it is still more scanty for nickel. Indeed,
so far as 1 am aware, the effect of torsion on the magnetism
of nickel wire under various longitudinal stresses has not
hitherto been investigated. This accordingly was the problem
I resolved to attack ; and the results that bave been obtained
will, I believe, be found to contain distinct novelties.
   It is well known from the results of various experimenters
that, by the application of longitudinal stress, the magnetism
of iron increases up to a certain critical load, while that of
nickel always diminishes. Thus we should naturally expect
that the effect of torsional stress on nickel will be opposite to
that on iron. In fact, this is exactly reproduced in one of
Wiedemann's experiments t> the curve obtained being just
the reverse of one given by Thomson %. But Wiedemann's
result was obtained by simply clamping the wire in a hori
zontal position, so that the wire was subject to a weak longi-

118       Mr. H. Nagaoka on the Effects of Torsion and
tudinal stress only. On this account the combined effect of
pull and torsion on the magnetism of nickel was still a matter
to be determined.
    In the following experiments I have examined these points,
and have found that the longitudinal stress produced a singular
effect. For weak stresses the change of magnetism came out
as was to be expected, but when the load exceeds a certain
limit this is no longer the case. The changes of magnetism
become gradually altered, and beyond a critical value of the
longitudinal stress one end of the nickel wire acquires the
two opposite kinds of magnetism during the torsion and
detorsion, notwithstanding the absolute constancy of the mag
netizing force both in direction and magnitude. This critical
value of the load seems to vary with the strength of the mag
netizing field, becoming greater as the field is increased. All
these points will be described in the following pages.
    I must here express my thanks to Dr. 0. Gr. Knott for his
kind suggestions during the course of experiments.
    The intensity of magnetization was measured by a direct
magnctometric method. The magnetometer consisted of a
small mirror hung by a spider-thread 11 centim. long. This
was geometrically fixed in position on a wooden plank ac
cording to Thomson's method of the hole slot, plane. Level
ling was effected by three base-screws. In front of the mag
netometer a lamp was placed, and the image of the slit was
reflected on a circular scale. Its radius was 1 metre, and it
was so placed that the magnetometer was just at its centre.
The wire to be examined was set vertically due east of the
magnetometer. The upper end of the wire was level with the
centre of the magnetometer-mirror. To each end of the wire
a short stout brass wire was brazed. The lower of these was
bent into a hook, so that a pan holding the weight could be
hung from it. The upper one was riveted to a strong brass
rod projecting from the middle of the side of a table, which
rested on stone piers. The nickel wire* was surrounded by
a magnetizing coil 45 centim. long. The resistance of the
 coil was 19'6 ohms, and the strength of the field for a current
of one ampere was 138-4 C.G.S. units. The magnetizing
current was sent from 12 Daniell cells, and its strength was
adjusted by means of a liquid slide and measured by a tangent
 galvanometer.
    The twisting-apparatus is shown in the subjoined cut.
   * This wire contained 17 per cent, of iron, besides small quantities of
carbon as impurities.

          Longitudinal Stress on the Magnetization of Nickel.   119
    It consisted of two hollow cylinders of 2*5 centim. radius.
    The lower cylinder was fixed to a tripod stand, while the
    upper one fitted into it, and was movable. The latter was
    graduated on its external cylindrical surface at intervals of
    20°, and by means of a pointer which was cut on the corre
    sponding surface of the fixed cylinder the amount of twist was

     easily read off. The screw, S, attached to the lower cylinder
     serves to fix the upper one at any desired angle of twist. On
     the inner surface of the movable cylinder two vertical V-
     grooves were cut opposite each other. On these the two ends
     of the thick brass diametral rod were made to slide. This
    rod had a small hole at its centre which was just large enough
    to allow the passage of the brass wire attached to the lower
    end of the nickel wire. In order to secure the axial position
    of this hole with reference to the twisting-cylinder, the rod
    was fixed between the V's and bored on a lathe by turning it
    together with the cylinder. A small clamping-screw served
    to pin the wire fast against the side of the rod, so that the
    wire and cylinder rotated together.

 120     Mr. H. Nagaoka on the Effects of Torsion and
   It might at first sight appear that this arrangement might
prevent the longitudinal stress being applied uniformly for
various angles of the twist, because of the friction of the rod
 against the Vs. To test this point the wire was fixed by the
 screw and the longitudinal pull applied by known loads hung
 on below. The upper end of the wire was fastened to a spring-
 balance, by means of which any variations of stress could at
 once be detected. With a given load, the wire was twisted
 through various angles ; but scarcely any sensible variation
 of longitudinal stress was indicated.
   The magnetic experiments were conducted in the following
 manner :—At first a constant current was made to pass through
 the magnetizing coil and the magnetometer-zero was deter
 mined. The wire was then placed in position, and was first
 twisted through 180° in what we call the positive direction ;
although it may^be stated once for all that the positive direc
tion means the first chosen direction, whether that is, so to
speak, with the magnetizing current or against it. Then
after a complete revolution in the opposite direction, it was
brought back to its original position. This process was
repeated till the changes became nearly cyclic. Then at every
successive 20° of twist, the deflexion of the magnetometer-
magnet as given by the scale-reading was taken and noted,
the reading being observed by means of a telescope. Each
complete set of experiments was made in a constant magnetic
field, while the wire was subjected to gradually-increasing
longitudinal stresses. The results thus obtained are given in
C.G-.S. electromagnetic units, though such reduction is not
necessary in experiments of this kind. The observed values
of the intensity 3 for successive 60° of twist are given in the
Appendix. In the figures showing the changes of magneti
zation, the abscissas denote the amount of twist, while the
ordinates represent the intensity of magnetization
   The first experiment was made with a nickel wire 40 centim.
long, and 1 millim. thick. The wire was deprived of its initial
magnetism by heating it red-hot. It was then placed vertically,
and so came under the influence of a magnetic field of -34
C.Gr.S. units. With a steady load of -64 kilog. the wire
was subjected to repeated twisting and untwisting. After
six such operations, the changes became nearly cj'clic, and
the following readings of deflexions were taken at the seventh
cycle :—

    Examining the figure, we see that the first effect of twisting
is to increase the magnetization. The rate of increase is rapid
at first, but gradually falls off as the magnetization attains its
greatest value at the maximum twist. During the process of
untwisting the magnetization diminishes more rapidly than it
increased during twisting, so that for every position of twist
the magnetization during twisting is greater than the magne
tization during untwisting. The diminution of magnetization
goes on even after the wire has passed the original position
from which the twisting was begun until the apparent mag
netization is at length reduced to zero. This happens very
 soon after the original position of the untwisted wire has been
 reached, as the process of untwisting is continued as twisting in
 the negative direction. But now as this negative twisting is
 continued, the polarity of the noire changes sign, a very striking
 fact indeed. As the twisting is continued on towards —180°,
 this negative magnetization passes through an arithmetical
 maximum, becoming finally almost zero. As the wire is being
 brought back to the position from which it started, the mag
 netization gradually recovers nearly its original value, as
 shown in the figure.
    Now, reasoning from analogy, we should expect to obtain

122      Mr. H. Nagaoka on the Effects of Torsion and
by such twisting and untwisting a curve of the form given in
PI. II. fig. 5, since the behaviour of nickel with regard to the
effect of stress in magnetization seems to be just opposite to
that of iron (see Sir W. Thomson's figures for iron, Philoso
phical Transactions, 1879). But in this experiment the
curve of magnetization seems to have no resemblance at all to
any figured by Sir W. Thomson ; and then there is the very
curious fact that the magnetization of nickel in a steady field
can be made to change sign by twisting. It first occurred to
me that this very extraordinary result must be due to some
defect in the arrangement, but careful examination discovered
no flaw. The question naturally suggests itself, Was this phe
nomenon a function of the load as well as of the twist ? Hence,
as a next step, the weight was increased by *5 kilog., and the
experiment was performed in the usual manner.
   The result is shown in fig. 2. Here the effect is quite
similar to the former, the differences being only differences
of detail. The march of magnetization with positive twisting
is sensibly the same as in the former case ; but during
negative twisting the opposite magnetization has increased to
more than ten times its amount in the first experiment.
However, the rate of recovery has very much diminished,
and even after a twist of 180° the magnetization is far from
reaching the former value.
   The same experiment was then performed with the load
increased to 5*14 kilogs. The result is shown in fig. 3.
There again we find the opposite magnetization still more
increased. Indeed, the two kinds of magnetization do not
differ much in intensity at the two extreme twists, although
the initial or positive magnetization is somewhat predominant.
In the two former experiments there was a distinct tendency
towards recovery of positive magnetization as the wire was
twisted more and more in the negative direction. Here,
however, no such tendency shows itself except in the diminished
rate of growth of negative magnetization.
   Still increasing the load, we see that the curve (fig. 4)
becomes nearly symmetrical with respect both to the line of
zero magnetization, and the line of zero twisting. In this
case we find further that the range of the change of magneti
zation has considerably diminished. The slight excess of the
initial magnetization over the other still shows itself, a fact
which is probably to be referred to the direction of the mag
netizing force.
   The general conclusion from these experiments is that in a
weak field of "34 units, the increase of load makes the manner
of change of magnetization in nickel under the influence of

       Longitudinal Stress on the Magnetization of Nickel.     123
cyclic twisting depart more and more from any slight resem
blance which at small loads it seemed to bear to the manner
of change for iron. For still smaller loads, then, it might be
possible to obtain the magnetization-curve just opposite to
that of iron.
    In the second series of experiment the strength of the field
was raised to 2-47 units. The load at first applied was only
the weight of the brass wire attached to the lower end of the
nickel wire, and a brass rod which gripped the wire during
the process of twisting. This load was -02 kilog., that is, a
tension of 2'6 kilogs. weight per sq. centim. With this
amount of longitudinal stress, the successive twistings and
untwistings were performed seven times, and the following
readings of deflexion were taken :—
   Twist (positive). Headings.    Twist (negative).  Headings.

 The curve thus obtained (see fig. 5) is nearly perfectly sym
 metrical with respect to the line of zero twisting. Also, the
 magnetization remains positive throughout the whole cycle.
 It is, moreover, interesting to observe that the curve is exactly
 the reverse of that of iron as obtained by Thomson. This
 shows that the behaviour of nickel twisted in a magnetic field
 under feeble loads is opposite to that of iron.
    When the stress was increased to 145 kilogs. weight per
 sq. centim., the magnetization-curve lost its symmetry and
 became as shown in fig. 6. The intensity of the magnetization
 became greatly diminished, but still remained positive through
 out the whole cycle of operations. The features to be noted

   124       Mr. H. Nagaoka on the Effects of Torsion and
   are that, although suggestive of the symmetrical form given
   in fig. 5, the curve is now distinctly one-sided with respect
   to the line of zero twisting, and indicates much greater
   magnetization for positive than for negative twists. These
   peculiarities are still more pronounced when the stress is
   increased to 209 kilogs., as shown in fig. 7.
      This experiment is of special interest, illustrating as it does,
  the manner in which the magnetization-cycle changes charac
  ter just as the extraordinary phenomenon of change of sign is
  about to show itself.
     As usual, the first effect of twisting the wire is to increase
  the intensity of magnetization, while the effect of untwisting
  it is to decrease it. Then, as the untwisting is continued as
  negative twisting, the magnetization tends to recover its former
  value. But for the maximum negative twist of two right
  angles, the magnetization does not nearly recover its former
  value. Thus it is evident that in such a strength of field the
  increase of longitudinal stress tends to make the increase of
  magnetization during negative twisting gradually less and
  less, until finally for a certain load the increase does not take
  place at all for the particular range of twist. This is shown
  in fig. 8, which is the curve for a tension of 782 kilogs. weight
 per sq. centim.
     A study of these four curves (figs. 5, 6, 7, 8) shows the
 character of the changes wrought in the cycles as the load is
 increased. The symmetry is first lost, the negative loop be
 coming smaller and smaller. Then, as shown in fig. 7, it
 ceases to be a loop, the course of the return curve from greatest
 negative twist lying above the other, and never cutting it.
 Then, as in fig. 8, the upward course of the curve on the
 negative side of zero twist vanishes away altogether ; while
 at the same time the phenomenon of reversal of magnetic
polarity shows itself. Thus the double-looped curve for low
tensions passes gradually into a single-looped curve as the
tension is increased. And after this single-looped curve is
 obtained, the phenomenon of reversed polarity begins to
appear. The passage from the double-looped to the single-
looped curve betokens a peculiar alteration in the lagging-
effect in nickel—an alteration which has no analogue in the
case of iron.
    To study more carefully the law of hysteresis in nickel—to
use Professor Ewing's word—the experiments were repeated
in stronger fields.
    Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12 (PI. III.) show the march of events in a
field of 4*94 units, the tensions increasing from 400. For
smaller tensions the curves are of the approximately symme
trical form shown already in fig. 5, and do not call for special

      Longitudinal Stress on the Magnetization of Nickel.     125
remark. Here, then, we see how the already diminished loop
for negative twisting, as shown in fig. 9, has vanished alto
gether in fig. 10. At the same time, the curve begins to
cross the lines of zero magnetization into the negative region.
Fig. 11 is a further development in the same direction. In
both of these curves (10 and 11), the quantity ^3 the rate of
change of magnetization with twist, still changes sign at par
ticular twists. The negative tail—as it might be called—so
evident in fig. 10, has disappeared in fig. 11 ; while at the
same time the negative magnetization nas numerically in
creased. But now passing to the higher load (see fig. 12),
we see that the various changes discussed above have their
final end in a simple single-looped curve, with a large portion
in the region of negative magnetization, and with no true
minimum-points for 3. The twist for which, in the first three
cases, the value of (£3
                     -j- changes sign, works towards the left
as the load is increased. Thus :—
              For W = 400, d^/dr=0 at + 8°.
                   W=527, „ =0 at -20°.
                   W = 655, „ =0 at -60°.
For W = 1910, we may regard this critical twist as being too
great to be included in the range of greatest twist applied.
   It was remarked, while discussing the experiment made in
the earth's vertical field, that the ratio of the two opposite
magnetizations gradually tends to unity as the load is increased;
but this does not seem to be generally the case. There is a
certain limit beyond which there is an opposite tendency.
The following calculations show that this must be the case:—
Let +3 and —3 be the greatest magnetization during positive
and negative twists respectively, then in the field = 4*94 units,
and
   W= 655; +3 = 188-6,-3= 49-9, +3/-3=3'78;
   W= 910; +3 = 152-1, -3 = 151-3, + 3/-3 = l-005
   W=1270; +3 = 119-3, -3=113-1, +3/-3=105;
   W=1910; +3= 86-3, -3= 77-4, + 3/-3 = Ml.
   The following experiments in field =6'71, show how this
ratio depends on the strength of the field. The changes which
the magnetization-curve undergoes while it is changing its
sign are quite analogous to the preceding two cases, as a glance
at figs. 13, 14, and 15 will show. From figs. 15, 16 (PI. III.),
17 (PI. IV.), however, we see how the opposite magnetization
becomes smaller as we increase the field . The ratio + 3/( — 3)
is always a very large quantity and has a minimum value lor

126        Mr. H. Nagaoka on the Effects of Torsion and
a particular load. For loads greater than this particular load
the negative magnetization decreases, and at last completely
vanishes. Thus, for stress W = 1770 kilogs., there is no
opposite magnetization therein agreeing with the curves for
loads smaller than that for which the negative magnetization
first appears. But there is the difference that the curve is a
single loop in which dfj/dr changes sign during negative
twisting and untwisting.
    Taking into account all the series of experiments, we see
that the greatest value in each Series of the ratio             3
tends to increase as the field is increased. The strength of
field in which these last experiments were tried seems to he
about the critical value for which we can get the two
transitions of magnetization—namely the change of sign for
particular load and the vanishing of this change for a higher
load.
    The peculiarities which have just been the subject of dis
cussion do not, however, persist at all strengths of , fields.
At still higher fields a different order of things comes in.
Take, for example, the next series of experiments with a field
 of 8-06, as shown in figs. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. First of all, for
 the lower tensions, the two-looped curve is more sj'inmetrical
 than it can be obtained at lower fields (see fig. 18). In fig.
 19, for a tension of 782, a symmetry begins to show itself;
 but the diminution, instead of taking place in the left-hand or
 negative loop, takes place in the right-hand or positive loop.
 Figs. 20, 21 show the gradual vanishing away of this right-
 hand loop as the load is increased. Also, exactly as in the
 former sets of experiments, the curve dips below the zero-
 magnetization line, as the right-hand portion loses its loop-
 character. Now if we were to compare fig. 21 with figs. 17,
  12, and 8, 2, and take no account of the intermediate links
 of development, we should at once regard them as being of
 essentially opposite character. In the four earlier cases
 positive twist increased the magnetization and negative twist
 diminished it ; but in the present case the effects are exactly
 opposite. In the same way fig. 20 presents features quite
 opposite to those presented by figs. 1, 7, 11, and 16. How
  ever, just as in the former sets of experiments, the twist at
 which d%/dr vanishes was shown to shift gradually to the
 negative side as the load was increased ; so in the present
  case, the twist at which d^/dr vanishes shifts gradually to the
  right as the load is increased. These very interesting reversals
  of effects clearly depend on the strength of the field. Then,
 again, the particular strength of field at which the reversal of
  these effects begins to show itself seems to be connected with
 the fact already discussed, that for a particular field the ratio

      Longitudinal Stress on the Magnetization of flickel.     127
+ j/f— 3) becomes infinite. In other words, when the
strength of the field is such that, under sufficient loading, the
reversal of polarity vanishes away, this seems to be the signal
for the new set of conditions to appear. Up to this critical
strength of field, it is the left-hand loop in the typical sym
metrical curve that gradually diminishes under loading. But
for strengths of fields higher than this critical value, it is the
right-hand loop that disappears when the load is great enough.
This reversal of effects also seems to be accompanied by a
lingering of the magnetization near the zero (see figures 18
and 19).
   It is not necessary to discuss in detail other combinations
of field and stress which were experimented upon. There are
certain minor differences depending on strength of the field ;
but the principal features for fields higher than 8 are the
same. The essential characteristics can be gathered from
figures, brief explanations of which I shall content myself
with giving.
   Figs. 22-23 (PI. IV.).—These illustrate the changes of
magnetization in field 11*9.
   Figs. 24-27 (PI. IV.).—These were obtained infield 13"85.
The curious transition-curve, fig. 30, Pl.V., is specially worthy
of note.
    Figs. 28-31 (PI. V.).—These show the gradual changes of
magnetization for field 15-78.
    Figs. 32-34 were obtained in field 23*50.
    Figs. 35-40 were obtained in field 3354.
    This last was the highest strength of the field at which it
 was possible to notice the changes of magnetization. For
 the stronger the field the higher is the load necessary to bring
 out the curious changes. The critical load for fields higher
 than 33*54 is greater than the tenacity of the wire.
    There is one other point that calls for remark. The range of
 the change of magnetization under feeble stresses begins gra
 dually to diminish after a certain strength has been reached, so
 that for a field of 20 or 30, the change of magnetization by
 twisting becomes almost inappreciable. This can be accounted
 for by the fact that nickel wire, whether in the normal or
 twisted condition, behaves practically the same as regards mag
 netization in higher fields. Indeed, nickel is more easily satu
 rated than iron, so that when Jq = 20 or 30, it is already far
 beyond the saturation-point. Consequently the differences in
 the susceptibilities of nickel in the normal and twisted con
 ditions, to which this alteration of magnetic intensities must
 be ascribed, become less and less marked as the strength of
 the field is increased. Many of the features of magnetization-
 curves are quite simply accounted for by this consideration.

128        Mr. H. Nagaoka on the Effects of Torsion and
   It is very difficult to determine the exact loading at which
the reversed phenomenon of reverse polarity makes its
appearance in various fields. Assuming, however, that with
in small ranges of load, the decrease in the intensities of
magnetization is proportional to the amount of loading, I
obtained the following values for the stress which must be
applied so as to effect the reversal of polarity of the particular
nickel wire placed in various fields :—
              For $<= -34, W= 77 kilogs. centim.8

                  •0=33-54, W=2830         „      „

we get the annexed figure :—

   This seems to show that, for moderate strengths of field, the
load at which the wire begins to show reversed polarity is
nearly directly proportional to the strength of the field. For
very weak and strong fields this rule does not seem to hold.
It must be remembered, of course, that all these peculiarities
are for one particular twist only, and that it is possible that
quite a different series of effects might exist for other twists.

       Longitudinal Stress on the Magnetization of Nickel.    1 29
    The general results of these experiments may be thus
 summarized.
    In all magnetic fields with moderate loading, the effect of
 twisting nickel wire is to increase the magnetization. But
 the increase depends on the strength of the field as well as the
 longitudinal stress applied. If the field is weak and the lon
 gitudinal stress sufficiently great, the magnetization increases
 in one direction of twist and decreases in the other. Even
 tually, for a particular stress which is approximately propor
 tional to the field, the wire begins to show opposite polarity ;
 and the cyclic curve of magnetization passes gradually from
 a two-looped to a single-looped form. For stronger fields
 similar effects exist. But in fields higher than a critical
 value the increase and decrease of magnetization take place
 for reversed directions of twist, and at the same time the
 course of the curve becomes reversed.
    In a recent paper (" Magnetische Untersuchungen," Wiede
 mann's Annalen, March 1886) Professor Wiedemann has
 described certain experiments on the combined effects of mag
 netization and twist in iron and nickel. He does not seem,
 however, to have investigated the effect of longitudinal stress
 in conjunction with these. His chief aim seems to have been
 to adduce facts in support of his theory of frictionally rotated
molecules. Some of the results above described may be ex
pressed in terms of his theory. Thus, when the external
magnetizing force is great, the magnetic molecules will be
held in position more strongly, and consequently the change
of magnetization due to twisting will be diminished. This
agrees with experiment. But, again, we saw that by suffi
ciently loading the wire we could bring the apparent magneti
zation down to zero, and eventually reverse its sign by mere
twisting. Now if this be due to the frictional rotation of
molecules, the molecules must, notwithstanding the directive
force of 30 units, be rotated through more than a right angle
from their first position, while the amount of mechanical twist
amounts only to '079 radian per centiin. in each direction.
Admit it to be so ; what effect then may we expect increased
loading to produce on the rotation of the molecules? The
magnetic molecules in strong fields are acted on only by a
greater directive force, and consequently they must tend to
remain more in the direction of the magnetizing force ; but
why they should assume nearly the position of magnetic
neutrality when they are subjected to sufficient longitudinal
stress is a question which every supporter of the theory of
frictionally rotated molecules is bound to answer.

       Note by J. T. Bottomley and A. Tanakadatr.
                            [Plate VI.]
   The results described in the foregoing paper are of so
remarkable and unexpected a character, that it seemed both
desirable and interesting that some of the experiments should
be repeated under fresh conditions and by new hands. Ac
cordingly the authors of the present note, though they desire
to avoid interfering in any way with an investigation so
admirably commenced by Mr. Nagaoka, have made a few
observations of which a brief account may here be given.
   To each end of a nickel wire a cross-bar of very thick
copper strip was attached. A hole was drilled in the middle
of the cross-bar and the end of the nickel wire passed into it
and silver-soldered. One of these bars was attached by brass
screws to the under side of a wooden beam ; and to the other
bar a scale-pan for carrying a stretching load, and a very
simple apparatus for applying pure torsion were connected.
The accompanying sketch (PI. VI.) will explain the arrange
ment. The torsion-apparatus consists of a brass tube fitting,
not too tightly, inside a second outer tube, which is fixed to
the table and acts as a guide. The inner tube carries a fork
which is connected by two easily removable pins with the
copper cross-piece. An enlargement of the torsion-apparatus,
T, is shown in the figure. The cord which carries the scale-pan
and weights is attached to the cross-bar and passes down along
the axis of the inner tube. The whole of the torsion arrange
ment can be disconnected from the wire in two or three
seconds, by removing the pins and the wire left hanging with
or without the scale-pan and weights. The wire itself also
can with the greatest ease be raised or lowered, or can be
completely removed in order to find the zero of the magneto
meter. It is only necessary for this purpose to pull out two
pins of very thick copper rod which serve to support the
wooden beam, A B.
   The magnetometer M is of the kind now well known :—A
light galvanometer-mirror with magnets on the back, hung by
a long single silk fibre. It was placed, to the east of the wire,
on the table ; and a lamp and scale were employed for read
ing the deflexions. The magnetometer was placed opposite
to the lower end of the coil : and the magnetometer-needles
were ascertained to be magnetized in such a way that true
southern magnetism (red) developed in the lower end of the
wire, placed as described, caused increased readings of the
magnetometer-scale. The northern magnetism caused dimi

  134          Messrs. Bottomley and Tanakadate* on
  nished readings. The scale used is graduated from 0 at the
  left hand to 1000 at the other extremity.
     The foregoing brief description of the apparatus used will
  be considered sufficient in a note like the present.
     The nickel wire used was T58 millim. in diameter. It is
  of excellent quality, though not guaranteed perfectly pure.
  The first wire used was 63 centim. long ; a second wire, which
  was used inside a solenoid, was 5 or 6 centim. longer. After
  being hung up, the wire was several times heated to redness
  at every part by passing a Bunsen-flame up and down it.
  The scale-pan and a small weight were kept hanging on the
  wire during this heating, which was with care carried out to
 the very extremities of the wire.
     The wire was then very carefully lifted down, shocks being
 avoided ; the zero of the magnetometer was ascertained;
 the wire was replaced, and the scale-pan first and then the
 stretching-load were cautiously applied. The heating process
 was repeated when, after any usage to which the wire had
 been subjected, it was judged that irregularity of magneti
 zation might have been introduced.
    After a few preliminary trials had been made with small
 loads, all of which seemed to verify conclusions which would
 be represented by Mr. Nagaoka's curves (figs. 1 and 2),
 the wire was reheated and a load of 12-49 kilogs., or 640
 kilogs. weight per square centimetre, was applied. This it was
 considered ought to give results such as would be represented
 by fig. 3 of the original paper. The following table shows the
 results of this experiment, and the readings under twist fully
 confirm Mr. Nagaoka's corresponding experiment.

   The wire, on being freed from the torsion-apparatus, was
found to have taken a permanent set of about 35° ; being left
free to take this position, the magnetometer-reading was 500.
Once more brought to zero of the torsion-scale, the mag
netometer-reading was 315. It is to be noted that a similar
remark as to the permanent set applies in all similar cases
during the experiments detailed below. The wire we used
would not bear 180° twist in either direction without per
manent set.
   To alter the magnetism of the wire without applying a
magnetizing-coil, a small but powerful steel magnet was
applied to the wire, as in the old method of magnetization by
"simple touch." The true south pole of the magnot was
placed against the wire, and the magnet was passod from the
highest point downward several times ; thus reversing the
effect due to terrestrial magnetism.

   The magnet was now passed from the lowest end to the top
of the wire, the southern pole being still the one in contact
with the wire. The effect was to increase very much the
effect due to terrestrial magnetism.

   The series thus described having been completed, the wire
 was replaced with the weight on as before, Dut the torsion-
 apparatus was not connected to it. The wire had then a
 negative permanent set of about 35°. Left free it influenced
the magnetometer but little, the reading being 500. Twisting
a little (well within elastic limits) from this free position in
the positive direction produced increased southern magnetism
in the lower end of the wire ; twisting to the negative side
produced the opposite magnetic effect.
   Lastly, so far as this wire was concerned, it was twisted
first positively through 180°, then negatively through 180°,
observations being taken. The twisting in the negative direc
tion was then carried through another 180°, and finally the
negative twist was taken out. The result of this operation
was to annul entirely the effect of the first positive twist (say
right-handed, see p. 120) and as it were to convert the former
positiveness of right-handed twist into negativeness, and
vice versa.
          Cycle of Ticisting in the Zero Magnetic Field.
   A fresh wire was now suspended, and was subjected to
the action of a strong uniform magnetic field obtained by
means of a magnetizing-coil with secondary coils. The
strength of the field was 182 C.Gr.S. The stretching-load
was small ; being only 1*78 kilogs., or 91 kilogs. per square
centimetre, or the smallest necessary for keeping the wire
stretched in position. After the wire had been thus magne
tized the field was reduced to zero (the earth's vertical force
being neutralized by means of the solenoid). The change of
residual magnetic moment was then observed. This is shown
in the following series of numbers :—

   The behaviour of the wire was far from being cyclic. The
wire was therefore subjected to six complete cycles of twisting;
thus, 0°, +180°, 0°, -180°, 0°. After this series of opera
tions tho magnetometer-readings came to a very nearly cyclic
condition, and were as follows :—

   Under the action of the coil producing this field the mag
netometer-reading was quite out of range of the scale. The
spot of light was therefore brought on the scale by means of
a fixed magnet placed at right angles to the plane of the
magnetometer-needles, so as not to alter tho sensibility of the
magnetometer. A series of readings under twist were then

    This series shows that, with twisting in either direction in
 this very strong field and with small load, the magnetization
 of the wire diminishes instead of increasing. The curve, if
 traced, would resemble those given for iron by Sir William
 Thomson (Phil. Trans. 1879, pp. 70-72). A comparison of
 the various curves of Mr. Nagaoka among themselves had led
 us to suppose that this might be found to be the case.
    Lastly, followingup the alteration in form shown in the
iron curves by Sir W. Thomson (loc. cit.) to be due to increase
of stretching-load, a few experiments were made on a piece of
the iron wire used by him with the view of finding whether
in a very weak field, or almost no field, and with a very
heavy pulling-load, the iron wire could be made to behave
like nickel, and to show magnetism increased by twist instead
of diminished. So far as we have gone, our experiments did
not show any likelihood of our being able to produce this
condition in the iron. The results obtained corresponded
very much in character with those observed by Sir W. Thom
son. We do not, however, consider that our experiments, so
far as they have gone, are sufficient to settle this important
question.

       XVI. On the Use of Steam in Spectrum Analysis.
          By John Trowbridge and W. 0. Sabine*.
AMONG the difficulties with which the investigator in the
       subject of spectrum analysis must contend is that of
obtaining a source of light which is free from constituents
other than those which are under examination, and is at the
same time sufficiently powerful to enable one to photograph
the spectra of the latter. The voltaic arc gives a sufficiently
strong light to enable one to photograph throughout the visible
spectrum ; but the carbons between which the arc is formed
are full of impurities, and it is difficult to interpret the spectra
obtained by this means ; moreover it is not easy to employ
the arc-light for researches in the ultra-violet portion of the
spectrum. On the other hand, the spark from a RuhmkorfF
coil taken between terminals of metals the spectra of which
one wishes to examine, gives us, in general, spectra which are
comparatively free from impurities; but its light is very
feeble compared with that of the electric arc ; and even when
the spark is obtained by means of a powerful coil excited by
an alternating dynamo machine, an hour is necessary to obtain,
with a concave grating of 21 feet radius of curvature, a pho
tograph on the most sensitive plate we can obtain of the
ultra-violet spectrum of copper at wave-length 2100.
   It becomes an important question, therefore, to ascertain
whether the time of exposure of the sensitive plate can be
shortened by any process; for the outlay in obtaining one
photograph in the ultra-violet by the means hitherto at our
command is very large, involving the running of an engine
of at least two-horse power for an hour. In our experiments
with a jot of steam, we find that the time of exposure of the
sensitive plate can be shortened to at least one third.
   We were led to employ steam for the purpose of obtaining
the spectra of oxygen and hydrogen with a more powerful
electrical excitation than is possible in Geissler tubes. During
the winter of 1886 one of us, in connexion with Mr. C. 0.
Hutchins, of Bowdoin College, while engaged upon the inves
tigation of oxygen-spectra, tried to obtain a powerful electric
spark in an atmosphere of steam ; but the experiments were
unsatisfactory. The difficulties were chiefly in the way of
defective insulation of the terminals of the RuhmkorfF coil.
Our experiments showed that no containing-vessel could be
employed ; for the sides of the vessel conducted the electrical

 charge from one terminal to the other. No spark could be
 obtained and the experiments were abandoned. During the
 present winter the experiments were renewed. The containing-
 vessel was abandoned, and the jet of steam was allowed to
 impinge directly upon the spark. No effect could be per
  ceived when there were no condensers in the secondary
 circuit, and with the introduction of small condensers the
  effect was not marked. When the number of Leyden jars
  (8 in. x 6 in.) was increased to four, the effect of the jet of
  steam upon the electric spark was surprising. Its light
  immediately became comparable with that of the electric arc,
  enabling one to see metallic spectra with the naked eye upon
 the ground-glass of the photographic camera without the use
  of an eyepiece. The chamber in which the spark and steam-
 jet was placed became rosy red from the hydrogen arising
  from the dissociation of the steam. The hydrogen and
  oxygen lines in the air-spectrum became very much
 strengthened ; a continuous spectrum showed itself in the
 neighbourhood of the C line, and also in the yellow. A pho
 tograph of the air-lines and metallic lines of the terminals
 employed could be taken in a third of the time which was
 necessary when the steam-jet was not employed.
    The apparatus consists merely of a tin box which is placed
 opposite the slit of the spectroscope. Steam enters at one
 side and is blown across the terminals of the Kuhmkorff coil,
 which are placed in the box opposite the slit. An outlet on
 the side opposite to that in which the steam enters allows
 the steam to escape into the outer air.
    The change of colour of the spark is undoutedly due to
 hydrogen. The light filling the box is decidedly red, and the
hydrogen-line C flashes out with groat brilliancy in the midst
 of a continuous band of red in the spectrum. The metallic
 lines of the terminals are also greatly strengthened. The
 light from iron terminals is especially brilliant. Without the
 steam the spark between iron terminals seems to consist of a
 single line of discharge. When the steam is turned on, a
 great bundle of sparks appear in the midst of a flaring light
 and the noise of the sparks was greatly increased. These
 effects can undoubtedly be attributed to increased conducting
power of the air-space between the terminals of the Ruhmkortf
coil.
    The appearance of the spectrum led us to examine the
question of the character of the spectrum of the aurora
borealis and its connexion with that of aqueous vapour.
We believe that the theory that the shifting nature of the
northern lights may be due to electrical discharges following

           Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.              141
strata of air more or less laden with aqueous vapour has been
advocated. The appearance of the spectrum of the electric
spark in steam certainly leads one at first to favour this hypo
thesis. We have spoken of the marked brilliancy of the
hydrogen-line, and of a continuous red band near this line.
The continuous spectrum in the yellow is no less prominent.
The observations which have been made on the northern
lights do not enable one to make exact comparisons. The
lines given by different observers, however, do not appear to
coincide with the prominent lines and bands observed in the
air-spectrum heightened by steam,
    Other observers, among them Professors Liveing and
Dewar, have employed steam to obtain steam-lines : but we
have been unable to find any reference to the remarkable
economy in time and in waste of apparatus which results in
the use of a jet of steam in spectrum analysis when the spark
method of obtaining the spectra of metals is employed.

                    XVII. Molecular Refraction.
             By William Sutherland, M.A., B.Sc*
riTHE object of the present paper is to furnish a theoretical
 -A- establishment of Gladstone's empirical law connecting
the index of refraction of a substance with its density and to
consider certain consequences thereof, also to show that Glad
stone's law expresses moro accurately than any other which
has yet been proposed the connexion between index and
density. To this latter end it will be advisable to give a sketch
of the history of the subject, especially as that history is one
of the most interesting of those of the minor branches of
physics.
   The first indication of a connexion between index of refrac
tion and density is due to Newton, who was led to discover it
by his investigation of refraction according to the emission
theory. In his ' Optics,' Book II. part iii. he enunciates
(chapter x.) thus :—" If light be swifter in bodies than in vacuo,
in the proportion of the sines which measure the refraction of
the bodies, the forces of the bodies to reflect and refract light
are very nearly proportional to the densities of the same bodies
excepting that Unctuous and Sulphureous bodies refract more
than others of this same density." Newton's proof of this
proposition may be stated thus in the terminology of the
   * Communicated by the Author, having been read in Section A of the
Australian Association for the Advancement of Science, August, 1888.

142        Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.
modern science of energy :—the main mass of a transparent
body may be considered to be a field of constant potential,
and so also may the external free aether ; but in the passage
from the body to the aether there is a layer of space in which
the potential varies along the normal to the layer ; the change
in the kinetic energy of a corpuscle of light in crossing this
layer must be equal to the determinate change of potential
energy corresponding to the passage from one region of con
stant potential to another. But only the normal component
of the velocity changes ; hence we have the result that the
difference of the squares of the normal velocities of a corpuscle
in aether and in the substance is proportional to the definite
change of potential ; or the square of the ratio of the normal
velocity in the substance to the normal velocity in aether,
minus unity, is proportional to the same quantity. Now
Newton does not expressly show how the change of potential
energy on passage from free aether into a substance should be
proportional to the density (tbis was afterwards done by
Laplace) ; but he proceeds to tabulate the indices and den
sities for a number of bodies and to show that the square of
the index minus unity divided by the density is roughly the
same for them all. He comments on the fact that this quan
tity has the same value for air as for glass, in spite of the great
difference in density between the two substances.
   Laplace was able, by the treatment of the subject of mole
cular force, which he develops for his theory of capillarity, to
give precision and definiteness to Newton's proof (Me'canique
Celeste, book x. chap. i.). If, as in the gravitation theory,
the force due to a molecule is proportional to its mass, it is
obvious that the force exerted by a body on a corpuscle of
light near its surface will be proportional to the density of the
substance, assuming that molecular force is sensible at insensible
distances and insensible at sensible. Laplace is able to show
how it is only at the transition layer between aather and sub
stance that a change of potential occurs, and how the change
of potential is expressible as a definite integral proportional to
the density. He thus gets the formula (n — l)/«Z = c, where c
is a parameter whose value depends only on the chemical con
stitution of the substance.
   Biot and Arago (Memoires de I'Acad. vii. 1806) undertook
the experimental verification of this formula in the case of
gases, and found it to hold accurately.
   With the establishment of the undulatory theory and the
abandonment of the emission theory, the theoretical arguments
of Newton and Laplace failed to apply any longer to the actual
circumstances, but still Newton's discovery of a connexion

          Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.         143
between index and density retained its value as an empirical
   In the course of some researches as to how far (rt9 — l)/d
could be regarded as constant for liquids when d is changed by
heat, Gladstone and Dale (Phil. Trans. 1858) discovered that
(n— V)jd is more nearly constant than Newton's expression.
Berthelot had drawn attention to the desirability of studying
for different substances not only {ni — l)/d, but M(n9— l)/rf,
where M is the molecular weight. Landolt, doing this with
Gladstone's expression, discovered that the molecular refraction
of a substance, M(n— l)/d, is the sum of the definite atomic
refractions or refraction-equivalents of the elements composing
it. Subsequent researches by Gladstone showed that certain
elements have not a single definite refraction-equivalent, but
different equivalents according to their different methods of
chemical union with other elements. As this discovery pro
mised to be of value to those chemists who are eager to take
advantage of all the light that physical investigations can
throw on chemical structure, its further prosecution was taken
up by Briihl, who established the important result for structural
chemistry that whenever two carbon atoms are connected
ethylenewise (or, in the " bonds " terminology, when a carbon
atom is united to another by a pair of bonds) the refraction of
the molecule is increased by a definite amount above the sum
 of the equivalents of the atoms in the molecule. Kanonnikoff
 was able, as a first-fruit of optical chemistry, to show how
 Briihl's discovery throws immediate light on the debated
points of the comparative structure of citraconic, itaconic, and
 mesaconic acids and of the different terpenes.
    A large amount of experimental work had thus been under
 taken, all on the strength of Gladstone's empirical law, and
 no physical theory had been advanced to give the law meaning,
 when Lorenz of Copenhagen, and Lorentz of Amsterdam,
 brought out each a mathematical theory of molecular refrac
 tion ; the former applying his treatment of the ordinary
 undulatory theory, the latter using the electromagnetic hypo
 thesis, but both coming to the same result, but one quite
 different in form and meaning from that of Gladstone's law.
 They found that on these assumptions («*— l)/(n9 + 2)d ought
 to be constant for a given body. It would be impossible to
 give in a brief form an analysis of their mathematical work as
 presented in the German translations of their papers in Wie
 demann, volumes ix. and xi.; but a slight sketch of Lorenz's
 method is necessary to make clear the following discussion
 of the merits of his formula in comparison with that of
 Gladstone.

 144       Mr. W. Sutherland cm Molecular Refraction.
    Lorenz assumes that throughout a heterogeneous non-
 absorbing medium composed of aether and molecules (the
 aether being quite uniform in properties), the differential
 equation for the vibratory disturbance of an element during
 the propagation of a wave of light may be written
 where a> is a function of x,y,z, the coordinates of the position
of the element when undisturbed ; m for a homogeneous
medium is the constant velocity of light in it. Considering
only plane waves, he assumes that a solution of the above
equations exists in the form
                % — (£o + £2)008 {kt — lx—my—nz—d),
with similar expressions for 17 and f ; where £0, %, ?0, k, I, m
n, d are all constants, but £2, r)2, f, are periodic functions of x,
y, z ; fo> Voj £0 being so chosen that the mean values of f2,
?s throughout a finite volume are zero. Thus f0, i?0, f0 are the
components of a certain constant mean amplitude. Now,
although a variable amplitude is thus provided for as the dis
turbance passes from aether into matter, we see that the con
dition that k, I, m, n, and d are constant commits us to the
assumption of an invariable wave-length.
   Apart from all mathematical symbols, we may state Lorenz's
fundamental assumption thus, that in a medium composed of
aether and molecules light may be considered as propagated
with a certain mean velocity, but with a periodically varying
amplitude of vibration. Now there can be no question as to
the fact that a wave of light does pass through such a discon
tinuous mixed medium with a certain mean wave-length and
a corresponding mean velocity, no matter how different the
actual wave-lengths in pure aether and in pure matter may be;
but a serious mathematical difficulty arises when, in deducing
an integral relation from the original differential equation,
Lorenz assumes this mean wave-length to hold through the
substance of a single molecule, throughout which he performs
certain integrations involving wave-length, while for all we
know the wave-length in matter may be millions of times
smaller than in aether. It appears to me that if there is to be
integration over a single molecule and its " domain " of aether,
then we must employ a solution of the differential equation
which provides not only for variable amplitude, but also for
variable wave-length, as we pass from aether into matter.
The logical consequence of Lorenz's assumption of a mean
wave-length is that, like Cauchy, he must replace the mixed

           Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.           145
medium by a certain mean medium. The whole form of
Lorenz's final result depends on his application of a mean
solution to a discontinuous medium to which it does not actu
ally apply as regards the elements of the medium ; and as this
is not justifiable a priori, it is interesting to examine how
its results are experimentally verified, and the history of physics
does not contain a more striking example of the experimental
verification of a purely theoretically deduced formula than
that obtained by Lorenz and Prytz (Wiedemann, xi.). They
examined some 15 or 16 compounds both in the liquid and
vapour state, and found (n*— l)/(n* + 2)d in almost every case
to be practically the same in both states, and, considering the
great difference in density of the two states, no more searching
single test could have been applied by Lorenz to his theory.
On the other hand, when Gladstone's formula (n — \)/d was
tested by the beautifully accurate determinations of Lorenz
and Prytz, it was found to fail signally in bridging over the
great gap in density between liquid and vapour. This fact
at once arrested the attention of those engaged in the investi
gation of molecular refraction, and Landolt, Briihl, and others
proceeded to adopt Lorenz's expression because it possessed
two great advantages over Gladstone's, it had a theoretical
foundation and a better experimental verification.
   But meanwhile Quincke (Sitzungsberichte der kon. preuss.
Akad. der Wissen. Berlin, 1883, and Phil. Mag. 5th series,
vol. xvii. 1884) tested the three refraction formula} of Newton,
Gladstone, and Lorenz in another manner, by varying the
density not by heat, but by hydrostatic pressure. His method
consisted in measuring the change of index of a liquid when
subjected to a certain pressure. Now each of the three rival
formulae gives a value for the change of density in terms of
the change of index, so that from the optical measurements in
each case a value of the compressibility of the liquid could be
deduced. Quincke's test consisted in comparing these three
calculated values of the compressibility with his own actual
measurement. He applied the method to 10 liquids of diverse
properties. His results showed that Lorenz's theory is
defective. In every case Lorenz's formula gave too small a
value for the compressibility. Newton's is too large, while in
6 cases Gladstone s gave too small a value, and in 4 too large.
The mean percentage errors, according to the three formulae, I
have found to be —14 for Lorenz's, +17 for Newton's, and
 — 1'6 for Gladstone's.
    This ought to furnish logicians with an instructive example
in the theory of evidence, that Lorenz's formula stood the test
of comparison between liquid and vapour states, but failed

decidedly under the difference of density produced by a few
atmospheres' pressure. It should bo mentioned that in 1874
Mascart ( Comp. Rend, lxxviii.) showed, by experiments on the
change of index of water under pressure, that Gladstone's
formula gives very nearly the correct compressibility, while
Newton's fails.
   Ketteler, developing the theory worked out by Sellmeier,
Meyer, Helmholtz, and himself to account for dispersion,
obtains a different form of expression connecting index and
density, which, in a recent paper (Wiedemann's Ann. 1888),
is presented in the form
                  (n'-l)(v-p)=c{l+ae-kl),
where v is the molecular domain (usually called molecular
volume) and /3 is the true volume of the molecule, c, a, and k
being constants and t the temperature. The hypothesis on
which this is based is that discontinuous aether and the mole
cules may be imagined to be replaced by two homogeneous
continuous media both filhng the same space, but with an
action between the two media partly of a frictional nature.
As the above expression involves four arbitrary constants, it
necessarily permits of great accuracy in the representation of
experimental results. Ketteler as yet has applied it to only
two substances, water and alcohol, which are hardly suitable
for testing any theory relating to molecular structure, as there
is an abundance of experimental evidence to show that their
molecular condition is exceptional. With experiments made
over a wide range of temperature he has determined the values
of the constants, so that we can test his formula as to its power
to give the correct compressibility.
   Proceeding as Quincke does with the other three formula?,
we find that Ketteler's formula would give for the com
pressibility the value according to Newton's multiplied by
              In this way we find the following values of the
compressibility, multiplied by 106, as compared wuh the ex
perimental and Gladstone values :—
                     Experimental.   Ketteler.     Gladstone.
      Water     .  .     46-14         42*1           46-04
      Alcohol   .  .    101-41         97-2          100-2
   So far as these two cases go, Ketteler's four-constant
formula gives inferior results to Gladstone's one-constant
expression.
   After this sketch of the history of the subject the following
summary of the conclusions of various experimenters as to

          Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.          147
the merits of Gladstone's and Lorenz's refraction-formulae will
be appropriate :—
   1. In all cases where the same specimen of a substance has
been examined with sufficient accuracy in the liquid and
vapour states, the Lorenz formula is markedly superior to
Gladstone's.
   2. Quincke has shown that, within the limits of experimental
error, Gladstone's formula is verified by his experiments with
compression, while Lorenz's fails.
   3. Landolt firds that in most cases both formula} hold with
considerable accuracy when applied to the change from solid
state to liquid, but that Gladstone's has the advantage.
   4. Landolt finds that Gladstone's formula leads to more
accurate results than Lorenz's when applied to the deduction
of the index of a mixture from those of its constituents. Thus
while the calculated values of (n—V)jd differ from the expe
rimentally found values by '05 per cent, on the average, and
^6 per cent, in the worst case, (n2 — l)/(n? + 2)d departs on
the average from experiment by -16 per cent., and "6 percent,
in the worst case. Gladstone's formula is thus decidedly tho
better of the two for chemical optical analysis. If it is used
to determine the amount of a particular substance dissolved
in a certain amount of solvent from the determined index and
density of the solution, it gives much more reliable results than
Lorenz's.
   5. Landolt showed that the general results as to refraction-
equivalents of the elements 0, 0, H, and N, and the halogens
obtained by the study of the Gladstone expression, still held for
the Lorenz formula ; but Briihl was able to show that, from
the chemical point of view, Lorenz's formula is preferable, as
it allows of the calculation of the refraction-equivalent of a
molecule from those of its atoms with a smaller percentage
error.
   It is thus seen that neither formula is a complete expression
for all the physical facts, but that on the whole the Gladstone
formula is the nearer of the two to the truth. It will now bo
shown that Gladstone's formula can be obtained as a first
theoretical approximation, and that a second approximation
 gives an extension and improvement of Gladstone's formula,
rendering it capable of expressing the complete relation of
index to density.
   Consider the path of a ray in a medium composed of evenly
 distributed atoms between which lies aether with all the
properties of free aether unaltered. The ray is supposed
 capable of passing through the substance of an atom. This is
a natural supposition, seeing that the vibrations of matter are

148       Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.
communicated to aether and the vibrations of aether are taken
up by matter. But the ray travels more slowly in matter
than in aether, so that, for every portion of matter passed
through in a certain path, the ray loses time as compared
with its time along a similar path in pure aether. Now what-
ever the shape of the atoms may be, if we imagine them to be
very small and very numerous, there is a certain mean distance
in the atom which we can in every case imagine the ray to
traverse, and on account of the numerousness of the atoms
this mean distance is the same for all experimentally possible
distributions of the molecules. It is possible that the mean
distance may alter with temperature, but, within the limits of
refraction-experiments as yet carried out, we may assume the
mean distance to be independent of temperature. Under
these circumstances we imagine that every encounter of a ray
with an atom means the traversing of this fixed mean distance
in matter instead of in aether, and a corresponding loss of time.
The total loss of time along a path will be proportional to the
mean number of encounters, which is directly proportional to
the length of path travelled, to the mean sectional area of an
atom, and to the number of atoms in unit volume ; thus
calling s the length of the path considered, I the mean distance
through an atom, a its mean sectional area, m its mass, and d
the density of the substance, so that the number of atoms in
unit volume is proportional to d/m, the number of encounters
varies as sad/m. If v be the velocity of light in free aether
and V in the matter of an atom, then the loss of time in an
atom is IfV—l/v. Hence we can write the total loss of time
    kslad f 1 _ 1 \
      m \V         v )'
   But if t/ is the mean velocity of light in the atom-strewn
medium, the loss of time is equal to s/v'—s/v.

             i. e.    (n— 1)-^- =AZa(N—l) = constant ;
 where n is the index of the medium and N is the index of re
 fraction of the matter of the atom. This is Gladstone's law.
    Now la is the volume of the atom, and regarding m/d as
 the actual measure of the domain of the atom (usually called
 the atomic volume), and calling these volumes u and U, we

          Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction. •         149
can write the above thus :—
                       (n-l)«=HJ(N-l).
   But if we suppose u to become identical with U, n must
become identical with N, and we see that the value of k must
be 1, and
                       (n-l)«=(N-l)U,                           (1)
an equation which could be written down direct from the
consideration that the effect of the scattered molecules in re
tarding the light is the same as if the molecules were gathered
into a continuous homogeneous mass. The corresponding
equation in Lorenz's theory is
                        n2-l _ N2-1TT
and it is important to notice the great difference in the physical
bearings of the two expressions. If N is large, that is if the
velocity of light in a molecule is small compared to that in
aether, then (N2— l)(N'2 + 2) approaches the limit 1, and
                            U_n»-1
                            u ~V + 2'
and this last fraction, for most liquids, has a value about one
fourth, so that if N could be shown to bo large, we should
have the actual volume of an atom about one fourth of its
 domain ; while, according to equation (1), if N is large,
XJ/u is a small fraction of (n — 1), and would be small for most
liquids. The two theories are thus in direct contradiction to
one another, and it would appear that the assumption previously
pointed out as having been made by Lorenz, is responsible
 for the discrepancy, seeing that the greater N is, the more
 unjustifiable is that assumption.
    The general method of proceeding in the previous proof,
 namely, that of considering loss of time, has a certain claim to
be considered the correct one, if we remember that, according
to the wave theory of light, a ray passes from one point to
 another by the path which makes its time of passing a
 minimum.
    If we suppose several sorts of atoms distributed throughout
 the same space, whether mechanically mixed or chemically
 united into molecules, we ought, according to the above theory,
to have
                        (w-1)m=S(N-1)U;                          (2)
  but only so long as we assume that neither N nor U, for any
  sort of atom, is altered by chemical combination ; if N or U

 150       ' Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.
is altered, then in this last equation it must have its value
 proper to the compound.
    Thus we have the theoretical view of the application of
 Gladstone's empirical law to mixtures and chemical com
 pounds.
    But so far the reasoning by which equations (1) and (2)
 have been established is only a first approximation to an
 accurate argument, as we have left out of count the effect of
 the atoms in producing delay, not only when the wave is
 passing through their actual substance, but in the inter
 mediate aether by breaking up the wave-front ; in other
 words no ray can get through in a straight line, it is bent now
 this way, now that, by the successive atoms. The mean ray,
 therefore, has its time of traversing the pother thus increased.
 A more definite idea of this effect of the atoms can be ob
 tained if we imagine them spread out in successive planes
 parallel to the plane of an incident wave. At each encounter
 with a layer of atoms the plane wave-front, after getting just
 through, is a curved surface tbat tends to recover its plane
 form before encountering the next layer ; during this process
 of recovering the mean velocity of the wave-front must be
 less than the velocity of a plane wave in pure rether. The
 amount of delay thus produced must be proportional to the
 length of path and a function of the density, and as it vanishes
 with the density we may assume that it is expressible by
 s (bd + cd2) + , where b and c are constants, which may depend
 on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. Adding this
 to the right-hand side of our original equation, we get
              s

whence we get
              (n-l)j = h{X-l) + m(b + cd + ).        ...      (3)
    This would make the refraction-equivalent of the molecule
equal to a constant term plus a term proportional to the
density if the series can bo arrested at the second term. The
terms mb and rued must be small compared to la (N — 1), as
is seen from the nature of the argument by which they were
introduced, and it is to bo noticed that they may vary with
the structure of the molecule.
    To test the last formula (3) the only experiments suitable
are those of Lorenz (Wiedemann, xi.), who determines the
values of the index and density of six liquids at the tempera

tores of 10° and 20°, and in the gaseous state at 100° with
the utmost accuracy. If, then, in the formula

we determine c and the constant bracketed term from the
data for liquid at 10° and 20°, the value of the bracketed term

ought to be found to be the same as the value of ^ found
by Lorenz for the gas, seeing that d is so small that the term
cd may be considered to vanish in the case of a gas. When
it is remembered how small the difference in density is for
10° difference in temperature with liquids, it will be seen how
strict the test is.
   In the following table are given the values of (n — l)/d as
calculated by Landolt from Lorenz's data (Ann. der Chem.
213) for the different liquids at 10°, 20°, and the vapours at
100°. Water and ethyl alcohol are not included on account
of the exceptional character of thoir molecules ; the fifth

   The agreement between observed and calculated values in
the above table in all cases except that of ethyl iodide is good,
especially if the severity of the method of testing is taken
into account. As regards the applicability of the formula to
gases under varying pressure we have the experiments of
Chappuis and Riviere (Comptes Rendus, ciii.). They find

152       Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.
that for air the formula (n— 1) = Ap (1 + "00058 p) represents
the index at 21° up to a pressure of 14 metres of mercury, p
being measured in metres ; and from Van der Waal's equation
for air they deduce the relation
                     d=A'p(l + -00065^);
but this is erroneous, as the correct deduction from Van der
Waal's equation is
                     d=A>(l+ -00077j>).
The equation which I have given, however (Phil. Mag. Aug.
1887), for air, and which is founded on Amagat's more ex
tended data, while Van der Waal's was obtained from Reg-
nault's, gives the relation d=A'p (1 + "00060 p), which within
                                           n—1
the limits of experimental error makes ^ constant, seeing
that, according to the experimenters, there is a possible error
of "00003 in the coefficient "00058. This agreement between
the optical and the mechanical experiments shows that the
formula obtained from Amagat's data for air will be of high
accuracy for manometric work.
   But we must see how far the modification of Gladstone's
formula to make it applicable to vapour affects its applicability
to compression experiments. Its effect is to divide the value
of the compressibility as used by Quincke by l+cd2/^— 1).
   Ethyl oxide and carbonic disulphide are the only two
bodies in the above table which occur in Quincke's table, and
it will be noticed that for these two c is markedly larger than
for the others, while there are two out of the four bodies in
Quincke's table for which Gladstone's formula gives too large
a compressibility. In the case of aether the above modifica
tion reduces the calculated compressibility by 7 per cent., and
as it is already 1"5 per cent, too high leaves it 5"5 per cent,
too small ; in the case of 0S3 the reduction is 11 per cent.,
but as the excess is 3*6 the modified Gladstone formula gives
a compressibility 7"4 per cent, too small. But this gives only
a rough estimate of the effect of the modification of the
formula, seeing that Quincke's specimens of aether and CSS
must have been far from pure, as his values of the compressi
bility of these substances are much smaller than those of other
experimenters, but he did not desire chemical purity for the
end he had in view. Allowing for the larger values of the
compressibility of pure aether and CS2, we may say that the
modified formula gives the compressibilities 5 per cent,
smaller than the observed values, and this in cases where the

          Mr. W. Sutherland on Molecular Refraction.          153
modifying constant c is specially large. The general con
clusion, then, is that the modified Gladstone equation is capable
of representing the relation of index of refraction and density
under all circumstances within the limits of experimental
error. We see how the values of m(n— l)/d, tabulated by
various experimenters, for various liquids ought to be reduced
to the values corresponding to zero density ; or in all cases
the observations ought to be made on bodies in the state of
 vapour, if the results are to be as trustworthy as possible to
 the chemist.
     The advantage that the Lorenz formula possesses is that
 it happens to give the same value for a substance in the
 liquid and vapour states ; and since for vapours
                    (»»-l)/(n«+2)d=|(»-l)/d,
 we see that the Lorenz formula gives approximately, when
 applied to a liquid, two thirds of the desideratum, namely the
  value of (n — l)/d determined on the vapour of the liquid. It
  is on this account I believe that the Lorenz expression has
  been found by Briihl to prove more accurate than Gladstone's
  in its chemical applications ; in an indirect manner tho
  Lorenz formula applied to liquids gives a measure of the
  constant term in the modified Gladstone equation.
      The most important fact that the study of refraction from
  a chemical point of view has brought out is that the refrac
   tion-equivalent of an atom of an element is not constant but
  depends on its method of binding with others. Now, accord
   ing to the theory of our first approximation, the refraction-
   equivalent of an atom ought not to vary unless an actual
   change in the physical structure of the atom has been pro
   duced ; the second approximation introduces a constant b
   which may depend on structure, but there is evidence which
   would seem to indicate that b is zero. Thus the following
   table contains the values of the Lorenz molecular refraction,
   which I have calculated from the data given by Bartoli and
   Stracciati (Ann. de Ch. et de Ph. 6 s^r. vii. 1886) in their
   valuable table of physical constants for the liquid paraffins ; I
   employ the Lorenz expression for the reason given abovo. I
   have added the value for CH4 calculated from Mascart's data
   for gases (Comptes Rendus, lxxxvi.). The density at 0°, given
   by Bartoli and Stracciati for pentane (iso), appears to be a
   misprint, and I have taken "6368 as the density at 16°.

   This is the most extended series of homologous compounds
yet studied, and it is seen that from the first to the sixteenth
member the difference in molecular refraction corresponding
to a difference of CH2 is constant ; tho mean value is 4'57, a
number almost identical with 4*56, the value deduced by
Landolt as the general mean given by the alcohol, aldehyde,
fatty acid, and ajther series. This fact and tho fact that
isomeric bodies of similar structure have tho same refraction-
equivalent show that structure does not produce a pro
nounced effect under some circumstances ; but when we
come to consider the effect produced by tho double binding
of two carbon atoms or by the change of valency in a poly
valent atom we are face to face with a most important fact
which we can explain as due either to the structural term b
in our formula, or to a distinct change in the physical
properties of the atom when it changes its valency (the
double-binding of a carbon atom is equivalent to the change
of tetrad to triad). But in some cases the difference between
the values of the same atom with different valencies, as for
example 12 and 20 for iron in tho ferrous and ferric state3,
seems too great to ascribe to structure and makes probable
the idea that the actual physical properties of the matter of
the atom are different.
   For the full discussion of this interesting question wo
should require a large number of careful measurements on
gases and vapours. Those that we possess are too discordant
in certain cases amongst themselves to admit of anj great ac
curacy in their discussion. Bleekrode (Proc. Boy. Soc. xxxvii.,
1884) gives indexes and density for a number of liquefied
gases, Mascart for a number of gases and vapours (Compt.
Mend, lxxviii. and Ixxxvi.), and Dulong for a number of gases ;
but nothing very definite can be deduced from their results
except that in the simpler compounds the atoms have some
times differeut refrcclion-equivalents in different compounds.

         Viscous Effect of Strains Mechanically Applied.       155
   Returning to the formula of the first approximation,
                       (n-l)m/<Z=(N-l)U,
we get
               (n-l)/d=(N-l)U/m= (N-l)/D,
where D is the density of the matter in the atom; so that we
see that the quantity (n — \)l<i, which is called the specific
refract've power of a substance, is equal to the specific refrac
tive power of a single atom of it. Under these circumstances
the specific refractive powers of the elements call for study
as much as the refraction-equivalents.
   The general results arrived at in this paper are, then, that
Gladstone's formula is the best yet advanced, that there is a
theoretical foundation for it, and that it can be improved to
the form (n— l)/d=A + Bd, where A and B are constants ;
that chemists ought to study the refraction of substances
in the state of vapour in order to obtain the necessary data
for the investigation of refraction-equivalents and the
questions of structure connected therewith ; as the practical
difficulties in the way of measuring the refractive index and
density of vapours are great, the values of A and B in the
above formula may be obtained by experiments on liquids at
temperatures as far apart as possible, and that where a
measurement at only one temperature is available the Lorenz
formula may be assumed on empirical grounds to give two
thirds of the desired value of A, but there is no guarantee
that this will always be the case.
XVIII. The Viscous Effect of Strains Mechanically Applied,
     as Interpreted by Maxwell's Theory. By C. Barus*.
   I. The two Species of Molecular Break-up which promote
                        Viscous Deformation.
1. 1/lOLLOWING the argument which underlies Maxwell's
    -I-    theory of solid viscosity experimentally, I was obliged
to take cognisance of two causes which promote viscous de
formation hi solids t. For any structure will give way under
impressed conations of stress, as a whole or in part, either
because the cemerts are insufficiently strong, or because the
bricks are insufficiently strong to withstand it. Similarly
the underlying cause of viscous motion is either such struc
tural change in which groups of molecules pass without loss
                   * Communicated by the Author,
                   t Phil. Mag. November, 1888.

156           Mr. 0. Barus on the Viscous Effect of
of identity from an initial to a final configuration ; or it is
a break-up superinduced by the disintegration of one or more
molecules of each group. Whichever the change may be,
it must, from the nature of the problem in general, be dis
tributed uniformly throughout the mass of the solid (§ 9).
Even without stress the said change may result from secular
subsidence. Moreover, it is conceivable that molecular disin
tegration may occur in such a way as to elude detection.
   Now I have since been able to prove experimentally that
in glass-hard steel a change of the viscous quality may be
obtained as the result of at least two distinct kinds of struc
tural change, probably as the result of the two kinds of
break-up here in question. The first section of the present
paper purposes to show this by aid of the phenomena of
accommodation, or motional annealing, as they may be called
more uniformly in keeping with the following work.
   2. The term annealing in its most general sense refers to
a process by which strained solid structure, whether main
tained by mechanical or chemical causes, is changed to
isotropic structure. In viscosity, inasmuch as strained
structure is ultimately accompanied by molecular instability,
annealing is a process by which viscosity is increased ; and
from this point of view annealing need have no direct refer
ence to exposure to temperature. Hence I have designated
by tho term motional annealing all such forced molecular
motion to and fro, in virtue of which the molecules of a
thoroughly soft solid are brought into new relations to each
other, to the effect that viscosity is increased at the expense
of the motionally less stable configurations of the soft solid.
There may appear to be some incongruity in the term, inas
much as the solid motionally acted on always experiences
strain ; it is not the strain, however, but the increment of
viscosity of the solid, to which the term refers*.
   Again, in order that a solid may be motionally annealed
the mechanical treatment (torsion, traction, &c.) must be
applied below a certain critical limit of intensity. Otherwise
this treatment introduces its own specific instability ; and in
proportion as stress is indefinitely increased, the viscosity of
the solid may now be reduced in any measure. Further
justification of the term is to be given in §§ 6, 9. At present
it is more expedient to indicate the points of crucial difference
between motional annealing and thermal annealing in their
effect on steel in the glass-hard state.
   3. When glass-hard steel is annealed at 100°, the effect is
             * Phil. Mag. [5] xxvi. pp. 199 to 203, 1888.

                    Strains Mechanically Applied.                      157
a decided increase of viscosity amounting to almost one half
of the total viscous interval, hard-soft*. This marked incre
ment of viscosity is accompanied by an equally striking
electrical effect f. For it has been shown that the specific
resistance of hard steel diminishes as much as 15 per cent, as
the result of annealing at 100°. Finally, since the electrical
effect is a sufficient indication of the changes of volume
 (decrement) and of carburation, it appears conclusively that
the underlying cause of the increase of viscosity hero in
question is a disintegration of the unstable carbide molecule
of steel.
    4. Again, an increment of the viscosity of glass-hard steel
comparable in magnitude with that of annealing at 100°,
may be obtained without heat. It is merely necessary, for
instance, to apply to the glass-hard wire large enough rates
of twist, a sufficient number of times alternately, in opposite
directions. This method of increasing viscosity has no elec
trical concomitant comparable with the electrical effect of § 3.
Hence the underlying cause of the observed increase of
viscosity in this case is probably not a disintegration of the
carbide molecule of steel ; or at least a disintegration quite
unlike that of the foregoing instance.
    5. In the following tables (I. and II.) I give the data
necessary to substantiate § 4. The method f of experiment
being identical with the one described in verifying § 3, I need
only call to mind here that my normal steel wire (maximum
viscosity) and the fresh glass-hard wire (minimum viscosity)
were countertwisted ; that the ends of the vertical system
were fixed, and a mirror-index placed near the middle, at
the junction of the two wires. Cf. figure 1, § 12. Table I.
contains the results for viscosity, both wires being at the
same temperature 0. The impressed rate of twist is given
in radians under t, and the permanent torsion observed at
the close of each experiment under 2 (<£ + <£'). Since the
lower end of the system was twisted 360 , t + 2 (</> + $')
= 2tt/L, where L is the length of the two wires. Finally
{<f>—<f)')/T is the viscous motion at the index, per unit of t,
per unit of L, at the time specified. In other words 2<f> and

methods premises that the viscous deformations of all the wires to be com
pared are similar time functions. That this is the case must be verified
preliminarily by some absolute method.

      Table I. indicates that the wires were twisted 8 times
 alternately in opposite directions. Before and after each
 series of vis,cous measurements in Table I., the resistance of
 the glass-hard wire was measured by a special device utilizing
 Matthiessen and Hoskin's method. These results are given
 in Table II., where rt is the observed resistance in microhms,

ment can be represented in the same way. If the tangents
be constructed at the same time-point, in each of the curves
of Table I., there appears to be some similarity between the
march of these ' results (A(</>— <£')/t) and the corresponding
march of rt in Table II. But interpreted by the data of § 2,
this similarity is only qualitative in kind. In other words,
whereas the increment of viscosity due to successive alterna
tions of twist is decidedly greater than one half of the incre
ment of viscosity due to annealing glass-hard steel at 100°, it
appears that the electrical effect in the first instance (motional
annealing) is practically negligible in comparison with the
electrical effect of thermal annealing. In Table II. the total
interval of variation of Ar< is about one half per cent, of rt ; on
the other hand, the variation of rt due to annealing at 100° is
from 10 per cent, upwards. It follows that in glass-hard steel
there are two distinct ways in which viscosity may be
appreciably increased, a result corroborating §§ 3,4. Again,
if the possibilities of viscous motion are to be fully given, it
is essential to postulate groups of atoms, as well as the some
what less definite groups of molecules, both varying in de
grees of stability from point to point of the solid mass.
Hence slight positional change of the elements of the atomic
configurations, or of the molecular configurations, due either
 to stress not exceeding a critical value or to mere secular
 subsidence, must in general involve an augmentation of the
viscous quality.
      7. Having arrived at this result I desire to inquire some
 what more in detail into the viscous relations of the motional

        160            Mr. C. Barus on the Viscous Effect of
        effect, §§ 4, 5. This is attempted in Table III., in which tor
        sional stress is applied cyclically. The viscous behaviour is
        studied at each of these successive stages of increase or
        decrease, as shown in the first column, t, of the table. As
        before, the length of the system of two wires, L = i + ?=30
        centim. + 30 centim. ; diameter, 2p = -081 centim. The final
        column A(^>— $'), being the detorsion from the beginning
        to the end of the first minute after twisting, may be taken
        as an index of the rate of deformation. In the first and
        second cycles twist is imparted positively ; in the third cycle
        negatively. To follow the sequence of observations it is
        sufficient to consult the time-column.

164             Mr. C. Barus on the Viscous Effect of
   8. The first result given by these data is obtained by com
paring <f> — (f>' and (<f>— <£')/T> showing that the latter quantity
is not independent of t. Nor can it be asserted that the
chango of {<j>— <£')/T 'with increasing r is retarded. It follows
that comparable values of {<f>—<j)');T are only obtained by
keeping t nearly constant, as has been done in all my
experiments.
   Again, the large variations of ($ — </>') in the direct or
stress-increasing phase of the cycles, as compared with the
corresponding variations in the retrograde or stress-decreasing
phase of the cycles, together with a repetition of the whole
phenomenon on a smaller scale for succeeding cycles of the
samo sign, are features of these experiments. When the sign
of the twist is reversed, cycles which exceed the original one
in magnitude are obtained. These in their turn dwindle on
repetition of like signs of t. Finally, the influence of residual
action in case of retrograde cycles appears more clearly in
proportion as stress approaches zero. On the other hand, the
circumflex contours of the earlier retrograde curves (t de
creasing from *105) is not a mere error of observation, but
results from superposition of direct and residual phenomena.
This is specially marked in the third cycle, where stress, after
t="087, was applied in a zigzag way, viz. :
                  tx 103 = 87, 70, 96, 87, 105, 96.
   9. The clue for the interpretation of the above complex
phenomena as a whole is suggested by the data for A (<j>—(f>').
It then appears that the viscous behaviour of the wires is
intimately connected with the amount of permanent set
imparted during the period of action of stress. From this
point of view the phenomena become not only strikingly
analogous to thermal annealing in case of temper, but of
special importance as regards their bearing on Maxwell's
theory. The following description* applies, mutatis mutandis,
to both classes of phenomena:—
   (1) The viscous deformation (annealing effect) of any
stress (temperature) acting on glass-hard steel increases
gradually at a rate diminishing through infinite time ;
diminishing very slowly in case of low stress (temperature) ;
diminishing very rapidly at first and then again slowly in case
of high stress (temperature) ; so that the limit of permanent
deformation is approached asymptotically.
   (2) The ultimate viscous deformation (annealing effect) of
any stress r (temperature t), is independent of preexisting
                * Cf. this Magazine [5] xxvi. p. 214, 1888.

  effects of the stress t7 (temperature t'), and is not influenced
  by subsequent application of stress ¥ (temperature <'), pro
  vided t>t' (f>r).         In case of incomplete deformation
  (partial annealing) induced by stress r (temperature t), this
  law applies more fully as the ultimate effect of t (t) is more
  nearly reached. Again, the effect of t' succeeding t (/' suc
  ceeding i) is more nearly nil as the effect of t>ti (t>t')
  approaches completeness.
     To discern the cause of this detailed analog)' it is sufficient
  to call to mind, (1) that in thermal annealing viscous defor
  mation is produced by thermal diminution of viscosity under
  conditions of the initially given stress stored up in the
  tempered solid ; in motional annealing by increase of the
  mechanical stress applied from without under conditions of
  initially given viscosity. Finally, (2) the configurations,
  molecular or atomic, which just break up under the action of
 stress t or temperature t, respectively, are necessarily limited
  by a higher order of stability, and are greater in number
  than those just surviving under less intense conditions of
 stress                                      crucial feature of the
 analogy. However unlike the instabilities may be in the
 two cases of motional and of thermal annealing, however un
 like the treatment to which they are here respectively sub
jected, its effect in modifying the occurrence of instability is
 similar, and hence tho similarity of viscous results.
     So far as we have observed, however, residual phenomena
 are absent in thermal annealing of glass-hard steel, and this
 is a point of difference between the break-up of atomic groups
and molecular groups. The former are not reconstructed.
Again, in motional annealing for increasing rates of twist,
thick wires show viscous deformation at earlier dates than
thin wires. The break-up commences at the external surf'aco,
where stress is most intense, and proceeds thence to the
axis, where stress is least. The history of motional annealing
is therefore essentially dependent on tho dimensions of the
deformed wire and varies for different values of radius. I
pointed out* that in soft iron the limits of torsional resilience
were reached when the obliquity of the external fibre (shear)
somewhat exceeds "003 radians. Finally, the ultimate anneal
ing effect (time = oo ) of any temperature t acting on glass-
hard steel increases at a retarded rate with temperaturo, and
practically reaches tho limit of variation below 350°. In
case of motional annealing stress may bo applied in any
degree from without, and increasing effects obtained limited

1 Ob-           Mr. C. Barus on the Viscous Effect of
only by the given degrees of resilience or of brittleness.
Nevertheless, if the wire admits of permanent set, the analogy
pursued may even be pushed to this extreme detail. For,
just as in the case of thermal annealing above 350°, no
further marked effects are produced, because the intensity of
stored stress is invariably below the value of viscosity ; so in
case of motional annealing, when stress surpasses the limits
of resilience, further increment of marked consequence is no
longer elastically retained.
    II. Tensile, dravm, and other Strains in their Bearing on
                   Maxwell's Theory of Viscosity.
    10. It is known that the effect of drawing metallic wires
 through a draw-plate is a marked decrease of the viscosity of
 the originally soft metal. The diminution increases with the
 intensity of strain imparted. It is not so well known that
 the viscous effect of a tensile strain applied in any degree to
 the same originally soft metal is after straining almost nil in
 comparison. Kohlrausch* and his pupils, Streintz f and
 others, more recently and in extensive researches Mr. Herbert
 Tomlinson X, have occupied themselves with these phenomena.
 The results of these observers are in general accord, and
 agree well enough with my work that special publication of
 new data might appear superfluous. Nevertheless, as steel has
 been but sparingly dealt with, and as results fitting at once
 into my diagrams are essential to my purpose, I have found
 it desirable to communicate them. Apart from these con
 siderations the observations which I need must be made with
 minuto reference to Maxwell's theory. In this respect the
 earlier work is seriously lacking.
     The striking difference in the permanent viscous effect
 produced by the action of the two strains is particularly sur
 prising, because the strains are imparted by mechanical pro
 cesses not altogether dissimilar. The action of wire-pulling,
 however, accompanied as it is by surface compression as well
 as longitudinal extension is conducive to the permanent re
 tention of high-strain intensities, because it imparts to the
     * Kohlrausch's original and fundamental researches are given in my
 earlier papers. Here I need refer only to Schroeder, Wied. Ann. xxviii.

wire an arched structure. In steel, at least, there is a dense
shell surrounding an unusually rare core in such a way that
the density of the whole mass is materially lessened. Con
ditions favourable to the retention of high-strain intensities,
are also conditions favourable to the occurrence of molecular
instability. Hence the marked loss of viscosity of a drawn
wire, as compared ccet. par. with a soft wire. This premised,
it appears that in the case of a wire hardened by simple trac
tion the strain retained after traction is of insufficient
intensity to be accompanied by marked molecular instability.
More rigorously : if the wire during traction has experienced
a strain S, which strain after the tensile stress is withdrawn
diminishes to S' (S > S'), then the wire need exhibit no change
of viscous quality. For in the above cases of thermal anneal
ing and torsional motional annealing (§§ 2, 9), the greater
tensile strain S, supposing its action sufficiently prolonged,
has wiped out all motional instability for strains S' < S ; so
it follows here that to evoke viscous deformation by aid of
tensile strains, the wire must be examined during traction,
and preferably under conditions of strain near the limit of
rupture.
   1 1. The apparatus used in these experiments is shown in
fig. 1 , in which ab and cd are the two steel wires to be coun
ter-twisted. The system is fastened above and below to two
massive torsion-circles, A and B, respectively.       The inner
ends of the wires are joined by a strong brass rod be, carrying
a symmetrical circular platform near the lower end, on which
the lead scale-weights C C C" &c. (4 kilogs. to 5 kilogs.
each) may be supported. In order to facilitate quick work,
the connecting rod be is provided with a pair of cross-vanes
D, D', submerged in the water contained in an annular
trough, fgih f'ff'i'h'. Finally, the mirror m adjustably at
tached to the rod be (readings by telescope and scale)
indicates the difference of viscous motion of the two wires in
consequence of a fixed rate of twist stored between A and B.
I may add that the rod be can easily be chosen light enough,
compatibly with strength, so as to introduce no viscous effect
of its own.
   12. The data to test the above are given in the following
tables, of which Nos. IV., V., VI. exhibit the behaviour of
 some drawn steel wires. In each case the comparison is made
 with my steel normal No. 15 (the lower wire in fig. 1,
 An. 450° and twisted to permanent viscous qualities). The
 drawn wire in Table IV. is in the moderately resilient bright
 commercial state, very soft to the file. The wire in Table V.

has been drawn down from a larger diameter and the same
state of hardness to an extreme of brittle resilience. The
wire of Table VI. finally was first softened by heating to
redness in air and then drawn down to brittle resilience.

the drawn and normal wires respectively. The former is

reason the same rate of twist is applied to the wires through

value of ff. Finally, after testing the wire in the drawn
state, it was softened by heating to redness in air and again
tested. In this case viscous motion at the mirror nearly
ceases, thus affording an excellent check on the validity of
the experiments.

   In Table VII. I give results for the viscous effect of
moderate values of tensile strain, on a plan identical with the
above. The pull on the strained wire (the normal being
No. 15) is indicated in the first column in kilogrammes.
The maximum pull which these wires will bear wae computed
to be between 30 kg. and 50 kg. It was found to be 45 kg.
in some cases, experimentally. Inasmuch as I here apply
8-4 kg., the pull applied is 17 per cent, to 25 per cent, of the
load producing rupture.

     The results of Tables IV., V., and VI. show the marked
 influence of the drawn strain in effecting diminution of
 viscosity clearly. Wires drawn only moderately resilient are
 of the same low order of viscosity as glass-hard wires.
 Again, if the wires are drawn very resilient the reduction of
 the viscosity of the originally soft wire is enormous. To
 eliminate the effect of different degrees of softness I also
 drew down a wire after heating in air (Table VI.). The
 results are in accord with Tables IV. and V.
     Some insight into these results is expeditiously obtained
 by constructing tangents at like time-points of the curves.
 This is approximately done in the small summary following
 (Table VIII.), by subtracting the values of (<j> — <f>')/T for the
 beginning and end of the second minute after twisting.
  Similar values for stretched wire are given in the last two
 columns, kg. denoting the load.

      From this table the small effect of traction in case of loads
 below 25 per cent, of the breaking stress is specially mani
 fest; an effect negligible in comparison with the diminution
 of viscosity due to the drawn strain. For the sake of orienta
 tion I may assume that corresponding values of A(<f>—<j/) /r
 for glass-hardness would at 30° be about 1/103 to 2/10' ; that
 is, about equal to this quantity in the case of a moderately re
 silient wire. In general the results for the drawn strain both
 at 30° and at 100° corroborate and accentuate the results
 already obtained for temper*, so that the further discussion
 can be made as in my earlier papers, and may be waived here.
 I add only that the effect of drawing in case of steel is a de
 crease of the density of the soft metal ; for instance,

 It appears that in this respect also the drawn strain and
 temper are similar.

   13. Returning to the case of simple traction, the changes
of sign of (<£ — </>') /T suggesting increase of viscosity for loads
slightly greater than 5 kg., indicate that here, as in the case
of motional annealing due to torsion, the initial effects are an
increase of viscosity. Nevertheless the obscurely small vis
cous variations due to traction do not admit of interpretation,
unless supplemented by data for very much larger loads.
Again, it is desirable and quite feasible, by aid of the apparatus
discussed above, to operate cyclically ; in which case the results
must be such as to bear on the lag-quality of solids under
stress.
   In the following Table (IX.) I have therefore inserted some
data for larger pulls. Traction increases successively as far
as 90 per cent, of the breaking stress. It will be superfluous
to give more than a few typical examples ; and the tables
can be further abbreviated, because in the stress-decreasing
phase of the cycles the viscous effect of loads P below the
maximum employed is nil, § 10, and therefore sufficiently
given by the final load zero. To retain a fixed rate of tor
sion, t, it is necessary to twist the wires anew after each of
the larger loads ; in other words to bring back the same scale-
division into the telescope at the outset of each experiment.
Otherwise the torsion seriously decreases in consequence of
the rapid viscous deformation of the loaded wire.
    In adding the successive loads care was taken to avoid
vibration and jarring ; but without special machinery it is
impossible to protect the system completely against it. To
this cause I attribute certain irregularities of sequence which
these and others of my results exhibit. Their general sig
nificance is none the les3 definite. The effect of traction is
diminution of viscosity, increasing at an accelerated rate in
 proportion as stress approaches the limit of rupture. Indeed
 by sufficiently increasing stress, viscosity may be diminished
in any degree whatever. The singularly curious feature of
 these experiments is this, that with the removal of load tho
 viscous effect of traction almost entirely vanishes. It is in
 this respect that the present experiments bear directly on
 the truth of Maxwell's theory ; for it is only during the
 interval within which conditions favourable to molecular
 break-up are forcibly maintained that the wires exhibit a low
 order of viscosity of a sufficiently marked degree to compare
 with the viscous effect of drawn strains and of temper,
 where instabilities are structurally retained.
    It follows, in general, that slight applications of mechanical
 treatment (twisting, traction, &c), inasmuch as they decrease
 in number the motionally unstable configurations of the soft

wire, increase viscosity (motional annealing). If this treat
ment is intensified beyond a critical stage, in other words
if stress is increased sufficiently beyond the limits of resi
lience and toward the limits of rupture, then viscosity is again
seriously decreased. For the action of stress has now become
such as to introduce its own specific instability, whereby
viscous deformation is again promoted.
   14. Having thus substantiated the remarks of § 10, and
shown that the accordant results of the earlier observers and
my own are such as follow naturally from Maxwell's theory,
it is expedient to give a graphic representation of the more
important differential data (i. e. differences between strained
and soft metal for each case of stress) in hand. In figure 2,
the viscous deformation (<f> — <£')/t, produced by the action of
a fixed rate of twist t, is represented as ordinate, time as
abscissa. The material is steel, the originally soft state of
which has been transformed by temper (glass-hardness),
drawn strain (wire-plate), tensile strain, and torsion respec
tively. Curves are given for intense values and for moderate
values of stress. The nature of the problem precludes greater
definiteness as to stress data. In case of traction infinitesi-
mally below the point of rupture, for instance, viscous de
formation would occur with such extreme rapidity that its
diagrammatic representation would be a vertical line.
    Again, in case of traction of sufficiently small value, the
curve would be a horizontal line coinciding with " soft," or
even a curve below it (motional annealing). In a measure
this is true of the other strains ; and I nave therefore ex
 pediently inserted the values for deformations actually found.
    The general outcome of the present paper is this, that the
 effect of strain of whatever kind, applied in sufficient intensity
 to homogeneous soft steel, is marked diminution of viscosity.
 Again, inasmuch as the underlying cause of viscous deforma
 tion is the occurrence of unstable configurations the number
 of which is being reduced in the course of viscous motion,
 Maxwell's theory naturally suggests the applicability of ex
 ponential equations for the description of the time relations
 of such motion. From another point of view it appears that
 the loss of viscosity experienced by a given metal, under
 action of a given kind of strain, may not inappropriately be
 used as a measure of its intensity. Finally, the curious
 observation, that in all the cases given loss of viscosity has
 taken place simultaneously with increase of hardness, is one
 of the suggestive results of the experiments made.

XIX. On some Facts connected with tlie Systems of Scientific
    Units of Measurement. By T. H. Blakesley, M.A.,
   M.I.C.E*
 IT seems to me a not unfitting opportunity, as a sequel to
       Prof. Biicker's suggestion, that we should modify some
of our scientific formulae, to inquire whether, with a change of
formulation, we may not advantageously effect a change in
some of the units themselves. That the CCS. and the prac
tical system of units do not satisfy all the requirements of a
perfect system of mechanical units must, I think, have oc
curred to others as well as to myself ; and I mention this, not
as an occasion for surprise, for indeed it would have been
surprising if any system brought into vogue twenty years ago
should still be found even to approach perfection, but rather
in order to draw attention to the points in which these systems
fail to give satisfaction, with a view to possibly rectifying
their shortcomings.
   The sense of imperfection may of course arise in the failure
to attain to any one of the various ends which it should be
the aim of a good system to reach.
   I imagine that the following would be generally considered
to be among those ends :—
   First. All the quantities considered should be so connected
by the equations representing the laws of nature, that no
coefficients are required in expressing any units in terms of
others. [Correlation.]
   Secondly. Where quantities are recognized as being essen
tially of the same nature, they should be measured by the same
unit. [Simplicity.]
   Thirdly. Such a system should embrace all of the physical
ideas which occur. [Comprehensiveness.]
   Fourthly. Such a system should, so far as is compatible
with other requirements, have its units closely and decimally
connected with natural unite. [Naturalness.]
   Fifthly. The units should, subject to other considerations,
agree with established though arbitrary units of measurement,
actually or decimally. [Convenience.]
   These five heads may be briefly described as: —
                        Correlation.
                        Simplicity.
                        Comprehensiveness.
                        Naturalness.
                        Convenience.
  I lay no particular stress upon the order in which these ends
  * Communicated by the Physical Society : read December 8, 1888.

           Systems of Scientific Units of Measurement.         179
should be placed, though in my opinion the above order seems
the true one, and I think most people would agree in putting
Correlation at the top of the list. Its importance is so great
that it has in fact been more completely realized than any of
the others, most physical ideas having their due formula?
assigned and recognized. It has been the more easy to do
this, since the process is absolutely independent of the real
units employed. The ideas need only to have their physical
nature truly comprehended.
   In the second point—Simplicity—there has been much less
progress made. In electrical matters, for instance, though in
describing a magnitude it may be perfectly well understood
what units of length, mass, and time form the fundamental
basis of the measurement, it is further necessary to state
whether the Electrostatic or the Electromagnetic system is
contemplated.
   Again, heat is recognized as a form of energy, and yet the
two are not referred to the same unit. If they were so, Joule's
equivalent would always be unity. The defects in Compre
hensiveness have been lately discussed in this Society by
Prof. Riicker*. The one with which I have been brought
most in contact is the omission of temperature from the
systems in use. I think that if generalizations as great as
the Electromagnetic Theory of Light are to be made by the
help of systems of units, the Thermometer ought at once to
be brought in out of the cold region of unsympathetic isola
tion and independence.
   In chemical physics are to be found some notable omissions
in atomic heat and electrochemical equivalence. When we
examine the units to note how many are founded upon natural
magnitudes, we recognize that the second is not a subdecimal
part of the solar day, but only the 53^00 °f that natural unit.
To set against this, however, it is a unit which is in common use.
   The centimetre is decimally connected with the earth's
quadrant, and the unit of density is that of water, the gramme
merely being derived from the centimetre and density of water
by proper correlation.
   In the quadrant-volt second, or practical system, the length
unit is brought up to practical coincidence with the earth-
quadrant ; the second, as before, is the unit of time ; and the
other quantities are only decimally connected with the C.G.S.
I am not aware that any accidental coincidences occur between
other units of this system and natural ones, the nearest ap
proach being probably the volt to theE.M.F. of a Daniell cell.
   But it is when we compare the units with those of an
arbitrary nature perhaps, but in common use, that the failure
                 * See p. 104 of the present Number.
                                 N 2

180     Mr. T. H. Blakesley on some Facts connected toitli
in actual coincidence or in decimal relation is most striking.
The failure to introduce to any great extent the metrical
measures of length into England as against the inch is a well-
known case. Again, the horse-power and the erg per second
are not decimally related.
   So inconvenient is this last defect in the department of
electromechanics, that Mr. Precco has suggested that engi
neers should give up the H.P. of James Watt and adopt in
its stead 1000 watts. This suggestion has not, so far as I
know, met with any support, perhaps because the modifications
in the definition of the unit which would be necessary for its
clear appreciation from a mechanical engineer's point of view
have not been clearly stated. The evil implied in the sug
gestion is, however, great ; and, if possible, something ought
to be done to assuage the acute suffering which engineers feel
in passing from H.P. to watts.
   1 think it will be conceded, too, that even the more har
dened physicist feels some pangs of passage on the troubled
sea of transformation from the terra jirma of the Electrostatic
system to that of the Electromagnetic ; and I do not think a
rapid answer could be given by many persons to the question,
What is the value, in C.G.S. electrostatic units, of a cur
rent of (say) 33*3 practical electromagnetic units ? Yet in
following out the experiments of Dr. Hertz, with which Mr.
Tunzelmann has made us familiar, such a calculation must, I
think, be made.
   I will here give two formula?, which will enable any mag
nitude given in one system to be brought into the other.
    Let k = the exponent of I in electromagnetic system,
         * =        »     »     m_      »       >>      »

      for any kind of magnitude brought into due correlation
            with others.

   The 3 in these equations is meant as a sufficient approxima
tion to the number 2*998, which is one tenth of " v " in
quadrants per second.

   I have myself not seen such reduction-formulas elsewhere,
and under the present systems I think they may be found
of use.
   But it would be far better than employing such formulae to
have but one system for all measurements, and do away with
this inconvenient bimetallism in the currency of science.
   And in this case the way out of the difficulty is easy. We
have only to adopt "v" as the unit of velocity. With this
one restriction any magnitude will be expressed in a system
based upon any units by the same number in either system.
Such a system would be a veritable coalition, and for distinc
tion might be so called.
   A coalition system, then, merely requires that the unit of
velocity shall be a certain one, which is also a natural one.
It reduces the degrees of freedom in the choice of units by 1,
and, without prejudice to Prof. Riicker's method of formula
tion, will allow us to fix almost any two other units arbitrarily.
The two cannot of course be time and length, for velocity
simply involves these alone. If the second were retained, the
unit of length would be 30 quadrants. If the quadrant were
retained, the unit of time would be       of a second.
   If it be urged that a velocity of 30 quadrants per second is
a large one, I would reply that it is only 30 times the present
unit of velocity in the practical system ; and that experience
shows that extremely high or low units do not materially affect
calculations. The unit of capacity is a million times the
microfarad of our laboratories, and that of velocity about a
million times the speed of an express-train. The use of mega-
and micro- has now been found by experience to present no
difficulty or objection.
   Thus this change in the unit of velocity would not introduce
inconvenience in itself ; but unfortunately, since v = j, its
change would necessitate one indirectly in either length or
time, and clocks and meters are so commonly in uso that any
interference in their present constructions would be felt a
serious thing. Of the two changes, that of the timo unit
seems to me simplest. To take ^ of a thing which itself is
^ of a minute, that again being ^0- of an hour, does not
appear so very radical an operation.
   If we calculate the various units obtained by this change in
the time unit and compare them with the quadrant-volt-
second units, we shall find (column V.) that mass, length, and
quantity of electricity remain unaltered ; time and conduc
tivity become 3l0 ; velocity, momentum, current, resistance,
magnetic field, pole, and magnetic moment, 30 times ; force,

 182     Mr. T. H. Blakesley on some Facts connected toith
acceleration, energy, and E.M.F., 900 ; and power, 27,000
 times of the practical units ; while capacity sinks to      of a
farad.
   This would, however, leave the connexion between the unit
 of power and 1 horse-power bad, for 1 unit would be about
 36 2 H.P.
   The correlation of temperature with other units would be,
 I imagine, best effected by the definition that a unit-of-
 temperaturo change shall be that through which a unit of
 energy in the form of heat would raise a unit of matter pos
sessing unit specific heat ; in other words, the equation
                          mPt-*=Jmcd
should be satisfied by J si.
   Since heat is recognized as energy, J must be numerical,
 notwithstanding arguments have been adduced against this
view. It is sometimes said that J cannot be numerical
because it changes with a change of units. This only arises
from the fact that heat in the form mcQ is not properly corre
lated, because (c&) is not so. Those who use this argument
should apply it in some other case, when the fallacy would be
apparent ; e. g.
         Power in watts           =746 horse-powers,
         Power in ergs per sec. = 107 x 746 horse-powers.
 Here the factor has changed with a change of units, but no
one would deny its being numerical, or the relation of one
magnitude to another of the same nature.
   If therefore J is reduced to unity by the above definition,
we have (c0) = Pt~i for the dimensions of temperature x
specific heat ; and if c is taken as numerical, these become the
dimensions of 6.
   As regards the relation between a degree so obtained and a
thermometer-degree, we have the following facts to go upon:—
      4*2 x 107 ergs raise 1 gram of water 1° C,
      1 erg raises 1 gram ol water through          x iqi) ^
         .-. 1° C. = 4-2 x 107 degrees C.G.S. (water).
             l°F. = 2-3xl07         „      „     „
             1° R. = 5-25 x 107     „      „     „
   These degrees therefore do not fit in decimally with the
arbitrary scales in use.
   But the number 4"2 may be written •2a«l, ¦ If therefore
we use as the standard of specific heat a substance which,

          the Systems of Scientific Units of Measurement.     183
referred to water, will have the specific heat -2381, we shall
then have
            1° C. = 10' C.G.S. (substance in question).
    Now Regnanlt's value for specific heat of air at constant
pressure is "2375, Wiedemann's value is '2389. The mean of
these is '2382.
    If therefore we adopt the specific heat of air at constant
pressure as the standard of specific heat, we have
               1° C. =10' of 1 C.G.S. (air) unit.
The practical unit would be 1018 of a C.G.S. unit, and there
fore would be 10n of a degree Centigrade.
    In relation to the thermometer, air has other well-known
advantages over liquids, and is already the standard for specific
inductive capacity and magnetic permeability.
    This decimal relation of the Centigrade thermometer would
 not exist if the coalition of the Electromagnetic and Electro
 static systems were carried out on the lines I have indicated,
viz. by making 3*5 of a second the unit of time. The new
 unit of temperature would then be 900 times that of the
electromagnetic quad rant-volt-second air unit.
    Hence
 1 unit of temperature = 900 x 10u of 1 degree Centigrade.
         „         „      =1620x10"           „      Fahrenheit.
         „         „      = 720xlOn           „       Reaumur.
    The endeavour to bring the horse-power and the unit of
power into decimal relation may be guided by throwing the
formulae into terms of length, time, and power ; and I have
accordingly given a table of the ideas involved on this basis,
in column VII. Any magnitude which appears in these
formulas unencumbered by the symbol of power will of course
be unaltered by a mere change in its unit. Hence, if we
adopted as the unit of power, "746 of the watt or a decimal
 multiplo of that quantity of power, we could bring the unit
 of power into decimal relation with the horse-power without
 altering the units in the practical system of time, length,
 velocity, acceleration, resistance and conductivity, and ca
 pacity. Thus the expensive standards of our laboratories, of
 resistance and capacity, our resistance-boxes and our micro
 farads, would remain to us. But our boxes of grammes would
 fall in value. The unit of temperature, however, would not
 be altered, so that Centigrade thermometers would remain.
 Column VIII. expresses the results of such a change.
    No doubt if we did not suffer from an hereditary duodeci
 mal taint, we might discard the 5^00 °f a ^ay, caued a
 second, and adopt the •jod'ooc °f a day as our um* °f time>

184    Mr. T. H. Blakesley on some Facts connected with
and that interval would be "864 of a second, which number
happens to be the square root of '746; and this would give us a
coincidence in magnetic field, whose formula is e-* <_l jo*. But
magnetic field is not a magnitude of which we keep instru
mental standards, as we are wont to do of resistance, capacity,
mass, time, length, and sometimes of E.M.F.
   It will be observed that in the formula? the symbol of power
occurs either simply or raised to the power of and we may
bring power into decimal relation with horse-power either by
taking -746 of the unit or 7-46. The square roots of these
relations are -86373 and 2-73136. Using the latter number
we should obtain no further coincidences among the mag
nitudes.
   In reviewing the results indicated by the above calcu
lations, in dealing with the units of science in such a way as
to obtain :—
   (1) The correlation of the thermometer ;
   (2) The unity of the two systems, Electrostatic and Elec
tromagnetic ;
   (3) The bringing of the unit of power into decimal relation
with the horse-power ;
I come to the conclusion:—
   (1) The thermometer Centigrade may be brought into
decimal relation with temperature-units on the C.G.S. system
or quadrant-volt-second system by adopting the specific heat
of air at constant pressure as unity.
   (2) That such decimal relation is compatible with a change
in tho unit of power to y0W of 1 H.P., which latter change
could take place without changes in the units of time, length,
velocity, resistance, and capacity, but would involve a change
in the important standards of mass.
   (3) That the union of the two electrical systems could be
brought about in the simplest way by taking ^ of one
second as the unit of time ; such a change retaining the
gramme- boxes, and the metre decimally, and the coulomb,
but requiring the unit of capacity to be        of 1 farad and
the unit of resistance to be 30 ohms.
   To my mind the last change recommends itself. No real
change would be necessary in tho face of the chronometer, or
in tho metre, or in the gramme-boxes. Each microfarad
 would have to be called. -0009, and each second 30, and every
 30 ohms 1 unit. A habit has arisen of attaching particular
names to units. This, without doing very much good, adds
greatly to the stability of the unit, and makes any subsequent
change so much tho more difficult. The practice has almost
always been confined to electricians, somewhat too oblivious
of the mechanical basis of a proper system.

186      Mr. G. Hookham on Permanent Magnet Circuits.
   Sir William Thomson, in a paper on unite of measurement,
contemplates a time when many of the unite we now employ
will become things of the past by the introduction of the
universal gravitation method of connecting mass with length
and force.
   The naming of particular units employed for a time in the
process of this development cannot but retard its progress,
and the unity of science should take place independently of
the subdivisions which may exist to-day.
   It is highly probable that chemical science may soon require
a modification of our present units, and we must not keep
combining weights, atomic heat, and so on, uncorrected
with the rest of the body of science because the development
of science has taken the order it has done. It might have
been quite otherwise.
   Dr. Whewell entertained a speculation as to whether the
laws of motion would ever have been discovered by an intel
lectual race of jelly-fish inhabiting a world in which were no
solid bodies.
   In like manner we may imagine that had Torpedoes, or
other animals armed with a controllable electrical equipment,
won the race for supremacy against man, the laws of electri
city might have been reached before the mechanical laws.
Faraday and Maxwell would have preceded Galileo and
Newton, and Gymnotus might have exhibited in submarine
air-cases that uncanny biped Homo who could give you a
curious and mysterious shock with a stick or a stone.
              XX. On Permanent Magnet Circuits.
                 By George Hookham, M.A.*
f I \HE immediate object of my experiments in permanent
  M.    magnets was a practical one, viz. to obtain a magnetic
field suitable for the electromotor part of my electricity-meter.
If by their use a constant field of sufficient intensity could be
produced, its advantage in point of economy in use would
 make it of the greatest value. At the same time I was aware
that the scientific world did not consciously believe in the
possibility of a really constant permanent magnet, except
when the magnetic circuit was complete through a magnetic
metal.
    But it occurred to me that there is one familiar case in
which absolute constancy is admitted, and yet this condition
is not fulfilled. I refer to the arrangement in which a soft
iron ring is cut at two points diametrically opposite, and the
   * Communicated by the Author, having been read before the Birming
ham Philosophical Society, November 8, 1888.

       Mr. G. Hookham on Permanent Magnet Circuits.           187
ends carefully refitted by filing and scraping. If, now, this
ring is once strongly magnetized by an electrical current, we
obtain a powerful permanent magnet. The magnetic circuit,
however, is anything but complete. There are two breaks in
it ; very minute, no doubt, if their mere dimensions are taken
into account ; but recent experiments seem to show that, how
ever carefully we may fit together surfaces of iron, there is
still an easily measurable resistance which is greater than
would be due to the dimensions of the air-space ; that there
is in fact, in addition, a surface-resistance. Such a resistance
is the equivalent of a small current tending to reverse the
magnetism of the iron. Now, what enables soft and pure
iron to withstand this demagnetizing agency? Apparently
nothing but the coercive force of the iron, small as it is.
Once magnetized, the softest iron under any circumstances
remains at ordinary temperatures a permanent magnet, how
ever weak ; and one can only suppose that it is in virtue of
this very small coercive force that the soft iron magnet over
 comes even the small resistance of well-fitted joints. If this
 supposition were well founded, I felt almost certain that when
 very hard magnets of tungsten steel were substituted for the
 soft iron, air-space resistances incomparably greater might be
overcome ; and yet the magnetic intensity in the circuit be
 very considerable, and to all intents and purposes absolutely
constant. It was at any rate quite certain that this state of
things would obtain, if the power of overcoming resistances in
 the circuit were at all proportional to the coercive force of tho
material of the magnets. My anticipations have been com
plete^' realized, and I have been able to construct magnets
which are truly permanent.
    As to the special arrangement, when the object in view, as
 in this case, is subject to commercial considerations, cost of
production makes the use of straight bar-magnets almost
imperative. A number of these are enclosed in a brass tube,
to the ends of which are attached soft cast-iron arms, curving
round towards the pole-pieces, which closely face each other,
so as to form a narrow slit in which the thin disk-armature of
the meter revolves. Tho magnetic resistance of the arms is
 practically negligible. As to proportions I was, in principle,
 guided by the analogy of the voltaic circuit. There, if we
 wish to overcome a considerable external resistance, the plan
 is to pile up the electromotive force by increasing the number
 of cells in series, paying little regard to the consequent in
 crease of internal resistance. Here the steel magnet-bars
 constitute the magnetic cell, whose magnetomotive force—to
 use what is at any rate a most convenient expression—is

 188    Mr. G. Hookham on Permanent Magnet Circuits.
proportional to the length of the bars. Hence, in order to
overcome a considerable air-space resistance, the actual dimen
sions must be such that the ratio of the total cross-section of
the steel magnet-bars to their length must be very small com
pared with the ratio of the cross-section of the air-space to
the distance between the pole-pieces. Obviously, too, the
best proportions would depend on the nature of the steel
magnets—an entirely unknown quantity—so that the first
experiment had to be made almost at haphazard. Curiously
enough I have never been able to improve on the proportions
used in this first experiment. I have had some fairly accu
rate tests made lately, and find that the best relation between
the two ratios, as stated above, is about 1 to 70. Thus, if A
equal the area of cross-section of the air-space, L the distance
between the pole-pieces, a the cross-section of the steel magnets,
                                 A.                             Q,
I the length of the bars, then j- should equal about 70 x j.
For example, if the cross-section of the steel magnets is 3
square inches, and their length 6 inches, then the air-space
may be 9 square inches, and the pole-pieces \ inch apart, or
4£ square inches with £ inch distance, or 2\ square inches
with ^ inch, and so on, for in each case the relation remains
the same, viz. 1 : 72.
   The object of making such tests was to get the best possible
return for a given weight of steel. On the analogy of the
voltaic cell, this object would be attained when the internal
and external resistances were equal. With the proportion at
 1 to 70 my tests showed that this equality practically existed ;
and, consequently, that the resistance of tungsten steel, as I
use it, is about one seventieth that of air, and therefore about
twenty times that of soft iron. The actual intensity obtained
is also very high, being in the ordinary pattern of my meter
nearly 4000 in the air-space, or at least half that in the air
space of a modern dynamo, and represents a magnetizing
force of 1000 ampere-turns on a soft-iron core of full sectional
area.
   Some very simple, but practically important, results follow
from the assumed analogy to the voltaic cell. In indicating
them I neglect the resistance of the cast iron in the circuit, as
this can always be made negligible at a trifling extra cost.
Thus we can increase the intensity in an air-space of constant
area in the proportion of the square root of the weight of steel
magnets. Wo can, for instance, double the intensity by
doubling the length, and at the same time doubling the
cross-section of the magnet-bars, for then the magneto
motive force is doubled, and all resistances remain the
same. Again, we may double the intensity in the air-space by

            On the Periodic Movements of the Ground.         189
simply halving the area and halving the distance, for we shall
then have made no change either in the magneto-motive force
or the resistances, and, consequently, the same total induction
is compressed into half the area ; or, again, we may double the
distance between the pole-pieces and preserve the same intensity
by simply doubling the length of the magnets. It is, in fact,
quite easy to design an arrangement of permanent magnets that
shall, within obvious limits, produce any given intensity of
magnetic field in any given area of cross-section of air-space.
These conclusions have been to a great extent tested by practice,
and so far as they go the analogy on which they are founded
holds good. The analogy is, in fact, mutatis mutandis, one of
universal application.
    The current by which the circuit is magnetized is always
applied when everything is in position ; otherwise very small
intensity results. The magnets are flashed by a current from a
 dynamo to practical saturation. The coils are then removed,
and the magnets hammered severely. The hammering seldom
reduces the intensity more than about one per cent. In montlis
 of continued testing I have never found any measurable falling-
 off in the field of a magnet so treated. If a reversing current
 is applied, the intensity will spring up on removal of the
current, and will sometimes continue to rise appreciably for
a considerable period. After a time it would probably fall
 again ; but, if the weakening under the reverse current has
 amounted to, say, twenty per cent., never to the lowest point
 then reached, and, perhaps, never to the point to which it
springs at once, on the removal of the reverse current ; and,
 further, I have little doubt that an experiment might be
 arranged in which magnetizing and demagnetizing currents
should be applied alternately in such a manner that, on their
 cessation, the successive strengthenings and weakenings of
 the field would repeat themselves backwards, just as was the
 case with the windings and unwindings in Sir W. Thomson's
 experiments on the " Fatigue of Metals." If so, the latest
 experiments on torsion would but add another analogy to
 Wiedemann's famous list.
  XXI. Note on M. Ph. Plantamour's Observations by means
    of Levels on the Periodic Movements of the Ground at
     Secheron, near Geneva. By Charles Davison, M.A.,
    Mathematical Master at King Edward's High School,
     Birmingham* .
  OBSERVATIONS on the movements of the ground by
         means of levels have recently been made by many
                   * Communicated by the Author.

190                 Mr. C. Davison on the Periodic
astronomers and physicists in different parts of the world.
But, at Secheron, near Geneva, they have been conducted by
M. Philippe Plantamour with an energy and perseverance
which can find but few parallels, even in the annals of science.
Since the end of 1878, without anj- important intermission,
have his levels been read at least twice a day, and the results
described in a series of valuable memoirs, published annually
in the Archives des Sciences physiques et naturelles*.
    In this paper I propose to summarize the conclusions at
which M. Plantamour has arrived : to show that a slightly
different discussion of his observations will lead to a result of
some interest ; and to consider the cause or causes to which
these movements may be due.
   Arrangement of Levels, §c.—M. Plantamour's levels are
placed in the cellar of his house at Secheron, nearly two kilo
metres north of the observatory of Geneva, and 27 metres
distant from the lake. The east front of the house faces the
lake and is parallel to its shore-line, its direction being 30° E.
of N. to 30° W. of S. The cellar, which is very dry, is
excavated in compact blue glacial clay, covered by gravel on
the west, north, and south sides of the house ; and the ground
on the west side is thus 2 metres higher than that on the
east. M. Plantamour says that the subsoil of the house is 20
centimetres lower than the terrace; that is, I suppose, the
clay beneath the floor of the cellar is at this depth below the
ground on the east side of the house. Between the house
and the lake the ground is nearly horizontal, the level of the
lake being on an average one metre below the terrace.
Behind the house the ground rises at an inclination of about
3 or 4 in 100 for about a kilometre, beyond which the slope
increases more rapidly. In the immediate neighbourhood of
the house, however, the slope of the land is considerable, and
its direction cannot differ greatly from 30° S. of E. I give
these details somewhat fully, as they have an important
bearing on the results t-

   t The above account is taken partly from M. Plantamour's papers,
partly from a letter to myself in which he describes the conditions at
greater length. In a MS. sketch of the plan of his house, which he was
good enough to send me, it would appear that the direction of the front
of his house and of the shore-line of the lake is 17^° E. of N. to 171° W.
of S. : but I am not certain whether this plan is drawn exactly to scale;

                    Movements of the Ground.                191
   The levels rest on a mass of masonry, built twenty years
before the observations were begun, but leaning against the
outer west wall of the house ; they are at a depth of more than
a metre below the ground outside, and at a distance of a
metre from one another. M. Plantaniour does not think that
the movements indicated by the levels are due to oscillations
of the outer wall under the action of changes of temperature.
But we cannot be certain that they are not partly so caused,
and it is impossible not to regret that observations under
taken with such care and perseverance should not have
been made on levels completely isolated from all external
accidents.
   One of the levels is orientated east and west, the other
north and south. During the first two years, however, owing
to an error in the compass employed, their directions were
7°S. of E. to 7° N. of W., and 7°E. of N. to 7° W. of S.,
respectively. Readings were taken five times a day (at
9 a.m., noon, 3, 6, and 9 p.m.) during the first year, in order
to determine the nature of the diurnal oscillations ; and
afterwards twice a day, at 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., that is, a little
after the daily minimum and before the daily maximum.
The mean of these readings is taken as the value of the in
clination for the day.
   Each year of observations begins on October 1, but, during
the first year, the N.S. level was not ready until December 23,
1878. Tables are given in each memoir of the mean inclina
tion of both levels for every day in the year, and the results
are graphically shown on a plate, as well as the curve of the
 mean temperatures recorded at the observatory of Geneva.
   Results of M. Planlamour's Observations.—1. In the E.W.
level, a rise or fall of the external temperature produces a
rise or fall, respectively, of the east end of the level : the
movements of the ground lagging behind the changes of
temperature. The extreme oscillations are determined by
the continuity of a certain mean temperature rather than by
the actual maxima or minima. The conclusion is therefore
natural that variations of external temperature may be one
of the principal causes of the periodic movements of tho
ground.
   2. The period of oscillation experienced by the N.S. level
is also annual, but its range is much smaller. In a general
way, the south end follows the changes of external tempera
ture, that is, it is lowered in winter and raised in summer.
But the temperature variations of shorter period produce an
inverse effect ; as the temperature rises the south end is

  192               Mr. C. Davison on the Periodic
 lowered and vice versa. This anomaly is never observed in
 the E.W. level, and its cause is unknown.
    3. Diurnal variations are exhibited by both levels. In the
 E.W. level they are frequent ; they vary much in intensity,
 being sometimes insensible, but at other times very pro
 nounced, amounting to as much as 3""2 (on Sept. 5, 1879).
 In the N.S. level they are rare and always small. When
 they occur in one level, moreover, they are absent in the
 other*. In the E.W. level M. E. Plantamour, applying
 Bessel's formula for periodic phenomena, finds that the
 maxima and minima of elevation of the east end generally
 fall between 6 and 7f p.m. and A.M.
    4. Besides the periodic movements indicated by the E.W.
 level, there occurred daring the second year of observations
 an extraordinary fall of the east end of the level, which it
 has never since recovered. On Nov. 13, 1879, the inclination
 wus +l"-66 towards the west. It fell gradually to — 5"*80
on Nov. 26, and then the downward movement became rapid,
reaching — 88""71 on Dec. 26. After this it rose slightly to
 — 82"-16 on Jan. 5, 1880 ; but again fell, attaining its maxi
mum lowering of — 89""95 on Jan. 28. During the following
summer the east end rose no higher than — 74",05 on Sept. 9.
M. Plantamour attributes this extraordinary movement in
part to the exceptionally low mean temperature of the winter
of 1879-80 ; but, as he observes, there must be some other
determining factor besides external temperature, whose cause
is as yet undiscovered.
    The following Table summarizes M. Plantamour's observa
tions. In the last two columns I have added the average
inclinations of both levels throughout the whole yearf :—
   * These features are readily explained if the annual and diurnal
oscillations be due to the same cause. For then the resultant diurnal
movement would take place in the same direction as the resultant annual
movement at the same time, which is most frequently in an easterly,
and but rarely in a northerly, direction. I am unable, however, to test
this explanation, as M. Plantamour has only published the tables of
diurnal motions for the E.W. level during the first year of observations.
   t A + sign before a figure indicates a rise, and a — sign a fall, of the
east and south ends of the two levels, with reference to their initial
positions on Oct. 1 and Dec. 23, 1878, respectively. From Oct. 7-21,
1870, no readings were taken. In calculating the average inclinations for
this year, 15 arithmetic means have been inserted between the figures for
Oct. 6 and 22, namely, +6"-86 and +5"77 for the E.W. level, and
—1"-70 and -2"-12 for the N.S. level. Excluding these 15 days the
average inclinations for the rest of the year would be — 70",37and — 2"'63.
It should be added that in a few cases I have taken these figures from
MS. notes, not being able to re-consult the original papers.

194               Mr. C. Davison on the Periodic
   Curves of Resultant Motion.—It will be noticed from the
preceding summary that M. Plantamour's discussion of his
observations is confined to the components of the motion in
two given directions, namely from east to west and from north
to south. It may be possible, therefore, to learn something
more from his observations by considering the movement
which is the resultant of these two components.
   The curves representing the resultant motion of the ground
are drawn as follows :—
   The zero of the E.W. level is its positiou on Oct. 1, 1878,
                              Ttg. I.
that of the N.S. level is its position on Dec. 23, 1878. The
positive abscissae and ordinates of points on the curve represent

                      Movements of (lie Ground.               195
the changes of inclination since these epochs towards the east
and north respectively. The straight line joining any two
points on the curve so obtained represents in magnitude and
direction the resultant change of inclination during the cor
responding interval. The direction of the longest axis of the
curve is, therefore, that in which the greatest change of incli
nation has taken place.
    In order to show the resultant change of inclination for
every day in the year, the figures would, however, have to be
inconveniently large. I have therefore made use of the
average weekly changes of inclination only ; except that the
average is taken for a period of eight days at the end of the
year of observations (Sept. 23-30), and also in the year 1884 in
the interval including Feb. 29. The curves so obtained for
the fourth to the eighth years of observation inclusive (1881-
86) are given in fig. 1 ; the scale being such that one inch
represents a change of 12" in either direction. To avoid
confusion the curves for different years are drawn below one
another instead of being superposed.
    Fig. 2 represents, on a scale ten times as great, the daily
changes of inclination for the period corresponding to the
right-hand portion of the curve for the seventh year (Dec. 24,
1884, to March 3, 1885). The dotted line, which represents,
on the same enlarged scale, the average weekly changes of in
clination during the same period, illustrates the simpler and
average character of the latter curve.
   From the curves in fig. 1, we may conclude :— (1) That
the changes of inclination take place in different azimuths,
showing that the component movements indicated by the two
levels are not always in the same proportion to one another ;
(2) that, besides the yearly periodic movement, there is
during the whole time illustrated a movement in a northerly
direction, and, from the fifth to the seventh years, a consi
derable movement in an easterly direction as well ; and
(3) that the direction of the longer axis of all the curves is,
on an average, about 12° S. of E, showing that the greatest
change of inclination during the year takes place approximately
in the direction of the average slope of the surrounding ground.
    Connexion between the Changes of Temperature and the
Movements of the Ground.— Let A B (fig. 3) represent a
 section of the surface of the ground (supposed plane), P, Q
two points on the horizontal floor of the cellar.
    Let us suppose the external temperature to be rising. Let
 QC represent the isothermal surface through Q, andl)E that
 at which a given change of external temperature is just per
 ceptible at the end of a certain time. If Q D, P CE be vertical
                                02


                     Movements of the Ground.                  197
lines through Q and P, it is evident that the parts Q D and
U E will expand hy the same amount after a given change of
                                Tig. 3.
external temperature ; and the rise of P relatively to Q will
be due to the expansion of the part P 0. Thus, as the tem
perature rises, the end P of a level P Q will rise.
   As the temperature falls, on the other hand, the end P will
fall after a short interval, and the bubble of the level will pass
through its zero-point when the average temperature of P C
is equal to its initial value.
   Now M. Plantamour finds that, with the ground sloping in
a direction nearly east, the rise and fall of the east end of the
level follow after a short interval the rise and fall of the
external temperature.
   Again, the length of the line P C is greatest when the line
P Q is perpendicular to the horizontal section of the isothermal
surface through Q, that is, when the line P Q is parallel to
the direction of the slope of the ground outside. Hence, the
directions of greatest change of inclination and of the general
slope of the ground should coincide.
   Also, since the range of temperature due to a given change
of external temperature diminishes as the depth below the
surface of the ground increases, the change of level due to that
change of external temperature must diminish as the distance
from the ground increases. So that two levels placed near one
another in the same cellar, but at different distances from the
surface, should indicate different variations of level. And the
variations may even be in opposite directions when the changes
of external temperature take place in opposite directions.
   Other conditions being the same, moreover, the extent of
the movement varies as the tangent of the inclination of the
land ; and this shows the desirability of choosing level ground
for observatory-sites.

    The nearly uniform temperature of the cellar * will tend to
increase this estimate ; but, on the other hand, the linear
coefficient of dilatation only has been used, whereas the ex
pansion will take place chiefly upwards. Hence, as the levels
are close to the surface of the ground, and as the annual and
daily ranges of temperature at Geneva are considerable, we
may, I think, conclude that changes of external temperature
are an extremely probable cause of the principal periodic move
ments of the ground observed by M. Pumtamour.
    There are other movements, however, whose causes are not
so clear. If the surface of the ground were perfectly plane,
and the movements were due solely to changes of temperature,
then we should expect the curves in fig. 1 to be simply straight
lines parallel to the slope of the ground. Possibly the move
ments at right angles to this direction may be due to inequa
lities in the ground or to differences in its covering, causing
the normal to the horizontal section of the isothermal surface
at any point to vary. It is evident that the direction of QP
 (fig. 3), for which the product of the length PC into its change
of average temperature is greatest, may vary, and the direction
of the resultant motion be consequently changed.
    Influence of the Formation and Melting of Polar Ice.—It
may be thought that the alternate formation and melting of
ice and snow on the two polar ice-caps might produce a small
periodic movement in the direction of the meridian. It must,
however, be inappreciable. For the centre of gravity of the
earth must be displaced by 147 feet along its axis to produce
a change of 1" in the direction of the vertical at Geneva.
 Let us suppose a layer of ice (of density "92) of uniform
thickness to be melted off the whole south polar zone, and the
   * It should be noted that Colonel Orfi, who has made observations on
levels in the cellar of the Observatory of Bogenhausen, near Munich,
placed thermometers on the opposite sides of the pillars supporting the
levels, the bulbs touching the pavement and being covered with sand. In
one case the average difference of temperatures during the year amounted
to C°-48 C. {Arch, del Sc. 3">e per. vol. vi. p. 618.)

  material (to take an extreme case) to be entirely transferred
  to the north polar zone, and re-formed there as a sheet of ice
 of uniform thickness. Then, to cause such a displacement of
 the centre of gravity, the sheet melted from one zone and
 collected on the other would have to be more than 3800 feet
 in thickness. By such a transference of the material, the
 centre of gravity would indeed be still further displaced in
 consequence of the displacement of the ocean-waters*. But,
 attributing the greatest possible value to such a cause, it is
 evidently insufficient to produce a deviation of the vertical of
 •04 of a second, which is the smallest change of inclination
 perceptible in M. Plantamour's N.S. level.
    Non-Periodic Movements.—To the geologist, perhaps, the
 most interesting of the movements observed by M. Plantamour
 will be those which seem as yet to be non-periodic in their
 occurrence. It will be seen from fig. 1 that these movements
 are not confined to the winter of 1879-80. The last two
 columns of the Table, which give the coordinates of what may
 be called the centre of the year, show also that this centre
 undergoes a displacement greater than can be accounted for
 by mere differences of temperature from one year to another.
 The extraordinary movement of the second year is continued,
 though to a less extent, during the third year, and the centre
is again shifted from the fifth to the sixth and from the sixth
 to the seventh year. From the third to the eighth years
 inclusive the centre has moved constantly towards the north.
 It is not unlikely, of course, that these movements may be
 local or accidental in their origin, and independent of any
 secular or wide-spread action. But it is at least possible that
 they are due to great earth-movements : that they represent,
 for our finite time, the infinitesimal changes which culminate
in a great mountain-chain.
    To observe these movements with a greater chance of
success it would be advisable to separate them from the
strictly periodic movements caused by the annual and
diurnal changes of external temperature. The latter diminish
as the distance from the surface of the ground increases, and
must be insensible at a depth of about 60 or 70 feet. At this,
or a greate*, depth levels might be observed in a deserted or
unfrequented mine ; and they need not, for this purpose, be
read oftener than once a week. If this were done at two or
three places on either side of a recently-formed mountain-
chain, like the Apennines or Alps, the results could hardly
fail to throw light on some of the great problems in the theory
of terrestrial evolution.

A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. By E. Mascart and
      J. Joubeet. Translated by E. Atkinson, Ph.D., F.C.S.
        Vol. II. Methods of Measurement and Applications.
TT is hardly necessary to say that MM. Mascart and Joubert
¦*- have, in publishing this treatise, done a very great service to
Electrical Students. Those who are not acquainted with the work
will obtain a very good idea of its nature if they imagine that a
professor well acquainted with Clerk-Maxwell's work has here
tried to give to students equipped only with the usual knowledge
of the Differential and Integral Calculus, not only a clear under
standing of Maxwell, but a clear knowledge of what has been done
in developing the quantitative study of electricity since Maxwell's
time. This second volume is likely to be of very great use to expe
rimenters and electrical engineers. The treatment of the subject
is very complete ; indeed it strikes a person who reads steadily
through the book that there is somewhat too much detail ; but it
is very probable that when the same reader uses the book after
 wards as a book of reference, he may feel very thankful for the
elaborate working out of corrections which are of so much import
ance in the laboratory. We are not now speaking of such details
as the proof of the law of torsion in a cylindric wire (pages 55-6),
because such matter seems to us as unnecessary as the proof of one
of Euclid's propositions in such a book. Again, there are certain
refinements in correction which seem to us unnecessary ; for ex
ample, the length of one spire in the winding of a coil may usually
be taken as equal to the circumference of the axial cylinder without
the introduction of a correcting term. It is, however, quite pro
bable that other readers may not agree with us here ; whereas as
to the obvious great merits of the book, and even to such a merit
in the translation as the creation of an index (although the index
might be advantageously amplified), there can be no difference of
opinion.
   The work is divided into four parts :—I. Methods of Measure
ment, 165 pages. II. Electrical Measurements, 400 pages.
III. Magnetic Measurements, 111 pages. IV. Complement,
88 pages.
   We shall say a few words about Part I., for the purpose of
giving an idea of the general method of treatment adopted by the
authors and translator.
   Part I. begins with corrections for temperature in measuring
length; corrections for the air in weighing; and 13 pages are de
voted to a description of various methods of measuring angles and
their limits of accuracy, the methods described being all optical.
The second chapter is devoted to a study of vibrations ; vibrations
damped when the resistance is proportional to the velocity, and
also when it is proportional to the square of the velocity. This is
a chapter which will be found very useful in the laboratory ; and

                    Notices respecting New Books.                       201
the end part is particularly important in magnetic work ; although
we must confess that here, as in the rest of the book, if the trans
lation were less literal, and were slightly altered in places by the
introduction of English technical terms instead of the literal trans
lations of French terms, it would be more useful to students.
    The third chapter, on the Measurement of Couples, is rightly
very elaborate, but in our opinion the authors are a little weak in
regard to the properties of materials; they do not sufficiently
understand the importance of " Fatigue " in materials subjected to
strains. Jn § 712 they neglect the expansion of the vibrating
body. In § 713 they do not seem to be aware that, if silver wire
were drawn out very fine, its tenacity per square centimetre and
its coefficient of rigidity might be very greatly altered.
    Chapter iv. treats of the properties of Circular Currents. Twenty
pages are devoted to the magnetic moment of a cylindric coil and
the field at the middle of its axis, leading to well-known theorems
concerning the most suitable dimensions of the coil for a given
length of wire ; or to give greatest field when the source of the
current is given ; or the best radial section of coil of a galvano
 meter ; in these various cases the section of the wire may be
 constant or varying, in places (§ 734 for example) the temptation
 to pursue a mathematical investigation to the end, although the
 result may be of but little practical importance, has not been per
 haps sufficiently resisted. The twenty-four remaining pages of the
 chapter are devoted to finding useful expressions for the field at
 other points than the central one, and theso naturally lead to the
 expressions in chapter v. for the coefficients of induction of coils.
 The field at any point due to a circular current is obtained in a
 series involving the powers of the coordinates x and y of the point,
 and the series are integrated to obtain the field for a cylindrical
 coil ; it being shown that only certain terms of the series need be
 taken in particular cases, the Quadrature method and Maxwell's
 " mean-value " method being given for a long coil. The results
 are applied to find the action of the coil on a magnetic needle ; to
 show the value of Gaugain's method of placing the needle; the
 value of Helmholtz's arrangement of two parallel coils ; the three
 parallel coils ; the four parallel coils ; and also two parallel coils with
 currents in opposite directions. Knowing the field at a point,
 there is a general rule for finding the average field [the mean action
  it is called in this treatise] at points on any circular area whose
  plane is at right angles to the axis. Finding this average field in
  the case of an annular coil (like the winding on a Gramme ring)
  for portions of the cross section is evidently given by the authors
  as a mathematical exercise ; of course the results are of no prac
  tical importance.
     In chapter v., on coefficients of induction, the results of chap. iv.
  are at once applicable in any case where the size of the wire is
  negligible. But the method of expressing the coefficient of mutual
  induction of two spires near one another by elliptic integrals with
   Maxwell's useful table is also given, and its extension to coils with

 202                Notices respecting New Books.
 the same axis. The entirely different method of taking up the
 subjects of chapters iv. and v., namely by Spherical Harmonics, or
 rather by Zonal Harmonics only, is now entered upon, and we could
 have wished that the whole treatment of the subject had been on this
 method. We know of no mathematical subject, capable of being
 of great value to the practical electrician, which has received so
 little attention as this of Spherical Harmonics. We know of no
 publication, for example, of the general development in Spherical
 Harmonics of the magnetic potential due to a current flowing in a
cylindric coil such as these authors are considering ; and it is not
at all easy at first sight to obtain it. When it is obtained the
practical man will find it quite useless, as, near the end of the coil,
he will require to make his calculation from about twenty terms.
When some practical mathematician takes up this subject seriously,
he will approximately give the potential by means o2 a series of a
few terms only, and show the working electrician that the subject
 of Spherical Harmonics is not merely a beautiful mathematical
 conception, but that it can really be made of use ; and when that
 time arrives, men will have as definite notions concerning the
attractions of coils for one another, and the values of the coeffi
cients of self and mutual induction of coils as they have of resist
ance. At the present time few electricians would be surprised to
hear that their notions of the values of these magnitudes for par
ticular coils were 100 times too great or too little. Although,
 however, we might wish a fuller treatment of the sabjects of these
two chapters by Spherical Harmonics, readers will find that these
subjects are here entered into much more fully than in any other
treatise. The potential on the axis due to a current in a circular
spire ; the external potential of a long coil ; the mutual induction
of two long coils ; the potential of coils wound spherically ; mutual
induction of circular currents ; these are investigations taken up
by the Spherical Harmonic method. Maxwell's method of obtain
ing the Coefficient of Self-induction of a coil is carefully worked
out, and the chapter finishes with the study of some particular
cases. At the beginning of chapter v. we find taken up the case of
parallel currents when the size of the wires cannot be neglected.
    It would be quite easy from our notes to describe in the same
sort of way the rest of this volume, but readers will find that our
description of Part I. applies fairly well to the whole volume.
There is everywhere else the same careful development of details
which Maxwell and others have left somewhat obscure ; and it is
evident that, in assisting students so carefully as they have done,
the authors were engaged in a labour which delighted them.
    We are sorry to say that it will be necessary to make a number
of corrections of printers' errors in a second edition. These errors
put great difficulties in the way of students ; for it has to be borne
in mind that many of the letters in use by French mathematicians
are such as would not be used in English books, sc represeats an
angle, for example, where we should use 0 ; T is the time of only
half what we call a complete oscillation. A weight in grammes is

p instead of w. The radius of a wire is y, the specific gravity of a
metal is d. The letter p is also used for a number of layers of
wire. Instead of log. here I. is conveniently used, but I is also used
to indicate a length.
    After all, these do not delay the progress of the earnest student.
It is only when the printer uses I and I. indifferently for log., and
mingles his letters curiously in mathematical formulae, and leaves
out very important half-brackets, and perhaps in the same page
uses I to represent also a length, that the student has a right to
cjmplain, and it is only fair to say that the printers' errors in
this volume are much too numerous.
    We note that the authors are careful in almost every case to
give the names of the various scientific men whose work they make
use of. One noticeable exception is the name of Prof. Tait, in the
description of his beautiful geometrical treatment of the damping
of vibrations.
    Although we have said that the book will benefit by some revision,
 we think that Dr. Atkinson, in undertaking and carrying out this
translation, has done a very great service to, and will receive the
 thanks of, a very considerable number of electricians.

 THE following communications were read :—
        1. " Notes on two Traverses of tho Crystalline Bocks of the
 Alps." By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc, LL.D., F.E.S., F.G.S.
     These journeys were undertaken in the Bummer of 1887, in the
  company of the Bev. E. Hill, F.G.S., in order to ascertain whether
  the apparent stratigraphical succession among the gneisses and
  crystalline schists which the author had observed in the more cen
  tral region of the Alps, held good also in the Western and Eastern
  Alps. At the same time all circumstances which seemed to throw
  any light on the origin of the schists were carefully noted. The
  author examined the rocks along two lines of section :—(I) By
  the road of the Col du Lauturet from Grenoble to Briancon, and
 thence by the Mont Genevre and the Col de Sestrieres to Pinerolo,
  on the margin of the plain of Piedmont. (2) From Lienz, on the
  upper waters of the Drave, to Kitzbuhel ; besides examining other
  parts of the central range, east of the Brenner Pass. The specimens
  collected have subsequently been examined microscopically.
     The results of the author's investigation may be briefly sum
 marized as follows :—
     (1) While rocks of igneous origin occur at all horizons among the
  crystalline series of the Alps, these, as a rule, can be distinguished ;
  or, at any rate, even if the crystalline schists in some cases are

204                     Geological Society :—
only modified igneous rocks, these are associated with recognizable
igneous rocks of later date.
    (2) There are, speaking in general terms, three great rock-groups
in the Alps which simulate curiously, if they do not indicate strati-
graphical sequence. The lowest and oldest resembles the gneisses
of the Laurentian series ; the next, those rather " friable " gneisses
and schists called by Dr. Sterry Hunt the Montalban series ; the
third and uppermost is a great group of schists, generally rather
fine-grained, micaceous, chloritic, epidotic, calcareous and quartzose,
passing occasionally into crystalline limestones, and (more rarely)
into schistose quartzites.
    (3) The Pietra Verde group of Dr. Sterry Hunt, so far as the
author has been able to ascertain, consists mainly of modified
igneous rocks, of indeterminable date, and is at most only of local,
if, indeed, it be of any classificatory value.
    (4) Of the above three groups the uppermost has an immense
development in the Italian Alps and in the Tyrol, north and south
of the central range. It can, in fact, be traced, apparently at the
top of the crystalline succession, from one end of the Alpine chain
to the other.
    (5) The middle group is not seldom either imperfectly developed
or even wanting, appearing as if cut out by denudation. It was
not seen in the traverse of the Franco-Italian Alps, except perhaps
for a comparatively short distance on the oastern side, being pro
bably concealed by Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks on the western
side. It is not very completely developed in the Eastern Tyrol,
and seems to prevail especially in the Lepontine Alps, and on the
southern side of the watershed.
    (6) The lowest group is fairly well exposed, both in the French
Alps and in the Central Tyrol.
    (7) As a rulo, the schists of the uppermost group had a sedimen
tary origin. The schists and gneisses of the middle group very
probably, in part at least, had a similar origin. In regard to the
lowest group it is difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to
come to any conclusion.
    (8) The slates and other rocks of clastic origin in the Alps,
 whether of Mesozoic or of Pala?ozoic age, though somewhat modified
 by pressure, are totally distinct from the true schists above men
 tioned, and it is only under very exceptional circumstances, and in
very restricted areas, that there is the slightest difficulty in distin
guishing between them. The evidence of tho coarser fragmental
material in these Pateozoic and later rocks indicates that the gneisses
 and crystalline schists of the Alps are very much more ancient than
 even the oldest of them.
     (9) The remarks made by the author in his Presidential Address,
 1886, as to the existence of a " cleavage-foliation " due to pressure,
 and a " stratification-foliation " of earlier date, which seemingly is
 the result of an original bedding, and as to the importance of dis
 tinguishing these structures (generally not a difficult thing), have
 been most fully confirmed. He is convinced that many of the con

                     On Fulgurites from Monte Viso.                 205
tradictory statements and much of the confusion in regard to the
origin and significance of foliation are due to the failure to recognize
the distinctness of these two structures. In regard to them it may
be admitted that sometimes " extremes meet," and a crystalline
rock pulverized in situ, is very difficult to separate from a greatly
squeezed fine-grained sediment ; but he believes these difficulties
to be very local, probably only of a temporary character, and of
little value for inductive purposes.
    2. " On Fulgurites from Monte Viso." By Frank Eutley, Esq.,
F.G.8., Lecturer on Mineralogy in the Royal School of Mines.
    The specimens described in this paper were collected by Mr.
 James Eccles, F.G.8., close to tho summit of Monte Viso (12,680
 feet above sea- level). They are fragments of a glaucophane-epidote
 schist, in which garnet, sphene, and occasionally diallage are pre
 sent. Prof. Judd considers that the rock somewhat closely resembles
 the glaucophane schists and eclogites of the He de Groix.
    The fragments are bounded by joint-planes or surfaces of easy
 fission, which are incrusted with minute pellets and thin films of
 fulgurite-glass forming the walls of lightning tubes. The glass was
 examined under the microscope (great care being taken to insure
 perfect isolation of the glass from the rest of the rock), and found
 to be, as a rule, remarkably pure, but in places not only gas-bubbles
 but also globulites occur, and the latter occasionally form longulites,
 and more rarely margarites. Microliths also are observable in some
 of the sections. In one section a minute rounded grain of schist
 containing a fragment of a strongly depolarizing crystal, probably
 epidote, appears to have been taken up in tho glass.
     Where the glass comes in contact with the rock the latter appears
 to have undergone no alteration beyond the development of a very
 narrow band of opaque white matter, which the author gave reasons
 for supposing to be due, not to the action of the lightning, but to a
 pre-existent segregation of sphene.
     The occurrence of globulites, margarites, longulites, and micro
 liths in the glass would seem to indicate a less sudden cooling than
 is assumed to be usual in such cases ; for the glass presents no signs
 which would characterize a subsequent devitrification or secondary
 change, and the bodies just enumerated appear, unquestionably, to
 have been formed during the refrigeration of the fulgurite.
     3. " On the occurrence of a new form of Tachylyte in association
 with the Gabbro of Carrock Fell, in the Lake District." By T. T.
 Groom, Esq.
     In this paper the author described an ancient but well-preserved
 glassy rock of basic composition which he had found as a vein
 associated with the gabbro of Carrock Fell. The rock was described
 macroscopically and microscopically, and a complete chemical ana
 lysis was given. The chemical composition resembled that of the
 more acid basalts and the augite-andesites, and approached especialty
  closely to some continental basalts, analyses of which were added
  for comparison. Examined microscopically, the rock consisted of a

206             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
globulitic and crystallitic glass-basis of green colour, containing
spherules of quartz, sphcrulitic felspars, and an interesting series of
granules and granular aggregates of augite, which likowise frequently
assumed a spherulitic form. The rock was rendered microporphy-
ritic by tho sparing development of crystals (or skeleton-crystals) of
plagioclase felspar, augite and quartz. The optical characters of
each of the minerals were given. Owing to the mode of develop
ment and to the variety of its constituents, the rock possessed an
exceedingly complicated structure. The order of crystallization was
worked out, and it was pointed out that a second generation of each
of the important constituents had arisen. The second generation of
felspar was of a more acid type, and that of the quartz was devoid
of fluid vesicles, and had crystallized out after the rest of the rock
had solidified sufficiently to form cracks. Close physical and mi-
neralogical relations with the gabbro were indicated, and the author
had no doubt that the two were in actual connexion with one
another. The age was put down as probably Ordovician. A com
parison of the rock with other basic rocks showed that it had
affinities both with the glassy forms connected with the more
volcanic members, and with the variolites of Durance found asso
ciated with diabase. The relation with the latter rock was espe
cially marked, but important points of difference rendered a separa
tion of the two necessary, and for the new type of rock thus re
cognized the name Carrockite was suggested. This rock might bo
looked upon as a Quartz-Gabbro-Vitrophyre.

            ON THE EFFECT OF TWIST IN MAGNETIZATION.
                         BY MR. H. NAGAOKA.
       To the Editors of tin Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          Gentlemen,
 TN a private letter to me, dated November 11, 1888, Mr. Na-
 ¦*- gaoka describes his further researches into the effect of twist
 in magnetization. His special object is to study the effect of dif
 ferent ranges of twist (i. e. the maximum twist to which the cycle
 of twisting is carried).
    He finds that in iron the essential features of the curve of twist
 and magnetism remain unchanged irrespective of the intensities of
 either the magnetizing-field or the longitudinal stress. This con
 firms the results stated by Mr. Bottomley and myself in the latter
 part of our note. When the range of twist is increased beyond
  + 11° per centim. (a very large amount of twist), although the
 general form of the curve remains similar, the hysteresis produced
 by the cycle of twisting and untwisting becomes reversed ; that is
 to say, the untwisting part of the curve lies above the twisting
 part, instead of being below, as it is when the range of twist is
 moderate. In nickel the effect of range is more curious and in

  ON THE ALTERATION OF THE CONSTANT OF ELASTICITY OF
     METALS BY THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT. BY C. A. MEBIUS.
    From his investigations on the elasticity of metals, Wertheim
concluded that an electrical current, which traverses a metal wire,
diminishes the coefficient of elasticity. The determinations of
"Wertheim are not very trustworthy, and from recent experiments
Streintz has questioned the couclusions at which Wertheim arrived.
    Mebius has a^ain taken up the question and attempted to solve
it by experiments on flexure. The materials under investigation
 (two rods of steel and two of iron, two tubes of brass, one silver
 wire) were laid on two parallel horizontal knife-edges, and the
 centre was loaded. By means of a microscope with micrometer in
 the eyepiece, an index could be sighted. The author could not
observe any direct action of the current on the bending. From a
 discussion of the results of the observations, it follows that in four
 experiments, if there had been any alteration of the coefficient of
 elasticity, it would have amounted to less than 0'089, 0-015, 0-047,
 and 0-037 per cent, of its entire amount, and accordingly, in agree
 ment with Streintz, he assumes that the electrical current has no
 action on the elasticity.— (Efvers. afk. Vet.-Alcad. Forhandl. 1887,

     Two rectangular plates are cut at right angles to the axis so that
  their long sides are simultaneously at right angles to the optical
  and electrical axis. The plates are very thin, cut to a few hun
  dredths of a millimetre, and are then cemented to each other, so
   that the electrical axes in them are reversed. The two external
   faces are silvered, and freed from the silvering on a narrow edge.
   If the silver coatings are brought to a difference of potential, the
   plate curves, as can be seen at a glass index placed at the free end
   of the plate. At its end a small photographed micrometer is

      Mr. Dudgeon, of Cargen, Dumfries, who supplied me with an
interesting case of an upward discharge of lightning which occurred
in June last, and is described in my communication to you in
August, was attracted by one of the cases given in my paper of
December (p. 483), in which a girl at Geneva is described as being
literally wrapped in a sheet of electric fire. Mr. Dudgeon states
that a similar phenomenon occurred to a friend of his during a
severe thunderstorm, which burst over a large tract in the south
of Scotland on the 12th of August, 1884—the storm in which
Lord Lauderdale was killed when out shooting in Boxburghshire.
Mr. Dudgeon says: — " My friend Sir Alexander Jardine was out
on the moors on the same day. He felt the full effects of the storm
before the phenomenon I am about to describe took place. Both
he and his gamekeeper got quite wet from heavy rain, and the rain
ceased when the thunderstorm was felt most severely. As Sir
Alexander described it to me, he was enveloped in a sheet of light
which seemed to him like illuminated steam. He does not re
member noticing any pricking sensation, and on my asking him
what the feeling was, he said it was indescribable, but a more
uncomfortable and weird feeling he never experienced. The game
keeper, who was standing about ten yards from him, saw him
enveloped in the luminous cloud, and exclaimed when it cleared,
' Oh ! Sir Alexander, I never thought to see you again ! ' Sir
Alexander went home, having received a severe shock, which
brought on a violent headache. He went to bed, and felt the
effects for some time afterwards. Jardine Hall, near which the
occurrence took place, is about 12 miles N.E. from Dumfries."

XXV. On the Divergence ofElectromotive Forcesfrom Thermo-
   ckemical Data. By E. F. Herroun, Professor of Natural
   Philosophy in Queen's College, and Demonstrator in King's
    College, London*.
THE fact that with many voltaic cells the electromotive
       forces observed experimentally do not accord with
values calculated from the thermochemical equations repre
senting the reactions occurring within the cells, has been the
subject of remark by several investigators, including Favre,
Julius Thomsen, Braun, Helmholtz, Willard Gibbs, Wright
and Thompson, and others. But although, at the present
time, we are in possession of a knowledge of the actual and
computed values of the electromotive forces of a large number
of voltaic cells, anything approaching a complete explanation
of the reason why certain cells should give electromotive
forces in excess, others in defect, others again according
almost exactly with the calculable values, is still wanting.
   It was in the hope of deciding certain questions and of
going some way on the road to a final solution of the problem
that the present research was undertaken.
   Certain cells, like the ' Grove ' or ' Bunsen/ in which nitric
acid is reduced by the evolved hydrogen, are said to furnish,
with nitric acid of certain degrees of concentration, electro
motive forces somewhat in excess of the values calculated
from the thermal effects accompanying the chemical changes ;

210          Prof. E. F. SerroUn on the Divergence of
but the effect of solution of the oxides of nitrogen or their
evolution as gas, together with other effects of dilution of the
acid, complicate the subject from the theoretical standpoint,
and their non-reversibility renders them unsuited for ex
periment. Cells of the Daniell type are therefore greatly
to be preferred, both for theoretical consideration and direct
experiment.
    Thanks to the careful and accurate data furnished by the
published researches of Dr. C. R. A. Wright and Mr. C.
Thompson, and their clearly tabulated results*, one can see
at a glance whether the electromotive force furnished by
two metals immersed in solutions of their corresponding salts
accords with, exceeds, or falls below the value calculated
from thermochemical data, and the exact amount of the
discrepancy.
    The explanations which might be given of the cause of the
departure of observed E.M.F.s from the calculated values in
different cells may be classified under the following heads :—
    1. Certain cells in which the anticipated chemical change
does not occur, but some other, different, reaction which
 evolves heat, to an extent which would account for the
 observed E.M.F. This is brought about by the special
 behaviour of a metal surface, and probably depends upon—
    2. The coating of a metal surface by films of oxide or
 subsalts either more or less readily reduced than the normal
 salt of that metal.
    3. The effect of dissolved gases, notably oxygen, in the
 solutions of the metallic salts.
    4. The hydration or solution of the salts formed in some
 cases, but not in all, supplementing or diminishing the E.M.F.
 due to the reaction of the solid salts.
    5. The evolution or absorption of sensible heat in tho
 cell, and the loss or gain in electric energy, corresponding
 thereto.
     In illustration of case 1 may be mentioned a cell consisting
  of aluminium in aluminic sulphate opposed to zinc in zinc
  sulphate, in which the thermochemical data would indicate
  that aluminium would be the metal attacked, giving, when
 opposed to zinc, an E.M.F. of about 1 volt ; whereas, in
  practice, zinc is the metal which is attacked, and the cell
 furnishes an E.M.F. of about "53 volt. But we know that
 the chemical reaction Al2(S04)3 + Zn3 = 3(ZnS04)+Al2 does

 not occur, so that the aluminium plate merely acts as an im
 perfect substitute for an entirely non-attackable substance
 snch as platinum or carbon, and having hydrogen, not alumi
nium, deposited on its surface.
   That this is the case, and that the reason is probably to be
 found in the superficial coating of the aluminium plate by an
oxide or suboxide, has been already put forward and received
experimental verification by Dr. A. P. Laurie*, who has in
vestigated the effect of amalgamating the aluminium, which
better enables it to come in actual contact with the liquid and
causes the E.M.F. of the call to actually reverse in direction.
   The heat developed by the oxidation or conversion into
sulphate of the zinc with the liberation of hydrogen would
be more than sufficient to account for the observed electro
motive force ; hence if it be desired to trace any connexion
between the absorption or evolution of heat and the anomalous
E.M.F. of any cell, it is the actual chemical change that does
occur which must be made the basis of the calculation.
Further, the term " Thermovoltaic Constant " (employed by
Messrs. Wright and Thompson to denote the extent of de
parture of the E.M.F. of a cell from thermochemical data;
zinc being taken as the standard from which the voltage is
reckoned) in cases such as aluminium can merely express the
fact that a plate of aluminium in its compact form, and
probably covered by its protecting film of oxide, is less actively
attacked than it ought to be from theoretical consideration
of the heat of formation of its salts ; but it must not be
accepted as denoting any occult power of transforming elec
tric energy into heat or vice versd.
   From purely a priori considerations one would expect that
metals like aluminium and magnesium, which in the amalga
mated or finely divided condition readily decompose water,
would, in the compact form, become covered superficially
with oxide and behave to a greater or less extent as a
hydrogen plate. It is therefore largely to this cause that one
would look for an explanation of the large + values assigned
to the " thermovoltaic constants " of aluminium, magnesium,
and possibly iron. The observation by Wright and Thomp
son, that the substitution of dilute sulphuric acid for ferrous
sulphate as the liquid surrounding the iron plate of an iron-
copper cell uniformly tends to lower the E.M.F., which effect
they refer to " local action," distinctly supports the view that
even with iron there is a tendency to decompose water and
coat itself with hydrogen, and thus acquire a higher relative
potential.

212          Prof. E. F. Herroun on the Divergence of
   A further consideration of case 2 will be met with later in
this paper. T will merely mention that a considerable
difference in E.M.F. due to the superficial coating of a
copper plate with suboxide has been already noticed in the
use of standard Daniell cells by Dr. J. A. Fleming * and
myself t, and that what is rare and comparatively unimpor
tant in the case of copper may become the rule and of greater
importance in some other combinations.
   In case 3 the nature of the effects of dissolved oxygen in
oxidizing a metallic surface or in removing traces of electro
lytic hydrogen and its depolarizing effect in the latter case
are too obvious to need much comment ; only I would draw
attention to the fact that by its action the electromotive force
on open circuit, as measured by an electrometer, or with a
balance of difference of potential, as in Latimer Clark's
method, or even when measured by a galvanometer of many
thousand ohms resistance, is liable to be in excess of that due
to the supposed chemical reaction, and therefore to give
false ideas as to the energy-producing power of the cell.
    Case 4 has been suggested as a very probable source of
divergence, since (1) in cells in which a very sparingly
soluble salt is employed, the solution, especially in the vicinity
of the electrode, may become saturated, and if any more salt
be formed it will necessarily be produced in the solid form,
which may, or may not, be dissolved in the rest of the liquid ;
 (2) it is difficult to see how the tendency of a salt to combine
molecularly with water to form a hydrate or to dissolve as a
solution, can directly affect the combination of the metal with
the acid radical to form that salt, and therefore we may be
justified in concluding that both the total heat evolved and
the E.M.F. of a cell are due to the algebraic sum of effects
 of events which take place successively. But since the water
in different solutions is differently combined or related with
the anhydrous salt, it appears possible that the energy which
in some cases is transformable into electric energy, or, to use
 Helmholtz's suggestive names, is " free," in other cases may
be simply " bound energy."
    The main interest of the question, however, centres in case 5,
 since many physicists seem to have tacitly assumed that the
 explanation of the divergence of actual E.M.F.s from the
 computed values is simply that with cells giving a deficiency
 of electromotive force a portion of the chemical energy
 appears as heat in the cell, while cells giving an excessive

electromotive force are spoken of as doing so " at the expense
of sensible heat/5 , They have not, however, given any reason
for such differences of action, and they do not appear to have
considered all the consequences which the adoption of the
latter part of this view would entail.
    Helmholtz, in his papers " Zur Thermodynamik che-
mischer Vorgiinge," * suggests the treatment of a voltaic
cell as a reversible thermodynamical process, and that the
nature of its working may be detected by the difference of
E.M.F. brought about by change of temperature. The cell
selected for examination is his zinc-mercurous chloride
battery, the E.M.F. of which is very slightly increased by
rise of temperature ; and the chief discussion is the relation
of the vapour-tension of the zinc-chlorido solution, the " free
energy of the salts," and the electromotive force dependent
on differences of concentration.
    But that part of his conclusion in which he states that
" the electromotiveforce between the metals increases with heating,
i. e. the calomel battery belongs, as 1 have already mentioned, to
(lie batteries which fix heat, which in part work at the expense of
the thermometric /teat of surrounding bodies," is based either
purely on thermochemical data or without due consideration
of what the adoption of that view would entail in the case of
the strictly comparable zinc-mercurous sulphate cell of
Latimer Clark, which decreases in E.M.F. by a considerable
proportion as its temperature is raised, although this also is
a cell giving an E.M.F. in excess of the supposed thermo
chemical effect.
    Now viewing a cell as a strictly reversible thermic engine,
if a portion of its E.M.F. be due to the absorption of sensible
heat, then, when worked backwards, an exactly equivalent
amount of heat would be evolved in the cell. Therefore,
taking two Latimer Clark cells, joined by their like poles,
one at a high, the other at a low relative temperature, the one
at the low temperature having the higher E.M.F. will send
a current against the E.M.F. of the one at the higher
temperature.
    But the current through the cold one will be direct, while
that through the warm one will be inverse, so that heat will be
absorbed in the cell at low temperature and evolved in the
 cell at high temperature ; and since for unit quantity of
 electricity flowing the same amount of chemical work will be
performed in each cell, but reversed in one, we should have an
 instance of a thermodynamical arrangement working by means

of a difference of temperature, the effect of which would be
to cool the cold cell and heat the hot one ; or heat would be
transferred from the cold to the hot body, and be made
capable of performing mechanical work, instead of requiring
its expenditure. It does not appear to me that this could bo
adequately explained by the different heats of dilution of the
salt at different temperatures, so that the result of believing
that a Latimer Clark cell works partly " at the expense of
sensible heat " is a direct contradiction of the principle of
the second law of thermodynamics, as this would require
that its E.M.F. should rise with rise of temperature. That
it is the postulate with regard to mercury cells, aud not the
second law, which is fallacious, I hope to show later in this
paper.
   If two plates of zinc, one amalgamated and the other plain,
be immersed in a solution of zinc sulphate, on completing
the external circuit a current is found to flow from the
amalgamated to the non-amalgamated plate through the cell ;
but Prof. J. Willard Gibbs in his paper " On the Equilibrium
of Heterogeneous Substances,"* remarks that such a current
could not have the effect of dissolving zinc from the amalga
mated plate and depositing it on the non-amalgamated plate,
as this deposited zinc might be immediately redissolved in
mercury to form an amalgam with merely the absorption of
sensible heat.
   By the use of pure zinc foil in solutions of zinc sulphate,
free from oxygen, I have found that the difference of poten
tial between amalgamated and plain zinc becomes exceedingly
small ; and in the case of a cell freely exposed to air the
current on a circuit of only 15 ohm's resistance did not
deposit any weighable quantity of zinc on the plain zinc
electrode after passing for seven days. This, therefore, is in
confirmation of the theoretical conclusion from the second
law put forward by Willard Gibbs, and renders it more im
perative to stringently examine any reputed case of the pro
duction of electrical energy at the expense of thermometries
heat.
   It therefore became important to examine on an experi
mental basis the theory that reversible heat effects are associated
with cells giving anomalous electromotive forces.
                               Method.
   The method usually adopted may be briefly described as
follows :—The experimental cell was constructed of a thin

  glass beaker as the outer vessel, containing one of the metal
  electrodes in a solution of one of its salts, and a porous
  earthenware cell, which contained the other metal in a solu
 tion of its corresponding salt. Cells of the Raoult form
 could not be employed on account of their inconvenience for
 thermal measurements and their necessarily high internal
 resistance. Attempts to reduce resistance by substituting
 animal membrane, parchment-paper &c. for the porous cell
 were abandoned owing to the facility with which they allowed
 small but significant quantities of the solutions to mingle by
 diffusion, and so permit the deposition of one metal on the
 more electropositive one, generating local heat and altering
 the electrical constants. The cell was supported by the rim
 of the beaker resting on a cork edge which was fitted into the
 top of a tin cylinder, the latter being itself suspended within
 a larger cylinder of bright tin. With this apparatus, when
 containing the usual working quantities of solutions, the rate
 of loss of heat was equal to yj0- of a gram-degree Centi
 grade for each minute-degree above the surrounding air
 temperature, for the few degrees of the experimental range.
    Thermometers graduated to fractions of a degree were
 inserted, one in the inner porous cell and another in the outer
 cell; and in cases in which a slight inequality of heating
 at the two electrodes occurred, a mean of the rise of tempera
 ture of the two thermometers was taken as best expressing
 the net heat-evolution.
    The external battery, used for sending currents against the
E.M.F. of the experimental cell, consisted of either a Daniell
 cell or a form of constant bichromate battery, in accordance
with the E.M.F. of the experimental cell to be overcome.
The current was measured by a calibrated galvanometer,
which gave a deflexion of 47 *5 with yo of an ampere, and
was regulated by the introduction of the necessary resistance.
    It was first proved in the case of a cell, cadmium-copper
sulphate, which gives an E.M.F. almost exactly in accordance
with its calculated value, that the heat which is generated by
a current passing through the cell depends only upon its
resistance, and is independent of the direction in which that
current passes.
    This being so, if the permanent experimental value of the
E.M.F. of any cell differs by e volts from its calculated
value (E— Ei=           an amount of heat equal to -j ought to
be evolved or absorbed when a current of strength c passes
for t seconds through the cell.

216          Prof. E. F. Herroun on the Divergence of
    Thus if the cell be one giving an excess, or E— E»= +e,
there should be an absorption of heat when the cell is worked
forwards and an evolution when worked backwards against
the E.M.F. of the cell. Exactly the reverse would hold
with cells giving a deficit from the theoretical value.
    Since the heat due to resistance will be evolved in both
cases, we have for the net heat evolved
                         tt c* r t + e c t
                         H=        j       ;
and where the value of e c t is negative we have a negative
total if it exceed the value of <?rt.
    In order therefore that the absorption of heat may be a
 maximum, with cells giving an excess of E.M.F. when
 worked forwards, or with cells giving a deficiency when
 worked backwards, the current-strength must be adjusted in
 accordance with the determined value of the internal re
 sistance of the particular cell.

 as the current-strength giving the greatest absorption of heat
  n the case of a cell in which the computed and observed
 E.M.F.s differ by e volts and internal resistance is r ohms.
     It is thus a matter of importance to determine the internal
 resistance, not only in order to be able to calculate the heat
 generated against it, but also to calculate the best current-
 strength for observing the effects. In many cells, however,
 the resistance is so unavoidably high that c would be too
 small for any thermal changes to be detected ; and in other
 cases the current has to be increased above the best theoretical
 to a best practical strength, time being an important factor in
 such delicate thermal measurement.
     It was found experimentally that the resistance in many
  cells is subject to considerable and, in some cases, enormous
 variations when currents are passing through the cell, being
 partly dependent upon the direction of the current. This

work, for if the resistance change with change of direction of
the current, the difference of heating-effects might be due,
at least in certain cases, to such change rather than to the
value of E— EA.
   This difficulty was endeavoured to be met by using a high
resistance galvanometer on a circuit of several thousand ohms
as a measurer of the difference of potential between the poles
of the experimental cell, when on open circuit and when
direct or inverse currents are passing through it.
   Taking E as the E.M.F. of the external battery and R its
resistance, and Ey the E.M.F. of the experimental cell, and
r; its resistance, and letting ru denote the total external re
sistance, including that of the current-galvanometer, we get
for the difference of potentials between the poles of the
experimental cell :
            V= ^/ffi rii)—^ r' with diroct currents,
                      K + ri + r«
and
            „V,= —                   ....inverse currents.
                   E,(R + r,.)+Er,Lwith
              '        R + r, + rtl
    Since, however, the value of E( (or indeed E) is subject to
possible variation due to polarization, the above method fails
to distinguish between change of difference of potential due
to change of resistance and that due to polarization ; and
 although the latter, if present, may be usually detected by
 suddenly interrupting the current and noting the value of E/}
 the difficulty still remains to some extent and is liable to
 vitiate the results.
    From the causes just indicated it will be readily seen that
 extremely few cells are suited for thermal experiments when
 currents of moderate strength have to be sent through them
 in alternate directions. Consequently a large number of
 voltaic combinations were tried and abandoned as unsatis
 factory, for some of the following reasons :—Certain cells are
 found to give marked variation in their internal resistance
 with different direction of current, commonly owing to tha
 sparing solubility of at least one of the salts formed and the
 consequent coating of one or both plates with insoluble and
 badly conducting films (ex.gr. cells involving the sulphate,
 chloride, or bromide of lead, mercury, or silver, threo typi
 cally exceptional metals). In other cases cells are rendered
 useless by the imperfect reversibility of the chemical change ;
 as in cases in which it is attempted to deposit a metal which
 can replace hydrogen from water at all readily (ex. gr. mag

 218         Prof. E. F. Herroun on the Divergence of
 nesium, a^minium, zinc, and iron), hydrogen is liable, in some
 cases certain, to be liberated in place of the equivalent of
 metal. In other cells, such as lead or silver in contact with
 their sulphates or free sulphuric acid, on making either of
 those metals the anode in the cell, a peroxide (Pb02 or AgO)
 is apt to form in spots on the surface of the metal plate and
 entirely alter both the E.M.F. and resistance of the cell,
 besides obviously altering the chemical work of electrolysis.
    The desiderata in a cell intended for this work—namely
 tolerable freedom from polarization, perfect reversibility, low
 and constant internal resistance—are only even approximately
 fulfilled by a very few of a large number of cells examined
 by me, and therefore the experimental results are greatly
 restricted.
                             Mercury.
    After dismissing aluminium and magnesium as being un
suitable, for reasons already stated, the metal which has the
next highest " thennovoltaic constant " positive in sign is
 mercury, and being the metal which is replaced by most-
 other metals, as copper, zinc, &c, it yields electromotive
 forces considerably in excess of the values deduced from the
heat of formation of its salts. The insolubility and sparing
solubility of the mercurous chloride, bromide, and sulphate,
and the inadmissibility of mercuric salts, owing to their
reduction in contact with metallic mercury, rendered it
necessary to employ mercurous nitrate, and, accordingby,
a copper-mercury nitrate cell was prepared, in which each
metal was in a strong solution of its own nitrate, with a
small proportion of free nitric acid, which is necessary to
keep the mercurous salt in solution by preventing the forma
tion of basic salts, and also diminishes the internal resistance.
I found this cell gave an E.M.F. of '43 volt, while from the
thermochemical numbers of Julius Thomsen, viz.
  [Cu, 0,NaOsAq]= 52410 and [Hg„ 0,N206Aq] = 47990,
one would deduce an electromotive force of only "095 volt.
    (Wright and Thompson, adopting the older standards of
measurement, give '433 volt for the experimental and "097
volt for the calculated value.)
   When a current of '2 ampere was passed in alternate
directions through the cell, it was found that if the current
was not continued for too long a period in one direction the
resistance was moderately constant, though by the prolonged
action of the current the solution became either nearly
deprived of mercury, or saturated with mercurous nitrate in

the layers near the metallic mercury, depositing crystalline
nitrato on it and greatly increasing the resistance. But by
allowing the current to pass for not more than 10 to 20 minutes
in one direction this was avoided, and the rise of temperature
which was observed corresponded very nearly with the heat
due to c?rt, and was independent of the direction in which
the current passed ; showing therefore no absorption of heat
with direct currents, as might be anticipated from its large
excess of E.M.F., viz. "335 volt.
    This result was so plainly at variance with what was to be
expected, that a solution of mercurous nitrate was electrolysed,
using a platinum anode ; but in this caso also there was no
indication of more chemical work being performed by the
current than supplied by it, i. e. no absorption of heat was
detected, but an evolution corresponding closely with the
                                             c2r t
amount calculated from the values of —j—. Hence the re
sult of these experiments clearly pointed to the conclusion
that mercury, if it be anomalous in its E.M.F., is not so on
account of any transformation of sensible heat into electric
energy ; and I was therefore led to examine the thermo
chemical data of mercury upon which the calculated E.M.F.s
have been founded.
                 Tliermochemical Data of Mercury.
    In the first place Julius Thomsen* appears to be the only
 experimentalist who has made determinations of the heats
 of formation of mercury salts, and since he depends upon
the heat of formation of mercurous nitrate for the ther
 mal values of almost all the other salts, if that were in error
 all the values derived from it would evidently be equally
inaccurate. But the method he employed for the determina
 tion of the heat of [Hg2, 0, Ns06 Aq] does not appear to me
 entirely free from objection. He determined it by reducing
 the mercury from a solution of its nitrate by sulphur dioxide,
 and determined the heat of neutralization of [HgjO,2HN03Aq]
 by decomposing the nitrate with sodic hydrate ; finding, as
 above stated, 479i)0 calories for the heat of formation of the
 nitrate in aqueous solution. Since, however, mercurous
 nitrate requires the presence of free nitric acid to maintain
 it in solution, he used a solution containing free nitric acid to
  an extent variously stated as 1*079 and 3*079 HN03 per
  molecule of Hg2 (N08)2 ; as the latter number is mentioned
  twice, probably the former is a misprint. But the exact

220         Prof. E. F. Herroun on the Divergence of
reaction which occurs between mercurous nitrate, free nitric
acid, and S02 one may reasonably expect to be less simple
than that required for exact thermal measurement.
   I have accordingly determined the heat of formation of
mercurous nitrate in acid solution, by decomposing it with
zinc amalgam, yielding zinc nitrate and metallic mercury ;
the results obtained are subjoined.

   Since Thomsen finds 102 510 for [Zn, O, N206 Aq], the
heat of formation of
    [Hg„ O, N2OsAq] = 102,510-77,485 = 25,025 calories.
   If this be approximately true, it follows that the values
given by Thomsen for the heats of formation of the chloride,
bromide, and iodide of mercury must be greatly in excess of
the true value. The heat of formation of [Hg2, Cl2] is given
by him as 82,550, taking 47,990 as the value for the nitrate.
But it is well known that calomel is reduced to metallic
mercury by an acid solution of stannous chloride, although
the heat evolved in the conversion of SnCl2Aq into SnC'l4Aq
is only 76,030. Hence splitting up Hg2Cl2 with the forma
tion of stannic from stannous chloride would give, according
to Thomsen, the following thermal equation :—
                  [SnCl2, Cl2,Aq]-[Hg2,Cls]
                       76,030        - 82,550 =-6520,
so that this reaction would be markedly endothermic and
could not well occur at ordinary temperatures.
   The matter, however, was put to experimental test, and it
was found that although the reaction was slow, requiring
about three hours for its completion at a temperature of
about 15° C, still heat was continuously evolved, and, after
calculating for loss of heat, gave the following values :—

Giving 76,030 — 10,775 = 65,255 calories as the heat of forma
tion of Hg2C]2.
   The electromotive forces calculated from these thermal

       Electromotive Force* from ThermocKemical Data.        221
data give for zinc-mercury nitrate cells E*= 1*673 volt, the
experimental value being 1*5 volt ; and for zinc-mercury
chloride cells E4= 1*028, the experimental value being 1*043
(Helmholtz), or from 1*123 to *988 (Wright and Thompson).
Hence it is evident that mercurj' ceils do not evolve electro
motive forces of about half a volt in excess of their calculated
values, the various statements to that effect being based on
inaccurate thermochemical data. On the contrary, it will be
noticed that the value of         for the nitrate cell is greater
than the experimental value E, which may be due to an error
in my determination of the heat of formation of mercurous
nitrate, but more probably to the same cause acting as in the
cases of lead and silver, both of which metals have negative
" thermovoltaic constants," and which greatly resemble mer
cury in many chemical characteristics.
                               Silver.
    The "thermovoltaic constants" for silver, given by Wright
and Thompson, vary from *395, in the case of the nitrate, to
*02, in the case of the iodide, but are all negative in sign. It
is noticeable that the larger values are attached to the
soluble salts, while the insoluble chloride, bromide, and iodide
have much smaller " constants," and these depend largely
on the nature of the liquid in which the haloid salt is sus
pended ; thus AgCI in solution of ZnCl2 has a thermovoltaic
 constant of *112 to *062 volt, while a copper-silver chloride
 cell in which the AgCI is suspended in CuCl2 solution has a
difference of only *001 volt from the computed value. The
 causes producing the large divergence in the case of the
nitrate or sulphate are, therefore, probably different in nature
 from those producing the small and very variable " con
 stants " (?) in the case of the chloride, bromide, or iodide.
    In order to test whether a cell consisting of silver in a
 solution of its nitrate, opposed to some other metal, gives rise
 to reversible heat-effects or not, a copper-silver nitrate cell
 was prepared and used in the manner previously described.
  It was found that when small currents (*1 to *2 amp.) were
  sent in alternate directions through the coll by means of
  another battery, apart from the heat due to the square of the
  current and the resistance, there was an evolution of heat
  when the cell was worked forwards, and an absorption of heat
  when worked backwards so as to dissolve silver and deposit
  copper.
     The following numbers, taken from one set of experiments,
  show the difference of heating with synergetic and opposed
  currents (E.H.F. of the cell *431 to *428 volt):—

   The thermal capacity of the cell was determined and found
to be equal to 68 grms. of water ; so that

                                J      *
   The mean resistance of the cell was found to be 1-4 ohm,
and taking e, the difference between E and E*, as "34 volt, we
get
           cll±= -04 x 1-4 x 1200" x -24= 16-1 grms.0 0.
and
           ecs- =-34 x -2 x 1200" x -24=19-58 grms.°C.
    Hence the sum of these amounts, 35'68 grms.0 C, and their
difference, — 3-48 grms.° C, represent the total amounts of heat
evolved with direct and with adverse currents respectively,
with which the experimental results of 31-69, and practically
0, accord within the limits of experimental error.
    Hence it results that a copper-silver nitrate cell gives an
electromotive force below the calculated value, and when it
sends a current a portion of the energy due to the replace
ment of silver by copper appears as heat in the cell, and its
equivalent in E.M.F. is therefore wanting. Consequently,
when the cell is worked backwards, a smaller amount of work
than that represented by the negative heat of substituting
 silver for copper is capable of producing the required electro
 lysis, the difference being supplied at the expense of sensible
heat.
    In view of the great difference in the heat of formation
of mercury salts found by me, and the previously recorded

        Electromotive Forces from Thermochemical Data.        223
values, I determined the heat of replacement of silver by
copper from a solution of AgN03, 200H2O. The amount of
silver was accurately determined both by titration of the
solution and by calculation from the weight of the dis
solved copper.
    The results of two exactly similar experiments gave
                        I. = 33,420 calories,
                       II. = 33,450 calories,
as the heat of replacement :—
             Cu + Ag2 (N03)2Aq= Cu(N03)2Aq + Ag2.
These numbers are slightly below those found by Thomson,
he giving 35,630 as a mean ; but they are sufficiently in
agreement to show that the actual E/M.F. furnished by a
copper-silver nitrate cell is considerably less than the calcu
lated value.
    It has been above remarked that the " thermovoltaic con
 stants " of silver vary greatly with the salt of the metal em
 ployed, the soluble salts having much larger constants than
 the insoluble, and the latter diminishing to an insignificant
 quantity in the case of the iodide, or of the chloride sus
 pended in cupric chloride. This would therefore show that
 it probably does not depend in any way upon the metal itself
 acting as a thermoelectric junction, but upon the nature of
 the chemical changes occurring in the cell.
     From these, and other considerations which are given later,
 I conclude that the thermovoltaic constant depends upon two
 prime causes. One, which operates with both soluble and in
 soluble salts of silver, is a tendency of that metal to form sub-
 salts, e.g. subchloride Ag2Cl, the heat of formation of the
 equivalent of which is greater than that of the normal salt, so
 that silver is more readily attacked superficially and .acquires
 a lower relative potential than would be predicted from the
 heat of formation of its normal salt.
     Wetzlar has shown that silver-leaf immersed in solutions
 of cupric or ferric chloride becomes converted into Ag2Cl, so
  that when a silver plate is immersed in cupric-chloride solu
  tion its surface rapidly becomes covered with a film of the
  subchloride of sufficient thickness to prevent the metallic
  silver producing its usual effect, and thus the thermovoltaic
  constant practically vanishes.
     The other cause of divergence is of much wider applica
  tion, and appears to me to depend upon the fact that with
  any salt, such as silver nitrate, which does not form a hydrate
   with water, but being soluble absorbs heat on dissolving,
  this heat can be supplied by the thermometric heat of sur

 224         Prof. E. F. Herroun on the Divergence of
  rounding bodies, and one would expect it to be "bound
  energy," and to be a reversible thermal effect independent of
  the effects due to the " free energy " of the chemical change.
     Since the heat of solution of silver nitrate is a large nega
 tive quantity, — 5440 or — 10,880 for Ag2(N03)s,Aq, the heat
 of formation of anhydrous AgNOs would be greater by that
 amount than that measured when using its solutions. This
 would give the heat of formation of
            [Agl, 0, N206] = 16,770 + 10,880=27,650,
 and thus give a calculated E.M.F. about "235 volt lower,
 still leaving a deficiency of about "105 volt to be accounted
 for by the tendency of silver to form a film of subsalt ; unless
 indeed the heat of formation of silver nitrate has been
 under-estimated, as the numbers g^ven above for the heat of
 replacement of silver by copper might indicate.
    These numbers, after allowance for the negative heat of
 solution of silver nitrate, would give a calculated electro
 motive force almost exactly in agreement with the experi
 mental value.
                                Lead.
    Lead, like silver, is a metal having a large negative " ther-
 movoltaic constant," which also varies with the salt of the
metal employed. Wright and Thompson give for the differ
ence of E and E* in the case of lead in saturated solutions
 of its chloride and bromide "222 and '235 volt, while for the
iodide only "002 volt. This difference, however, is readily
 explained on reference to the numbers selected by these authors
 in calculating the theoretical E.M.F., as, in the case of the
chloride and bromide, they employ the heats of formation of
the dissolved salts, while they use the heat of formation of
solid lead iodide. Inasmuch as they used saturated solutions
of the chloride and bromide, it is difficult to see why they
selected the values corresponding to the dissolved salts, since
any more salt formed must necessarily be produced in the
solid state, and the electromotive force would, consequently,
be determined by the heat of formation of the solid salts.
    Further, since there is no chemical attraction between
these compounds and water, and there is merely an absorp
tion of heat on solution, in accordance with the view stated
above (in regard to silver nitrate), the E.M.F. will depend
upon the heat of formation of the solid salt, even though the
solution be not saturated.
   The values calculated from the dissolved and anhydrous
salts and the experimental values are "ompared below :—

    The zinc-lead iodide cell being calculated from the heat of
formation of solid Pb I2 accords almost exactly with the
experimental value, the difference being only *002 volt.
    Similarly with a zinc-lead nitrate cell, while the E.M.F. cal
culated from the heat of dissolved lead nitrate is "737 volt, after
allowing for the large negative heat of solution, —7600, one
 gets for [Zn,0,NjA,Aq]-[Pb,0,N206], 102,510 -(68,070
 + 7600) =26,840, giving a calculated E.M.F. of -580 volt,
which agrees exactly with the experimental value "580 to
 •591 volt.
    A reference to the effect of concentration of the solutions
on the electromotive force of a zinc-lead nitrate cell confirms
my views. Wright and Thompson find that increasing the
solution strength from "25 to 2M"(N03)2, 100 H20 causes an
increase in the E.M.F. from '580 to "591, while they calculate
 that it should decrease from *759 to "716. Hence, instead of a
fall of *043 volt there is a rise of *011 volt, the cause of the
increase being in all probability due to the fact that the heat
of dilution of zinc nitrate is positive in strong but negative
in weak solutions; so that with moderately strong solutions the
 whole of the combining energy of zinc nitrate with water
may be converted into electric energy, while in weak solutions
a portion of that part of the energy of chemical change is
expended in the absorption of heat due to the greater dilution
 of the salt.
    It may be well to give here some collateral evidence in
support of this view. In the first place, if lead in chloride
solutions, either not saturated with or entirely free from lead
chloride, had a tendency to form Pb Cl2, represented by the
heat of formation of the dissolved salt, viz. 75,970 c, this
metal should be without action on a solution of stannous
chloride, the heat of formation of which in aqueous solution
is 81,140 calories ; but, as a matter of fact, a piece of pure
clean lead placed in an acid solution of stannous chloride
becomes immediately covered with a dull grey film, and after
a short time small brilliant crystals of deposited tin appear all
 over its surface. For the same reason a cell consisting of
 lead and tin plates, both immersed in either dilute hydrochloric
 acid, stannous chloride, or lead chloride solutions, furnishes a
 current the direction of which indicates that lead and not tin

226         Prof. Fj. P. Herroun on tlie Divergence of
is the metal attacked, the actual E.M.F being about '008 to
•012 volt. On the other hand, pure tin will not remove lead
from solutions of its nitrate or acetate or cold solutions of its
chloride, though if an acid solution of lead chloride be boiled
with tin, lead is deposited to a slight extent. Similarly the
above lead-tin cell, using an acid solution of stannous chloride,
will be found to diminish in E.M.P. as its temperature is
raised, so that between 50° and 60° 0. it possesses no E.M.F.,
while cibove that temperature the current flows in the reversed
direction, tin being the metal attacked. This explains why an
alloy of lead and tin, when treated with hot hydrochloric acid,
yields a solution of stannous chloride, leaving the lead un-
attacked. That the non-production of lead chloride cannot
be due to the prospective absorption of heat on dissolving
after its formation appears sufficiently evident ; and I think
this reversed action at the higher temperature is to be ex
plained by the heat of formation of the compound SnCl22H20
 being greater than that of even solid lead chloride (viz. 86,510
and 82,550 respectively) ; and although the former would be
 dissolved with a certain absorption of heat dependent on the
 strength of solution and the temperature, this amount would
 be less than the 5370 calories absorbed at low temperatures
 and in dilute solutions, and, further, being due to the merely
 physical process of solution, may at the high temperature be
 supplied largely at the expense of sensible heat, instead of being
 deducted from the energy of the chemical change.
    Nickel is a metal in the formation of the anhydrous
 chloride of which 74,530 calories are evolved, while in aqueous
 solution it furnishes 93,700 calories. If, therefore, the heat of
 formation of the dry salt plus the heat of hydration be
 regarded as measuring the total chemical energy and as
 occurring together, nickel should be able to replace tin or
 lead from their chloride solutions. But, as a matter of fact,
 instead of this being the case, pure electro-deposited tin is
 capable of completely displacing nickel from a solution of its
 chloride containing free hydrochloric acid, when allowed to
 remain in contact for a considerable time ; and on boiling the
 mixture of tin and deposited nickel in hydrochloric acid, tin
 and not nickel is dissolved. Nitric acid, however, rapidly
 attacks the nickel.
    This result is at once explained on reference to the heat of
 formation of anhydrous nickel chloride, which, as above stated,
 is given by Thomsen as 74,530, while the heat of formation
 of stannous chloride is 81,140 in aqueous solution, or 80,790
 if anhydrous. The heat which would on the whole be ab
 sorbed by this replacement in aqueous solution would doubt
 less be supplied by surrounding temperature.

         Electromotive Forces from Tliermochemical Data.      227
   These considerations, therefore, show that the heat of
formation of the anhydrous salt is the most important factor
in determining the chemical reaction, and suggest that the
kind of energy set free in the formation of a dry salt differs
from that due to the hydration of that salt, the latter being
only partly " free energy," while the negative heat of simple
solution may be supplied entirely by the " bound energy " of
the chemical change.
   A similar explanation will account for the fact that an
iron-cadmium chloride cell gives an E.M.F. opposite in
direction to that anticipated from the heats of formation
of their salts in solution, since Thomsen gives [Cd,(Jl2]
= 93,240, [Cd, CI,, Aq] = 96,250, and [Fe, C1J =82,050,
[Fe, Cls,Aq]= 99,950.
   Thus, taking the anhydrous salts we get a difference of
11,190 on the side of cadmium, while taking the dissolved
salts gives 3700 calories in favour of iron being attacked and
depositing cadmium, which is known not to occur. Thus the
first action in point of time—the formation of the anhydrous
salt—directs the course of the chemical change, which, how
ever, in the present case is not a replacement of iron by
cadmium, but if a current flow, hydrogen is evolved on the
iron plate ; so that this cell does not reverse the expected
reaction and furnish a current at the expense of sensible
heat, but, owing to the initial difference in the heats of forma
tion of the dry salts, an entirely different reaction is started
and continued.
    It is owing to the fact that iron is not deposited electro-
lytically from neutral or acid solutions of its salts that its
large positive constant was referred earlier in this paper to
a false reaction, though the above consideration shows at least
one cause for its anomalous behaviour.

    Measurements of the electromotive force of cells in which
 tin in a solution of its chloride is opposed to other metals
having shown * that it possesses an apparent negative " ther-
movoltaic constant," it was resolved to employ a cell in which
 tin is the metal attacked, and which should consequently give
 an E.M.F. in excess of the heat evolution due to the chemical
 change. Copper, which naturally suggests itself as the
 opposing metal, is, however, very unsatisfactory for thermal
 measurements when used in a solution of its chloride, owing

to the production of cuprous chloride on its surface, and
further, as Thomsen found for the heat of replacement of tin
by zinc from solution of its chloride numbers varying from
28,940 to 33,510 calories (a variation of 4570 calories, or
•098 volt), a determination of the previously unknown heat of
formation of stannous sulphate was made with the object of
using a tin-copper sulphate cell.
   A solution of copper sulphate, each cubic centimetre of
which contained "015875 grm. of copper, corresponding to
•45Cu SO4100H2O, and i containing free sulphuric acid to the
extent of 2 per cent., was treated in the calorimeter with
excess of pure granulated tin ; the copper was speedily de
posited, and the following heat measurements were made :—

                                Mean    . . 19,250      „
   As Thomsen finds for the heat of formation of copper sul
phate 55,960, this number added to 19,250 gives the heat of
formation of [Sn, O, S03Aq] = 75,210 c.
   In the above reaction there was no evolution of hydrogen
gas, even after the whole of the copper had been deposited,
and the conditions were as similar as possible to those ob
taining in the case of the same replacement in the voltaic cell.
But in the next experiment, which was conducted partly as a
control on the previous values, a small amount of hydrogen
was produced towards the end of the reaction. The solution
of stannous sulphate obtained in the previous reaction was
decomposed by placing in it strips of pure cadmium, and
the heat of the reaction Sn S04Aq + Cd = CdS04Aq + Sn was
accordingly measured, giving 15,210 c. as the result. Since
[Cd, O, S'Os Aq] =89,880, the difference 89,880-15,210
= 74,670 represents the heat of formation of [Sn, O, SOs Aq],
as measured in this way, and agrees fairly well with the
result obtained by the replacement of copper by tin, but is
slightly lower, probably owing to the above-mentioned slight
evolution of hydrogen, and therefore excess of the heat of
replacement of tin by cadmium.
   As a further check upon the general method I determined
the heat of replacement of copper by zinc, using the same
solution, viz. ^SCuSO* 100H2O, but, of course, free from
sulphuric acid, and found the heat of reaction to be 50,980 c,
the number calculated from Julius Thomsen's values being

        Electromotive Forces from Thermochemical Data.        229
 50,130 for solutions containing ^CuSO^lOOHjO, which
 numbers I considered to be in sufficiently close agreement.
    But adopting 19,250 c. as the heat of replacement of
 copper by tin we get a calculated E.M.F. of only *416 volt,
 while experiment shows an E.M.F. of "55 volt as a mean
 value ; thus showing that a tin-copper sulphate cell furnishes
 an E.M.F. of about '144 volt in excess of its computed value.
 Using this cell in a calorimeter, I found that with direct
 currents of *1 1 25 ampere passing through the cell there was
 an absorption of heat, and when worked backwards against
 the E.M.F. of the cell there was an evolution of heat apart
 from that due to the square of the current and the resistance.
 The internal resistance in one of these cells was reduced to
 only -9 ohm, so that the heat duo to it was very small.
    I conclude from these observations, and in consonance with
 the theory already stated, that stannous sulphate has a negative
 heat of dilution, which portion of its total energy, while
 appearing as negative in the calorimeter, is unable to reduce
 the electromotive force due to the " free energy " of the
 undiluted salt, the negative heat of dilution being supplied
 by fall of temperature. I have not been able to verify this
 conclusion experimentally, and the subject is complicated by
 the necessity of having free acid present in its solutions to
 prevent the formation of basic salts. The effect both of
 dilution and of the quantity of free acid present also greatly
 influence the E.M.F. of stannous chloride cells, and some
 points in regard to its action may be seen from the following
consideration.
   It is well known that if a strip of tin be placed vertically
in a vessel, containing at its lower part a strong solution of
stannous chloride (with free hydrochloric acid) and above it
water, at the line of junction of the liquids, where a dilute
solution of stannous chloride is formed by the intermixture,
metallic tin is deposited in brilliant crystals on the tin plate,
tin dissolving in the liquid below. This solution of a metal
in a concentrated solution of one of its salts and its deposition
from a dilute one is entirely contrary to what would be ex
pected, were it not for the fact that in the relatively strong
hydrochloric acid in the lower liquid there is a store of
potential chemical energy which may either evolve heat in
diffusion and dilution, or, by attacking the tin plate in contact
with it, furnish a current which, flowing through the liquid
and metal, has the effect of depositing an equivalent amount
of tin from the solution above, in which the hydrochloric acid,
being more dilute, has less tendency to dissolve the tin, a
considerable portion of its energy having already been ex
pended in the heat evolved during dilution.

230          Prof. E. F. Herroun on the Divergence of
    Hence in tin cells, while I recognize a negative " thermo-
voltaic constant" which is capable of producing reversible
thermal effects in the cell, I am inclined to refer them to two
causes : (a) a negative heat of dilution of the salts, and (#) to
effects of differences of concentration of the acid necessarily
employed to keep the salt in solution*.
                          General Conclusions.
   A review of the published measurements of the thermal
values of chemical reactions, in particular those directly re
lating to electromotive forces, namely, the replacement of one
metal by another from its dissolved salt, will, I think, show
that however valuable they may be as guides they cannot be
implicitly relied upon as furnishing absolute and unimpeach
able data by which to judge the truth or fallacy of a given
theoretical conclusion. In the first place, in the numbers
representing the heat of formation of the same body, deter
mined by different experimenters, there are frequently dis
crepancies of considerable magnitude. Thus Thomsen finds
for the heat of reaction of lead acetate and zinc 34,!'50 cal.,
Favre finding only 31,200 c, while Andrews gave 37,710c;
a total variation between the extremes of 6.510 calories. For
the heat of formation of CuO, and therefore of all salts
derived from it, Thomsen gives 37,160, Favre and Silber-
mann 43,770, and Andrews 38,300, while [Fe, Cl2, Aq] is
variously estimated by Thomsen at 9!),950, by Favre and
Silbennann at 106,700. and by Andrews at 102,060.
    Besides these experimental differences there is always the
fact that, as Berthclot has clearly laid down in his introduction
to his Essai de mecaniijue chimujue, the quantity of heat
evolved in a reaction measures the sum of the physical and
chemical changes which occur in the reaction ; some of which
quantities may be positive or negative, and which may or
may not directly influence the transformable energy of the
chemical change.
    Adopting the view of Helmholtz that a chemical process
gives rise to a total amount of energy, part of which is
freely transformable and part of which is " bound energy,"
while the calorimeter measures the total energy, the elec
tromotive force of a voltaic cell is a measure of the actu;d
transformation of free energy. In cases, therefore, in which
a portion of the total energy is to be reckoned as negative
   * In my previously published measurements of the E.M.F. of tin cells
the value given for the cadmium-tin sulphate cell was only '189 volt ; but
I have since found that, using more dilute and less acid solutions, a per
sistent value as high as '234 volt may be obtained.

        Electromotive Forces from Thermoehemical Data.       231
in respect to the main reaction, we see that such portion
may be supplied either at the expense of the free or of
the bound energy. If performed by the free energy,
obviously the amount of that energy which could appear in
other forms must be proportionately reduced ; while if per
formed at the expense of the bound energy, merely thermal
effects would follow, without affecting the course or amount
of the free-energy stream. It follows that in certain cases,
as for instance in the case of lead nitrate, or silver nitrate,
if the heat of solution is a large negative quantity, the free
energy, in my opinion, is greater than the total energy,
since the bound energy is negative in sign ; but, assuming
that this negative bound energy is not supplied at the
expense of the free energy, it can be readily made up by
thennometric heat. Hence, while thermal measurements
indicate 27,600-10,880 = 16,720 as the heat of forma
tion of silver nitrate in solution, the voltaic cell shows that
at least 27,600 thermal units must be regarded as trans
formable free energy, the 10,880 negative heat-units being
abstracted not from it, but from sensible heat. On the whole
there must be an increase of entropy, but there may be an
absorption of heat, as when a lead-copper nitrate cell sends a
current, or a copper-silver cell is worked backwards.
   The partial independence of thermal effects due to con
centration of solutions and electromotive forces, is recognized
by Helmholtz when he states in the case of a Latimer Clark
cell with saturated zinc-sulphate solution, that " the zinc sul
phate, newly formed by the current, can no longer be dis
solved, and its latent heat of solution is saved ; accordingly
there is a more powerful development of heat in the cell in spite
of the weaker electromotive force." His thooretical mathe
matical treatment disposes of many difficulties, but it did not
prevent him from the error of believing that mercury, when
deposited by zinc, even from its solid salts, gave rise to an
E.M.F. largely in excess of the thermal values, which, accord
ing to my view, would be quite impossible, as it would
amount to a conversion not merely of " bound energy " into
"free energy," but, under special circumstances of the
thermometric heat, into higher forms of energy with the pro
duction of mechanical effect.
    It might be thought that the whole of the heat liberated
in the formation of the fully hydrated salt was a measure of
the available energy, and that the negative heats of dilution
were supplied solely at the expense of sensible heat, but this
supposition is entirel)- negatived by the actual electromotive
 forces of several cells {ex. gr. zinc-cadmium bromide cell) ; so

that I conclude that since the hydration and solution of a
newly formed salt will, to a great extent, occur simultaneously,
the heat of hydration is partly absorbed in the process of
solution and dilution, and therefore to that extent cannot
 furnish electrical energy. On the other hand, when a salt is
 used which does not form hydrates, and consequently can
only absorb heat during solution, the energy due to the for
 mation of the solid salt determines the E.M.F., which cannot
be subsequently decreased by a process which has no chemical
continuity with it, but which merely absorbs sensible heat.
   As Helmholtz has already remarked, the exact reversibility
of these processes indicates the constancy of the partition of
" free " and " bound," or electrogenic and thermogenic energy,
and negatives the earlier supposition of Braun that the pro
portion of transformable energy was the accident of circum
stances.
    Helmholtz has further shown that, regarding the energy
and entropy of a system undergoing a restricted change as
represented by the differential coefficients of an integral
function of the system or substance, under the usual con
ditions the performance of external work takes place at the
expense of the "free energy," while loss of heat at the expense
of the " bound energy." But whether there subsists a definite
relation between the freely transformable and the bound
energy on the one hand, and on the other hand between that
portion of the energy set free by the process of hydration of
a salt which is convertible into electric energy, and that por
tion which runs down into heat, is a question which appears
to demand careful experimental as well as mathematical con
sideration ; especially with reference to the influence of tem
perature and various degrees of concentration of the salt.
   The fact that the E.M.F. of a cell, like zinc-cadmium
chloride, does not increase with greater dilution as rapidly as
it should from thermochemical considerations, may be taken
as indicating that the degradation of energy of the system
increases as the number of water-molecules in which the salt
is dissolved is augmented.
   I conclude, therefore, that :—
   I. The primary factor in determining the electromotive
force of a voltaic cell is the relative heat of formation of the
anhydrous salts of the two metals employed.
   II. That the E.M.F. may set up chemical changes of a
different direction and character from those predicable from
the heat of formation of the dissolved salts.
   III. That the E.M.F. set up by (I.) may be, and usually

      Effects of Contraction during the Cooling of Granite.  233
 is, supplemented by the energy, or a portion of the energy, due
 to the hydration or solution of the solid salts, and may have
 values which accord with the heat of formation of the dis
solved salts.
    IV. That in those cases in which there is no chemical
attraction, or a very feeble attraction between the water and
the salt, the negative heat of solution is derived from sensible
heat, and is not supplied by the free energy of the chemical
change. All cells in which such salts are employed opposed
to zinc should have negative " thermovoltaic constants/' and
evolve heat when they send a current forwards.
    V. That when metals, whose salts have purely negative
heats of solution, are opposed to metals whose salts they can
replace, the E.M.F. set up is in excess of the total thermal
change. Such cells, therefore, absorb sensible heat when
worked forwards.
    VI. That, taking the foregoing facts into consideration, no
cell exists which can furnish an E.M.F. in excess of the free
energy of the chemical change ; t. e. which can convert
sensible heat into electric energy working at uniform tem
perature. (Negatives the supposition concerning mercury
and other cells.)
    VII. That certain metals have a tendency to form films of
sub-salts on their surfaces, the formation of which giving
rise, as it does, to a different thermochemical reaction,
naturally furnishes an E.M.F. which does not correspond
with the values calculated from the heats of formation of
their normal salts. (Ex.gr. copper in cupric chloride, mer
cury in mercuric chloride, probably silver in most soluble
chlorides.)
    VIII. That the electromotive force of a voltaic cell fur
nishes a more accurate measurement of the " free energy,"
and therefore of true chemical affinity, than data derived
from calorimetric observations.
  XXVI. A Consideration of the Effects of Contraction during
    tlie Cooling of Intrusive Masses of Granite and the Cause of
    their Solid Continuity. By T. Mellard Reade, C.E.,
    F.G.S.,F.R.I.B.AS
NO doubt many geological observers have wondered, on
         looking at an intrusive granite-mass such as Cairnsmore
of Fleet in Kirkcudbrightshire, or that of Shap Fells in
                   • Communicated by the Author.

 234      Mr. T. M. Roade on the Effects of Contraction
Westmoreland, to find so little evidence of contraction. If,
as we have every reason to believe, the granite has once been
in a state of igneous fluidity, it would at first sight seem
reasonable to expect more evidences of contraction than what
are usually manifest. The late David Forbes was so much
6truck with this in Norway that he instituted a set of experi
ments to test the statement of Bischof that granite contracts
from 10 to 25 per cent, in volume in cooling. His results
in the casting of highly siliceous slags showed only a
contraction of from 0 014 to 0*028. Forbes did not attach
great weight to these experiments as accurate determinations
in consequence of the difficulty of getting a perfectly solid
casting, but considered that they proved Bischof to have much
overestimated the contraction of granite. Let us consider
what the process of contraction h, and in what way granite-
masses are likely to be affected by it.
   In casting ironwork it is usual to allow in the pattern A of
an inch per linear foot for the contraction of the iron = y|0 of
the whole length, or a contraction in vo'ume of ^0. This
is not, however, the contraction from a fluid state, for the
exterior cools first, and, at the time of solidification, is as large
as the pattern. The contraction of iron in passing from the
fluid to the solid state or in " freezing " is therefore not de
termined by this practice, and I am not aware of any reliable
determination of its amount ; indeed some have contended
that it expands in freezing, because cold iron will float in
molten iron.
   Be this as it may, I think we can get some hints of the
operations of nature from the processes of the ironfounder.
For instance, in casting a large sphere, say 2 feet in
diameter, it is necessary, to prevent the noneycombing of
the central part, to keep feeding tho ball as the metal cools.
It would seem that the outer skin takes the exact size and
form of the mould on solidification, and the metal cools and
congeals from the exterior to the centre. By keeping the
centre fed with new molten metal a sound casting is
insured. In the same way any one who has been in the
habit of making castings in lead is aware of the sudden
disappearance of the lead in the feeding-throat on congelation
taking place, so that unless a good plug be left a deep hole
will occur in the casting at the point where the metal has
been poured in. Both these phenomena point towards
sudden contraction on congelation.
   Let us now consider the case of a granite-mass. It is
extremely probable that in many cases these masses are more
or less like what Mr. Gilbert has called Laccolites or stone

       during the Cooling of Intrusive Masses of Granite.    235
cisterns*, and are, in fact, reservoirs fed from a throat below.
In other cases it may be possible that they are connected
with the central igneous magma of the earth in a larger way,
as tongues or protrusions of it. When this is the case it is
difficult to realize the enormous amount of heat-energy
brought up from below to be expended on the overlying
sediments in the way of mountain-building. Whether the
granite intrusion be fed by a throat, or whether it be a
tongue of molten matter, as it cools and congeals within
the bowels of the earth (which it must do at an extremely
slow rate) the uprising stream will introduce compensating
matter in the same manner as does the plug in casting.
The only difference will be that the one runs in by
gravitation, the other is forced up by pressure from below.
But while the matter is rising it is also eating into the
surrounding sediments and incorporating them into its own
body. And it is well here to remember that granite is of a
higher specific gravity than most sedimentary rocks, in the
proportion of about 2"90 to 2'30, or, in other words, a ton
of granite contains from 11'8 to 12-8 cubic feet, while u ton
of sandstone contains from 14'3 to 17"3 cubic feet. Therefore,
if we for the sake of illustration assume a sandstone to
consist of the same elements as a granite, it will, on incorpora
tion with the molten mass, actually decrease in volume. Of
course the amount of decrease would vary with the com
position of the sandstone. Again, if the surrounding rock
were marl it would decrease in a greater ratio.
   There are thus two forces at work—one the absorption of
the surrounding rock and its decrease in volume, the other
the introduction of new matter, the total effect tending
towards disruption by increasing bulk. This effect may be
seen in any good granite contact. There is generally a
laminated gneissic band between the granite and the enclos
ing rock, and often they are so welded together that junction
specimens showing both structures can bo taken and cut for
the microscope. It is not improbable that the fragments
of gneissic rock found in granite may be, so to speak, broken
off from the walls of the intrusion.
    Signs of lateral displacement of the surrounding rock
to a considerable extent are also sometimes seen. But what
is it that prevents the disruption and tissuring of the granite
by contraction after solidificat'on takes place ?
   I answer gravitation, for one thing ; for so long as the rock
will yield as a paste, the mass above, which in most cases is
supposed to have been very considerable, will keep it com-
                * Geology of the Henry Mountains.

 236        Mr. T. M. Reade on the Effects of Contraction
 pressed and in contact with the surrounding walls. When
 the granite has by cooling solidified sufficiently to be un
  affected in this way, other agencies come into play. I have
  shown * that variations of temperature of a small amount
 extending over a large area will produce an intermittent
 creep of the strata in one direction, so that the surrounding
  rock is continually being forced up against the granite.
     That considerable variations of temperature are con
 stantly taking place in regions of intrusion is tolerably
 certain, and that the heat of these intrusive masses is very
 slowly imparted to the encircling rocks is shown by the
 extremely slow cooling of some lava-streams that are only
 protected from the atmosphere by a thin covering ; whereas
 granite is often in enormous masses and deeply buried.
 Some of these masses must have taken thousands of years to
 cool. In addition to the lateral creep already spoken of, there
 is another force tending to compression in the gravitation of
 the surrounding and partially uplifted rock which naturally
tends to close up any shrinkage of the intrusive mass.
     It follows from this that granite-masses do not show
signs of shrinkage such as Forbes looked for, not because
 the material does not shrink but because, from one reason
 or another, it is kept throughout its history in a state of
 compression. When the contraction of the under-mass takes
 place on a large scale, then the granite may be sheared by
 normal faulting, as I have described in chap. viii. ' Origin of
 Mountain-Ranges,' like any other rock-mass.
    Granite intrusion may take place without creating much
disturbance, but when it occurs in large masses, such as in
the core of Mont Blanc and in other Alpine regions, from
the amount of new matter forced in from below, it must
become a very potent factor in producing lateral pressure.
The fan-structure which we see in such regions is in my
opinion produced by the gradual spreading out of the
probably semi-plastic matter by gravitation ; indeed it seems
impossible that it can be due to any other cause. This idea
is not a new one by any means ; the celebrated architect
Viollet lo Due has shown that expansion and intrusion of
the protogene in the core of Mont Blanc has caused the
folding back of the beds which it has forced apart t- The

treated of by Mr. W. Barlow in a paper read before the
Geological Society, which, although the author may claim
rather too much for his favourite force, shows in many ways
how, by simple gravitation, elevated masses of the earth
produce lateral pressure*.
   We thus see that while expansion-forces below the surface
of the earth produce both lateral compression, uplift, or
lateral creep, the effect of gravitation is to intensify the
lateral pressure and movement near the surface and to keep
the materials closely in contact during and after contraction.

ranges have found a difficulty in understanding how, if the
rise of the isogeotherms produces uplift by expansion, the fall
of the isogeotherms does not produce an equivalent sinking
by contraction and obliterate the range.
   The question is really fully answered in the book itself, in
which it is shown that the materials of a mountain-range
are by the effects of expansion, or a series of expansions,
moved towards and piled up into the range, and that they
cannot be drawn back and spread out in the areas from
which they have moved. Nothing, in fact, can remove them
save denudation.
   The effect of contraction is to produce normal faulting,
and this occurs most largely in the areas from which the
materials of the range have travelled. The mode of action
is really in one aspect very fairly shown in the experiments
on the expansion of metal plates, of which I have given many
illustrations. The total decrease of bulk of the section of the
earth's crust, out of which the mountain-range has been
elaborated, may eventually equal the previous increase which
has produced the range, but the form is entirely altered.
Subsidence may bring the sea back to the foot of the mountains,
or, carried further, may make islands of them ; but it cannot
obliterate them any more than the subsidence of the ground
on which a volcano stands can obliterate it.
   A mountain-range grows upwards by compression, a
volcano principally by accretion ; but they both indicate,
though in different ways, a redisposition of materials which
it takes denuding agencies geological ages to efface.

XXVII. A Comparison of the Electric Theory of Light and
    Sir William Thomson's Theory of a Quasi-labile ^Ether.
   By J. WlLLARD GlBBS*.
A REMARKABLE paper by Sir William Thomson, in
         the November number of the Philosophical Magazine,
has opened a new vista in the possibilities of the theory of an
elastic aether. Since the general theory of elasticity gives
three waves characterized by different directions of displace
ment for a single wave-plane, while the phenomena of optics
show but two, the first point in accommodating any theory to
observation is to get rid (absolutely or sensibly) of the third
wave. For this end it has been common to make the aother
incompressible, or, as it is sometimes expressed, to make the
velocity of the third wave infinite. The velocity of the wave
of compression becomes, in fact, infinite as the compressibility
vanishes. Of course it has not escaped the notice of physi
cists that we may also get rid of the third wave by making
its velocity zero, as may be done by giving certain values to
the constants which express the elastic properties of the
 medium ; but such values have appeared impossible, as invol
ving an unstable state of the medium. The condition of
 incompressibility, absolute or approximate, has therefore ap
 peared necessaryf. This question of instability has now,
 however, been subjected to a more searching examination,
 with the result that the instability does not really exist "pro
 vided we either suppose the medium to extend all through bound
 less space, or give it a fixed containing-vessel as its boundary."
 This renders possible a very simple theory of light, which has
 been shown to give Fresnel's laws for the intensities of
 reflected and refracted light and for double refraction, so far
 as concerns the phenomena which can be directly observed.
 The displacement in an seolotropic medium is in the same
 plane passing through the wave-normal, as was supposed by
 Fresnel ; but its position in that plane is different, being
perpendicular to the ray instead of to the wave-normal J.
   * From the American Journal of Science for February 1889.
    t It was under this impression that the paper entitled " A Comparison
 of the Elastic and the Electric Theories of Light with respect to the Law
 of Double Refraction and the Dispersion of Colours," in the June number
 of the Anier. Journ. Sci., was written. The conclusions of that paper,
 except so far as respects the dispersion of colours, will not applj to the
 new theory.

   Electric Theory of Light and of a Quasi-labile JEther.             239
    It is the object of this paper to compare this new theory
with the electric theory of light. In the limiting cases (that
is, when we regard the velocity of the missing wave in the
elastic theory as zero, and in the electric theory as infinite)
we shall find a remarkable correspondence between the two
theories ; the motions of monochromatic light within isotropic
or aeolotropic media of any degree of transparency or opacity,
and at the boundary between two such media, being repre
sented by equations absolutely identical, except that the
symbols which denote displacement in one theory denote force
in the other, and vice versa*. In order to exhibit this corre
spondence completely and clearly, it is necessary that the
fundamental principles of the two theories should be treated
with the same generality, and, so far as possible, by the same
method. The immediate consequences of the new theory will
therefore be deduced with the same generality and essentially
by the same method which has been used with reference to
the electric theory in a former volume of the American
Journal of Science (vol. xxv. p. 107).
    The elastic properties of the aether, according to the new
 theory, in its limiting case, may be very simply expressed by
means of a vector operator, for which we shall use Maxwell's
designation. The curl of a vector is defined to be another
vector so derived from the first that if u, v, w be the rectan
gular components of the first, and u', ?/, vJ those of its curl,
          f_ dw dv ^_ du dw ^ _ dv du
             dy      dz'         dz    da'           dx dy'
where x, y, z are rectangular coordinates. With this under
standing, if the displacement of the aether is represented by
the vector (£, the force exerted upon any element by the sur
rounding aether will be
                        — B curl curl (i dxdydz, . . . . (2)
where B is a scalar (the so-called rigidity of the aether) having
the same constant value throughout all space, whether pon
derable matter is present or not.
    Where there is no ponderable matter, this force must be
equated to the reaction of the inertia of the aether. This
 gives, with omission of the common factor dxdydz,
                      A(£=-B curl curl <£,                             (3)
 where A denotes the density of the aether.
   * In giving us a new interpretation of the equations of the electric
theory, the author of the new theory has in fact enriched the mathematical
theory of physics with something which may be compared to the cele
brated principle of duality in geometry.

240     Prof. J. W. Gibbs's Comparison of the Electric Tlieory
    The presence of ponderable matter disturbs the motions of
the aether, and renders them too complicated for us to follow
in detail. Nor is this necessary ; for the quantities which
occur in the equations of optics represent average values,
taken over spaces large enough to smooth out the irregu
larities due to the ponderable particles, although very small
as measured by a wave-length*. Now the general principles
of harmonic motion t show that, to maintain in any element
of volume the motion represented by
                               e=2Us*i                                    (4)
91 being a complex vector-constant, will require a force from
outside represented by a complex linear vector-function of (£;
that is, the three components of the force will be complex
linear functions of the three components of (£. We shall
represent this force by
                              Wikdxdydz,                                 (5)
where "9 represents a complex linear vector-functionf.
    If we now equate the force required to maintain the motion
in any element to that exerted upon the element by the sur
rounding aether, we have the equation
                         "^6= -curl curl g;                               (6)
which expresses the general law for tbe motion of monochro
matic light within any sensibly homogeneous medium, and
may be regarded as implicitly including the conditions rela
ting to the boundary of two such media, which are necessary
for determining the intensities of reflected and refracted
light.
    * This is in no respect different from what is always tacitly understood
in the theory of sound, where the displacements, velocities, and densities
considered are always such average values. But in the theory of light it
 is desirable to have the fact clearly in mind, on account of the two inter
 penetrating media (imponderable and ponderable), the laws of light not
 being in all respects the same as they would be for a single homogeneous
medium.
    t See Lord Rnyleigh's ' Theory of Sound,' vol. i. chapters iv., v.
    j It amounts essentially to tbe same thing, whether we regard the
 force as a linear vector-function of (5 or of (§, since these differ only by

and let the interface be perpendicular to the axis of Z. It is
 evident that if v! or d is discontinuous at the interface, the
value of u" or v" becomes in a sense infinite, i. e. curl curl (£,
and therefore, by (6),         will be infinite. Now both <g and
    are discontinuous at the interface, but infinite values for
       are not admissible. Therefore u' and d are continuous.
Again, if u or v is discontinuous, u' or d will become infinite,
and therefore u" or v1'. Therefore u and v are continuous.
These conditions may be expressed in the most general manner
by saying that the components of and curl (f parallel to the
interface are continuous. This gives four complex scalar con
ditions, or in all eight scalar conditions, for the motion at the
interface, which are sufficient to determine the amplitude and
phase of the two reflected and the two refracted rays in the
 most general case. It is easy, however, to deduce from these
four complex conditions two others, which are interesting and
sometimes convenient. It is evident from the definitions of
id and id' that, if u, v, v!, and v' are continuous at the inter
face, id and to" will also be continuous. Now — w" is equal
to the component of           normal to the interface. The fol
lowing quantities are therefore continuous at the interface :—

   To compare these results with those derived from the elec

chromatic light on the electrical hypothesis from a paper in a
former volume of Silliman's American Journal. This equa

 Pot denotes the operation by which, in the theory of gravi
 tation, the potential is calculated from the density of matter*.
 When it is applied, as here, to a vector, the three components
 of the result are to be calculated separately from the three
 components of the operand. — VQ is therefore the electro
 static force, and — Pot g the electrodynamic force. In
 establishing the equation, it was not assumed that the elec
 trical motions are solenoidal, or such as to satisfy the so-called
 " equation of continuity." We may now, however, make this
 assumption, since it is the extreme case of the electric theory
 which we are to compare with the extreme case of the elastic.
    It results from the definitions oi'curl and V that curl VQ = 0.
 We may therefore eliminate Q from equation (8) by taking
the curl. This gi res
                      — curl Pot g = 4tt curl $g                      (9)
 Since curl curl and ~- Pot are inverse operators for sole
noidal vectors, we may get rid of the symbol Pot by taking
the curl again. We thus get
                           — g = curl curing                         (10)
    The considerations for the motion at the boundar}' between
different media are easily obtained from the following consi
derations.       Pot g and Q are evidently continuous at the
interface. Therefore the components parallel to the interface
of VQ, and, by (8), of 4>g, will be continuous. Again,
curl Pot g is continuous at the interface, as appears from the
consideration that curl Pot g is the magnetic force due to the
electrical motions g. Therefore, by (9), curl <£>g is con-

William Thomson (with a happy economy of symbols) at the last meeting
of the British Association to express the same law of electrodynamic

of § normal to the interface shall be continuous.
   The following quantities are therefore continuous at the
interface :—
   the components parallel to the interface of
   the component normal to the interface of         %,
   all components of                              curl Q>%.
Of these conditions, the two relating to the normal compo
nents of % and curl 4>g are easily shown to result from the
other four conditions, as in the analogous case in the elastic
theory.
   If we now compare in the two theories the differential
equations of the motion of monochromatic light, for the in
terior of a sensibly homogeneous medium, (6) and (10), and
the special conditions for the boundary between two such
media as represented by the continuity of the quantities (7)
and (11), we find that these equations and conditions become
identical, if
                            8=*@,                             (12)

In other words, the displacements in either theory are subject
to the same general and surface conditions as the forces
required to maintain the vibrations in an element of volume
in the other theory.
   To fix our ideas in regard to the signification of ¥ and
we may consider the case of isotropic media, in which these
operators reduce to ordinary algebraic quantities, simple or
complex. Now the curl of any vector necessarily satisfies the
solenoidal condition (the so-called ''equation of continuity"),

   When w8 is positive, which is the case of perfectly trans
parent bodies, the positive root of n8 is called the index of
refraction of the medium. In the most general case it would
be appropriate to call n (or perhaps that root of n8 of which
the real part is positive) the (complex) index of refraction,
although the terminology is hardly settled in this respect. A
negative value of n8 would represent a body from which light
would be totally reflected at all angles of incidence. No such
cases have been observed. Values of n8 in which the coeffi
cient of t is negative, indicate media in which light is absorbed.
Values in which the coefficient of t is positive would represent
media in which the opposite phenomenon took place*.
   It is no part of the object of this paper to go into the
details by which we may derive, so far as observable phe
nomena are concerned, Fresnel's law of double refraction for
transparent bodies, as well as the more general law of the
same character which relates to seolotropic bodies of more or
less opacity, and which differs from Fresnel's only in that
certain quantities become complex, or Fresnel's laws for the
intensities of reflected and refracted light at the boundary of
transparent isotropic media with the more general laws for
the case of bodies seolotropic or opaque, or both. The principal
cases have already been discussed on the new elastic theory
  * But t might have been introduced into the equations in such a way
that a positive coefficient in the value of n2 would indicate absorption,
and a negative coefficient the impossible case.

in the Philosophical Magazine*, and a further discussion is
promised. For the electrical theory, the case of double refrac
tion in perfectly transparent media has been discussed quite
in detail in the Ainer. Journ. Sci.f; and the intensities of
reflected and refracted light have been abundantly deduced
from the above conditions by various authors J. So far as all
these laws are concerned, the object of this paper will be
attained if it has been made clear that the two theories, in
their extreme cases, give identical results. The greater or
less degree of elegance, or completeness, or perspicuity, w ith
which these laws may be developed by different authors
should weigh nothing in favour of either theory.
     The nonmagnetic rotation of the plane of polarization, with
the allied phenomena in aeolotropic bodies, lie in a certain
sense outside of the above laws, as depending on minute
quantities which have been neglected in this discussion. The
manner in which these minute quantities affect the equations
of motion on the electrical theory has been shown in a former
paper §, where these phenomena in transparent bodies are
treated quite at length. For the new theory, a discussion of
this subject is promised by Mr. Glazebrook.
     But the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization, with
the allied phenomena when an aeolotropic body is subjected to
magnetic influence, fall entirely within the scope of the above
equations and surface-conditions. The characteristic of this
case is that "9 and 4> are not self-conjugate||. This is what
we might expect on the electric theory from the experiments
of Dr. Hall, which show that the operators expressing the
relation between the electromotive force and current are not
in general self-conjugate in this case.
     In the preceding comparison, we have considered only the
limiting cases of the two theories. With respect to the sense
in which the limiting case is admissible, the two theories do
not stand on quite the same footing. In the electric theory,
or in anj- in which the velocity of the missing wave is very
great, if we are satisfied that the compressibility is so small as
to produce no appreciable results, we may set it equal to zero

 246    Prof. J. W. Gibbs's Comparison of the Electric Theory
 in our mathematical theory, even if we do not regard this as
 expressing the actual facts with absolute accuracy. But the
 case is not so simple with an elastic theory in which the forces
 resisting certain kinds of motion vanish, so far, at least, as
 they are proportional to the strains. The first requisite for
 any sort of optical theory is that the forces shall be propor
 tional to the displacements. This is easily obtained in general
 by supposing the displacements very small. But if the
 resistance to one kind of distortion vanishes, there will be a
 tendency for this kind of distortion to appear in some places
 in an exaggerated form, and even to an infinite degree, how
 ever small the displacements may be in other parts of the
 field. In the case before us, if we suppose the velocity of the
 missing wave to be absolutely zero, there will be infinite con
 densations and rarefactions at a surface where ordinary waves
 are reflected ; that is, a certain volume of ajther will be con
 densed to a surface, and vice versa. This prevents any treat
 ment of the extreme case, which is at once simple and satis
 factory. The difficulty has been noticed by Sir William
 Thomson, who observes that it may be avoided if we suppose
the displacements infinitely small in comparison with the
wave-length of the wave of compression. This implies a
finite velocity for that wave. A similar difficulty would pro
bably be found to exist (in the extreme case) with regard to
the deformation of the aether by the molecules of ponderable
matter, as the ajther oscillates among them. If the statical
resistance to irrotational motions is zero, it is not at all evident
that the statical forces evoked by the disturbance caused by
the molecules would be proportional to the motions. But this
difficulty would be obviated by the same hypothesis as the
first.
    These circumstances render the elastic theory somewhat
less convenient as a working hypothesis than the electric.
They do not necessarily involve any complication of the
equations of optics. For it may still be possible that this
velocity of the missing wave is so small, that the quantities on
which it depends may be set equal to zero in the equations
which represent the phenomena of optics. But the mental
processes by which we satisfy ourselves of the validity of our
results (if we do not work out the whole problem in the
general case of no assumption in regard to the velocity of the
missing wave) certainly involve conceptions of a higher
degree of difficulty on account of the circumstances menaoned.
Perhaps this ought not to affect our judgment with respect to
the question of the truth of the hypothesis.

tions from this limit are in opposite directions ; so that if the
phenomena of optics differed in any marked degree from what
we would have in the limiting case, it would be easy to find
an experimentwn cruris to decide between the two theories.
A little consideration will make it evident that, when the
principal indices of refraction of a crystal are given, the inter
mediate values for oblique wave-planes will be less if the
velocity of the missing wave is small but finite than if it is
infinitesimal, and will be greater if the velocity of the missing
wave is very great but finite than if it is infinite*. Hence, if
the velocity of the missing wave is small but finite, the inter
mediate values of the indices of refraction will be less than are
given by Fresnel's law ; but if the velocity of the missing
wave is very great but finite, the intermediate values of the
indices of refraction will be greater than are given by Fres-
nel's law. But the recent experiments of Professor Hastings
on the law of double refraction in Iceland spar do not en
courage us to look in this direction for the decision of the
question f.
    In a simple train of waves in a transparent medium, the
potential energy, on the elastic theory, may be divided into
two parts ; of which one is due to that general deformation
of the aether which is represented by the equations of wave-
 motion, and the other to those deformations which are caused
by the interference of the ponderable particles with the wave-
motion, and to such displacements of the ponderable matter
 as may be caused, in some cases at least, by the motion of the
 aether. If we write h for the amplitude, / for the wave
length, and p for the period, these two parts of the statical
energy (estimated per unit volume for a space including
 many wave-lengths) may be represented respectively by

 The sum of these may be equated to the kinetic energy, giving
 an equation of the form
   * This may be more clear if we consider the stationary waves formed
 by two trains of waves moving in opposite directions. The case then
 comes under the following theorem :—
    " If the system undergo such a change that the potential energy of a
 given configuration is diminished, while the kinetic energy of a given
  motion is unaltered, the periods of the free vibrations are all increased,
  and conversely." See Lord Eayleigh's ' Theory of Sound,' vol. i. p. 86.

B is an absolute constant (the rigidity of the aether, pre
viously represented by the same letter), A' and b will be
constant (for the same medium and the same direction of the
wave-normal) except so far as the type of the motion changes ;
i. e. except so far as the manner in which the motion of the
sether distributes itself between the ponderable molecules, and
the degree in which these take part in the motion, may un
dergo a change. When the period of vibration varies, the
type of motion will vary more or less, and A' and b will vary
more or less.
    In a manner entirely analogous*, the kinetic energy, on the
electrical theory, may be divided into two parts ; of which
 one is due to those general fluxes which are represented by
 the equations of wave motions, and the other to those irregu
 larities in the fluxes which are caused by the presence of the
 ponderable molecules, as well as to such motions of the pon
 derable particles themselves, as may sometimes occur. These
 parts of the kinetic energy may be represented respectively by

 Here F is the constant of electrodynamic induction, which is
 unity if we use the electromagnetic system of units ; / and G

     We have the means of forming a very exact numerical
 estimate of the ratio of the two parts into which the statical
 energy is thus divided on the elastic theory, or the kinetic
 energy on the electric theory. The means for this estimate
 is afforded by the principle, that the period of a natural
  vibration is stationary when its type is infinitesimally altered
  by any constraint f. Let us consider a case of simple wave-
 motion, and suppose the period to be infinitesimally varied,
  the wave-length will also vary, and presumably to some extent
  the type of vibration. But, by the principle just stated, if
  the asther or the electricity could be constrained to vibrate in
  the original type, the variations of / and p would be the same
  as in the actual case. Therefore, in finding the differential
  equation between I and p, we may treat b and A' in (24) and

It appears, therefore, that in the elastic theory that part of
the potential energy which depends on the deformation ex
pressed by the equations of wave-motion bears to the whole
potential energy the same ratio which the velocity of a group
of waves bears to the wave-velocity. In the electrical theory,
that part of the kinetic energy which depends on the motions
expressed by the equations of wave-motion bears to the whole
kinetic energy the same ratio.
   Returning to the consideration of equations (26) and (27),
we observe that in transparent bodies the last member of these
equations represents a quantity which is small compared with
unity, at least in the visible spectrum, and diminishes rapidly
as the wave-length increases. This is just what we should
expect of the first member of equation (27). But when we
pass to equation (26), which relates to the elastic theory, the
case is entirely different. The fact that the kinetic energy is
affected by the presence of the ponderable matter, and affected
differently in different directions, shows that the motion of the
aether is considerably modified. This implies a distortion
superposed upon the distortion represented by the equations of
wave-motion, and very much greater, since the body is very
fine-grained as measured by a wave-length. With any other
law of elasticity we should suppose that the energy of this
superposed distortion would enormously exceed that of the
regular distortion represented by the equations of wave-
motion. But it is the peculiarity of this new law of elasticity
that there is one kind of distortion of which the energy is
very small, and which is therefore peculiarly likely to occur.
Now if we can suppose the distortion caused by the ponder
able molecules to be almost entirely of this kind, we may be
able to account for the smallness of its energy. We should
still expect the first member of (26) to increase with the wave
length on account of the factor P, instead of diminishing, as
the last member of the equation shows that it does. We are
obliged to suppose that b, and therefore the type of the vibra
 tions, varies very rapidly with the wave-length, even in those
cases which appear farthest removed from anything like
 selective absorption.
    The electrical theory furnishes a relation between the re
fractive power of a body and its specific dielectric capacity,
 which is commonly expressed by saying that the latter is equal
 to the square of the index of refraction for waves of infinite
 length. No objection can be made to this statement ; but the
 great uncertainty in determining the index for waves of infi
 nite length by extrapolation prevents it from furnishing any
 very rigorous test of the theory. Yet as the results of extra

        of LiglU, and the Theory of a Quasi-labile JEther.    251
polation in some cases agree strikingly with the specific dielec
tric capacity, although in other cases they are quite different,
the correspondence is generally regarded as corroborative, in
some degree, of the theory. But the relation between refrac
tive power and dielectric capacity may be expressed in a form
which will furnish a more rigorous test, as not involving
extrapolation.
    We have seen on page 249 how we may determine nume
rically the ratio of the two first terms of equation (25). We
thus easily get the ratio of the first and last term, which gives
                      GA* _ d log I 7rF/gA*
                       4      d log \ pJ-                     (29)
In the corresponding equation for a train of waves of the same
amplitude and period tn vacuo, I becomes X, F remains the
 same, and for G we may write G1. This gives
                      G/t* ttF\8A«

                      G'-dlog\\9~rf(A*)                       W
    Now G is the dielectric elasticity of pure a>ther. If K is
 the specific dielectric capacity of the body which we are con
sidering, G'/K is the dielectric elasticity of the body and G'/2K
 is the potential energy of the body (per unit of volume), due
 to a unit of ordinary electrostatic displacement. But G/i9/4
 is the potential energy in a train of waves of amplitude h.
 Since the average square of the displacement is /t9/2, the
 potential energy of a unit displacement such as occurs in a
 train of waves is G/2. Now in the electrostatic experiment
 the displacement distributes itself among the molecules so as
 to make the energy a minimum. But in the case of fight the
distribution of the displacement is not determined entirely by
statical considerations. Hence
                                   &

1/a, which is the square of the index of refraction for an
infinite wave-length, would be identical with the second
member of (33).
   Another similarity between the electrical and optical pro
perties of bodies consists in the relation between conductivity
and opacity. Bodies in which electrical fluxes are attended
with absorption of energy absorb likewise the energy of the
motions which constitute light. This is strikingly true of the
metals. But the analogy does not stop here. To fix our
ideas, let us consider the case of an isotropic body and circu
larly polarized light, which is geometrically the simplest case,
although its analytical expression is not so simple as that of
plane-polarized light. The displacement at any point may be
symbolized by the rotation of a point in a circle. The external
force necessary to maintain the displacement g is represented
by n-sg. In transparent bodies, for which n~* is a positive
number, the force is radial and in the direction of the displace
ment, being principally employed in counterbalancing the
dielectric elasticity, which tends to diminish the displacement.
In a conductor n-2 becomes complex, which indicates a com
ponent of the force in the direction of g, that is, tangential to
the circle. This is only the analytical expression of the fact
above mentioned. But there is another optical peculiarity
of metals, which has caused much remark, viz. that the real
part of n8 (and therefore of n~") is negative, i. e. the radial
component of the force is directed towards the centre. This
inwardly directed force, which evidently opposes the electro-
dynamic induction of the irregular part of the motion, is
small compared with the outward force which is found in
transparent bodies, but increases rapidly as the period di
minishes. We may say, therefore, that metals exhibit a
second optical peculiarity—that the dielectrical elasticity is
not prominent as in transparent bodies. This is like the
electrical behaviour of the metals, in which wo do not observe
any elastic resistance to the motion of electricity. We see,
therefore, that the complex indices of metals, both in the real
and imaginary part of their inverse squares, exhibit properties
corresponding to the electrical behaviour of the metals.
   The case is quite different in the elastic theory. Here the
force from outside necessary to maintain in any element of
volume the displacement (£ is represented by n2(£. In trans
parent bodies, therefore, it is directed toward the centre. In
metals, there is a component in the direction of the motion (f,
while the radial part of the force changes its direction and is
often many times greater than the opposite force in transpa
rent bodies. This indicates that in metals the displacement of

         of Light and the Theory of a Quasi-labile jEther.              253
the aether is resisted by a strong elastic force, quite enormous
compared to anything of the kind in transparent bodies, where
it indeed exists, bnt it is so small that it has been neglected
by most writers, except when treating of dispersion. We can
make these suppositions, but they do not correspond to any
thing which we know independently of optical experiment.
    It is evident that the electrical theory of light has a serious
rival, in a sense in which, perhaps, one did not exist before the
publication of Sir William Thomson's paper in November
last*. Nevertheless, neither surprise at the results which
have been achieved, nor admiration for that happy audacity
of genius, which, seeking the solution of the problem precisely
where no one else would have ventured to look for it, has
turned half a century of defeat into victory, should blind us
to the actual state of the question.
    It may still be said for the electrical theory, that it is not
obliged to invent hypotheses t, but only to apply the laws fur
nished by the science of electricity, and that it is difficult to
account for the coincidences between the electrical and optical
properties of media, unless we regard the motions of light as
electrical. But if the electrical character of light is conceded,
the optica] problem is very different from anything which
existed in the time of Fresnel, Cauchy, and Green. The
third wave, for example, is no longer something to be gotten
rid of quocumjue modo, but something which we must dispose
of in accordance with the laws of electricity. This would
seem to rule out the possibility of a relatively small velocity
 for the third wave.
    * " Since the first publication of Cauchy 's work on the subject in 1830,
and of Green's in 1837, many attempts have been made by many workers
to find a dynamical foundation for Fresnel's laws of reflexion and refrac
tion of light, but all hitherto ineffectually." Sir William Thomson,
he. cit.
    " So far as I am aware, the electric theory of Maxwell is the only one
 satisfying these conditions (of explaining at once Fresnel's laws of double
refraction in crystals and those governing the intensity of reflexion when
light passes from one isotropic medium to another)." Lord Rayleigh,
Phil. Mag. September 18S8.
    t Electrical motions in air, since the recent experiments of Professor
 Hertz, seem to be no longer a matter of hypothesis. We can hardly
 suppose that the case is essentially different with the so-called vacuum.
 The theorem that the electrical motions of light are solenoidal, although
 it is convenient to assume it as a hypothesis and show that the results
 agree with experiment, need not occupy any such fundamental position in
 the theory. It is in fact only another way of saying that two of the con
 stants of electrical science have a certain ratio (infinity). It would be
 easy to commence without assuming this value, and to show in the course
 of the development of the subject that experiment requires it, not of
 course as an abstract proposition, but in the sense in which experiment
 can be said to require any values of any constants, that is, to a certain
 degree of approximation.

XXVIII. On tlie Oscillations of a Rotating Liquid Spheroid
    and the Genesis of the Moon. By A. E. H. Love, B.A.*
1. THIEMANN'S investigations t of the motion of a liquid
     -EV ellipsoid contain the condition of stability of the form
of steady motion usually referred to as Maclaurin's spheroid,
when the liquid is perfectly inviscid. The equation for the
critical value of the excentricity of the spheroid is
            e(3 +4e») V (1 -e2) = (3 + 2e2-4e*) sin"' e ;
and, if we take the notation of Thomson and Tait in which
(1+/8) (1— e2) = 1, the critical value of/is very nearly 3"14.
If/ be greater than this value the motion is unstable. If the
liquid be viscous, it is stated by Thomson and Tait that the
motion is secularly unstable, however slight the viscosity may
be, if/ exceeds 1*39457. This statement has been recently
proved by Poincare- f, who has also shown that the motion is
thoroughly stable for all displacements when / is less than
this value.
    In this paper is given an investigation by the method of
Grreenbill and Basset of the equations, first obtained by
Riemann, determining the lengths of the axis of a liquid
ellipsoid which rotates about one of its principal axes and
moves in such a way as to remain ellipsoidal ; and these
equations are then applied to find the small oscillations about
that state of steady motion in which the free surface is an
oblate spheroid, and the liquid rotates as if rigid about the
polar axis ; the displacement contemplated being of such a
kind that the axis of rotation remains fixed in space, and the
surface is always ellipsoidal and has this axis for one of its
principal axes. It appears that there are two periods of
oscillation, 27r/n, and Sir/n^, where
       V = 16ttW/(3 +f) - 2o>\3 + Sf +/*)/(3/^ +/*)

These values of n vary very little for different small values of
«, so that for a spheroid rotating in any period longer than
about three hours the period of oscillation varies inversely
as the square root of the density approximately.
   The determination of these periods of oscillation has an
important bearing on the question of the origin of the Moon.
Professor Darwin, in his paper " On the Precession of a
Viscous Spheroid and the Remote History of the Earth," *
saw reason to reject Laplace's hypothesis, that the moon sepa
rated from the earth as a ring because the angular velocity
was too great for stability. In the light of Riemann and
Poincare's researches above referred to it is clear that, when
the density is not less than 3 and the period of rotation longer
than three hours, the motion is certainly stable. According
to Professor Darwin, the period of rotation of the earth-moon
system when the two bodies formed a single mass may be
estimated at something between two and six hours, more
probably between two and four hoursf ; and if we take account
of the continued contraction of the two cooling bodies since
the date of the disruption and remember that the present
mean density of the moon is about 3"7, it seems highly im
probable that Laplace's hypothesis as to instability can be
correct. As an alternative Professor Darwin has suggested
that possibly the spheroid might have a period of free oscilla
tion not far removed from the semidiurnal tidal period, in
which case the solar tides would be of enormous height. This
is a new cause of instability in the otherwise stable dynamical
system, and its consequence would be a division of the mass at
a moment of greatest elongation. Thus on this hypothesis
the moon broke off from the earth as a single mass and not
as a ring, and we have not in our account of the history of
the system to make additional demands upon the lapse of time
with a view to the consolidation of the ring-moon into one
body. The hypothesis gains greatly in credibility when it is
shown that the spheroid really has a period of oscillation of
the requisite length. This is done in the present paper. It
is proved that for a liquid spheroid of the same mean density
as the earth the longest period is always very nearly equal to
 1£ hours, while for a spheroid whose density is 3 this period
is very nearly equal to 2 hours, whatever the rate of rotation

   Now a'x + h'y is the acceleration of the particle at {x, y, z)
parallel to the axis x, and h'x + b'y is the acceleration parallel
to the axis y, and thus the moment of the effective forces
about the axis z is proportional to h'. Hence h' — O.

 Suppose the liquid to be subject to its own attraction ; then

    We can show that t, t7 are constants, by forming the equa
 tions of conservation of moment of momentum and of vortex-
 strength.
    The moment of momentum round the axis z is
 or          (a2+&8)£+ft^|^ = const. =T+T/.
    The surface-integral of vortex-strength over any surface
 bounded by the principal section in the plane xy is propor

    Hence t and t7 are both constants.

   XXIX. The History of the Doctrine of Radiant Energy.
                 By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. E.S.*
IN his interesting Address t to the American Association
      for the Advancement of Science, Prof. Langley sketches
the development of the modern doctrine of Radiant Energy,
and deduces important lessons to be laid to heart by all con
cerned in physical investigation. This is a most useful under
taking ; but in the course of it there occur one or two state
ments which, in the interest of scientific history, ought not to
be allowed to pass without a protest.
   After quoting Melloni's very unequivocal conclusion of
1843, that " Light is merely a series of calorific indications
sensible to the organs of sight ; or, vice versa, the radiations
of obscure heat are veritable invisible radiations of light,"
Prof. Langley goes on to say, " So far as I know, no phy
sicist of eminence reasserted Melloni's principle with equal
emphasis till J. W. Draper, in 1872. Only sixteen years
ago, or in 1872, it was almost universally believed that there
were three different entities in the spectrum, represented by
actinic, luminous, and thermal rays."
   These words struck me strangely as I first read them. My
own scientific ideas were formed between 1860 and 1866, and
I certainly never believed in the three entities. Having on a
former occasion referred to this question J as an illustration
of the difference of opinion which is sometimes to be found
between the theoretical and experimental schools of workers,
I was sufficiently interested in the matter to look up a few
references, with results which are, I think, difficult to re
concile with Prof. Langley's view.
   In Young's Lectures§ we read :—" Dr. Herschel's experi
ments have shown that radiant heat consists of various parts
which are differently refrangible, and that, in general, in
visible heat is less refrangible than light. This discovery
must be allowed to be one of the greatest that have been made
since the days of Newton ....
   " It was first observed in Germany by Eitter, and soon after
wards in England by Dr. Wollaston, that the muriate of silver
is blackened by invisible rays, which extend beyond the pris
matic spectrum, on the violet side. It is therefore probable that

266               Lord Rayleigh on the History of
the yellow, and the red rays of light, and the rays of invisible
heat, constitute seven different degrees of the same scale, dis
tinguished from each other into this limited number, not by
natural divisions, but by their effects on our senses : and we
may also conclude that there is some similar relation between
heated and luminous bodies of different kinds."
   And, again, on p. 654 : " If heat is not a substance, it must
be a quality; and this quality can only be motion. It was
Newton's opinion that heat consists in a minute vibratory
motion of the particles of bodies, and that this motion is com
municated through an apparent vacuum by the undulations
of an elastic medium, which is also concerned in the phenomena
of light. If the arguments which have been lately advanced
in favour of the undulatory theory of light be deemed valid,
there will be still stronger reasons for admitting this doctrine
respecting heat; and it a .-ill only be necessary to suppose the
vibiations and undulations principally constituting it to be
larger and stronger than those of light, while at the same
time the smaller vibrations of light, and even the blackening
rays, derived from still more mirute vibrations, may perhaps,
when sufficiently condensed, concur in producing the effects
of heat. These effects, beginning from the blackening rays,
which are invisible, are a little more perceptible in the violet,
which still possess but a faint power of illumination ; the
 yellow-green afford the most light ; the red gives less light,
 but much more heat ; while the still larger and less frequent
 vibrations, which have no effect upon the sense of sight, may
 be supposed to give rise to the least refrangible rays, and
 to constitute invisible heat."
    It is doubtless true that Young's views did not at the time
 of the publication of these lectures * command the authority
 which now attaches to them. But when the undulatory theory
 gained acceptance, there was no room left for the distinct
entities.
    J. B. Beade, one of the pioneers of photography, in a letter
 to B. Hunt f, of date Feb. 1854, thus speaks of Young : —
 " Dr. Young's propositions are, that radiant light consists in
 undulations of the luininiferous sether, that light differs from
 heat only in the frequency of its undulations, that undulations
 less frequent than those of light produce heat, and that undu
 lations more frequent than those of light produce chemical and
 photographic action,—all proved by experiments."
   * I may remark, in passing, that Brougham knew a little of experi
 menting, as of everything else, except law !

 not being an undulationist, was upon the other side.

    Sir John Herschel's presentation of the matter* is not very
explicit. " The solar rays, then, possess at least three dis
tinct powers : those of heating, illuminating, and effecting
chemical combinations or decompositions ; and these powers
are distributed among the differently refrangible rays in
such a manner as to show their complete independence on
each other. Later experiments have gone a certain way to
add another power to the list—that of exciting magnetism."
Although the marginal index runs " Calorific, luminous, and
chemical rays," the choice of words in the text, as well as the
reference to magnetism (for surely no one believed in a special
magnetizing entity^, points to the conclusion that Herschel
held the modern view.
    For the decade between 1850 and 1860, the citation upon
which I most rely as indicative of the view held by the
highest authorities, and by those capable of judging where the
highest authority was to be found, is from Prof. Stokes's cele
brated memoir upon Fluorescence f. On p. 465 we read :—
" Now according to the Undulatory Theory, the nature of light
is defined by two things, its period of vibration, and its state
of polarization. To the former corresponds its refrangibility,
and, so far as the eye is a judge of colour, its colour." And
in a footnote here appended:—
   " It has been maintained by some philosophers of the first eminence
that light of definite refrangibility mignt still be compound ; and though
no longer decomposable by prismatic refraction may still be so by other
means. I am not now speaking of compositions and resolutions depen
dent upon polarization. It has been suggested by advocates of the undu
latory theory, that possibly a difference of properties in lights of the same
refrangibility might correspond to a difference in the law of vibration,
and that lights of given refrangibility may differ in tint, just as musical
notes ofgiven pitch differ in quality. Were it not for the strong convic
tion I felt that light of definite refrangibility is in the strict sense of the
word homogeneous, I should probably have been led to look in this direc
tion for an explanation of the remarkable phenomena presented by a
solution of sulphate of quinine. It would lead me too far from the subject
 of the present paper to explain the grounds of this conviction. I will
only observe that I have not overlooked the remarkable effect of absorbing
media in causing apparent changes of colour in a pure spectrum ; but this
 I believe to be a subjective phenomenon depending upon contrast."
     It can scarcely be necessary to insist that " light " is used
 here in the wider sense, a large part of the memoir dealing
 with the transformation of invisible into visible light.
     The allusion in the note is, of course, to Brewster. This
 distinguished discoverer never accepted the wave theory,
 and was thus insensible to the repugnance with which his
    • Art. Light, Enc. Met. 1830, § 1147.
    t " On a Change of Refrangibility of Light." Phil. Trans. 1852.

 268              Lord Bayleigh on the History of
 doctrine of three different kinds of luminous radiation was
regarded by every undulationist. The matter was not finally
 set at rest until Helmholtz showed that Brewster's effects de
 pended upon errors of experiment not previously recognized.
    The following, from W. Thomson*, is almost equally sig
nificant :—
    " It is assumed in this communication that the undulatory
theory of radiant heat and light, according to which light is
 merely radiant heat, of which the vibrations are performed in
periods between certain limits of duration, is true. ' The
 chemical rays ' beyond the violet end of the spectrum consist
 of undulations of which the full vibrations are executed in
 periods shorter than those of the extreme visible violet light,
or than about the eight hundred million millionth of a second.
 The periods of the vibrations of visible light lie between this
 point and another, about double as great, corresponding to
the extreme visible red light. The vibrations of the obscure
 radiant heat beyond the red end are executed in longer periods
than this ; the longest which has yet been experimentally
tested being about the eighty million millionth of a second."
    Again, in Lloyd's 'Wave Theory of Light 'j, we find the
following passage :—" It appears, then, that sensibility of the
eye is confined within much narrower limits than that of the
ear ; the ratio of the times of the extreme vibrations which
affect the eye being only that of 1*58 to 1, which is less than
the ratio of the times of vibration of a fundamental note and
its octave. There is no reason for supposing, however, that
the vibrations themselves are confined within these limits. In
fact, we know that there are invisible rays beyond the two
extremities of the spectrum, whose periods of vibration (and
lengths of wave) must fall without the limits now stated to
belong to the visible rays."
    I believe that it would be not too much to say that during
the decade 1850-1860 nearly all the leading workers in
physics, with the exception of Brewster, held the modern
view of radiation. It would be quite consistent with this
that many chemists, photographers, and workers in other
branches of science, who trusted to more or less antiquated
text-books for their information, should have clung to a belief
in the three entities. After 1860, and the discussions re
specting the discoveries of Stewart and Kirchhoff, I should
have supposed that there were scarcely two opinions.

1866, and was widely used in schools and colleges. In
book II. ch. II., he elaborately discusses the whole question,
summing up in favour of the view that " radiant light and
heat are only varieties of the same physical agent, and that
when once the spectrum of a luminous object has been
obtained, the separation of the different rays from one
another is physically complete ; so that, if we take any region
of the visible spectrum, its illuminating and heating effect
are caused by precisely the same rays." What there was
further for Draper or any one else to say in 1872 I am at a
loss to comprehend *.
   To pass on to another point. I have followed the excellent
advice to read W. Herschel's original memoirs ; but I must
confess that the impression produced upon my mind is
different in some respects from that expressed by Prof.
Langley. It seems to me that Herschel fully established the
diversity of radiant heat. In the first memoir f a paragraph
is headed " Radiant Heat is of different Refrangibility," the
question being fully discussed ; and from the following
memoir (p. 291) it is evident that this proposition extends to
invisible radiation. " The four last experiments prove that
the maximum of the heating power is vested among the in
visible rays ; and is probably not less than half an inch beyond
the last visible ones, when projected in the manner before
mentioned. The same experiments also show that the sun's
invisible rays, in their less refrangible state, and considerably
beyond the maximum, still exert a heating power fully equal
to that of red-coloured light. ..." Can it then be said of
De la Roche that he, in 1811, before anyone else, "derives
the just and most important, as well as the then most novel
conception, that radiant heat is of different kinds " ? It was
doubtless a most important step when De la Roche and
Melloni exhibited the diversity of radiant heat by means of
selective absorption ; but I do not see how we can regard
them as the discoverers of the fact.
    It would take too long to establish by quotations, but it is
pretty evident that in his two. earlier papers J Herschel leaned
to the view that light was not " essentially different from
radiant heat." Why then, after laying hands upon the truth,
did he let it go, and decide that light and heat are not
occasioned by the same rays ?
  * I have limited myself to citations from English writers, but I have
no reason to think that the course of opinion was different in France and
Germany.

270               Mr. W. Brown on Steel Magnets.
   " The question,* which we are discussing at present, ma
therefore at once be reduced to this single point. Is the heat
which has the refrangibility of the red rays occasioned by the
light of these rays ? For, should that be the case, as there
will be then only one set of rays, one fate only can attend them,
in being either transmitted or stopped, according to the power
of the glass applied to them. We are now to appeal to our
prismatic experiment upon the subject, which is to decide the
question." The issue could not be more plainly stated. The
experiment is discussed, and this is the conclusion :—" Here
then we have a direct and simple proof, in the case of the red
glass, that the rays of light are transmitted, while those of
heat are stopped, and that thus they have nothing in common
but a certain equal degree of refrangibility. . . ."
   I am disposed to think that it was this erroneous con
clusion from experiment t, more, perhaps, than preconceived
views about caloric, that retarded progress in radiant heat
for so many years. We are reminded of Darwin's saying
that a bad observation is more mischievous than unsound
theory. It would be interesting to inquire upon what
grounds we now reject the plain answer which Herschel
thought himself to have received from experiment. 1 do not
recall a modern investigation in which the heat and light
absorptions are proved to be equal for the various parts of the
visible spectrum. Can it be that after all we have nothing
but theory to oppose to Herschel's facts ?
    I hope it will be understood that these criticisms, even if
they are sound, do not touch the substance of Prof. Langley's
address, which is doubly interesting as coming from one who
has done so much himself to enlarge our knowledge of this
branch of science.

   The above table is quoted to show the effect of annealing on
the different specimens ; it also shows the retentive power of
each specimen, which appears to vary inversely as the quantity
of manganese in the specimen. Thus specimen III., which
has nearly three times as much manganese as either of the
 other two, in the glass-hard condition has diminished in mag
netic moment by 5-25 per cent. ; and specimen II., which has
about 20 per cent, more manganese than I., loses 3 per cent,
nearly ; whilst the decrease in the magnetic moment of I. is
approximately 1"4 per cent. Specimen I., however, as
appears from Table I., differs very much from the others in
the quantity of silicon it contains, and it alone contains
sulphur. By annealing for one hour in oil at 100° C, the
magnetic moment of I. has been slightly raised and that of
III. lowered, whilst II. remains unaltered, and so on ; a

simple inspection of the table indicating the behaviour of each
specimen under the various treatments.
    In order to obtain data for the determination of the effective
lengths, the correct method would be to take a magnet the
length of the longest magnet required, and after tempering,
magnetizing, and testing it, to break it successively into a
number of lengths and test each part separately after remag-
netizing. But in doing so we would assume that every piece
of the same specimen would be in the same physical condition.
There is also the difficulty in breaking a glass-hard piece of
steel so as to have plane ends, and so permit accurate measure
ment of the length of the magnet.
   I think, therefore, that there is less liability to error in
making all the magnets of the required lengths before temper
ing, as was done in these experiments.
   Each specimen was cut in lengths varying from 1 to 20
centim., they were carefully made straight and the end-
planes made as accurately as possible at right angles to their
lengths. They were all made glass-hard by heating them to
a bright red heat inside an iron tube in a brisk coal fire, and
then dropping them end on into a vessel of water 100 centim.
deep, the temperature of the water being 7° 0. A greater
number of magnets than were actually required were treated
in this way, and only those which were found to be glass-
hard throughout chosen for the experiments.
    They were then carefully cleaned, polished, measured, and
weighed, and, finally, magnetized to saturation in a long
helix giving a field of 1500 C.G.S. units intensity.
   In order to obtain the deflexions for calculating the mag
netic moments, the apparatus employed consisted of a lamp
and scale, a modified form of the Bottomley magnetometer,

   Tho magnetometer M consists of a small circular mirror m
8 millim. in diameter, with two short magnetic needles 10
millim. long and 0-8 millim. diameter, attached to the back of
it and suspended by a single approximately torsionless silk
fibre 16 centim. long and ^ of a millim. in diameter ; the
whole being enclosed in a case of which the base and lower
part is wood and the upper part a glass tube 2 centim. in
diameter. The upper end of the silk fibre is attached to a pin
which can be lowered or raised by means of the nut a working
in a collar on a brass cap fixed to the top of the glass tube.
This pin is for the purpose of adjusting the height of the
mirror so as to allow it to hang centrally in a cavity cut in the
wooden block b at the lower end of the tube. The pin is also
capable of a lateral motion in any direction by means of three
screws (not shown in the drawing) through the brass cap
and impinging on the collar. The cavity in the wooden block
b for receiving the mirror is 12 millim. in dkmeter and
3 millim. deep, thus allowing 1 millim. of clearance all round
the mirror ; the front of the cavity is closed by a piece of thin
plate glass g.
   The base of the magnetometer is fitted with three conical
feet which fit accurately into the well-known hole-slot-and-plane
arrangement of Sir "W illiam Thomson, the hole and slot being
cut in a piece of thick plate glass which is fixed to a table in a
position where the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
force is known. Eastwards from the magnetometer at a dis
tance of 127 centim. is a boxwood scale S divided into half-
millimetres, and having an electric glow-lamp immediately
behind it. The deflexion of the light-spot from the magneto
meter-mirror on the scale can be read to ^ of a millim.
by means of the shadow cast by a fine wire stretched across
the orifice of a copper funnel c through which the beam of
light passes from the lamp. A dark screen s serves to pre
vent any undue reflexion from the lamp on to the scale.
Westwards again from the magnetometer, at a distance of 40
centim., is placed the grooved plane P for holding the magnets
during the deflexion observations. The base of this plane is
made on the same geometrical principle as the magnetometer,
and is arranged so that when it is in position a line passing
through the middle of the groove and the centre of the mag
netometer-mirror shall be at right angles to the magnetic
meridian.
   The magnet and magnetometer being placed in their re

   These curves, when examined along with Table I., are very
interesting.

    From a magnetic point of view, specimen II. seems to be
 the best of the three; since with a magnet, whose dimension
 ratio is 19, we get a magnetic moment as great .as one with
 dimension ratio of 23-5 of either specimens I. or III. Spe
 cimens II. and III. are about equal with magnets 10 centiin.
 long, or a dimension ratio of 35. We see also that there
 would be very little gain by making a magnet from speci
 men I. longer than 8 centim., and 10 centim. appears to be
 the length for No. III., whilst No. II. rises abruptly up to
 even 20 centim.
    This behaviour of No. II. is somewhat curious ; it contains
 the least silicon and the most phosphorus of the three, and an
 intermediate quantity of manganese, and in the condition in
 which it came from the manufacturer it is the hardest and the
 most elastic of the three specimens ; it is also very fibrous,
 tough, and difficult to straighten.
    No. III. is something like II. in its physical qualities, only
 not so pronounced in the qualities mentioned ; whereas No. t.
 is milder, softer, and more easily worked than the other two.
 It ought to bo mentioned that II. and III. are by one maker,
 and I. by another.

THE Anniversary Address (pages 1-43) by Mr. C. S. Wilkinson,
        F.G.S., gives a favourable account of the Progress of Science
in Australia ; and, in noticing his own special subject, the President
draws attention not so much to past labours in the field of Geology
as to some of the work yet to be accomplished. In sketching out the
extent to which each successive series of rock-formations is known,
Mr. Wilkinson clearly indicates the points to which further research
should be directed. Imperfect or doubtful evidence has to be made
good, substantiated, or corrected, as the case may be, both as to
age, sequence, and thickness of some strata, and as to the
occurrence and characters of fossils. All the good Australian
workers in these and other departments of Natural Science are duly
mentioned ; and in Geology, more particularly the late Rev. W. B.
Clarke, the founder of Australian Geology, and the Rev. J. E.
Tenison-Woods, to w hoin the Society's " Clarke Medal " was
awarded in May 1888.
   In Mr. W. E. Abbott's paper (pages 59-76, with the discussion)
on " Porest-Destruction in New South Wales and its effects on the
flow of water in watercourses and on the rainfall," the author stated
that on his land, a basaltic district, streams now flowed where there
was little water when the forests were standing. In the discussion
some good points were mooted, as to the decrease of atmospheric
pressure, perhaps by solar heat on the exposed ground, allowing the
subterranean water to flow out,—as to the local condition of the
soil, &c. Although pretty-well established that forests in general do
not increase local rainfall, yet the Society quite agreed that, if
forests were destroyed, a sufficiency of standing trees should
always be left (as, indeed, required by law) for the purposes of
shade and ornament.
   Mr. H. C. Russell, F.R.S., gives some interesting observations
(pages 76-78) on the variable red Star, r) Argus. This is now
proved to have remarkable fluctuations of brilliance at its minimum
as well as at its maximum ; and its minimum seems to have now
past, as its magnitude is again increasing. Its period is probably
about 80 years.
   In his " Notes on some Minerals and Mineral Localities in the
Northern Districts of New South Wales " (pages 78-SS, with a
plate), Mr. D. A. Porter continues his remarks (made in 1884) on the
same subject, and notices Gold, Antimony, Stibnite, Molybdenite,
Actinolite, Axinite, Beryl, Zircon, Spinel, Gahnite, Pleonaste,
Vesuvianite, Rhodochrosite, Siderite, Calcite, Arragonite, Natrolite,

or overtaxing his brain with obtuse formula."

    3. "On the Jersey Brick Clay." By Dr. Andrew Dunlop, F.G.S.
    This clay is of a dull yellow colour and somewhat sandy ; in
places it effervesces with acids ; bedding and lamination have been
noted. The lower part contains angular stones, usually with their
longest diameter parallel to the surface of the underlying rock, and
either derived from it or from some other rock not far distant. The
bulk of the rocks consists of granite, diorite, rhyolite, quartz-felsite,
&c, but thero is an argillaceous shale, locally hardened, which is
largely developed over considerable areas. The clay occurs in patches,
covering all kinds of rocks, and is spread over the raised beaches ;
it seems more abundant on the higher grounds. A similar clay
occurs in Normandy and in the other Channel Islands.
    The author was disposed to regard this clay as probably a fluvia-
 tile deposit laid down towards the close of the Glacial Period, when
the Channel Islands were at a lower level and united to the main
land. Subsequently he conceived that it might be the result of the
 decomposition of shale, felspathic porphyry, &c, some sections
 seeming to show this process as still going on ; the clay, too, seems
 better developed over this class of rock ; if so, it would require a
 moving force more energetic than ordinary rainwash.

    The following communications wore read :—
     1. " On the Growth of Crystals in Igneous Bocks after their
Consolidation." By Prof. J. W. Judd, F.B.S., F.G.S.
    That the characteristic structures of the " granophyric " rock
 were not acquired by them during the act of consolidation, but
 have resulted from secondary changes taking place subsequently,
 was suggested in a former communication to the Society. Addi

                         Geological Society.                       279
tional evidences was now brought forward concerning the nature of
the processes by which these structures —variously known as the
micropegmatitic, the centrio or ocellar, the pseudospherulitic, the
microgranitic, and the drusy or miarolitio—which are found in the
peripheral zones and the apophyses of granitic intrusions, must
have been produced.
   That fragments of crystals in detrital rocks undergo enlargement
and redevelopment has been shown by Sorby, Van Hise, Bonney,
and many other authors. The fact has also been frequently re
cognized that curious outgrowths may often be detected in con
nexion with the crystals of igneous rocks ; such outgrowths have
 usually been regarded, however, as having been formed during the
 original consolidation of the rock.
   In a " labradorite-andesite " (labradorite of French petrographers)
belonging to the older or " felstone " series of ejections in the Ter
tiary volcano of Mull, largo crystals of a plagioclase-felspar, near to
labradorite in composition, are found to oxhibit large and re
markable outgrowths of very irregular forms. The distinction
between these outgrowths and the original crystals is rendered very
obvious from the circumstance that the original crystals have been
corroded by the enveloping magma and contain enclosures of the
same, and that they have been much cracked, and sometimes even
partially kaolinized bofore growth recommenced in them. In some
cases the crystals have been actually broken and recemented by
newly deposited felspar-material.
   While there is a general crystallographic continuity between the
old felspar-crystals and the new outgrowths from them, the varia
tions in the position of extinction in different portions of the en
larged crystal show that, as growth went on, the composition of
successively formed zones gradually and progressively changed from
near the Anorthite limit to close upon the Albite limit.
   These facts prove that, under suitable conditions, felspar-crystals
in solid rock-masses may grow at the expense of the unstable glass-
magma by which they are surrounded. This conclusion is in com
plete harmony with some other recent researches—especially those
of Dr. J. Lehmann on the mode of production of the perthite-
structure in felspars. In conclusion, the circumstances which have
given rise to the exceptionally clear illustration of the processes
described in the rock under consideration were explained, and the
bearings of the principles enunciated on the theory of metamorphism
are indicated.
   2. " The Tertiary Volcanoes of the Western Isles of Sootland."
By Prof. J. W. Judd, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In bis recently published memoir, "The History of Volcanic
Action during the Tertiary Period in the British Isles," Dr. A.
Geikie, while adopting many of the views propounded in a commu
nication made to this Society in 1874, " On the Ancient Volcanoes
 of the Highlands," takes exception to certain of the conclusions
 which are maintained in that paper.

280                     Geological Society :—
    Among the ideas set forth in 1874, of which Dr. Geikie now
announces his acceptance, and to which, indeed, he supplies valuable
 support and confirmation, from his own observations and those of
 various members of the Geological Survey, are the following :—
    (1) The perfect transition between the plutonic rocks of the
 district (granites and gabbros) and the lavas ("felstones" and
 basalts), and the dependence of each variety of texture exhibited by
 them—from the holocrystallino to the vitreous—on the conditions
 under which solidification took place.
   (2) The presence of great masses composed of volcanic agglomerates,
 breccias and tuffs, with numerous intrusive bosses, sheets, and
 dykes, at five well-marked eruptive centres, namely Mull, Ardna-
 murchan, Bum, Skye, and St. Kilda, and the subaerial character of
the ejections at these five centres.
    (3) The Tertiary age, not only of the lavas, but also of the gabbros
and granites found associated with them at these different centres.
    The conclusions to which exception is taken are as follows : —
    (1) That the ejection of the "felstone" lavas and the intrusion
of the granites preceded the appearance of the basalts and gabbros.
    (2) That tho five centres of eruption mark the sites of as many
great volcanic cones, now ruined and dissected by denudation.
   The view that the acid rocks were, as a whole, older than the
basic ones, was originally put forward by Prof. J. D. Forbes and
Dr. F. Zirkel, and is supported in the memoir of 1874. Dr. Geikie
admits that around several of the centres indicated basalts may
frequently be seen resting on more acid rocks ; but the latter he
regards as being, in every case, of an intrusive character ; he also
allows that the tuffs intercalated with the basalts often contain
fragments of felsite, but he does not accept this as a proof that the
felsites must have been erupted before the basalts. Much of the
divergence of opinion that has arisen appears, however, to be due to
the circumstance that Dr. Geikie classes as basalt many of the dark-
coloured lavas (augite-andesites &c.) which were, in the original
paper, grouped under the name of " felstones." In these " felstones "
the granites and gabbros alike were shown to be intrusive ; and it
was also admitted that there were many intrusions of acid rocks of
later date than both the " felstones " and the basaltic lavas.
   "With respect to the existence of great volcanoes in the district,
Dr. Geikie, while confirming most of the statements which were
made in 1874 as to the several centres of eruption, prefers to refer
the origin of the great plateaux of basaltic lava to " fissure-erup
tions." Ho maintains that the numerous basic dykes of the district
mark the actual cracks through which the lavas in question rose
 up and welled out at the surface.
    In opposition to this view, it was pointed out that the numbers and
dimensions of the Tertiary dykes are not such as would warrant us
in inferring that they formed the conduits through which the enor
mous masses of lava forming the plateaux were erupted ; and the
absence of all proofs of eontact-metamorphism at their sides, and of
evidence that the majority of them ever reached the surface at all,
was commented upon. In 1874 it was pointed out that some of these

               Evidence of former Glacial Periods.                 281
dykes appeared to mnrk the radial fissures on which sporadic cones
(" puys") were thrown up, after the great central volcanoes became
extinct ; and this view is supported by the circumstance of the close
analogies between the materials erupted at this later period, and the
rocks which constitute some of the undoubtedly Post-Mesozoic
dykes.
   Dr. Geikie supports his view, that the plateau-basalts of the
Western Isles of Scotland and of Antrim were formed by " fissure-
eruptions," by facts which he noticed in the Snake-liiver country,
in the year 1879, while he was making an excursion to the Yellow
stone Park, and also by observations made by Captain Dutton in
the Grand Canon country, in Utah, and in New Mexico.
   With respect to Dr. Geikie's own observations, it was pointed out
that geologists who have had more time and opportunity for the
detailed study of the district in question, like Captain Reynolds,
Dr. Hayden, and Mr. Clarence King, all agree that there is abund
ant evidence of ordinary volcanic action having occurred in the
Snake-Eiver country ; and the last- mentioned author distinctly
points out the great paucity of dykes, and the absence of any
evidence of the existence of fissures such as those from which
" fissure-eruptions " are supposed to have taken place.
   Captain Dutton, although originally inclined to refer the lava-
fields of the Western Territories of the United States to " fissure-
eruptions," has, since his visit to Mauna Loa, and his study of the
floods of basalt that have flowed from that volcano, very candidly
confessed that, in view of these later observations, he is no longer
prepared to maintain his original position.
   If the effusive action taking place at many volcanoes be rightly
understood and appreciated— and the recent very interesting re
searches of Prof. J. D. Dana in the Sandwich Islands have thrown
much new and important light on this subject—the theory of
" fissure-eruption " will be found to be as unnecessary as it is vague.
At some volcanic centres there is a preponderance of explosive
action : at others the main result consists in the extrusion of lava-
currents; while in most cases we find a combination of both kinds
of action. The Teitiary volcanoes of Scotland, like tho existing
volcanoes of Iceland, are interesting as exhibiting evidence of both
the effusive and the explosive action on the very grandest scale.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. "On the prevailing Misconceptions regarding the Evidence
which we ought to expect of former Glacial Periods." By Dr. James
Croll, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The imperfection of the geological record is greater than is usually
believed. Not only are the records of ancient glacial conditions
imperfect, but this follows from the principles of geology. The
evidence of glaciation is to be found chiefly on land-surfaces, and
the ancient land-surfaces have not, as a rule, been preserved.

282           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
Practically the several formations consist of old sea-bottoms,
formed out of material derived from the degradation of old land-
surfaces. The exceptions are trifling, such as the under-layers
of coal-seams, and dirt-beds like those at Portland. The trans
formation of an old land-surface into a sea-bottom will probably
obliterate every trace of glaciation; even the stones would be
deprived of their ice-markings ; the preservation of Boulder-clay, as
such, would be exceptional. The absence of large erratic blocks in
the stratified beds may indicate a period of extreme glaciation, or
one absolutely free from ice. The more complete the glaciation the
less probability of the ice-sheet containing any blocks, since the
rocks would be covered up. Because there are no large boulders in
the strata of Greenland or Spitzbergen, Nordenskjold maintains
that there were no glaoial conditions there down to the termination
of the Miocene period. The author maintained that glaciation is
the normal condition of polar regions, and if these at any time were
free from ice, it could only arise from exceptional circumstances,
such as a peculiar distribution of land and water. It was extremely
improbable that such a state of things could have prevailed during the
whole of the long period from the Silurian to the close of the
Tertiary.
   A million years hence it would be difficult to find any trace of
what we now call the glacial epoch ; though if the stratified rocks
of the Earth's crust consisted of old land-surfaces, instead of old
sea-bottoms, traces of many glacial periods might be detected. The
present land-surface will be entirely destroyed in order to form the
future sea-bottom. It is only those objects which lie in existing
sea-bottoms which will remain as monuments of the Post-tertiary
glacial epoch. Is it, then, probable that the geologist of the future
will find in the rocks formed out of the non-existing sea-bottom
more evidence of a glacial epoch during Post-tertiary times than we
now do of one, say, during the Miocene, Eocene, or Permian period?
Palaeontology can afford but little reliable information as to the
existence of former glacial periods.

manifestly escaped the notice of the authors that the phenomena
which they hare discovered were for the greater part already de
scribed by me in the January number of Wiedemann's Annaten,*
entitled " Ueber das Maximum der galvanischen Polarisation von
Platinelectroden in Schwefelsaure." In this research I have com
municated experiments on the influence of the concentration of the
acid, as well as the influence of the size of the electrodes, on the
value of the maximum polarization, and therefore also on the values
of the resistance of the voltameter which occur at the same time as
the values of the polarization. The subject of the researches of
 Messrs. Gee and Holden is exclusively the observation of the
 resistance; and it entirely confirms the results which I pub
 lished. As regards also the cause of the interesting phenomena,
 the authors confirm the conclusions which I have made known.
     I may therefore here restrict myself to a brief collation of those
 passages iu my paper from which are seen the ijreat variations in
 the values both of the polarization and of the resistance of a volta
 meter, which change with the magnitude of the resistance of the
 rheostat ; assuming that the voltameter contains sulphuric acid of
  47° to 57° per cent., and between a small polished platinum anode
 and a platinum kathode of any size and condition.
     The electromotive force of the polarizing current may amount to
  10-12 volts. If, then, the current is closed with a great resistance
  iu the rheostat, innumerable small bubbles of gas arise from the
  kathode as well as from the anode, the deflexion of the galvano
  meter is very constant; the resistance of the voltameter is greater
  than that given by the law of resistance of sulphuric acid, and its
  polarization somewhat less than if it had been tilled with acid of 40
  to 45 per cent.
      If, now, the resistance of the rheostat is diminished, the strength
   of the current at first increases, the number of bubbles of gas
  ascending from the electrodes increases, while their magnitude at
  first remains small. The needle of the reflecting-galvanometer
  of a sudden begins to oscillate strongly, and all at once sinks
   to a considerably smaller deflexion, making continually smaller
   oscillations about this. While a uniform current of small gas-
   bubbles continually ascends from the kathode, only larger gas-
   bubbles now rise from the anode with a hissing noise and at longer
   intervals, 1 to 3 bubbles in the second according to the strength of
   the current. This intermittent escape of gas-bubbles from the
   anode is the cause of the oscillations of the needle, which take place
   even with a strongly damped galvanometer. In this condition the
   polarization of the voltameter is 1 to 2 volts higher than in the
   preceding case ; its resistance, however, contrary to the law of
   resistance of sulphuric acid, is smaller than when it was filled
   with 40 to 45 per cent, sulphuric acid.
       We still more diminish the resistance of the interposed rheostat ;
   the current first of all increases. But suddenly the needle flies

back and sets continuously very near its position of rest. A small
but perfectly uniform stream of minute gas-bubbles still ascends
from the kathode, but the anode is covered with a thick bubble of
gas, and this only escapes every 10 to 20 seconds. As it escapes,
the current momentarily increases a little, and again decreases in
proportion as the new bubble forms. In this condition the resist
ance of the voltameter is of enormous magnitude ; but its polari
zation does not exceed that obtained by introducing a large rheostat-
resistance, or by filling the voltameter with 40 to 45 per cent, acid ;
it is only the resistance, and not the polarization, of the volta
meter which is of abnormal magnitude. On the other hand, in
what has been described above as the middle condition, both the
polarization and the resistance are of abnormal magnitude, the
former too large and the latter too small. I will, however, remark
that this middle condition is the less easy to obtain, the nearer
the concentration of the acid is to 60 per cent. The first condition
passes quickly into the third when the resistance of the rheostat
is diminished.
              PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
                                      Survey of India Offices, Calcutta,
Gentlemen,                                    January 7th, 1889.
      With reference to the very interesting article on " Photo
graphy of the Least Eefrangible Portion of the Solar Spectrum,"
by J. C. B. Burbank, which appears in your Journal for October
last, will you kindly permit me to point out that my early
results in photographing the lines on the less refrangible side of A,
which the author attributes to the use of turmeric, were for the most
part obtained on collodio-bromide plates stained with a blue dye,
(ordinary aniline blue), the lines in this part of the spectrum being
reversed, i.e. dark, on a clear ground. I found, however, at the same
time that some collodio-bromide plates, stained with the tincture of
the seeds of the annatto plant (Bixa orellana), not turmeric, were
unusually sensitive to the whole spectrum, so that I obtained the
spectrum up to A and traces of a line below it unreversed. Apart
from the reversing, the best results were secured with the Wue-stained
plates. An account of these experiments was published in the
Proceedings of the Boyal Society, No. 166 of 1876.
   I may take this opportunity of recommending the treatment of
cyanin proposed by Messrs. Wellington and Burbank. Plates
stained with the dye so treated are exceedingly sensitive in the red,
and work much cleaner than if stained with the ordinary cyanin.
On Wratten and Wainwright's ordinary plates so treated, I have
obtained very good small photos of the spectrum from C to A, but,
although there is a considerable extension of action below A, there
are only just traces of lines.
                                       I remain, Yours truly,

      ON SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH THE SPARK OF A LARGE
                      BATTERY. BY A. RIOHI.
   The battery which I have had made and which has given me the
best results, consists of 108 condensers. Each of them is a cylin
drical beaker more than half a metre high, and 16 centim. in
diameter. The coating extends to about half the height, and
each has a surface of about 1432 square centims. The glass is
rather more than a millim. thick, and, accordingly, the capacity of
each beaker is about 6270 electrostatic units (C. Q. 8.). The
arrangement of the conductors of the battery is that described in a
memoir on the electric spark, published by myself in 1875.
   The 108 jars are arranged in 6 batteries of 18 each arranged in
cascade, by which high potentials can be obtained. The terminal
coatings are connected with the conductors of a Holtz machine,
and the armature of the middle is put to earth. It has thus the
same capacity as if — 18 =3 jars together were joined as a battery,
with the armatures directly communicating with two conductors of
the machine ; hence the capacity of the system will be 18,810
electrostatic units (C. Gr. S.), or about ^ of a microfarad.
   The Holtz machine is like one which I have described else
where *, but has four disks. It ordinarily gives sparks more than
30 centim. in length ; and this even on the most humid days, for it
is enclosed in a glass case containing chloride of calcium, together
with a small frietional machine to give the initial charge. The
disks are unvarnished, and it is sufficient to clean it from time to
time with alcohol to obtain the best results.
   It happened more than once that the battery discharged through
the machine, leaving deep marks on the disks, and one discharge
even perforated two of the large sides of the glass case. In order to
prevent these evils, and also for the protection of the person who
worked the machine, I connected the two conductors and the ter
minal coatings of the battery by a long glass tube filled with water.
With this arrangement, if the discharge took place in the machine
it could not do any damage, nor be dangerous, for there is a very
 high resistance in the circuit. The connexions with the apparatus
in which are produced the discharges to be studied are metallic,
being made with long wide brass tubes.
    This battery, which has served me for experimentally illus
 trating a special course on atmospheric electricity, gives on a
still larger scale the remarkable effects which I have elsewhere
 describedt- For instance, if in the circuit we place two brass
 spheres 6 to 7 centim. in diameter, at distances of 5 to 10 centim.
 apart, and place beween them a flat strip of glass 5 metres long or
 more, coated with zinc-filings like the magic pane, we obtain on
 the strip, instead of the usual luminous ramifications, a loud and
   » Degcrizione ed ueo di una macchina fyc. still Acc. di Bologna, 1879.

large spark, 5 metres or longer ; and with this experiment we can
account in part for the enormous length of lightning-flashes, assu
ming that the filings represent the minute droplets of water
suspended in the atmosphere. Along the surfaces of water (in my
case placed in as many large glass troughs arranged in series) we
obtain a discharge more than a metre in length, and of equal
length if discharged through a large gas-flame.
   The following is the new experiment which has given occasion
to this Note.
   A platinum wire, 3£ metreB in length (or even a little longer)
and      of a millim. in diameter, being fused by the discharge, is
instantly changed into a beautiful corona o2 incandescent globules ;
but if we take a shorter path in the same wire, for instance a
metre and a half, we observe the following curious phenomenon.
The moment the discharge takes place, a white spark a metre and a
half in length is observed in the place occupied by the wire, which
is rectilinear if the wire is straight, but follows the shape of the
wire if bent. Of course no trace is observed in the wire behind
the spark ; there is only produced from this long spark a little
smoke with a characteristic odour.
   With iron, brass, or gold wire, with a thin and very narrow ribbon
of steel, or of magnesium, or tinfoil, an analogous phenomenon is
observed. The spark becomes yellow with iron and with gold, and
green with copper. With these metals the smoke of the discharge
is more dense and abundant, but does not produce the penetrating
odour which platinum does.
   The formation of this spark may be explained as follows.
The first portions of the discharge are sufficient to convert the
wire into the state of vapour ; the remainder of the discharge
then finds a column of metallic vapour at a high temperature which
offers an easy path. It forms instantaneously, as it were, a
Greissler's tube, the sides of which are formed of the surrounding
cold air, full of rarefied gas, because at a high temperature.
   To test this explanation, I devised the following experiment.
Above about the middle of the wire A B (which is stretched between
two stouter ones) I place a conductor with a knob 0, which is con
nected with the stout wire to which A is attached. If the above
explanation is correct, this is what should happen. The moment the
discharge takes place, this should commence by traversing the wire
A B and volatilizing it, provided the knob is at a suitable distance
from the wire ; but then, instead of forming a spark from A to B
 through the metallic vapour, it should form one simply from C to B.
Then the wire should evaporate altogether, but the large spark appear
only on the right of C.
   Having frequently made the experiment, I have observed that it
 succeeds completely as prevised, and that the moment the discharge
 passes all the wire evaporates, and only a spark passes from C to B.

       MEASUREMENTS OF RADIATION ON THE SONNBLICK. IN
             FEBRUARY 1888. BY DR. J. M. PERNTER.
   The observations were made with Violle's actinometers, which
were modified so as to measure the radiation, and were simulta
neously effected on the Sonnblick (3095 metres) and the Eauris
(900 metres).
   The value of the radiation S, in Eauris, at a temperature of
 — 8° C, was found to be 0*151 calorie ; and on the Sonnblick, with
a temperature of —15°, it was S.,=0-201 calorie (gramme minute).
   From this the temperature of cosmical space is calculated to be
-1110 C.
   It follows moreover from this that the entire atmosphere possesses
imit power of absorption for rays proceeding from the earth. This,
however, is not the case with the atmosphere on high mountains
such as the Sonnblick. Hence no rays pass into the cosmical
space from the lower levels, that is, from the greater part of the
earth's surface, as maintained by Langley ; but they do so pass
from the tops of the hills.
    As, for the future, we are able to calculate the radiation of the
atmosphere from an observation of radiation, and the coefficient of
radiation for the entire atmosphere is equal to unity, we cau deter
 mine the mean temperature of the atmosphere from each measure
 ment of radiation, for <r=AT\
    From a comparison with measurements of Maurer, in Zurich, it
 follows that the radiation of the atmosphere o.ily depends on its
 temperature, and, as a further conclusion, on the temperature
 observed on the earth's surface.
    It can moreover be easily calculated from the above that, with
 complete absence of the sun, the mean temperature of the earth
 would be lowered by 103°, that is would amount to — 8S° C.
     By the aid of the results of measurements of the radiation the"
 solar constant may, curiously enough, be calculated with at least
 the same accuracy as from direct measurements of the solar radia
 tion. It is about 3"1 calories.—Berichte der Wiener Akademie,

       THEORY OF ISOHYDRIC SOLUTIONS. BY SV. ARRHENIUS.
     The author has applied the term isohydric to two solutions the
 conductivities of which are not altered when they are mixed (Wied.
 Ann. vol. xxx. p. 51, 1887). According to the author's views,
 what is called the electrolytic dissociation (into ions) of the two
 electrolytes is unaltered in these circumstances when they are
  mixed. Since, according to the investigations of Van't Hoff, the
  same conditions of equilibrium hold for dilute solutions as for
 gases, from the principle of entropy we can establish the conditions
  which two isohydric solutions must obey, so that on mixture their
  condition of dissociation is not altered. These conditions lead to
    v'

288           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the result that isohydric solutions contain equal dissociated parts
per unit of volume. The author compares this theoretical conclu
sion with the results of his determinations of isohydric solutions,
and finds a satisfactory agreement in the twenty-two cases which
can be calculated. The author deduces further in the same way
the general properties of isohydric solutions as found experi
mentally.
   If to a solution of an electrolyte, a second electrolyte is added
which has one ion common with the first, the state of equilibrium
between the non-dissociated and the dissociated parts (the ions) of
the first electrolyte is displaced, and so that the dissociation is
less. This is particularly remarkable when the first electrolyte is a
feeble acid or base. As moreover, according to the author, the
facility with which a body reacts is proportional to the dissociated
portion, then from the general conditions of equilibrium the in
fluence of extraneous electrolytes on the velocity of reaction may
be calculated. Such a calculation has been made for the case for
merly investigated experimentally by the author, the saponification
of ethyle acetate by ammonia, and yields results which agree with
experiment. The author concludes from this calculation, that all
ammonia salts act in this cose in the same manner, as has been
found. Other regularities observed in saponification may be de
duced in the same way.
   The author proves in conclusion, that if quantities a, I, c, d of
four isohydric solutions of electrolytes, I,J., \i„ IjJ,, and IaJa, are
mixed with each other, there can be no chemical change between
these four bodies, provided only a . d=b . c. A similar conclusion
can be drawn for any given number of electrolytes. The chemical
equilibrium between several electrolytes in the same solution may
consequently be calculated from these regularities.—Zeitschrift fur

             ON AN ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTINOMETEB.
                    BY MM. GOUY AND RIGOLLOT.
   Two copper plates, one of which was heated in a Bunsen's flame
until the iridescent colours disappeared and the plate had become
of a homogeneous brown, while the other is bright, or both are
oxidized, are immersed in solution of sodium chloride. When
light falls on an oxidized plate it becomes more strongly positive.
The action is instantaneous and disappears in darkness : the ap
paratus is sensitive to all colours. On closing the circuit by a few
ohms resistance the alteration of electromotive force is somewhat
greater. Bromides act similarly, iodides somewhat more feebly.
When the copper plates are heated too strongly they become less
sensitive. They may advantageously be coated on the back with
paraffin during cooling.— Comptes Rendvs, p. 1470 (1888) ;

              XXXIV. On Rays of Electric Force.
                    By Prof. Dr. H. Hertz*.
AFTER I had succeeded in showing that an electric oscil
        lation could give rise to a wave capable of radiating
into space, I at once made the attempt to intensify this effect
and to make it sensible at greater distances by placing the
exciting conductor in the focus of a large parabolic mirror.
These attempts did not succeed, and I convinced myself that
the failure was the necessary result of the wrong proportion
existing between the length of the waves employed, viz. 4 to
5 metres, and the dimensions of the mirror in the most favour
able case possible. I have lately observed that the experiments
described by me can quite well be performed with oscillations
more than ten times as rapid, and with waves more than ten
times as short as those at first discovered. I have therefore
returned to the use of concave mirrors, and have attained
better results than I had ventured to expect. I have suc
ceeded in producing distinct rays of electric force, and in
performing with them the elementary experiments which one
is accustomed to perform with light and with radiant heat.
An account is here given of these experiments.
                           The Apparatus.
    The method of producing short waves is the same as that
 by which the longer waves were excited. The primary con-

 ductor employed may be most simply described as follows : —
 Imagine a cylindrical brass body, of 3 centim. diameter and
 26 centim. length, interrupted in the middle of its length by
 a spark-space of which the poles on each side consist of sphe
 rical surfaces of 2 centim. radius. The length of the conductor
 is nearly equal to half the wave-length of the corresponding
 oscillations in straight wires ; we can thus form at once an
 approximate estimate of the period of oscillation. It is essen
 tial that the pole-surfaces of the spark-interval should be
 frequently polished, and during the experiments carefully
guarded against illumination by simultaneous lateral dis
charges, otherwise the oscillations are not obtained.
    The aspect and the sound of the spark both give notice
whether the spark-interval is in a satisfactory condition. The
discharge is conducted to the two halves of the conductor by
means of two thick wires covered with gutta-percha, which
terminate near the spark-interval on the two sides. As induc-
torium I found it advantageous to employ, instead of the
large Eiihmkorff's apparatus, a small coil by Keiser and
Schmidt, capable of giving sparks of, at most, 4-5 centim.
length. It was worked by three accumulators, and gave
between the spherical surfaces of the primary conductor
sparks of from 1 to 2 centim. long. The spark- interval was
then adjusted for the experiments to a length of about
3 millim.
    The evidence of the electric forces in space was obtained
here also by means of the small sparks which they produced in
a secondary conductor. As before, I made use partly of a
movable circle, which had an oscillation-period nearly equal
to that of the primary conductor. This had now a diameter
of 7*5 centim., and was constructed of copper wire 1 millim.
thick. The one end of the wire carried a polished brass ball
of some millimetres diameter ; the other end was pointed, and
was adjusted by means of a fine screw, insulated from the
wire, to an extremely small distance from the brass ball. It
will easily be understood that we have to do only with little
sparks of a few hundredths of a millimetre in length, and a
little practice enables one to judge better from the brightness
of the sparks than from their length.
    The circular conductor gives only a differential effect, and
is not suitable for placing in the focal line of a concave
mirror; it was therefore combined with another secondary
conductor of the following form :—Two straight pieces of
wire, 50 centim. long and 5 millim. diameter, were so ar
ranged in the same straight line that the opposing ends were
5 centim. apart. From these ends two wires, 15 centim.

             Prof. Hertz on Rays of Electric Force.             291
long and 1 millim. thick, led, parallel to each other and at
right angles to the first-mentioned wires, to a spark-interval
similarly arranged to that of the circular conductor. In this
conductor no attention was paid to resonance, which is here
not very perceptible. It would have been more simple to
place the spark-interval directly in the middle of the straight
wire ; but the spark-interval could not then have been mani
pulated and observed in the focus of the concave mirror
without the observer obstructing the aperture of the mirror.
For this reason the arrangement described was preferred as
more advantageous.
                   The Production of the Ray.
   If the primary vibration be now set up in a large free
space, the circular conductor in ita neighbourhood permits
the observation, on a smaller scale, of all the phenomena
which I had previously observed and described in the neigh
bourhood of a larger oscillation*.
   The greatest distance at which sparks could be recognized
in the secondary conductor was 1*5 metre, or as much as
2 metres with a favourable condition of the primary spark-
interval.
   The effect is increased on either side if a plane conducting
surface is adjusted on the opposite side, parallel to the oscilla
tion and at a suitable distance. If the distance is chosen
either very small or somewhat greater than 30 centim. the
surface produces a prejudicial effect ; it produces a strong
reinforcement at distances between 8 and 15 centim., a feeble
reinforcement at 45 centim., and is without effect at greater
distances. We have previously remarked upon this pheno
menon, and we conclude from it that the wave corresponding
to the primary oscillation has, in air, a half wave-length of
about 30 centim. We might expect a still greater reinforce
ment by replacing the plane surface by a concave mirror of
the form of a parabolic cylinder, in the focus of which the
longer axis of the primary oscillation falls. If the mirror is
properly to concentrate the action at a distance, it is advan
tageous to have its focal length as small as possible. But if
the direct wave is not immediately to quench the action of the
reflected wave, the focal length must not be much less than a
quarter of a wave-length. I chose therefore a focal length of
12£ centim., and constructed the mirror by bending a zinc
plate, 2 metres long, 2 metres broad, and £ millim. thick,
round a wooden frame of the right curvature into the desired
     * H. Hertz, Wiedemann's Annalen, xxxiv. pp. 155, 651, COO.

  form. The height of the mirror thus became 2 metres, the
 diameter of its aperture 1*2 metre, and its depth 0*7 metre.
 The primary oscillation was adjusted in the centre of its focal
 line. The wires by which the discharge was conducted were
 allowed to traverse the mirror ; the inductorium and the accu
 mulators were placed behind the mirror, and produced no
 disturbance. If, now, we examine the neighbourhood of the
 vibration by means of our conductors, we find no action
 behind the mirror and at one side in general ; but in the direc
 tion of the optic axis of the mirror the sparks are perceptible
 to a distance of 5 or 6 metres. By placing a plane conducting
 surface at right angles to the advancing wave the sparks were
 perceptible near it to a much greater distance—as much as 9
 or 10 metres.
    The waves reflected by the conducting surface strengthen
 the direct waves at certain points. At other points, again,
 the two waves weaken each other. With the straight con
 ductor we can recognize very distinct maxima and minima in
 front of the plane conductor, and with the circular conductor
 the interference phenomena characteristic of stationary waves,
 which I have previously described. I was able to disinguish
 four nodes which fell on the wall, at 33, at 65, and at 98 centim.
 distance from it respectively. Hence we have 33 centim.
 as a close approximation to the half wave-length of the waves
 employed, and an oscillation-period of l'l thousand millionths
 of a second, assuming the velocity of light for the velocity of
 radiation. In wires the oscillation had a wave-length of
 29 centim. It seems, then, that also with these short waves
 the velocity is somewhat less in wires than the velocity in
 space ; but the ratio of the two velocities comes very near to
the theoretical value of 1, and does not deviate from it so
much as our experiments with longer waves made probable.
This remarkable phenomenon still requires explanation. Since
these phenomena are manifested
hood of the optic axis of the mirror, we designate the result
as an electric ray issuing from the concave mirror.
    I now made a second concave mirror exactly similar to the
first, and placed the straight secondary conductor in it, so
that the two 50 centim. long wires fell in the focal line, but
the two wires leading to the spark-interval traversed the wall
of the mirror (being insulated from it) by the shortest route.
The spark-interval was thus close behind the mirror, and the
observer could adjust and observe it without interrupting the
course of the waves. I expected that on intercepting the ray
by this arrangement I should be able to recognize it at still
greater distances, and 1 found that I was not mistaken. In

             Prof. Hertz on Rays of Electric Force.          293
the space at my disposal I could recognize the sparks from
one end to the other. The greatest distance to which—by
making use of an open door—I could trace the ray was 16
metres ; but the results of the experiments on reflexion, to
be described immediately, leave no doubt that in open spaces
sparks could be obtained up to at least 20 metres. For the
remaining experiments so great a distance is not necessary,
and it is more convenient if the secondary spark is not too
weak ; a distance of 6-10 metres is the most advantageous for
most experiments. We will now describe the simple experi
ments which may be made with the ray without difficulty.
When the opposite is not expressly remarked, the focal lines
of both mirrors are to be supposed vertical.
                     Rectilinear Radiation.
   If a screen of zinc plate 2 metres high and 1 metre broad
be placed in the straight line joining the two mirrors at right
angles to the direction of the ray, the secondary sparks com
pletely disappear. A screen of tin-foil or of gilt paper gives
an equally perfect shadow. A frame placed across the ray
leaves the secondary spark-interval dark whenever it intercepts
the ray, and permits the sparks to appear whenever it allows the
ray to pass. Insulators do not intercept the ray—it passes
through a screen of wood or through a wooden door, and it
is not without surprise that we see the sparks produced inside
a closed room. If two conducting screens, each 2 metres
high and 1 metre broad, are placed diametrically right and
left near the ray and at right angles to its direction, they
do not influence the secondary sparks at all, so long as the
breadth of the slit which they leave between them is not
smaller than the aperture of the mirror, that is 1*2 metres.
If the slit is made narrower than this, the sparks diminish
and disappear when the breadth of the slit becomes less than
0*5 metre. If the breadth of the slit be left 1*2 metres, but
the screens be moved sideways out of the direct line joining
the two mirrors, the sparks also disappear. If the producing
mirror be turned right or left, through about 10° out of the
correct position, the sparks become weaker, and when turned
through 15° the sparks disappear.
   The ray has no geometrically sharp limit or shadow, and it
is easy to obtain phenomena due to refraction, but I have not
yet succeeded in observing maxima and minima at the edge
of a shadow.
                          Polarization.
    The mode of production of our ray leaves no doubt that it

294          Prof. Hertz on Rays of Electric Force.
consists in transverse vibrations, and can be " plane-polarized "
in the optical sense. This fact, however, may also be shown
by experiment. If the receiving mirror be rotated round the
ray as axis until its focal line, and consequently also the
secondary conductor, have attained the horizontal position,
the secondary sparks disappear gradually, and no sparks are
to be obtained when the two focal lines are at right angles,
even if the two mirrors are made to approach each other
closely. The two mirrors behave like the polarizer and
analyzer of a polarizing apparatus. I had made an octagonal
frame of wood 2 metres high and 2 metres broad, and wound
copper of 1 millim. thick wire over this, so that the wires
 were all parallel and 3 centim. from each other. If now
the two mirrors were arranged with parallel focal lines,
 and the wire screen was moved about in the ray at right
angles to its direction so that the wires were at right angles
to the plane of the focal lines, the screen produced practically
 no effect upon the secondary sparks ; but if the screen was
 placed so that its wires were parallel to the plane of the focal
 lines, the ray disappeared altogether. Thus, in regard to the
 transmitted energy, the screen behaves to the ray exactly
 like a tourmaline plate to a plane-polarized ray. The focal
 line of the receiving mirror was then placed horizontal, in
 which position, as already mentioned, no sparks were ob
 tained, nor were sparks produced by the introduction of the
 screen into the ray, so long as its wires were either vertical or
 horizontal. But if the wire frame was placed in either of
 the two possible positions so that its wires made an angle of
 45° with the horizontal line, the introduction of the screen
 caused the production of sparks. Evidently the screen pro
 duces the resolution of the vibrations into two components,
 and transmits only that vibration which takes place at right
 angles to the direction of the wires. This component is
 inclined at an angle of 45° to the focal line of the second
 mirror, and when once more resolved by the mirror produces
 the action upon the secondary conductor. The phenomenon
 is exactly similar to the brightening produced in the dark
 field of two crossed nicols by a tourmaline plate introduced
 in the proper position.
    The following remarks upon the subject of polarization may
 be permitted. With the means employed in the present in
 vestigation we are only able to recognize electric force. Its
 vibrations undoubtedly take place, for a vertical position of
 the primary vibration, in the vertical plane passing through
 the ray, and are wanting in the horizontal plane. But from
 the phenomena we observe with slowly changing currents we

               Prof. Hertz on Rays of Electric Force.        295
  cannot doubt that the electric vibrations are accompanied by
  vibrations of magnetic force, which take place in the hori
  zontal plane and become zero in the vertical plane. The
  question in which of the two planes the vibrations of our ray
  take place does not, then, admit of an answer without data to
  determine whether the question is of electric or of magnetic
  vibrations. That the failure to decide an old optical dispute
  is explained by this consideration was first clearly pointed
  out by Herr Kolacek *.
                            Reflexion.
     We have already proved the reflexion of the wave at a con
 ducting surface by the interference'of the reflected and direct
 waves, and have made use of it in the construction of our
 concave mirrors. But it is now possible for us to separate
 the two wave-systems. I placed the two concave mirrors
 in an open space side by side, so that their apertures faced
 the same way, and that their axes converged upon a point
 about 3 metres off. The spark-space of the receiving mirror
 of course remained dark. Now I placed a vertical plane
 wall of thin zinc plate 2 metres high and 2 metres broad at
 the intersection of the axes, so as to be equally inclined to
 them both. I then obtained a long stream of sparks result
 ing from the reflected rays. The stream of sparks ceased as
 soon as the wall was turned about a vertical axis either way
through about 1 5° from the correct position ; hence the re
 flexion is regular, and not diffuse. If the wall was removed
from the mirrors, their axes being made to converge always
upon the wall, the sparks diminished very slowly. 1 was still
able to recognize sparks when the wall was distant 10 metres
from the mirrors ; the waves had then to traverse a path of
20 metres. This arrangement might be employed with ad
vantage if it were desired to compare the velocity of radiation
in the air with other slower velocities of propagation, e.g.
that by means of a cord.
    In order to obtain the reflexion of the ray at incidences
other than normal, I arranged the ray parallel to a wall in
which there was a door, and in the neighbouring room to
which the door led I placed the receiving mirror so that its
optic axis traversed the centre of the door and cut the direc
tion of the ray at right angles. If, now, the plane conducting
screen was placed vertically at the point of intersection so as
to make angles of 45° both with the ray and with the axes of
the receiving mirror, a stream of sparks was produced in the
               * Wiedemann's Annalen, xxxiv. p. 676.

296          Prof. Hertz on Rays of Electric Force.
secondary conductor which also was not interfered with by
the closing of the door. If the reflecting screen was turned
through about 10° from the right position, the sparks ceased.
The reflexion is therefore regular, and the angles of incidence
and reflexion are equal. That the action was transmitted
from the source to the plane mirror and from there to the
secondary conductor could also be shown by interposing
shadow-giving screens at different points of this path, when
the secondary sparks at once ceased, whilst the screen could
be placed anywhere else in the room without effect. With
the aid of the circular secondary conductor it is possible to
determine the position of the wave-surface in the ray; this
was at right angles to the ray, both before and after reflexion,
so that in the reflexion it suffers a deviation of 90°.
    So far the focal lines of the concave mirrors have been
 vertical, and the plane of vibration consequently at right angles
 to the plane of incidence. In order to produce reflexion
 with the vibrations in the plane of incidence, I adjusted the
focal lines of both concave mirrors in the horizontal plane.
I observed the same phenomena as in the former case, and
 was moreover not able to perceive a difference in the intensity
 of the reflected rays in the two cases. If, on the other hand,
 the focal line of the one mirror is vertical and that of the
 other horizontal, no secondary sparks are to be perceived.
 The inclination of the plane of vibration to the plane of inci
 dence is therefore not altered by reflexion so long as this
 inclination has one of the values mentioned; but this state
 ment cannot be taken as generally true. It may even be
 considered as open to doubt whether generally the ray after
 reflexion is plane-polarized. The interferences which the
 intersecting systems of waves produce before the mirror and
 which, as I observed, give rise to characteristic phenomena in
 the circular conductor, may possibly lead to conclusions in the
 current problems of the optician as to change of phase and
 amplitude upon reflexion.
    I will mention one other experiment on reflexion by an
 isotropic surface. The two curved mirrors were again placed
 side by side as in the experiment on reflexion first described,
 and opposite to them as a reflecting wall the screen, constructed
 of parallel copper wires, was placed.
    It was seen that the secondary spark-interval remained
 dark when the wires intersected the direction of the vibrations
 at right angles, but became brighter as soon as the wires coin
 cided with the direction of vibration. The analogy between
 our surface conducting in one direction and the tourmaline plate
 is therefore limited to the transmitted portion of the ray. The

             Prof. Hertz on Rays of Electric Force.         297
part not transmitted is absorbed by the tourmaline plate but
reflected by our surface. If in the last experiment the focal
lines of the two mirrors are crossed, we can obtain no sparks
in the secondary conductor by reflexion at an isotropic sur
face ; but I convinced myself that the experiment succeeds
with reflexion at an anisotropic wire screen, if so placed that
its wires are inclined at an angle of 45° to both focal lines.
The experiment is easily understood from what has been said.
                           Refraction.
    In order to try if a bending of the ray could be observed
 upon its passing from air into another insulating medium, I
 had constructed a large prism of so-called hard pitch, an
 asphalt-like material. The base was an equilateral triangle
 1*2 metre in the side, and with a refracting angle of about
 30°. The height of the prism with its refracting edge
 placed vertical was about I'D metre.
    But since the prism weighed about 12 cwt. and altogether
 was inconveniently heavy, it was constructed in three pieces,
 each about 0"5 metres high, placed one on the other. The
 mass was cast in wooden boxes, which, since they would have
 no prejudicial effect, were left round the mass. The prism
 was placed in a support at such a height that the centre of its
 refracting edge was at the same height as the primary and
 secondary spark-intervals. After I had convinced myself
 that refraction did occur, and had formed an opinion as to its
 amount, I arranged the experiment as follows:—The produ
 cing mirror was placed at a distance of 2"6 metres from the
 prism, turned towards the one refracting surface, so that the
 axis of the ray passed through the centre of gravity of the
 prism and intersected the refracting surface at an angle of
 65°. Two conducting-screens were placed near the refracting
 edge of the prism and near the opposite side, which cut off
 from the ray every other part than that through the prism.
  On the side of the emerging ray a circle was traced upon the
 floor of 2*5 metres radius, with the centre of gravity of the
  prism as centre. The receiving mirror was moved about
  upon this, so that its aperture was always directed towards
  the centre of the circle. If the mirror were placed in
  the line of the incident ray, no sparks were to be obtained
  in it; in this direction the prism threw a perfect shadow.
  Sparks, however, appeared when the mirror was moved
  towards the second surface of the prism, and first when the
  angular displacement was about 11°. The sparks increased
  in intensity up to a deviation of about 22° and then decreased
  again, becoming imperceptible at about 34°. If the mirror

  298         Lord Rayleigh on the Limit to Interference
  was adjusted in the position where the strongest effect was ob
  served, and withdrawn from the prism along a radius of the
 circle, the sparks could be recognized up to a distance of 5 or
  6 metres. A screen placed in front of or behind the prism
 always quenched the sparks; a proof that the action occurred
  in fact through the prism, and did not reach the secondary
 conductor by any other part. The experiments were repeated
 after placing the focal lines horizontal, but without altering
 the position of the prism. No alteration in the phenomena
 produced was observed. A refracting angle of 30° and
 a deviation of 22° in the neighbourhood of minimum devia
 tion corresponds to a refractive index of 1*69. The refractive
 index for light is given for pitch-like substances between 1*5
 and 1*6. The uncertainty of our determination and the im
 purity of the material employed does not permit of our
 assigning greater importance to the magnitude or signification
 of this difference.
     We have represented the phenomena investigated by us as
 rays of electric force. We may in conclusion perhaps regard
 them as light-rays of very great wave-length. To me at least
 the experiments described seem eminently fitted to remove all
 doubt as to the identity of light, radiant heat, ard electrody-
 namic wave-motion. I believe that we shall now with more
 confidence avail ourselves of the advantages which the assump
 tion of this identity offers, both in the domains of optics and
 of electricity.
  XXXV. On the Limit to Interference when Light is radiated
          from Moving Molecules. By Lord Ratleigh*.
 IN a recent number of Wiedemann's Annalen, Ebertt
        discusses the application of Doppler's principle to the
 radiation from the moving molecules of an incandescent gas J,
 and arrives at the conclusion that the widths of the spectral
lines, as calculated upon the basis of the principle, are much
greater than is consistent with experiments upon interference
with a large relative retardation. This is a matter of no small
importance. Unless the discrepancy can be explained, the
dynamical theory of gases would, it appears to me, have received
a heavy blow, from which it could with difficulty recover. If
it be true that a gas consists of molecules in irregular motion,

        when Light is radiated from Moving Molecules.           299
and that for the most part each molecule radiates independ
ently, there seems no escape from the conclusion that the
character of the aggregate radiation must be governed by
Doppler's principle.
   If r be the velocity of a molecule, 8 the inclination of its
motion to the line of sight, the natural wave-frequency N is
changed by the motion into n, where

and V is the velocity of light.         If A, X be the original and
altered wave-lengths, so that
                     A = V/N,      \=V/n;                        (2)

when v/Y is small.
   As a first approximation, Ebert supposes that the velocity v
of every molecule is the same. In this case the spectral band,
 into which what would otherwise be a mathematical line is
 dilated, has the limiting wave-frequencies
                   N(1+?>            N(1-?)                      w
 and between these limits is of uniform brightness.              For
 the number of molecules whose lines of motion lie between 8
 and 8 + dd is proportional to sin 8 d8, and this again by (1) is
 proportional to dn. It is here assumed that the spectrum is
 formed upon a scale of wave-frequencies ; but for the present
 purpose the range concerned is so small that it becomes a
 matter of indifference upon what principle the spectrum is
 disposed.
    The typical case of interference arises when two streams of
 homogeneous light are superposed, which differ in nothing
 but phase. If 8 denote this difference of phase, the vibrations
 may be represented by
                       cos ifr + cos (yjr + 8),
 or by
                       2cosi8cos(^ + £8);                        (5)

 If the two streams are obtained by reflexion at the opposite
 faces of a parallel plate, the circumstances are somewhat more
 complicated. But the simple theory is applicable even here
 as a first approximation, which becomes more and more rigo
 rous as the difference of optical quality between the plate and
 the medium in contact with it is supposed to diminish. If p
 be the index of the plate, A its thickness,

 If the plate be of air, fi = l. In any case the variation of ft
 is small compared to that of n ; so that if A denote the equi
valent thickness of air, we may take

a function of n—the frequency, as well as of A and V.
    If now the light be heterogeneous, we have nothing further
to do than to integrate (8) with respect to n, after introduc
tion of a factor t such that i dn represents the illumination
corresponding to dn*. In the present case, where the inten
sity is supposed to be uniform within limits «] and «j, and to
vanish outside them, we have

infinitely small, so that

        when Light is radiated from Moving Molecules.         301
So long as a is small, the mode of interference is nearly the
same as if v = 0. This will be the case when A is sufficiently
small, so that at first the bands are absolutely black. As A
increases, the distinctness of the bands will depend mainly
upon the relative brightnesses of the least and most illuminated
parts. If we call this ratio h, and denote by a the numerical
value of (10), we have
                        A=(l-a)/(l+a),                        (12)
or
                        a = (l-/t)/(l + /t)                   (13)
   Now from (10) it appears that when a. is equal to ir, or to
any multiple of ir, a = 0, and the field is absolutely uniform.
Between values of a equal to ir and 2tt, 2tt and 37r, and so on,
there are revivals of distinctness, the maxima of which occur
at values not far removed from |w, f ir, &c. Thus, between
                                                                2
7r and 2ir there is to be found a value of a at least equal to g—,
corresponding to A= § nearly. At this stage the bands should
certainly be visible.
   In order to estimate at what point the interference-bands
would first disappear as A increases, we must make some
supposition as to the largest value of h indistinguishable in
experiment from unity. Under favourable circumstances in
other respects we may perhaps assume for this purpose A = '95,
so that a = "025. Since a is small, a is nearly equal to ir.
We ma)- take approximately sin a = -025 ir, or a = -975 ir. In
fact, so long as we take h nearly equal to unity, the precise
value makes very little difference to the corresponding value
of a, and for the purposes of such a discussion as the present
we may suppose with sufficient accuracy a,=ir. In this case,

which gives the retardation (2A) measured in wave-lengths
in the neighbourhood of which the bands would first disappear.
This estimate differs widely from that put forward by Ebert.
The latter is equivalent to
According to my calculation the value of a corresponding to
(15) would be 54°, a would be "86, and h would be -075 ; so
that the bands should be hardly distinguishable from those
which occur when A = 0.

302          Lord Rayleigh on the Limit to Interference
   For the grounds of his estimate Ebert refers to an earlier
paper *, in which, however, the calculation seems to relate to
a problem materially different from the present, that, namely,
in which the refrangibility of the light is limited to two dis
tinct values (as approximately in the case of the soda lines),
instead of being distributed equally over the same range. In
this case (9) is replaced by

   According to (16) the field is first uniform when en = \tr,
instead of 7r, as from (9). When a.=ir, the bands are again
black, and as A further increases there is a strictly periodic
alternation between blackness and absolute disappearance of
the bands.
   The substitution for a spectral band of uniform brightness
of one in which the illumination is all condensed at the edges
explains a large part of the discrepancy between ( 1 4) and (15) ;
but even in the latter problem (15) seems to be a very small
estimate of A. According to (15), a = 54°, cos a = *59 ; so
that from (17) h = '26. Bands of which the darkest parts
are of only one quarter of the illumination of the brightest
parts could hardly be invisible.
    The more nearly correct formula (14) is itself, however,
based upon the assumption that all the vibrating molecules
move with the same velocity. This is the origin of the law
expressed in (9), according to which the bands should re
appear at a retardation greater than that of first disappearance.
But the real law of the distribution of velocity is that dis
covered by Maxwell, if there is any truth in the molecular
theoryf. That such is the case is recognized by Ebert ; and
he argues that the broadening of the spectral band due to
velocities higher than the mean, will entail a further diminu
tion in the maximum retardation consistent with visible inter
ference f. I proceed to the actual calculation of the maximum
retardation on the basis of Maxwell's law.

conditions ; the one is in truth as much an interference phenomenon as
the other " (Enc. Brit.,Wave Theory, vol. xxiv. p. 425). It is obvious that
nothing could give rise in the spectroscope to a mathematical line of
light, but an infinite train of waves of harmonic type and of absolute
regularity.

 tion is sensibly greater than that calculated (14) upon the
 supposition that all the molecules move with the mean velocity
 v, and as much as 4£ times greater than that (15) taken by
 Ebert as the basis of his comparison with observation.
    Under these circumstances it would seem that there is no
 discrepancy remaining to be explained. It is true that the
 width of spectral lines is not wholly due to movement of the
 molecules ; but it is possible that this is the principal cause
 of dilatation when the flames are coloured by the spray of
 very dilute solutions, as in Ebert's use of the method of
  Gouy *. Again, it is true that interference-bands are often
  observed under conditions less favourable than is supposed
  in the above estimate of h. In Michelson's method, however,
 the bands may be very black at small retardations ; and it
 seems very probable that at higher retardations bands in
 volving even less than five per cent, of the brightness might
 be visible. The question is one of very great interest, and I
 hope that Herr Ebert will pursue his investigations until it is
  thoroughly cleared up.

            XXXVI. On the Law of Molecular Force.
            By William Sutherland, M.A., B.Sc*
IN the Philosophical Magazine for August 1886, and July
      and August 1887, I advanced the hypothesis that the
law of molecular force is that of the inverse fourth power of
the distance, and considered how far its consequences har
monize with the results of the experiments of Thomson and
Joule on the expansion of gases through porous plugs, and
with the experiments of Amagat and Andrews on the volume
occupied by C03 at different temperatures and pressures. In
the present paper I shall discuss the same law in the light of
the recent beautiful discoveries of Eotvos and Robert Schiff
in capillarity, and shall show, as the chief result of the inquiry,
the following law of the parameter A in the expression 3Am2/?A,
which expresses the force between two similar molecules of
mass to at distance r apart, the law of their mutual potential
. .        Am2
being       pp.
   In compounds containing C, 0, and H the molecule may
be considered to have a volume, to which each atom of H
contributes an amount very small in comparison with that
contributed by an atom of 0 and of C ; while an atom of 0,
 when singly bound to another atom, contributes an amount
equal to that of two carbon atoms, and when doubly bound
equal to that of three carbon atoms. The volume of such a
 molecule can then be expressed in terms of that of a carbon
atom, and the parameter A varies inversely as the surface of the
molecule.
    By the volume of a molecule I do not mean what is usually
called the molecular volume (an objectionable term, which I
would propose to replace by the term molecular domain), but
the actual volume of the molecule. Another result of the
investigation will be to show that the rate of change of the
translatory kinetic energy of nearly all liquid molecules with
temperature is the same when measured at low constant
pressure.
   E6tvos(Wiedemann,xxvii.)announces the following remark
 able law :—The rate of variation with temperature of the
 product of the surface-tension of a liquid by its molecular
 domain raised to the power two thirds, is the same for all
 liquids ; or, in symbols, if a denote surface-tension, and v
molecular domain,

He found this to hold for a large number of liquids ; and also
that water, the alcohols, and the fatty acids are exceptional at
the lower ranges of temperature. The theoretical grounds on
 which he founds the law are, in the present state of physics,
somewhat transcendental ; but as they illustrate the power of
the idea of " correspondence," which Van der Waals has"deve-
loped so brilliantly, they can be reproduced herewith advantage.
   Let v be the domain of a molecule when it is part of a mass
of liquid, and w when part of a mass of gas at the same tem
perature as the liquid ; then, if the temperatures Tj and Ta
for two substances are chosen so that v1lu1 = v2/it3, the con
ditions of the molecules are considered by Eotvos to " corre
spond." This equation may be written
                       viPifli=v,n/I»;                        (1)
where pt and p2 are the pressures of saturation at the tempe
ratures Tj and Ta, if we consider the vapours of the liquids as
approximately perfect gases. Then, according to the method
of " correspondence," it is stated that the forces .acting on the
two molecules and the energies of the two molecules corre
spond. Consider a plane area over which n molecules are
distributed. The pressure on it is npyvfy; the tension across
a line in the surface-film on which I molecules lies is lvilau
where ^ is the surface-tension or surface-energy. Then,
from the assumption as to complete correspondence in the
states of the two molecules, we have
                      r=        ii or     1=     r- > • • (z)

   Arguing in a similar manner as to correspondence in the
change of energy of the two molecules to their surface-energy
when they evaporate with absorption of latent heats m^ju
w2L2 respectively, nti and         being the molecular weights,
Eotvos writes *          wllL1 = wtgL,
This last result is known as Waterston's law (Phil. Mag. 1857,
vol. xiv.), announced by him without reference to the idea of
correspondence ; but, according to Eotvos, the quantities L1;
«1? »x, L4, &c. must be taken only for corresponding states of
the two bodies. We shall see afterwards that Waterston's law
cannot be regarded as an accurate physical law when tested
by the available experimental material ; but that, as a rough
statement of a connexion between surface-tension and latent
heat, it can be deduced from the law of the inverse fourth
power.

                         Law ofMolecular Force.                    307
   Combining equations (1) and (2), we get
                                    _                     _   _    ^
Now, according to Van der Waals, if two bodies are in corre
sponding states at temperatures             and T2, they will continue
to be so at temperatures (l + n)Ti and (l+n)Ts ; in the case
where n is an infinitely small fraction we get from (4),
i. e.
                 ¦^j- (aii-ji) — j- («sv,f) = constant.
    Thus, according to this argument the last expression is not
only constant for a given body at all temperatures, but is the
same for all bodies. Eotvos has verified the formula from
0°-190° for ethyl oxide, and has found the mean value of the
 constant for a number of substances to be "227.
    The exceptional behaviour of water, the alcohols, and the
 fatty acids is easily understood when we remember the large
 amount of experimental evidence there is pointing to irregu
larity in the molecular structure of water and ethyl alcohol,
 while the well-known anomalous vapour-density of acetic acid
 and of some of the higher acids of the series helps to explain
 their exceptional behaviour.
    Robert Schiff's discovery (Annalen der Ckemie, ccxxiii.)
 was the result of a comprehensive experimental determination
 of the capillary constants of a large number of organic com
 pounds, and consisted in the unfolding of a definite relation
 between the number of molecules of different liquids, which
 rise in a given capillary tube, and their chemical structure.
 He showed that the number of molecules raised could be ex
 pressed as a number of hydrogen atoms ; thus the presence of
 a 0 atom in a molecule has as much influence in determining
 how many molecules will rise in a tube as two H atoms, an
 0 atom as much as three H, and so on. Calling the capil
 lary equivalent of a molecule thus expressed in terms of H
 atoms h, and n 1000 times the number of molecules raised,
           a3d
or 1000 s—, where a2 is the height to which the substance
           2m
 rises in a millimetre tube, d its density, and m its molecular
weight, Schiff's empirical law is
               logi0 "= 2-8155- -00728 h- log10A.
We shall not have occasion to use this result of Schiff's ; but

308                 Mr. W. Sutherland on the
his rich experimental material, published in the Annalen der
Chemie, vol. ccxxiii., and in Wiedemann's Beiblatter, vol. ix.
(from the Mem. della R. Acc. d. Lincei, 1884), combined with
Eotvos' law, will be used to determine the parameter A ; it
is therefore necessary briefly to take note of a discussion
which has been raised over a certain assumption of SchifPs.
He assumes that the angle of contact of liquid with glass is
zero in every case in his determinations; but at the same time,
in order to take account of the weight of the meniscus in his
determination of surface-tension, he gives measurements of
the distance between the top and the bottom of the meniscus,
as this distance is in many cases different from the radius of
the tube. The meniscus surface would appear to be different
from the hemisphere, which it ought very approximately to
be if the contact-angle were zero. Volkmann pointed out this
 (Annalen der Chemie, vol. ccxxviii.), and recalculated the
 capillary constants from Schiff's determinations on the assump
 tion that the data for the height of meniscus might be used
 for determining the angle of contact which he introduces into
 the calculation for the surface-tension. These recalculations,
 while they take away from the definiteness of some of SchifPs
 minor results, do not affect the truth of his broad discovery.
 There is no doubt that, on theoretical grounds, Volkmann's
 criticism is sound enough ; that the experimental data, as
 furnished, bore evidence to the existence of a finite contact-
 angle not taken into account in the calculations. But it must
 be remembered that the measurements of the heights of the me
 niscus were undertaken only for use in a small correction ; and
 that such measurements are not competent to give satisfactory
 evidence of a finite contact-angle, and are certainly not com
 petent to give a measure of it. The manner in which the
 apparent height of the meniscus varies in SchifPs data with
 temperature shows in a practical manner the unreliability of
 such measurements for testing the difficult question of contact-
 angle. Schiff admits the theoretical justness of Volkmann's
 criticism as to contact-angle, but appeals to the regularity of
 his own results as his practical justification. As Volkmann
 himself has shown (and Quincke also) that the contact-angle
 for a large number of watery solutions of inorganic salts is
 zero, and as ordinary meniscus measurements would not de
 monstrate the fact, we are on the whole safe in assuming with
 Schiff that all his liquids wet glass (that is, that their contact-
 angle is zero), until the point is settled by a satisfactory
 experimental method.
    In applying the law of the inverse fourth power to the ca
pillary theory we cannot use directly the formulas already

                      Law of Molecular Force.                309
developed in Laplace's theory, seeing that there are assump
tions involved in them which ure not required or permissible
with the law of the inverse fourth power.
   For the purposes of this paper it will suffice to consider
the surface-tension in a meniscus in a circular tube of so small
diameter that its surface may be regarded as portion of a
sphere, not necessarily a hemisphere, as we must provide for
the case where the contact-angle is not zero.
    We desire to find the force exerted by the meniscus
A P B C P D (fig. 1) on a column
of water, PQ, of small section
lying along the axis of the tube.
The meniscus consists of two
parts : one, the surface layer, of
variable density, which is en
closed between the two surfaces
APB and A'P'B'; let the
mean density in this layer be p,
while p is the density in the body
of the fluid. The other part of
the meniscus A' E D, B' F C is
therefore of density p ; but we
may regard the whole meniscus as of density p, seeing that
the parts A' E D and B' F C will contribute a small part of the
whole force. In the same way we can regard the column P Q
as throughout of density p, seeing that the force exerted
on P' Q is a small part of the whole. Now, for purposes of
integration, we wish to replace the discontinuous distribution
of molecules in the meniscus and column by an equivalent
uniform distribution of matter. Accordingly, as I pointed
out in a previous paper, we must be careful to provide a cer
tain distance between our continuous meniscus and the base
of the continuous column. This distance is not necessarily
the same as the mean diameter of the molecular domain, but
is a quantity of the same order of            Fig. 2.
magnitude. The problem then
reduces itself to the determina                   0
tion of the resultant attraction of
a meniscus A P B C P D (fig. 2),

   Let us call the angle of contact of meniscus-surface with
tube 6. We know, from the usual theory of capillarity
verified by experiment, that 6 is constant ; and this result
holds in the same manner for the law of the inverse fourth
power, so that, in the above expression, c/R, which = cos 6,
aVR, which = 1 — sin 6, are both constant ; and therefore the
first term is independent of the curvature of the meniscus,

Thia equation is founded on the assumption that the capillary
tube is so small that the meniscus-surface may be considered
to be a portion of a sphere. When this is not close enough
to the truth we shall require a more extended investigation of
the necessary form of the meniscus, but for present purposes
the above will suffice. It gives us an important relation
between the parameter A and the surface-tension, but one
involving the unknown average density p of the surface-film,
and the angle 8 which is difficult to determine. But, however,
as 6, if not zero for all ordinary liquids, is small, we will
assume it to be zero, so that the bracketed expression above
reduces to               And as in the first case we desire only
             2+V2
relative values of A for a number of substances, we cannot go
far wrong in assuming that, at their boiling-points, the ratios
of the mean density of the surface-film of different liquids to
the ordinary densities are approximately the same ; we will
therefore write p<xp, and reduce our equation above to the
form a txApPe.
   Now it is natural to suppose that, in different liquids, e is
proportional to the mean distance apart of the molecules in
the surface-film, that is to the cube root of the molecular
domain (usually called the molecular volume) ;

   This equation contains two important consequences :—
   First. The parameter of molecular force varies inversely as
 he product of molecular weight and modulus of dilatation.
  Mendelejeff calls dpjdt the modulus of dilatation, and shows
                                   approximately independent of
temperature when measured at low pressures (one atmo
sphere).]
   Second. The rate of variation of the translatory kinetic
energy of the molecules of most liquids with temperature is
the same, if that rate is measured at a constant low pressure,
such as that of one atmosphere. This second consequence
flows from the above equation in the following manner. It
is shown in my previous paper (Phil. Mag. July 1887) that
the virial of the mutual attractions of the molecules in unit
mass of a body, according to the law of the inverse fourth
power, is irKp log L/a ; where L is a sensible length such as
the cube root of the volume of the unit mass, and a is a length
approximately proportional to the cube root of the molecular
domain (usually called molecular volume). L/a is so large a
number that log L/a may be regarded as constant within the
limits of present experimental possibility in the variation of
L and a.
   Now Clausius' equation of the virial applied to gases is
      § pv + internal virial = translatory kinetic energy.
In the case of liquids under a small constant pressure, pv is
negligible in comparison with the other terms of the equation ;
so that for liquids at low pressures the equation assumes the
simple form
         internal virial =» translatory kinetic energy ;
while for gases at low pressures, the internal virial being
negligible, it assumes the form
      %pv or external virial = translatory kinetic energy.
In the equation for liquids let us replace the internal virial
by its value 37rAplog L/a, and denote the kinetic energy of
translation of the molecules in unit mass by E ; then

or the temperature rate of variation of the translatory kinetic
energy of a molecule, is the same for all molecules when com
pared as the constituents of liquids at low constant pressure.
   This is an important result in molecular dynamics ; its
similarity to the law of Dulong and Petit as to the constancy
of the molecular heats of the elements is obvious and imme
diately suggestive, while its bearing on the physical meaning
of temperature is worth noting. It must not be confused
with the assumption made by many continental writers on
thermodynamics and molecular physics, that the absolute
temperature of a mass is a measure of the kinetic energy of
translation of each molecule in the mass, no matter what the
state of the mass be ; this assumption gives mE ocT, and
therefore d(ME)/dt is constant for all substances and for all
states of each substance. But the result given above holds
only when the external virial is negligible in comparison with
the internal ; in fact the difference between the two views
may be shown thus :—According to the arguments of this
paper, we can write d(mE)/dt = F when the external virial is
negligible, while d{mE)/dt = Q when the internal virial is
negligible, P and Q having possibly different values ; while,
according to the assumption mentioned above, P is considered
equal to Q. Again integrating, we get
              mE = JP dt + M for the first case,
and
              »nE = j" Q dt + N for the second case,
the constants of integration being possibly different ; while,
according to the above assumption, the two constants are
assumed to be the same, seeing that the translatory kinetic
energy of a molecule, both of a liquid and of a vapour at the
same temperature, is assumed to be the same and to be
proportional to the absolute temperature.
   Before proceeding to the determination of the values of A
from Schiff's experimental results, it may be as well to discuss
a certain old-standing difficulty in capillarity, namely the
rapid rate at which capillary height and surface-tension
diminish with rising temperature. According to the expres
sion found above, the tension for a given substance varies as
the $ power of the average density of the film, a <Xp%. Now
C. Schall has shown {BericMe der deutsch. chem. Gesell. xiv.
p. 555) that approximately the surface-tension for several
liquids varies as the § power of the density ; although the
theoretical arguments by which he endeavours to establish
this relation as a consequence of the Newtonian law are not

314                  Mr. W. Sutherland on the
valid, still a. <xp*. The seeming discordance between these
two values for a corresponds to the old difficulty in the early-
days of capillary theory, when Laplace's simplification of
imagining the surface-density to be the same as the body-
density was adopted, and the surface-tension was found expe
rimentally to diminish much more rapidly with temperature
than his theory indicated. But if we take account of the
possibility of a markedly different density in the surface from
that in the body, and recognize the corresponding difference
of stress in the two regions, we shall be prepared to imagine
that, approximately,      oep*, which means that the rate of
variation of the surface-density with temperature is more
rapid than that of body-density. And this is a necessary
corollary of our concession of a marked difference of density
and stress in the two regions ; for Van der Waals has accus
tomed us to the idea of a difference of stress, of the order of
magnitude of 1000 atmospheres ; and the recent researches of
Amagat, on compressibility at higher pressures and its varia
tion with temperature, have shown that the coefficient of
expansion of aether under one atmosphere between 0° and 50°
is '0017, while under 3000 atmospheres it is '00056, so that
an increase in stress of 3000 atmospheres diminishes the
coefficient to one third of its ordinary value. Thus then we
see that, in a general way, the old difficulty is really a very
direct confirmation of the great difference of stress and density
in the surface-film and body of a liquid ; and moreover ex
periment shows that heating the film alone produces a much
more pronounced effect than heating the lower liquid only in
a capillary tube.
   We can now proceed to determine the values of the para
meters kA for a large number of compounds by applying the
equation * = kAp$mi to Schiff's results.
   The following table is devoted to the consideration in the
first case of the values of kA for the isomeric forms of the
compound ethers of the general formula CnH2BOa. For the
sake of brevity the basic radicals methyl, ethyl, &c. are de
noted by I, II, &c, and the basic radicals in ascending order by
1, 2, 3, &c. ; so that 1 1 stands for methyl formiate, II 3 for
ethyl propionate, and so on. Schiff's values of a are given
in terms of grammes weight per linear metre, so that kA in
the following tables is given in corresponding units. The
acids C„H2b02 are omitted from the table because Eotvos
finds that they do not obey his law, and their anomalous
vapour-densities are well known.

   The mean values are taken with the formiates excluded
because they depart so markedly from the rest, the formiates
evidently tending towards the irregularity of the acids. The
mean values are introduced into the following table, in which
the values of kA are arranged according to descending order.
The second column contains the formula) with 0' to indicate
0 connected with two other atoms, 0" to indicate O con
nected with a single atom. Inspection of the table shows
that the number of H atoms in the molecule exercises no
appreciable influence on the value of kA, and that 0' produces
the same effect as 2 0, and 0" as 3C. In the third column
there is placed the number n of C atoms that the molecule is
equivalent to, which I shall call its parameter equivalent. In
the fifth column the mean value of kA for a given value of n,
or kA ; and the last column contains the values of kA n*.

   This table shows that, although the values of kA do not
change at a bound on passing from one value of nto another,
yet the mean value of kA taken for a given value of n found
in the manner indicated varies closely inversely as the two-
thirds power of n or kA = 228/>J.
   A study of the table shows that the compounds containing
chlorine possess such values of kA as would make CI equal
to 5C or GC. With regard to N in the cyanides, its value
appears to diminish as the molecular weight of the compounds
into which it enters increases ; in the amines, on the other
hand, N can with considerable accuracy be put equal to C ;
or if we solve strictly for n bv the equation above, the value
deduced for N is "8 C. In tLd nitrites N02 = 5-6C and as
 02 = 0'0" = 5C, N in the nitrites =-(5C. In the nitrates
 N03in the mean has the value 8'6 C ; and as 03 = 0'Os" = 8 C,
the value of N in the nitrates is '6 C.
   The small influence of the hydrogen atom in the molecule is
shown by the fact that in the previous table the number of H
atoms has been ignored ; with a more accurate treatment the

318                 Mr. W. Sutherland on the
actual value of H may be determined ; but for the present,
as a general result, we regard H as negligible.
   If we regard the number n as measuring the actual volume
of the molecule, and if we consider molecules to have similar
shapes, then nJ measures the surface of the molecule; and we
can say that the parameter A varies inversely as the surface
of the molecule. This interpretation is partially justified by
the consideration of certain results in molecular refraction.
Let i be the index of refraction of a substance whose molecule
occupies a domain u, but actually fills only a volume U, and
let 1 be the index of refraction of the matter of the molecule,
then I have shown in my paper on Molecular Refraction that
(i— l)u = (I — 1)U, which is Gladstone's law. Now Landolt,
Gladstone, and Briihl have shown that in general (t— l)w
for a molecule is the sum of certain quantities known as the
refraction-equivalents characteristic of the different atoms,
but that there are pronounced exceptions : thus, when an atom
possesses two valencies, it has two corresponding refraction-
equivalents. The same results hold therefore for (I — 1)U;
thus, if an atom has different effective valencies, it contributes
different amounts to the value of (I — 1)U in a molecule ac
cording to its valency; thus either I or U, or both I and U,
alter with the effective valency. Now we have considered n to
be proportional to U; and we have found n in the case of
oxygen to vary with valency, so that the optical argument for
a possible variation of U with valency agrees with the varia
tion in the value of n which we have found. It is to be
observed here that this effect of change of valency in changing
n may tend to obscure the value of H as compared with C ; for
in most cases a reduction in the number of H atoms is accom
panied by a change of valency of the C atoms. In the study
of molecular refraction we find in a large number of cases
that the reduction of molecular refraction caused by the ex
pulsion of H atoms for a molecule is almost exactly counter
balanced by the increased refraction-equivalent of C due to
changed valency.

   In the case of bromides containing one atom of Br we see
that the value of kA is stationary, or increases a little with
increasing molecular weight, while in the case of the iodides
the same phenomenon is more pronounced, the value increases
with addition of CH2 instead of diminishing, as it does in
compounds containing C, H, 0, N, and CI. The exceptional
character of these results is not surprising when we consider
the large masses of the Br and I atoms. The refraction-equi
valents of the organic bromides and iodides are quite regular;
so that there is no ground for thinking that the volume of a
Br or of an I atom varies according to the number of carbon
atoms with which it is united ; but the surface of a molecule
containing Br or I united to an organic radical may perhaps
no longer be considered to be proportional to the two-thirds
power of the molecule on account of the pronounced want of
symmetry in structure due to the preponderant atomic mass
of Br and I. With this in view, and remembering that if Br
 and I parameter-equivalents are large, as the preceding table
 shows that they must be, then 228/n* would vary slowly with
 the slight variation in n produced by the introduction into
 the molecule of a few C atoms ; the effect, therefore, of dys-
 symmetry in the building up of the organic bromides and
 iodides would not require to bo very great to explain the ex
 ceptional character of kA in them.
    In conclusion, we will see what light the law of the inverse
 fourth power throws on Waterston's law. If for a moment
 we ignore thermodynamical considerations and regard the
 evaporation of a liquid from the purely mechanical point of
 view as a change of a system of molecules attracting according
 to the inverse fourth power from a configuration where the
 density is p to one in which it is a, then, as shown in my former
 paper (Phil. Mag. July 1887), the mutual potential energy
 of the molecules in the two configurations is 27rAplogL/a
 and 27rA<7 log L/a respectively. If, then, for the moment we
 consider the latent heat-vaporization as equivalent to this
 change of potential energy and call the latent heat X, we have
                        X=27rA{p— a} l°g~^
    Now, except in the neighbourhood of the critical point, we
 can neglect a, the density of the vapour, in comparison with p,

that of the liquid, and can write
                        \= 2irAp log —.
   But our equation for the surface-tension gives

   This is Waterston's law. Now according to therniody-
namical principles the latent heat of evaporation without
performance of external work is
where 6 is the absolute temperature at which evaporation takes
place. This cannot be evaluated till we know the character
istic equation for fluids, which bridges in a complete manner
the gap between the liquid and the gaseous states. But if we
make the assumption that the latent heats of all fluids at their
boiling-points are approximately the same fraction of the
change of potential energy of the molecules due to evapora
tion, then Waterston's law would still be an approximate de
duction from the law of the inverse fourth power. And this
assumption is a natural one, seeing that B.amsay and Young
have pointed out that the external work done during evapo
ration at the ordinary boiling-point is approximately the same
fraction of the total latent heat for all liquids ; our assumption
is, that the fraction of the latent heat due to thermodynamical
adjustment is for all liquids the same fraction of the change
of mechanical energy. However, that the assumption is not a
sound one is shown by the roughness of the approach to con
stancyJ of the following w values of ami . The alcohols and acids

   The previous numbers show that Waterston's law, while
representing a remarkable attempt at the time it was an
nounced to connect latent heat, surface-tension, and molecular
volume, is far from being verified by experimental data ; and
they show the danger of pushing the idea of " correspond
ence " too far. In fact, it would appear that the manner in
which Edtvos deduces his law theoretically from the principle
of " correspondence " only happens by chance to give a rigo
rous law, as the same principle applied to latent heats and sur
face-energy leads to a law so far from rigorous as Waterston's
has been shown to be.
   In the preceding pages we have argued from Eotvos's
empirical law as basis ; but probably, when the dynamical
meaning of temperature in liquids has been made clear,
Eotvos's law will be deduced in the following manner.
   The temperature of a liquid subjected to small constant
pressure is such a property of the molecule of the liquid, that
its rate of variation with the translatory kinetic energy of the
molecule is the same for all molecules; but as external virial
is negligible under these circumstances, we have the rate of
variation with temperature of internal virial multiplied by
molecular mass proportional to the rate of variation of the
translatory kinetic energy of the molecule, which is the same
for all molecules. But according to the law of the inverse
fourth power, internal virial multiplied by the mass of the
molecule is proportional to surface-tension multiplied by the
two-thirds power of the molecular domain, whence Eotvos's
law follows, that the rate of variation with temperature of
the product of surface-tension and the two-thirds power of
the molecular domain is the same for nearly all liquids.
   In the present paper we have been occupied only with
attractions between similar molecules; and there is too little
experimental material to allow of our testing any hypothesis
as to the parameter of molecular attraction in the case of dis
similar ones ; but it seems probable that the parameter will
be inversely proportional to the product of the square roots
of the surfaces of the two molecules.

                  By Dr. J.W. W. Waghobn*.
 IT is well known that an unknown resistance x can be
      determined in terms of a known resistance R, if both are
arranged in series with a cell, and if the deflexions of an
electrometer be observed when connected in turn to x and
to R.
   If C is the current in the circuit, the differences of potential
at the terminals of x and of R are respectively Gx and CR.
   It is also well known that any voltmeter may be substituted
instead of the electrometer, if the resistance of the voltmeter-
circuit is very large compared to x and R.
   But it may not have been generally observed that the same
method may be employed whatever be the relative resistances
of the voltmeter and the conductors ; and is true even if the
usual conditions are reversed, so that the voltmeter-resistance
is very small compared to x and R. Any galvanometer may
take the place of the voltmeter.
   Let G be the resistance of the galvanometer ;
        E be the E.M.F. of the battery ;
        r be the resistance of the battery and connecting-wires.
   Let 0 be the strength of the current on the undivided part
           of the circuit ;
        Gx be the strength of the current through the galvano
           meter when its terminals are connected to x ;
        Or be the strength of the current through the galvano
           meter when its terminals are connected to R.

    XXXVIII. On the Dimensions of Electromagnetic Units.
              By Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald, F.R.S.*
SOME attention has lately been called to the question of
       the dimensions of electromagnetic units, but the follow
ing obvious suggestion seems to have escaped notice.
    The electrostatic system of units may be described as one
in which electric inductive capacity is assumed to have zero
dimensions and the electromagnetic system as one in which the
magnetic inductive capacity is assumed to have zero dimensions.
Now if we take a system in which the dimensions of both these
quantities are the same, and of the dimensions of a slowness,
i. e. the inverse of a velocity, £j-J , the two systems become
identical as regards dimensions, and differ only by a numerical
coefficient just as centimetres and kilometres do. There seems
a naturalness in this result that justifies the assumption that
these inductive capacities are really of the nature of a slow
ness. It seems possible that they are related to the reciprocal
of the square root of the mean energy of turbulence of the aether.

XXXIX. On the Electromagnetic Effects due to the Motion
   of Electrification through a Dielectric.         By Oliver
   Heaviside*.
1. npHE following paper consists of, First, a short discussion
    _L of the theory of the slow motion of an electric charge
through a dielectric, having for object the possible correction
of previously published results. Secondly, a discussion of
the theory of the electromagnetic effects due to motion of a
charge at any speed, with the development of the complete
solution in finite form when the motion is steady and recti
linear. Thirdly, a few simple illustrations of the last when
the charge is distributed.
   Given a steady electric field in a dielectric, due to electri
fication. It is sufficient to consider a charge q at a point, as
we may readily extend results later. If this charge be
shifted from one position to another, the displacement varies.
In accordance, therefore, with Maxwell's inimitable theory of
a dielectric, there is electric current produced. Its time-
integral, which is the total change in the displacement, admits
of no question ; but it is by no means an elementary matter
to settle its rate of change in general, or the electric current.
But should the speed of the moving charge be only a very
small fraction of that of the propagation of disturbances, or
that of light, it is clear that the accommodation of the dis
placement to the new positions which are assumed by the
charge during its motion is practically instantaneous in its
neighbourhood, so that we may imagine the charge to carry
about its stationary field of force rigidly attached to it. This
fixation of the displacement at any moment definitely fixes
the displacement-current. We at once find, however, that to
close the current requires us to regard the moving charge
itself as a current-element, of moment equal to the charge
multiplied by its velocity ; understanding by moment, in the
case of a distributed current, the product of current-density
an I volume. The necessity of regarding the moving charge
as an element of the " true current " may be also concluded
by simply considering that when a charge q is conveyed into
any region, an equal displacement simultaneously leaves it
through its boundary.
   Knowing the electric current, the magnetic force to corre
spond becomes definitely known if the distribution of induc-
tivity be given ; and when this is constant everywhere, as
we shall suppose now and later, the magnetic force is simply

the vector of no divergence whose curl is 4?r times the electric
current ; or the vector-potential of the curl of the current ;
or the curl of the vector-potential of the current, &c. &c. Thus,
as found by J. J. Thomson *, the magnetic field of a charge
moving at a speed which is a small fraction of that of light
is that which is commonly ascribed to a current-element
itself. I think it, however, preferable to regard the magnetic
field as the primary object of attention ; or else to regard
the complete system of closed current derived from it by
taking its curl as the unit, forming what we may term a
rational current-element, inasmuch as it is not a mere mathe
matical abstraction, but is a complete dynamical system
involving definite forces and energy.
    2. Let the axis of z be the line of motion of the charge q
at the speed u ; then the lines of magnetic force H are circles
centred upon the axis, in planes perpendicular to it, and its
tensor H at distance r from the charge, the line r making an
angle 6 with the axis, is given by
                           H=^wsin 6=cEuv,                       (1)
where v=sin 0, E the intensity of the radial electric force, c
the permittivity snch that /*0ct!a = l, if /*0 i8 the other specific
quality of the medium, its inductivity, and v is the speed of
propagation.
    Since, under the circumstance supposed of u/v being very
 small, the alteration in the electric field is insensible, and the
 lines of E are radial, we may terminate the fields represented
by (1) at any distance r = a from the origin. We then
 obtain the solution in the case of a charge q upon the surface
of a conducting sphere of radius a, moving at speed u. This
realization of the problem makes the electric and magnetic
energies finite. Whilst, however, agreeing with J. J.
Thomson in the fundamentals, I have been unable to corrobo
rate some of his details ; and since some of his results have
been recently repeated by him in another place t, it may be
 desirable to state the changes I propose, before proceeding to
the case of a charge moving at any speed.

 The limits are such as include all space outside the sphere

 moving charge and any external magnetic field. This is the
 space-summation S/it0H0H/47r, if H,, is the external field ; and,
 by a well-known transformation, it is equivalent to 2A^, if Ao
 is any vector whose curl is /*oH0, whilst T is the curren<>density
of the moving system. Further, if we choose Aq to have no
 divergence, the polar part of T will contribute nothing to the
 summation, so that we are reduced to the volume-integral of
 the scalar product of the divergenceless Aq of the one system
 and the density of the convection-current in the other. Or,
in the present case, with a single moving charge at a point,
we have simply the scalar product AqU^ to represent the
mutual magnetic energy ; or
                           M=A0u2,                              (3)
which is double J. J. Thomson's result.
    5. When, therefore, we derive from (3) the mechanical
force on the moving charge due to the external magnetic
field, we obtain simply Maxwell's " electromagnetic force " on
a current-element, the vector product of the moment of the
current and the induction of the external field ; or, if P is this
mechanical force,
                           F=WVuH0,                             (4)
which is also double J. J. Thomson's result. Notice that in
the application of the " electromagnetic force " formula, it is
the moment of the convection-current that occurs. This is
not the same as the moment of the true current, which
varies according to circumstances ; for instance, in the case
of a small dielectric sphere uniformly electrified throughout
its volume, the moment of the true current would be only
§ of that of the convection-current.
    The application of Lagrange's equation of motion to (3)
also gives the force on q due to the electric field so far as it
can depend on M ; that is, a force
where the time-variation due to all causes must be reckoned,
except that due to the motion of q itself, which is allowed for
in (4). And besides this, there may be electric force not
derivable from A0, viz.

where      ia the scalar potential companion to A,,.

    6. Now if the external field be that of another moving
 charge, we shall obtain the mutual magnetic energy from (3)
 by letting Ao be the vector-potential of the current in the
 second moving system, constructed so as to have no diver
 gence. Now the vector-potential of the convection-current qu
 is simply qvi/r ; this is sufficient to obtain the magnetic force
 by curling ; but if used to calculate the mutual energy, the
 space-summation would have to include every element of
 current in the other system. To make the vector-potential
 divergenceless, and so be able to abolish this work, we
 must add on to qu/r the vector-potential of the displacement
 current to correspond. Now the complete current may be
 considered to consist of a linear element qu. having two poles ;
 a radial current outward from the + pole in which the current-
 density is quj&irrf; and a radial current inward to the — pole,
 in which the current-density is —qu/iTrr^ ; where rt and r2 are
 the distances of any point from the poles. The vector-potentials
 of these currents are also radial, and their tensors are \qu
 and — %qu. We have now merely to find their resultant
 when the linear element is indefinitely shortened, add on to the
 former qufr, and multiply by /i0, to obtain the complete diver
 genceless vector-potential of qn, viz. :—
                     A=^(u-*MVJ),                               (5)
where r is the distance from q to the point P when A is reckoned,
and the differentiation is to a the axis of the convection-
current. Both it and the space-variation are taken at P.
The tensor of u is w. Though different and simpler in form
(apart from the use of vectors) this vector-potential is, I be
lieve, really the same as the one used by J. J. Thomson.
From it we at once find, by the method described in § 4, the
mutual energy of a pair of point-charges qt and q3 moving at
velocities U! and u2 to be

difference.
   7. The mutual energy being different, the forces on the
charges, as derived by J. J. Thomson by the use of La
grange's equations, will be different. When the speeds are
constant, we shall have simply the before-described vector
product (4) for the " electromagnetic force ;" or

if Fx is the electromagnetic force on the first and F2 that on
the second element, whilst 1^ and H2 are the magnetic forces.
Similar changes are needed in the other parts of the complete
mechanical forces.
    It may be remarked that (if my calculations are correct)
equation (7) or its equivalents expresses the mutual energy of
any two rational current-elements [see § 1] in a medium of
uniform inductivity, of moments <ftWj and qsu3, whether the
currents be of displacement, or conduction, or convection, or
all mixed, it being in fact the mutual energy of a pair of
definite magnetic fields. But, since the hypothesis of instan
taneous action is expressly involved in the above, the applica
tion of (7) is of a limited nature.
    8. Now leaving behind altogether the subject of current-
elements, in the investigation of which one is liable to be led
 away from physical considerations and become involved in
 mere exercises in differential coefficients, and coming to the
 question of the electromagnetic effects of a charge moving in
 any way, I have been agreeably surprised to find that my
 solution in the case of steady rectilinear motion, originally an
 infinite series of corrections, easily reduces to a very simple
and interesting finite form, provided u be not greater than v.
 Only when u>v is there any difficulty. We must first settle

requires no change when there is moving electrification. But
the analogous law of Maxwell, which I understand to be really
a definition of electric current in terms of magnetic force, (or
a doctrine), requires modification if the true current is to be
                                C+/>D + pu;                               (12)
 viz. the sum of conduction-current, displacement-current, and
 convection-current pu, where pis the volume-density of elec
 trification. The addition of the term pu was, I believe, pro
 posed by G. F. Fitzgerald *.
     [This was not meant exactly for a new proposal, being in
 fact after Rowland's experiments; besides which, Maxwell was
  well acquainted with the idea of a convection-current. But
  what is very strange is that Maxwell, who insisted so strongly
  upon his doctrine of the </«ast-incompressibility of electricity,
  never formulated the convection-current in his treatise. Now
  Prof. Fitzgerald pointed out that if Maxwell, in his equation
  of mechanical force,
                          F= VCB-«V^-mVn,
  had written E for — V^> as it is obvious he should have done,
  then the inclusion of convection-current in the true current
  would have followed naturally. (Here C is the true current,
  B the induction, e the density of electrification, m that of
  imaginary magnetic matter, "9 the electrostatic and XI the
  magnetic potential, and E the real electric force.)
      Sow to this remark I have to add that it is as unjustifiable
   to derive H from SI as E from "9 ; that is, in general, the
  magnetic force is not the slope of a scalar potential ; so, for
   — V^i we should write H, the real magnetic force.
      But this is not all. There is possibly a fourth term in F,
   expressed by 47rVDG, where D is the displacement and G the
   magnetic current ; I have termed this force the "magneto-
   electric force," because it is the analogue of Maxwell's "elec
   tromagnetic force " VCB. Perhaps the simplest way of
   deriving it is from Maxwell's electric stress, which was the
   method 1 followed f.
      Thus, in a homogeneous nonconducting dielectric free
   from electrification and magnetization, the mechanical force
   is the sum of the " electromagnetic " and the " magnetoelec-

    It must, however, be confessed that the real distribution of
 the stresses, and therefore of the forces, is open to question.
 And when aether is the medium, the mechanical force in it,
 as for instance in a light-wave, or in a wave sent along a
 telegraph-circuit, is not easily to be interpreted.
    The companion to (11) in a nonconducting die ectric is now
                        curl H = cpE + i-jrpu                 (13)
    Eliminate £ between (11) and (13), remembering that H
 has no divergence, because fi0 is constant, and we get
                   (j9*/vs-Vs)H=curl 4?rpu, . . . . (14)
the characteristic of H. Here V*=^s/^*+ . . ., as usual.
    Comparing (14) with the characteristic of H when there is
impressed force e instead of electrification p, which is
                      (p7v8-V2)H = curl cpe,
 we see that pu becomes cpe/itr. We may therefore regard
 convection-current as impressed electric current. From this
 comparison also, we may see that an infinite plane sheet of
electrification of uniform density cannot produce magnetic
force by motion perpendicular to its plane. Also we see that
the sources of disturbances when p is moved are the places
where pn has curl ; for example, a dielectric sphere uniformly
filled with electrification (which is imaginable), when moved,
starts the magnetic force solely upon its boundary.
   The presence of " curl " on the right side tells us, as a
matter of mathematical simplicity, to make H/curl the variable.
Let                          H=curlA,                         (15)
and calculate A, which may be any vector satisfying (15).
Its characteristic is
                       (p>2-Vs)A=47rpu                        (16)
The divergence of A is of no moment, and it is only vexatious
complication to introduce           The time-rate of decrease of A
is not the real distribution of electric force, which has to be
found by the additional datum
                            div cE = 47rp,                    (17)
where E is the real force.

Here the numerator of the fraction to the right is the vector-
potential of the convection-current. Calling it Ao, we have
                        Ao=^P=*^                               (19)
   Inserting in (18) and expanding, we have
             A={l + (p/«V)a + (p/«V)4+ ...}Ao. .            .  (20)
Given then pu as a function of position and time, Ao is known
by (19), and (20) finds A, whilst (15) finds H.
   10. When the motion of the electrification is all in one
direction, say parallel to the r-axis, u, Ao, and A are all parallel
to this axis, so that we need only consider their tensors.
When there is simply one charge q at a point, we have
                            Ao = qujr,
and (20) becomes
            A = q{l + (p/v\7Y + (p/vVy+ ...}(«/r) . (21)

   Now, as regards         if we bring it in, we have only got to
take it out again. When the speed is very slow we may
regard the electric field as given by —              plus a small cor
recting vector, which we may call the electric force of inertia.
But to show the physical inanity of go to the other extreme,
and let u nearly equal v. It is now the electric force of inertia
(supposed) that equals              nearly (except about the equa
torial plane), and its sole utility or function is to cancel the
other —        of the (supposed) electrostatic field. It is surely
impossible to attach any physical meaning to "V and to pro
pagate it, for we require two M^'s, one to cancel the other, and
both propagated infinitely rapidly.
   As the speed increases, the electromagnetic field concentrates
itself more and more about the equatorial plane, 6 = \ir. To
give an idea of the accumulation, let M2/t>* = -99. Then cE is
•01 of the normal value q/r9 at the pole, and 10 times the
normal value at the equator. The latitude where the value is
normal is given by
                     v=(v/u)[l-(l-u'/vt)*]i                       (30)
    12. When u—v, the solution (29) becomes a plane electro
magnetic wave, E and H being zero everywhere except in the
equatorial plane. As, however, the values of E and H are
infinite, distribute the charge along a straight line moving in
its own line, and let the linear-density be q. The solution is
then t
                            B.=Ecv=2qv/r                          (31)
 at distance r from the line, between the two planes through
 the ends of the line perpendicular to it, and zero elsewhere.
    To further realize, let the field terminate internally at r=a,
 giving a cylindrical-surface distribution of electrification, and
 terminate the tubes of displacement externally upon a coaxial
 cylindrical surface; we then produce a real electromagnetic
 plane wave with electrification, and of finite energy. We have
 supposed the electrification to be carried through the dielectric
 at speed r, to keep up with the wave, which would of course

break up if the charge were stopped. But if perfectly-
conducting surfaces be given on which to terminate the dis
placement, the natural motion of the wave will itself carry the
electrification along them. In fact we now have the rudi
mentary telegraph-circuit, with no allowance made for absorp
tion of energy in the wires, and the consequent distortion.
If the conductors be not coaxial, we only alter the distribution
of the displacement and induction, without affecting the pro
pagation without distortion *.
   If we now make the medium conduct electrically, and
likewise magnetically, with equal rates of subsidence, we shall
have the same solutions, with a time-factor e-*' producing
ultimate subsidence to zero ; and, with only the real electric
conductivity in the medium the wave is running through, it
will approximately cancel the distortion produced by the
resistance of the wires the wave is passing over when this
resistance has a certain value t- We should notice, however,
that it could not do so perfectly, even if the magnetic retar
dation in the wires due to diffusion were zero ; because in
the case of the unreal magnetic conductivity its correcting
influence is where it is wanted to be, in the body of the
wave; whereas in the case of the wires, their resistance,
correcting the distortion due to the external conductivity, is
outside the wave ; so that we virtually assume instantaneous
propagation laterally from the wires of their correcting influence
in the elementary theory of propagation along a telegraph-
circuit which is symbolized by the equations

 conductance, and permittance per unit length of circuit, C the

 difference, but which I have expressly disclaimed J to represent
 the electrostatic difference of potential, and have shown
 to represent the transverse E.M.F. or line-integral of the
 electric force across the circuit from wire to wire, including
 the electric force of inertia. Now in case of great distortion,
 as in a long submarine cable, this V approximates towards
 the electrostatic potential-difference, which it is in Sir W.
 Thomson's diffusion theory ; but in case of little distortion, as

334     Mr. 0. Heaviside on the Electromganetic Effects due
in telephony through circuits of low resistance and large in
ductance, there may be a wide difference between my V and
that of the electrostatic force. Consider, for instance, the
extreme case of an isolated plane-wave disturbance with no
spreading-out of the tubes of displacement. At the boundaries
of the disturbance the difference between V and the electro
static difference of potential is great.
   But it is worth noticing, as a rather remarkable circum
stance, that when we derive the system (32) by elementary
considerations, viz. by extending the diffusion-system by the
addition of the E.M.F. of inertia and leakage-current, we
apparently as a matter of course take V to mean the same as
in the diffusion-system. The resulting equations are correct,
and yet the assumption is certainly wrong. The true way
appears to be that given by me in the paper last referred to,
by considering the line-integral of electric force in a closed
curve. We cannot, indeed, make a separation of the electric
force of inertia from —        without some assumption, though
the former is quite definite when the latter is suitably defined.
But, and this is the really important matter, it would be in
the highest degree inconvenient, and lead to much complica
tion and some confusion, to split V into two components, in
other words, to bring in *9 and A.
   In thus running down          I am by no means forgetful of
its utility in other cases. But it has perhaps been greatly
misused. The clearest course to pursue appears to me to
invariably make E and H the primary objects of attention,
and only use potentials when they naturally suggest them
selves as labour-saving appliances.
   13. Returning to the solutions (29), the following are the
special tests of their accuracy. Let E, and E3 be the z and
h components of E. Then, by (11) and (13), with the special
meaning assumed by p, we have

differing from (31) only in that q, the linear density, may be
any function of z.

nally at r = a, the perpendicularity of E and the tangentiality
of H to the surface show that (29) represents the solutions in
the case of a perfectly conducting sphere of radius a, moving
steadily along the .i-axis at the speed u, and possessing a total
charge q. The energy is now finite. Let U be the total

reduces to that of equation (2) when u/v is infinitely small.
   15. The question now suggests itself, What is the state of
things when u > v ? It is clear, in the first place, that there can
be no disturbance at all in front of the moving charge (at a point,
for simplicity). Next, considering that the spherical waves
emitted by the charge in its motion along the c-axis travel at
speed v, the locus of their fronts is a conical surfaco whose
apex is at the charge itself, whose axis is that of z, and whose
semiangle 0 is given by
                             sin6=v/u                          (38)

336     Mr. 0. Heaviside on tlie Electromagnetic Effects due
The whole displacement, of amount q, should therefore lie
within this cone. And since the moving charge is a convec
tion-current qu, the displacement-current should be towards
 the apex in the axial portion of the cone, and change sign at
some unknown distance, so as to be away from the apex either
 in the outer part of the cone or else upon its boundary. The
 pulling back of the charge by the electric stress would require
 the continued application of impressed force to keep up the
 motion, and its activity would be accounted for by the con
 tinuous addition made to the energy in the cone ; for the
 transfer of energy on its boundary is perpendicularly outward,
 and the field at the apex is being continuously renewed.
   The above general reasoning seems plausible enough, but I
cannot find any solution to correspond that will satisfy all the
necessary conditions. It is clear that (29) will not do when
u > v. Nor is it of any use to change the sign of the quantity
under the radical, when needed, to make real. It is suggested
that whilst there should be a definite solution, there cannot
be one representing a steady condition of E and H with respect
to the moving charge. As regards physical possibility, in
connexion with the structure of the aether, that is not in
question.
   16. Let us now derive from (29), or from (27), the results
in some cases of distributed electrification, in steady rectilinear
motion. The integrations to be effected being all of an ele
mentary character, it is not necessary to give the working.

 we shall have to add to (41) the solution due to the electrifi

with plane waves, and no component of electric force parallel
to the line of motion.
   17. Next, let the electrified line be in steady motion per
pendicularly to its length.
Let q be the linear density                             p

   Terminating the fields internally at r=a, we have the case
of a perfectly conducting cylinder of radius a, charged with
q per unit of length, moving transversely. When u=v there
is disappearance of E and H everywhere except in the plane
6=.\ir, as in the case of the sphere, and consequent infinite
values. It is the curvature that permits this to occur, i. e.
producing infinite values j of course it is the self-induction
that is the cause of the conversion to a plane wave, here and
in the other cases. There is some similarity between (43) and
(29). In fact, (43) is the bidimensional equivalent of (29).

When P is equidistant from the edges, H is zero. There is
therefore no H anywhere due to the motion of an infinitely
large uniformly charged plane perpendicularly to itself. The
displacement-current is the negative of the convection-
current and at the same place, viz. the moving plane, so
there is no true current.
    Calculating E„ the z-component of E, z being measured
 from left to right, we find
       cE1=2,{tan-1^(l-J2;-tan-f(l-"7}.(45)
 The component parallel to the plane is H/cw. Thus, when
the plane is infinite, this component vanishes with H , and
 we are left with
                        cE1=cE=27rg,                         (46)

    19. Lastly, let the charged plane be moving in its own

 trace of the plane when of finite breadth. We shall find that

 above the plane, and its negative below it. This differs from
 the previous case of vanishing displacement-current. There
 is H, and the convection-current is not now cancelled by co
 existent displacement-current.
    The existence of displacement-current, or changing dis
 placement, was the basis of the conclusion that moving elec
 trification constitutes a part of the true current. Now in the

        Rotation of the Plane of Polarization of Light.          339
problem (48) the displacement-current has gone, so that the
existence of H appears to rest merely upon the assumption
that moving electrification is true current. But if the plane
be not infinite, though large, we shall have (48) nearly true
near it, and away from the edges ; whilst the displacement-
current will be strong near the edges and almost nil where
(48) is nearly true.
   But in some cases of rotating electrification, there need be
no displacement anywhere, except during the setting up of
the final state. This brings us to the rather curious question
whether there is any difference between the magnetic field of
a convection-current produced by the rotation of electrification
upon a good nonconductor and upon a good conductor re
spectively, other than that due to diffusion in the conductor.
For in the case of a perfect conductor, it is easy to imagine
that the electrification could be at rest, and the moved con
ductor merely slip past it.      Perhaps Professor Rowland's
forthcoming experiments on convection-currents may cast
some light upon this matter.

XL. The Rotation of the Plane of Polarization of Light by
  the Discharge of a Let/den Jar. By Dr. Olives Lodge*.
11HE current produced by the discharge of a Leyden jar is
       so violent while it lasts, that those phenomena which
depend upon the value of a current independently of its
duration are well excited by it. Such are the induction of
currents, the production of magnetism, and the rotation of
the plane of polarization.
   Nothing is easier than to wind a quantity of thin gutta-
percha-covered wire round a piece of heavy glass, and to
witness the bright flashing of a dark field between polarizer
and analyser whenver a large Leyden jar is sparked
through the coil, the source of light being a paraffin-lamp or
gas-flame. The suddenness of the effect suggests, of course
erroneously, that it is an illumination caused by the light of
the spark which one is looking at.
   The fact that the discharge is oscillatory, and that the
restoration of light in the dark field is oscillatory too, is
proved by the fact that an adjustment of the analyser to one
side or the other of complete darkness has just the same effect
on the result. It is proved also by the fact that a biquartz

340     Dr. Lodge on the Rotation of the Plane of Polarization
exhibits no change in its sensitive tint during the discharge ;
similarly also Jellett, and other such reversible detectors,
would be useless for the purpose : the effect is an irreversible
one. Nevertheless some sort of measure of the effect can be
made by finding the position of the analyser whereat the
brightness of the field suffers no appreciable change at the
occurrence of the spark, because in one position the oscilla
tion on one side will darken it just as much as that on the
other side brightens it.
    It seemed to me possible that if the effect could be rendered
pretty considerable a slight darkening of the field might be
obtained with some adjustments, because some arcs of the
sine curve have an average ordinate less than their middle
ordinate. But when a fairly bright field winks slightly it is
not easy to say whether it winks brighter or darker, and after
all I do not know that it much matters.
    The main interest in the experiment seemed to me to lie in
the evidence it afforded of practical instantaneity in the
development of the property in the substance under examina
tion ; and in order to try oscillations of much greater fre
quency than those I first used, I got my assistant, Mr.
Robinson, to make a long tube of carbon disulphide with
which to repeat the experiment in a sensitive manner.
    Now, a most interesting experiment of Villari *, in which
he whirled a drum of heavy glass up to 200 revolutions per
second between the poles of a magnet, and perceived the
electro-optic effect to diminish from 100 revolutions per second
upwards, and ultimately nearly cease at high speeds (sa}r 180
per second) , had led one to suppose that some distinct time
was necessary for the production of the effect—something
between ^ and              second. But on referring to that most
 useful summary of Electrical Science, Prof. Chrystal's article
 in the Encycl. Brit., I found, along with a quotation of Villari's
 experiment, a statement that Professors Bichat and Blondlot t,
 of Nancy, had by means of Leyden-jar discharge proved
 that practically no time was necessary. I accordingly pro
 cured a copy of the volume of the Comptes Rendus from
 London, and there found an all too brief account of a most
 beautiful series of experiments, by which they considered it
 proved that if any time is required, it is less than the 55-535
 second. The skill of these French Professors in optics, and
 their previous researches in connexion with the Faraday

              of Light by the Discharge of a Leyden Jar.                341
effect in various substances, are well known ; and what I have
to show to-day is practically nothing more than a repetition
of their experiments with the theory worked out.
     I take either a bit of heavy glass in its helix, or, for pro
jection, a tube of CS3 a yard long surrounded by four large
helices, each containing about 80 yards of gutta-percha-covered
No. 16 wire ; and on passing the discharge from a battery of
 several jars the field flashes out bright, in what may be (if
one is looking direct towards the hot lime) quite a dazzling
manner.
     I have just received a post-card from M. Bichat, in answer
 to an inquiry, saying that the coil they used was the secondary
bobbin of a Ruhmkorfl" coil with a resistance of 5000 ohms.
 Now, whether this was by accident or by design, it was difficult
 for them to use a coil more suited to the purpose, or one that
 would give a larger effect, as I shall show directly. The
 Leyden jars employed by them were either one or two, about
 18 inches high and 6 inches in diameter. We shall find that
 the effect increases in direct proportion to the capacity of
 the jars.
      To find out whether any time was required for the develop
  ment of the effect, they made the light coming through the
  tube illuminate a slit, the spark being made to illuminate
  another slit close above the first, and then both slits were
  examined in a rotating mirror. Both were spread out into a
  discontinuous band, and the serrations of the one agreed as
  nearly as could be seen with the serrations of the other. Thus
  proving in a beautiful manner that there was practically no
  lag of the effect behind its cause, and thereby contradicting
  the conclusion of Villari *.
      Meanwhile I had been doing similar experiments, but with
  a bobbin of much smaller inductance, and using a still smaller
  capacity, my object being to find the greatest frequency able
  to show the effect distinctly. If, for instance, heavy glass or
  CS2 was able to follow oscillations of some million per second,
  there could be no further question but that Villari's conclusion
  was wrong. I find that the CS2 is able to show the effect
  when the rate of alternation is 70,000 per second ; and though
  the short length of heavy glass available does not enable me
  at present to make quite the same statement for it, I have no
      * They also mention an unpublished experiment by MM. Curie and
   Ledeboer, in which a disk of glass was spun between the poles after the
   manner of a Foucault disk of copper, so that the path of the light was
   parallel to the axis of rotation, instead of perpendicular to it as in Vil-
   lari's drum arrangement, and in that case no diminution was observed.
   If this experiment is yet published I am ignorant of it.

342     Dr. Lodge on the Rotation of the Plane of Polarization
reason to suppose it in any way inferior. In fact, experiment
distinctly suggests that the effect is practically instantaneous ;
but as to the degree of instantaneity I shall be able to make
a more exact numerical statement later on.
   It may be of interest to the Physical Society to have the
oscillatory character of the restored light demonstrated, and
there is no difficulty in the experiment. One sets the
analyser to as near darkness as possible, one receives the
trace of residual light upon a rotating mirror, by which it is
spread out into a faint band ; and on then sending sparks
through the coil of wire round the tube of CS2, the band
brightens and presents a distinctly beaded appearance at every
spark.
   Rotating the analyser a little, every alternate bead grows
fainter, while the other alternate ones brighten, thus proving
most directly the oscillatory character of the light and of the
Leyden-jar discharge.
    Still more feasible is it to spread out the light of the spark
itself into a serrated band, but in making this visible to an
audience it is well to save time by exciting the jars with a
large induction-coil instead of a Wimshurst machine, because
not only can sparks be thus got much more frequently, but
 each spark is multiple—the jars filling and overflowing several
times during the one coil-discharge. The multiple or inter
mittent spark is analysed by the revolving mirror into a
number of serrated bands one after the other, and while one
band is in the field of view of one part of the audience
another band may be visible to another.
    Although when a suitable circuit is employed the analysis
of the spark in a mirror such as is used for manometric flames
 rotating not more than three or four times a second is easy,
 yet with ordinary discharging circuits I have used small
 mirrors spinning 200 times a second and failed to see any
 certain trace of oscillation ; while, as is well known, Wheat-
 stone used mirrors rotating 800 times a second, and got the
image-spark only barely elongated : not in the least serrated.
 It may be worth while, therefore, to state the kind of circuit
 which I have recently employed. The capacity consists of a
 couple of condensers built up in the laboratory with double
 thicknesses of window-glass alternating with tinfoil, and the
 whole flooded in paraffin till it is a solid mass in a box of
 teak weighing a couple of hundredweight. These condensers
 stand a considerable length of spark, 3 or 4 inches for in
 stance, but their strength is not in the least called out in the
 experiments now related. Their capacity when joined up
 parallel is "048 microfarad. These are often supplemented by

           of Light by the Discharge of a Leyden Jar.         343
a battery of ordinary Leyden jars and by single jars, which
altogether raise the capacity to "074 microfarad or 670 metres.
To vary the capacity in the ratio 1, 2, 4, I use a switch con
sisting of 6 glass pillars, each with a bit of close-fitting glass
tube cemented on the top to serve as a mercury cup. The
leading wires are held in the mercury cups by indiarubber
umbrella-rings round the glass pillars ; and insulated wire
bridges easily make connexion between one pillar and the
next.
   In the annexed figure dotted lines indicate sufficiently the
permanent connexions. M being

connexions are made in pairs as

nect 3, 4.
   For both condensers in parallel,
connect 1, 2 ; 3, 4 ; 5, 6.
   As regards circuit, one of the
coils I use is a hank of 440 yards
of thickly covered No. 16 Gr. P.
wire as it came from the maker,
with a self-induction of *048
secohm and a resistance of 3*75
ohms.
   The coils on the CS3 tube consist of the same kind of wire ;
they have a resistance rather greater than the above, and a
combined self-induction of about "008 secohm.
   A number of gigantic electric-light cables have been in
serted in the circuit at different times, one on a bobbin like
two cart-wheels being kindly lent by the Engineers of the
Liverpool Electric Supply Company ; but the easiest way of
getting very large self-induction is to use No. 20 or No. 22
G. P. or I. R. wire not too thickly covered. I have recently ob
tained a large coil wound so as to give maximum self-induc
tion which I estimate as 7 or 8 secohms ; I have not yet
used this, but I frequently use a number of coils of No. 21
wire packed together as close as is easily possible, and making
a total self-induction of 1 secohm or ten thousand kilometres.
   Without going into further details, I may say that the ob
served frequency of the oscillations, as estimated from the
appearance of the serrations in the revolving mirror, or by
the pitch of the musical note accompanying the spark, agrees

344     Dr. Lodge on the Rotation of the Plane ofPolarization

    Returning now to the magneto-optic effect of the Leyden-
jar discharge, I make out its theory to be as follows :—
    The current at any instant during the discharge is
                      C=^e-»'smj><                             (1)

The difference of magnetic potential between the two ends of
a rod of length I surrounded by a very long solenoid of n1
turns of wire on unit length of it is
                              Atr/iCn^.
The Verdet constant for carbon disulphide, or the rotation of
the plane of polarization per unit difference of magnetic
potential is, according to the determination of Lord Rayleigh,
 •04202 minute for a temperature of 18° Centigrade, and
 for sodium light. Calling this k, we have the rotation
 effected by the current
                         0=4-7r/bt,Z/iC                        (2)
 In the case of the heavy glass experiment a helix longer than
 the stalk of glass is employed ; but in the case of the long
 tube of CS2 and four helices there will be some correction
 necessary for the ends of the helices. This correction is, how
 ever, well understood, and there is no special need to intro
 duce it at present.
     Now the total amplitude of the light falling upon the
 analyser being a (this amplitude being all stopped if the
  analyser is set to darkness, and all transmitted if it be turned
  90°), the component amplitude which will at any instant get
  through the analyser set to darkness, when the plane of
  polarization has been rotated through an angle 6, is
                                a sin 6 ;
  and the amount of light which gets through during the time
  t during which an impression is capable of being accumu
  lated on the retina, i. e. before it has begun to die away as
  fast as it is produced, is

The amount of light which would get through in the same

These expressions, then, furnish the measure of the respective
effects upon the retina ; and so we have
   apparent brightness restored by the spark _       <& sin8 9 dt
           maximum brightness possible         ~~       ^
   Now inasmuch as t is comparable to the time of persistence
of retinal impression, being perhaps equal to it, and since this
time is greatly longer than any ordinary duration of a spark-
discharge, the above ratio of the relative brightnesses reduces,
for practical purposes, to
                                        1 r°
            B = relative brightness = -I sin2 0 dt, . . (3)
and this is what the eye will observe.
   Beferring back to equations (1) and (2) we have the means
of determining this quantity. I do not know how to do it
completely, but for the case when 6 is moderately small the
integral is easy, viz. :—
           B = 16 7rs&V»2^j^V*"' sin2 Pt dt
             = 160yfeV«9^J*                                     (4)
The effect thus depends directly on the square of the total
number of turns of wire employed, directly on the energy of
 the static charge used, and inversely on the resistance of the
circuit.
    To find the best size of wire to wind
 on a bobbin of given size, for the pur-            '
 pose, one can write down the value of
 n*/R; given the length of the bobbin
 as I, its depth of winding-space b, the
 diameter of its empty core c. Call the |                  l
 radius of the uncovered wire used p, \                    |
and its radius when covered p'.
    First, supposing no appreciable resistance in the rest of the
 circuit, it comes out
                          R~4(c+&) (*)•                         <5>
 which means that the size of the wire does not matter, but
 that it is important to keep the covering thin. Only then

346    Dr. Lodge on the Rotation of the Plane of Polarization
unfortunately the discharge is liable to burst the covering.
In my helices p'=3p, which is rather excessive, because it
reduces the visible effect to one ninth of what it might be
if no covering were used.
   It is impossible to press this to its natural consequence of
using only one turn of thick sheet copper, because the resist
ance of the rest of the circuit has been neglected. Taking it
into account, as r, the relation becomes
                  n*_     i(c + b)  \p'J                     -
                   r—          7Z           '   •   *  •  ' W
¦which contains the product of the sizes of covered and un
covered wire as well as the ratio ; and this product occurs in
the term containing r, the external resistance. Hence, to keep
this term small, it is desirable to use wire thin enough to
throw the major part of the resistance into the bobbin ; and
there is no limit to the thinness of the wire that may be ad
vantageously employed, until the thickness of the covering
bears too high a ratio to the whole. And inasmuch as
insulation thickness may be more judiciously distributed
between layers than between consecutive turns, it is obvious
how extremely suitable a coil for the purpose is the secondary
of a Riihmkorff.
   I said that I did not know how to evaluate the complete
integral involved in (3) when 8 is not small ; but, as usual, I
sent the problem to my brother, and he speedily reduced it
to a form equivalent to this :—

where
                   A = STrkn(iY0
I have asked him to write a short appendix to this paper.
   Returning now to consider the meaning of these equations,
and attempting a numerical estimate of what to expect in
practice, we shall find that though the instantaneous rotation
expressed by (2) is enormous, being quite possibly 60 or even
180 degrees, yet the restoration of light expressed by (4) is
but feehle, and only some ten thousandth part or so of what
could be gained by rotating the Nicol. This explains why
it is fairly easy to analyse the restored light into a beaded

            of Light by the Discharge of a Leyden Jar.       3 17
band, because then one gets the effect of the separate oscilla
tions ; and they are very bright though very momentary.
    Looking at the formula (4), it is clear that to get large
effects it is desirable to use a large battery of jars, and to
charge to a high potential, only that one is afraid of breaking
down the coil. Large capacity and a great number of turns
of wire are the safest ways of increasing the effects.
    One sees also that extra self-induction in the circuit does
neither good nor harm to the resultant effect. It diminishes
the effect of each oscillation, but it prolongs the time during
which they last. And it is the total " action " of the series of
decaying swings which the eye perceives. One sees that
extra resistance in the circuit is wholly bad.
    As to the cause of what must now be regarded provisionally
as the erroneous conclusion of Villari I see no reason to doubt
his experiments, though he does not give sufficient details to
enable one to arrive at a perfectly satisfactory judgment on all
points ; it is practically certain that he did get a much dimi
nished effect on spinning the flint-glass drum between the
poles of the magnet and sending the light along successive
diameters of the drum.
    But the cause of this I venture to suggest is possibly to be
 found in the state of strain into which the glass will be thrown
 by centrifugal force. It may bo said that, if so, the light
 ought to have been similarly affected even when no magnetic
 field was employed ; and Villari expressly says that this was
 not the case.
    But then it is to be noticed that, when no magnetic rotation
 is attempted, the aspect of the plane of polarization to the
 stress remains constant throughout the journey; and if light
 happens to enter with no component modifiable by the stress,
 it will go out in the same condition. Whereas when rotation
 has taken place inside the glass this constancy of aspect is
  destroyed, and the light on exit has a different component
  modifiable by the strain to what it had on entrance.
     I do not profess to be able to give a coherent account of
  how this cause shall give rise to a reduction in the rotation
  instead of to an elliptical polarization. But then neither am
  I able to extract from Villari's account of his experiments
  any assurance that some elliptic polarization was not pro
  duced, and that the reduction of the rotation of the polarized
  plane was anything more than a mixture of small effects not
  easily analysable nor precisely defined.
     It is in any case a most interesting experiment, and should
  be repeated so as to really get at the bottom of the cause of
  the observed phenomenon. There are many other experiments
  on whirling glass which may likewise be made.

XLI. On the Use of Lissajous' Figures to determine a Rate of
   Rotation, and of a Morse Receiver to Measure the Periodic
   Time of a Reed or Tuning-fork. By Prof. J. Viriamu
   Jokes, M.A.*
JT is sometimes of importance to determine with great accu
      racy the angular velocity of a rotating body at a given
instant. For instance, in measuring an electrical resistance
in absolute measure by the British Association method or the
method of Lorenz, the rate of rotation of the revolving coil or
disk must be known with full accuracy at the time when the
reading of a galvanometer-needle is taken.
   The method I have to bring before the Physical Society in
this note consists in obtaining, by means of Lissajous' figures,
equality of period between the rotating body and a reed main
tained in vibration electrically, and then subsequently deter
mining the vibration-period of the reed.

350      Prof. J. V. Jones on the Use of Lissajous' Figures
 (i.) The use of Lissajous' Figures to obtain Equality of Period
         between the Revolving Apparatus and the Reed.
    In one end of the axle of the revolving apparatus (which in
 the application of this method in the laboratory of the Uni
versity College, Cardiff, is a Lorenz disk rotating about a
horizontal axis) a pin is placed excentrically. The pin fits
 accurately in a hole in a rod free at one end, and constrained
to move only longitudinally at the other.
    Fig. 1 represents an end view of the axle M M M. The
excentric pin is indicated by the dotted circle at B. The pin
fits into a hole in the rod S S free at the end C, the other end,
A, being constrained to move only longitudinally.
    When the apparatus is in rotation the excentric pin im
presses on the rod a vibratory motion ; and the vibration-
period of the rod is equal to the revolution-period of the
revolving disk.
    To the free end of the rod a mirror, T, is attached.
    In the apparatus in my laboratory, already mentioned, the
axle is horizontal and the rod moves in a vertical plane.
    The reed is a steel bar 100 centim. long, and its section is
rectangular, 1*51 centim. by *60 centim. It is clamped in a
massive iron frame, and by moving the bar in the frame the
vibrating segment may be made longer or shorter so as to
vary its vibration-period. The period may be further adjusted
by the movement of a rider.
    Fig. 2 is a plan of the reed and its electrical arrangements,
which are a little different to those in ordinary use in order to
allow, without inconvenient readjustment of the springs, the
lengthening or shortening of the vibrating segment.
    A A A is the steel bar.
    C C the iron frame to which it is clamped by the bolts and
        nuts D, D. This stand is clamped to a large wooden
        block resting on a concrete floor.
    F F F is a wooden piece attached at N N to the iron frame,
       and bearing the electromagnet M.
    On the opposite side of the vibrating bar to the electro
magnet there is a pair of springs Sj. One of the pair is
always in contact with the bar as it vibrates, and the other,
fitted with screw-adjustment, makes and breaks contact with
the first. The first spring is connected through the electro
magnet with the pole of a suitable battery, the other pole
being connected with the second spring. The apparatus gives
no trouble, and once started the reed will vibrate for hours
without attention.
   To the free end of the vibrating segment a mirror T T is

>\

attached. In my apparatus the reed moves in a horizontal
plane, and so its plane is at right angles to that of the vibrating
rod attached to the axle of the rotating disk. Therefore the
image of a spot of light seen by reflexion in both mirrors (viz.
that attached to the rod on the axle, and that attached to the
reed) will for synchronism be drawn out into some form of
ellipse, and the permanence of the ellipse is an exact test of
equality between the vibration-period of the reed and the
period of revolution of the rotating-apparatus.
  (ii.) Determination of the Vibration-period of the Reed by a
                          Morse Receiver.
   Opposite the pair of springs Sx connected with the electro
magnet M and concerned with the maintenance of the reed in
vibration, there is another pair of springs Ss, similar in every
respect. One of these is connected through a Morse receiver
with a battery of the requisite electromotive force, the other
being connected with the other pole of the battery. When
the reed is in vibration it makes and breaks contact between
this pair of springs ; and we have, therefore, on the tape of
the Morse instrument a series of dashes; a dash and the blank
space between it and the next corresponding to one vibration
of the reed.
    On the same tape, side by side with the track of the inking-
wheel of the Morse instrument, a pen is made to record the
movement of the pendulum of the standard clock in a suffi
ciently ordinary manner. We have then merely to count the
number of dashes in a given time, and we have the number of
vibrations in that interval, and hence the pitch of the reed.
   The electrical connexion is made in my laboratory by the
escapement-wheel of the clock ; and hence for accurate result
the time taken must be an integral multiple of a minute, the
period of revolution of the wheel.
    This method of determining the vibration-period of a reed
or tuning-fork has seemed to me to be of extreme simplicity,
and by taking a sufficient interval of time may be made of
any desired accuracy. A Morse receiver will spin out its tape
at a speed of 40 feet a minute, and the ordinary rolls of tape
 will last for at least 15 minutes when it is doing so.
    The limit of accuracy in this method of determining the
rate of vibration is, I find at present, the constancy of vibra
tion of the reed. It has been a surprise to me to find that the
vibration-period is not constant to much more than 1 part in
1000.

354        Dr. G. Gore on the Loss of Voltaic Energy
   These numbers represent the relative amounts of voltaic
energy exerted with zinc, by one part by weight of each of
the substances, when added to one of the portions of water,
and show that the electro-negative energy (or power of ex
citing a voltaic couple) of the halogens chlorine, bromine,
and iodine is very grently reduced by their chemical union
with potassium, and that of the resulting compound is still
further reduced by additional union with oxygen.
   In order to ascertain whether the energy was diminished
by every additional different substance added to and chemi
cally united with the original substance, or with the subse
quently formed group of bodies, I made the following measure
ments with substances in the proportions of their molecular
weights. The chemical compounds formed may be recognized
by having the smallest amounts of voltaic energy (see " A
Method of Detecting Dissolved Chemical Compounds and their
Combining Proportions," Proc.Roy. Soc. January 19th, 1889),
and are indicated by a X . Distilled water was employed in
making all the solutions, and the substances used were suf
ficiently pure for tae purpose.

   In this case the mean relative amount of voltaic energy of
the original substances averaged 350,021, and was reduced to
53 by the formation of a definite chemical compound having
the formula KC103, KC1.
   In order to reduce the voltaic energy still further- 1 used
the following substances :—

   In this case the mean relative amount of energy was 67'2,
and was reduced to 28'4 by the formation of a definite chemical
compound having the formula KC10S, KC1, Am8C204.
   In the experiments of these three tables, 1st, by the che
mical union of 1 atomic weight of chlorine with its chemical
equivalent of potassium to form KC1, the electro-negative
energy was reduced from 1282 millions to 699,803 ; 2nd, by
the union of 1 molecular weight proportion of KG with
oxygen, the energy was further reduced to 239 ; 3rd, by the
union of 1 molecular proportion of KC103 with its equivalent
of KG, the energy was still further diminished to 53 ; and
4th, by the union of KGOs, KG with its equivalent or 1
molecular weight proportion of ammonium oxalate, the energy
was finally decreased to 28-4. The total reduction was from
 1282 millions to 28-4.

 it has become a negative quantity, i. e. it is less than that

    In all these cases every addition to the degree of com
 plexity of the definite compounds formed by the addition of

varied inversely with the degree of molecular complexity of

      1. " On the Occurrence of Palaeolithic Flint Implements in
the neighbourhood of Ightham, Kent, their Distribution and pro
bable Age." By Joseph Prestwich, D.C.L., F.E.S., F.G.8.
   The author stated that Mr. Harrison of Ightham has discovered
over 400 palaeolithic implements lying on the surface at various
heights and over a wide area around Ightham. A description of the
physiography of the district and of the distribution of the various
gravels and drifts was given, and in the absence of fossils, attention
was called to the different lovels at which the deposits occurred, and
to their physical features and characters. Besides the river-gravels,
two groups of unclassed gravels were described, one occupying a
low level, and the other levels higher than that to which tho river-
drifts reach ; the latter is of varied composition.
   In the case of the Shode valley, only beds below tho contour-level
of 350 feet in its upper part, and of 300 feet or less in its lower
part can be referred to the former action of the Shode, and those
above this belong to a high-level drift of uncertain age. The com
position of the various gravels was described in detail.
   The implements are found on the surface of the land at all levels
up to 600 feet, and Mr. Harrison has discovered them at 40 localities
in the hydrographical basins of the Shode, the Darent, the Ley-
bourne stream, and in part of the Thames basin. Two groups of
implements extend far beyond the limits assigned to the river-drifts
formed since the present hydrographical basins were established, and
must be accounted for by some other means than those in connexion
with the former regime of the existing streams. A description of
the general characters and variations observable in the implements
was given.

360                       Geological Society :—
   It is evident from the condition of moet of the implements that
they have been imbedded in some matrix which has produced an
external change of structure and colour. In the case of the river-
gravel sites the question presents no difficulty. Three classes of
implements have been found ; (i.) where the flint still shows some of
its original colour ; (ii.) those of which the surface has turned from
black to white, has been altered in structure, and acquired a bright
patina, and which show no trace of wear ; (iii.) those of which the
flint has also lost its original colour, but has been stained, and is
 with or without patina ; these are generally much rolled. Tho
characters of the first call for no comment. Those of (ii.) and (iii.)
are very marked, and there is no difficulty in referring each to a dis
tinct matrix. The implements of class ii. have been imbedded in a
stiff brick-earth, generally of a reddish colour, and those of class iii.
seem to have lain in ferruginous beds of sand or gravel. Reasons
were given for supposing the surface to have been once covered with
a deposit of clay or loess, since denuded except where preserved in
pipes, and that a continuous plane descended from the high range
of the Lower Greensand to the Thames valley, which has since been
lowerod 300 feet or more. It was also shown that the high-level
doposits were formed anteriorly to the post-glacial drifts of the
Medway- and Thames-Valleys. It is probable that the loess is a
deposit from flood- waters, and that some of it may be referred to the
Medway flowing at a higher level ; but the highest deposits cannot
be so accounted for, and tho author referred to the possibility of glacial
action, without insisting on it. The deposit on tho Chalk-plateau
is abruptly cut off by the river-valleys, and the rudest forms of im
plements, such as those of Ash and Bower Lane, occur on this
plateau at from 500 to 550 feet, and the author thinks they may
possibly be of Pre-glacial age. The changes which have taken place
in the physiography of the district, and the great height of the old
chalk-plateau, with its clay-with- flints and southern drifts point to
long intervals of time, and to the great antiquity of the rude im
plements found in association with these drifts. That the removal of
the material indicates the existence of agents of greater force than
those operating under the present river regime closes up the time
required for the completion of the great physical phenomena, though
the author's inquiry tends to carry man further back geologically
than is usually admitted.

   1. " On the Cotteswold, Midford, and Yeovil Sands, and the
Division between Lias and Oolite." By S. S. Buckman, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   After giving a short sketch of the work and opinions of other

          On the Cotteswold, Midford, and Yeovil Sands.            361
writers, the author proceeded with the evidence on which his own
views are based. He described a series of sections of the typical
exposures of il Sands " and contiguous strata, commencing near
Stroud and terminating on the Dorset coast. Dividing the series,
into seven horizons, characterized by their distinctive Ammonites, viz.-
Amm. communis, variabilis, striatulus, dispansus, the genus Dumor
tieria, Amm. Moorei, and opalinus, and taking the Striatidus-hods as a
fixed starting-point, the author demonstrated how the strata varied
in regard to that horizon. The Cotteswold Sands, containing the
 Variabilis- and part of the CWini/nts-horizons, were below tho Stria-
twZtta-beds ; the Midford Sands, containing the Dhpansus-horizoTi,
were above, Oramm. striatulum occupying a thin bed at the base ;
the Yeovil Sands, containing the Moorei- and .DumoWwn'a-horizons,
overlay a bed containing Ammonites of the Dispansus-horizon, and
were consequently still later deposits.
    Since the different sands were deposited not on a horizontal plane,
in point of time, but, as it were, obliquely, the deposit of Cotteswold
Sands having ceased before that of Yeovil f>ands commenced, it was
incorrect to lump all the " Sands " from the Cotteswolds to tho Dorset
 coast under the single local name " Midford Sands," thereby implying
 a contemporaneity which did not exist, while the use of the present
 restricted local names was defended.
    The Ammonites were apparently uninfluenced by changes in the
 character of the deposit, since the same species are found in Lime
 stone in the Cotteswolds, in Sands at Midford, and in argillaceous
 Marl at Dminster. The change from argillaceous to arenaceous or
 calcareous deposits has been looked upon as so distinct a feature,
 that it has been utilized as a great argument in favour of drawing
the line between Lias and Oolite at that point ; but if this be dono,
 the line is always drawn at different horizons in different districts.
    If lithology furnishes no reason for a dividing-line at this point,
 it was shown that neither did palaeontology. It was also shown
 that the Ammonite family Hildoceratidae dominated the period from
 the Falcifer- to the Concavus-mnea, and that with the close of the
 latter zone they died out with singular abruptness, and that, further
 more, there exists, both in England and upon the continent, a marked
 hiatus at the same point due to the absence of a zone or a number of
 zones.
    On account of these facts the proposal was put forward that d'Or-
 bigny's term " Toarcien " should be emyloyed to designate the strata
 from the Falcifer-zono to the Concavus-zone inclusive, that this term
 should not be used in the sense of merely an extended " Upper
 Lias," but to mark an entirely distinct transition-formation,—a
 definite part of tho Jurassic period,—separating the typical Lias
 from the mass of thoroughly Oolitic strata.

   2. " On some Nodular Felatones of the Lleyn Peninsula." By
Miss Catherine A. Raisin, B.So.
   This paper dealt with two small masses of rock forming the head
lands of Pen-y-chain and Careg-y-defaid, a few miles from Pwllheli.
They consist of old lava-flows, once glassy, now devitrified and, at
the former place, associated with interbedded agglomeratic and ashy
 strata. The lithological characters, as well aa other slight evidence
obtained, would fully support the identification by the Survey of
the surrounding beds as of Bala age.
   The rocks exhibit evidence of alteration and of silicification,
suggesting that the district may have passed through a Solfatara
stage, and that its condition may have been not far removed from
that of a geyser region. Perlitic structure is common, and is often
found in connexion with spherulitic growth, of which there are
many gradations, and specially marked and large oxamples are
presented in the agate nodules.
   Some nodules seem to result from spheroidal fracture, others to
be masses of flow-brecciation ; but the majority have a spherulitic
crust, often surrounding an interior occupied by secondary quartz
or chalcedony. Similar specimens were described and compared
which had been received from Boulay Bay, through the kindness of
Professor Bonney. The evidence of these and of the Lleyn ex
amples appears to be strongly in favour of the view that the
spherulite is the least altered and most durable part of the mass.
Other considerations were brought forward by the author, which
would offer some further difficulties in accepting the decomposition-
theory to account for the origin of the interior of the nodules.
Some of the specimens described present certain special character
istics, and, at one locality in the Lleyn, what seem to be quartzose
amygdaloids occur, in close relation to agate nodules. On the
whole, although the mode of origin is difficult or impossible defi
nitely to prove, the evidence appears to suggest that in these
nodules a spherulitic crust has formed around an originally vesicular
nucleus.

Carbonic-acid Gas, on the Minerals of the Mica family." By
Alexander Johnstone, Esq., F.G.S.
   Two muscovite fragments were suspended for a year, one in dis
tilled water, the other in water saturated with carbonic anhydride.
A good deal of mica-dust was detached from each, but no material
had been dissolved, the only chemical change being hydration,
accompanied by physical alteration, producing a mineral chemically
and physically similar to a natural hydromuscovite.
   When biotite was similarly treated, the mineral suspended in
the distilled water became a hydrobiotite, whilst that in the water

saturated with carbonio anhydride underwent chemical change, and
was converted into hydromuscovite by loss of magnesia and iron,
which were dissolved in the water.
   Lepidomelane in pure water became hydrated, but in carbonated
water also sustained a loss of iron.
   The author has ascertained that when anhydrous micas become
hydrated, or lower hydrated ones more highly hydrated, they increase
in bulk.

ON THE OPHIOLITE OF THURMAN, WARREN CO., N.Y., WITH
   REMARK8 ON THE EOZOON CANADENSE.                      BY GEORGE P.
   MERRILL.
THE Warren County Ophiolite, or Verdantique Marble, as seen
     in the limited amount put upon the market, consists in its typical
 development of an even granular admixture of white calcite and
pale yellowish-green serpentine in about equal proportions. The
uniformity of texture is, however, often interrupted by large irre
gular blotches of deep lustrous-green serpentine, which, as shown
in a large block in the National Museum collection, sometimes
carry a white nucleus. The presence of this nucleal material,
which may frequently be observed passing by imperceptible grada
tions into the green serpentinous material, suggested at once that
here, too, the serpentine is a metasomatic product, as the writer
has shown* is the case with that of Montville, New Jersey. Thin
sections of the rock under the microscope confirm this suggestion.
The white nucleal mineral is seen to be an aggregate of small
monoclinic pyroxenes, quite colourless in the thin sections, without
pleochroism, but polarizing brilliantly and giving extinctions on
clinopinacoidal sections as high as 41°. Irregular canals of ser
pentinous matter cut through these aggregates following cleavage-
and fracture-lines, and all stages of alteration, can, as in the Mont
ville stone, often be observed in a single section. In the more
even-textured portions of the rocks the serpentine appears as
rounded or oval granules, with small enclosures of secondary cal
cite imbedded in the large original plates of the same material.
 Here, too, all stages of alteration are readily detected, some of the
 pyroxene granules being traversed by but a few wavy threads of
 the serpentinous matter, while in others not a trace of the original
 mineral remains. Were it not for these fresh remaining por
 tions one would hesitate to pronounce them pyroxenic derivatives,
 since they in no case show crystal outlines, but are mere oval
               * Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus. vol. xi. (1888) p. 105.

  blebs or granules imbedded like shot in the white calcite in a
  manner quite similar to that of the chondrodite grains in the white
 limestone from Amity, Orange County, in the same State. The
 granules are not in all cases isolated, but sometimes occur in groups,
  or connected by canals of serpentinous matter in a manner stri
  kingly suggestive of the detached sections and groups of Eozoon
  chamberlets, as figured by Dr. Dawson on pages 24 and 28 of his
 late paper*. Indeed I can but feel, since reading his resume, that,
 even at this late day, this serpentinization of pyroxene is destined
 to throw some light on the Eozoon problem. This idea is supported
 by the fact that the fragmental Eozoon has been reported from
 these same formations at Warren County, further by Dr. Dawson's
 statement that eozoonal masses often occur as " rounded or dome-
 shaped masses that seem to have grown on ridges or protuberances,
 now usually represented by nuclei of pyroxene "t. While, from
 the study of so limited an amount of the Warren County stone, it
 may not be advisable to assert that the remarkably regular struc
 tures figured by Dr. Dawson are due wholly to alteration in situ of
 pyroxene granules, I can but suggest that we have in this alteration
 the source of the serpentinous material, and that the " mineral
 pyroxene of the white or colourless variety              occurring orten
 in the lower layers and filling some of the canals " of the Eozoon
 is but the residual mineral which has escaped alteration. Further,
 that the structureless nodules of serpentine found in the eozoonal
 rocks, and to which often patches of Eozoon are attached or im
 bedded, are but patches in which the alteration is complete and the
pyroxenic nucleus quite obliterated. Dr. Dawson, although recog
nizing the frequent accompaniment of a white pyroxene with the
eozoonal structure, in no case mentions appearances indicating
that the serpentine is an alteration-product, but seems rather to
regard it as an original injection J, following in this respect the
well-known teachings of Dr. Hunt§. Those conversant with the
literature of the subject may recall that Messrs. King and Eowney ||
recognized also the presence of pyroxenes in these limestones, and,
in insisting upon the inorganic nature of the Eozoon, compared its
structural forms to those assumed by chondrodite, eoccolite, &c. in
the limestones of New York, New Jersey, and other localities.
These authorities seem, however, to have regarded the serpentine
as true " replacement pseudomorphs " after these minerals rather
than alteration or metasomatic products.

   In conclusion, the serpentine in the Warren County Ophiolite,
Ophicalcite, or Verdantique, as it has been variously called, is an
alteration or metasornatic product after a mineral of the pyroxene
group. The original rock would appear to have been simply a
pyroxenic limestone, the pyroxene occurring either in scattering

amination of the Essex County Ophiolite reveals a somewhat
similar though more complicated condition of affairs. A portion
of the serpentine here is also derived from a pyroxene ; but another,
and in cases a very large portion, is apparently after a mineral
which I have not as yet found sufficiently unchanged to be able to
identify. The rock is as yet insufficiently studied, and must be
made the subject of another paper. I am indebted to Mr. George
F. Kunz for the Warren County material.—American Journal of

             ON ELECTRODES WITH DROPPING MERCURY.
                        BY PROF. W. OSTWALD.
    In the Philosophical Magazine, 1886, vol. xxii. p. 70, 1 published a
 preliminary notice on the use of electrodes with dropping mercury,
 for measuring directly the potential of electrolytes. Some time
 afterwards Dr. James Moser employed the same method, but, in
 my opinion, he did not succeed in properly preparing the surface
 of his electrodes ; an operation by no means easy. Dr. Moser *
 obtained numbers differing from mine, and ascribes the fault to my
 having erroneously interpreted a formula of Lippmann.
    If, in this formula,
                                x=e+xa,
 x is the difference of potential with the small surface of mercury,
 x0 the same with the large surface of the capillary electrometer,
  and e the compensating force. Dr. Moser takes exception to my
  having neglected x0 in my determinations.
     The experiment which I have made consists in varying the
  external force e until the surface-tension of the small surface of
  mercury attains its maximum value. In this case, according to a
  theorem of von Helmholtz, the value of x becomes null, and we
  have
                                 e=-x0.
     The compensating force is then, the sign excepted, equal to the
  difference of potential between the mercury and the sulphuric acid
  in the large surface ; that is to say, equal to the difference which

in ordinary circumstances is set up between mercury and sulphuric
acid.
   M. Lippmann found this value equal to about 0*9 volt ; I myself
have found it to be 0-86 volt. This difference is due to difference
of concentration of the sulphuric acid ; that which M. Lippmann
used was about ^, while that which I used was about -fa.
   The difference of potential between mercury and sulphuric acid
is thus really 0*86 to 0*9 volt, according to the concentration of
the acid ; if then Dr. Moser found a different value of 0-4 volt, it
is a decisive proof that Dr. Moser's electrodes do not furnish the
true potential of the electrolytes.—Comptes Rendus, February 25,
1889.
      ON ELECTBOLYSIS.        BY MM. YIOLLE AND CHASSAGNY.
   The decomposition of water by means of a powerful current if
accompanied by luminous and calorific phenomena, which were
noticed more than forty years ago by MM. Fizeau and Foucault*,
and since then investigated by a large number of physicists. The
use of a Gramme machine which can furnish 40 amperes with an
electromotive force of 110 volts has enabled us readily to obtain
these phenomena, to observe
to call attention to some new facts.
   In water containing T*jj- sulphuric acid (with a smaller proportion
the phenomena are less well marked) a platinum wire 4-5 millim.
in diameter was immersed. The negative electrode was a platinum
wire 1*6 millim. in diameter, which was very slowly immersed in
the cold liquid.
   If the difference of potential at the binding-screws of the volta
meter is above 32 volts, a luminous sheath is observed about the
negative wire, which stands out from the liquid, and in which the
disengagement of hydrogen alone takes place. It offers a powerful
resistance to the passage of the current, which slowly diminishes
as the sheath extends, on penetrating the liquid with the wire, and
which suddenly falls the moment the sheath disappears to give
place to the ordinary disengagement by bubbles. The following
table indicates the maximum length I which the sheath can attain
for a given electromotive force E in a cold liquid ; I is the indica
tion of a Deprez-Carpentier's ammeter in the circuit.

   The quantities of electrical energy expended in the voltameter
are virtually proportional to the maximal lengths of the sheath
which they can produce.
   The light which is seen on the electrode is discontinuous ; there
are at first only some brilliant orange points at the end of the
wire ; then a fringe of a violet colour extends over the whole of
the immersed part.
   This part becomes greatly heated and the heating contributes
powerfully to keeping up the sheath. If in fact the current is
broken the sheath does not at once disappear, and a hissing is
produced when the liquid touches the metal. In like manner the
transition from the sheath to bubbles, when the electrode being
gradually immersed reaches a certain depth, is accompanied hy
a kind of explosion. On the other hand, with a potential lower
than 32 volts, the sheath can be produced on the negative wire
which has been previously heated ; but the phenomenon is then
transitory, and the disengagement in the form of huhbles soon
takes place across the liquid which has come in contact with the
cooled wire.
   The sheath having been formed for a certain length , if the dif
ference of potential between the two electrodes be made to in
crease progressively, the calorific and luminous manifestations
increase in intensity. The discharges which illumine the sheath
become more numerous and more brisk. The disengagement of
gas is accelerated ; the liquid rises round the electrode ; and the
sheath increases and becomes detached with evolution of light
and explosion in the form of large, compressed bubbles. The
immersed part of the electrode becomes red hot and may even
melt; with an electromotive force of 80 to 100 volts platinum
wire, 1*6 millim. in diameter, immersed to a depth of from 2 cen
tim. to 4 centim., is easily melted, while the part of the same wire
which is outside is scarcely hot.
   With a great difference of potential it is difficult to produce,

368            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
aud still more difficult to maintain, the sheath, which at the
smallest agitation is transformed into crepitating bubbles.
   This resonant form of electrolysis is accompanied by a super
ficial disaggregation of th9 negative electrode ; the liquid soon
becomes charged with a very heavy black powder, which is essen
tially composed of a hydride of platinum ; this decomposes in a
vacuum above 400° * and corresponds to the formula PtjH.
   We have hitherto only been concerned with the phenomena
met with at the negative pole. A sheath may also be observed
on the positive pole. For this purpose it is sufficient to invert
the conditions of the experiment, to attach to the negative pole the
wire of 4-5 millim., always deeply immersed in the same water
acidulated to -j^, and to gradually immerse the positive electrode,
which is a wire of 1*6 millim. diameter. There is considerable
difficulty in obtaining the sheath, which does not form sharply with
less than 50 volts, but which in return is remarkably persistent ; it
is moreover much less luminous.
   If the sheath is first of all formed on the stout wire, which is
immersed to a depth of 2 to 3 centim., in proportion as the stout
wire is immersed the sheath elongates to the point at which it
disappears suddenly; but at the same time the strength of the
current increases, and the other electrode may become so much
heated as in turn to be covered with a luminous sheath, or with
crepitating bubbles.
   Similar phenomena, though far less intense, are met with in
water acidulated with phosphoric acid. The normal decomposition
is disturbed with greater difficulty, as has already been pointed out
by M. Mascart t.—Comptes Bendus, Feb. 11, 1889.
      ON THE ELECTBOLYTIC BEHAVIOUR OP MICA AT HIGH
               TEMPERATURES. BY W. H. SCHULTZE.
   The results of this investigation are as follows :—
   Mica split parallel to the planes of cleavage shares with glass the
property of becoming a better conductor for the current as the
temperature rises. After reaching a maximum, its conductivity
diminishes ; and at a certain high temperature it becomes infinitely
small.
   Comparing mica and glass, it is seen that even at a high tempe
rature the former is the better insulator.—Wiedemann's Annalen,

 XLV. The Concave Grating in Theory and Practice. By
   Joseph Sweetman Ames, Assistant in Physics in the Johns
   Hopkins University*.
                             [Plate VIII.]
SINCE the invention of the concave grating in 1881, it has
      been universally recognized as one of the most valuable
instruments for spectroscopic work at our command. Owing
to difficulties in their ruling, however, it is only recently that
they have come at all into common use. Thinking that the
experience of many years might be useful, at Professor Row
land's request I write this explicit description of the appa
ratus at the Johns Hopkins University and the adjustments
found necessary for its accurate use.
                          General Theory.
   The general theory of a concave spherical grating gives (see
Rowland, Phil. Mag. vol. xvi. p. 197, and Amer. Journ. Sci.
vol. xxvi. p. 91) as the radius vector of the focal curve (see
PI. VIII. fig. I.),

                      R (cos /u. + cos v) — p cos2 v
it being referred to the centre of the grating as origin, /a is
the angle r makes with p the radius of curvature of the gra
ting ; and R and v are the coordinates of the source of light.
For any given value of R and v there is thus a curve defined

370           Mr. J. S. Ames on the Concave Grating
by r and fi, on which the various spectra are brought to a
focus ; and there is a second curve passing through K, v such
that, if the source of light be placed at any point of it, the
spectra will be brought to focus along the curve r, fi. These
two curves are then conjugate, and their properties have been
discussed by Mr. Baily in the Philosophical Magazine for 1883
(vol. xv. p. 183).
   If we make R=pcosv(t. e. place the slit on the circle
whose diameter is the radius of curvature of the grating),
r — p cos fi ; that is, the two focal curves coincide. This case
is shown in fig. II.
   As is well known, this arrangement is mechanically secured
by placing the slit at the intersection of two beams set at
right angles, on which are ways to carry tho grating and eye
piece, these two being kept at a constant distance p apart by
an iron girder. Thus, in fig. III. the slit is at A, the grating
at B, and the eyepiece or camera at C.
   The reasons for putting the eyepiece at C, where f* = 0, are
easily found. Suppose the micrometer-eyepiece were placed
at D (fig. IV.), tangent to the focal circle. Let the eyepiece be
displaced along the tangent by an amount DD' or " a,"
                        a=|sin2O*-0),

   But by theory of diffraction (see Rayleigh, Encyc. Brit.,
Wave Theory of Light, vol. xxiv. p. 437),
                       X = ^ (sin v + sin ft.),

Or, if a photographic plate, bent to radius p/2, wore placed at
D, one scale-division A along plate
                                = pdfi,

                               (l\= —rr>
                                    PN
since /t is so small that wo can put cos/t=l. Hence the
spectrum is " normal " at C. Further, in this case,

                      .'. .since AC = p sin v,
Thus, if one absolute wave-length is marked on AC, and the
instrument is in perfect ad justment, we can mark on the beam
AC a scale of wave-lengths for each spectrum, and the abso
lute wave-length of any line is known at once. It is im
portant to notice that this scale on the beam is identical with
the scale on the photographic plate, and that all the spectra
are in focus at C at the same time, and stay in focus however
C moves along AC, it being rigidly fastened to B. These
facts alone would render a concave grating preferable to a
plane one ; but it has many other points of superiority. It
is the only spectroscope suitable for use in both the ultra
violet and the infra-red. Much longer photographic plates
can be used than with any other instrument, since they can
easily be bent so that they are entirely in focus. Between
the slit and the camera-box no lens is interposed. Besides the
saving in light and cost, there are no corrections necessary for
spherical aberration, imperfections of lenses, right- and left-
handed quartz, &c. Further, the concave grating is astigmatic,
i. e. a point of light as the source is brought to focus, not in a
point, but in a line. The advantages of this fact are :—
   (1) A narrow spark at the slit is broadened out into a wide
spectrum.
   (2) Greater accuracy in comparing metallic and solar lines,
as will appear later when the use of the instrument is described.
   (3) No " dust-lines," as they are brought to a different
focus.
   (4) A spectrum is obtained which is broad enough to stand
enlarging.

    By the principle of addition of small displacements, the
 effect of any combination of these four displacements can be
 found by addition—one can be used to counteract another,
 and so on. Thus, displacement IV. can correct a combination
 of I. and III. This has been found true in practice.
     Any small displacement, as long as the distance from the
 grating to the camera-box is unaltered, does not affect the
 constant of the instrument (i. e. the ratio of A to tlx), for, as
  we saw above, that depends on this distance alone.
                         General Description.
     Before giving the adjustments and precautions necessary in
  mounting a concave grating properly, I will briefly describe
  the various parts of the apparatus as used in Professor Row
  land's Laboratory.
     The instrument is mounted in a room, the walls and fix
  tures of which are blackened, and whose windows are of
  " ruby " glass and provided with black shades. Opening off'

                     in Theory and Practice.                 375
this is a balcony for the heliostat. The beams carrying the
instrument are placed about eight feet from the floor, and a
platform erected at one end of the room, thus allowing the
floor-space to be used for other purposes if necessary.
   AB and AC (see figs. XII., XIII.) are heavy wooden beams
6x13 in. and 23 feet long. AB is fastened rigidly to the
wall, while AC has a slight freedom of rotation about A,
controlled by screws at C. The " ways " for the grating-
holder and camera-box are fastened to these beams by screws
which admit of adjustment, so that the " ways " may be
straightened if the beams warp. They are made of £-inch
angle-iron, although a board made of any hard wood may be
used. G G' is a 4 in. tubular wrought-iron girder, braced by
a truss, and pivoted at its ends, directly over the " ways," on
two iron carriages. Its length is approximately equal to the
radius of the grating, and has a range of adjustment of about
six inches. The carriages have each two brass wheels or
rollers placed nearly a foot and a half apart, and these resting
on the iron ways enable the girder to be easily moved from
one position to another. The camera-box and grating-holder
are themselves movable along BC and have freedom to revolve
around axes, but can be finally clamped in place. The camera-
box (see fig. XIV.) consists of a fixed wooden frame B, and a
box A which can be removed. The sensitive plate is placed
in A in suitable slots and is pressed firmly by means of wooden
buttons against pieces of hard rubber so that it is bent to the
proper radius. There is in B a frame which can be moved
vertically by a rack and pinion ; and to this A is fastened by
dowel pins on the bottom and hooks at the top. On the back
of the camera-box, B, is hinged a board " C," which can bo
held firmly in place by hooks. This board carries a brass
plate (see fig. XV.) having a longitudin.il opening of a width
equal to the thickness of the plate and capable of revolution
around a horizontal central axis. By means of stops this
revolution is confined to 90°. This plate is used for the com
parison of spectra, as described below.
   The grating-holder is made of brass. It consists (see
fig. XVI.) of a heavy platform carrying an upright frame, B,
which can move in slots on A. To B is fastened by screws
at the sides, P, a square piece of brass D. D is movable
around the axes, P, by means of a screw S. To D by means
of an axis P', at the bottom is fastened the frame, C. By
means of a screw at S' whose nut is rigidly connected with
D, C can be moved around the axis, P'. Springs take up the
slack of the screws when unscrewed.
   The grating itself stands on two projections at the bottom

376          Mr. J. S. Ames on the Concave Grating
of C, and is held there, free from all constraint, by a soft
wax. By means of the side and back screws the grating can,
then, be turned around its centre in its own plane, or tipped
back and forward.
   The slit placed at A is of somewhat complicated mechanism.
See fig. XVII. It has the following adjustments :—
    1st. Width of slit can be regulated by a micrometer-screw.
It is generally not open more than O001 in.
   2nd. The slit can be rotated about a central axis so as to
make it parallel to the lines of the grating. This adjustment
is one of the last to be made in mounting the grating, and is
done by turning the slit until the definition is the best possible.
This is most important, as the excellence of the photographs
depends largely upon it. The definition is spoilt, if the slit
is 0°-5 out.
   3rd. Stops can be inserted at top and bottom, thus causing
the grating to be illuminated by the centre of the solar image
only. Otherwise the definition may be spoilt by the rotation
of the sun. It is important, therefore, that the image of the
sun on the slit be quite large. With the larger apparatus in
use in the Johns Hopkins University it isl-2 cm. in diameter,
and this is reduced one half by the stops.
   For solar work a heliostat, having a south exposure, throws
the light on the slit by means of a condensing-lens and a
totally reflecting prism. The lens is held in a brass frame,
and can be adjusted from within the building. Between the
prism and the lens is a revolving stage with circular openings,
across which absorbing solutions c»n be placed. Both this
stage and the lever arm carrying the reflecting prism are
controlled by strings running along AC ; so that, without
leaving his seat, the observer can place different solutions
before the slit, or put aside ihe prism, when a metallic spec
trum is to be photographed. For this purpose, along the
line of the slit and grating is a wooden tube with condensing-
lens, which focuses on the slit the image of the arc-light or
spark, placed in a separate compartment. (See fig. XII.) All
 lenses and prisms must, of course, be made of quartz.
    For the arc-light a Weston dynamo of 150 volts, 30
amperes pow er is used, or alternating Siemens of 700 volte
 maximum. For spark spectra, Professor Rowland has had
 constructed an induction-coil, which (with from 3 to 12
 gallon-jars) gives a spark of intense brilliancy, when driven
 by the alternating Siemens dynamo. Using this coil, iron
 wire -j\;in. diameter melts, and | in. wire is heated red hot.
    Gratings with 10,000, 14,438, and 20,000 lines to the inch
 are used. For ordinary purposes a 10,000 one is sufficient,

                     in Theory and Practice.
while for photographing in the ultra-violet it is best to have
a 20,000 grating, with a rulod space of 5^ in. on a 6 in.
polished surface. The radius of curvature is generally 21*5 ft.
The photographic plates are 19 in. long, 2 in. wide, and T^in.
thick. This thickness allows the plates to be bent to the
required radius without breaking. They are flowed with an
ammonia emulsion by Professor Rowland himself, and register
from 15-20 on Warnerke's sensitometer. Quick plates give
too coarse an effect for enlargement. For short focus gratings,
such as may be used for gaseous spectra or direct stellar
spectra, Professor Rowland has suggested the use of paper
or celluloid negatives, as they can be bent to a small radius.
   The micrometer-eyepiece used is more like a dividing-
engine than an ordinary micrometer. It has a run of
5 inches, and the screw is to all purposes perfect, having been
made according to the directions given by Professor Rowland
in his article on the Screw in the Encyc. Brit. vol. xxi.
p. 552.
   Hoods of black cloth to keep out stray light are necessary
at the slit, and at the camera-box, where ono should extend
halfway to the grating, as even the darkest room has some
light in it.
                            Adjustments.
   The adjustment of these various parts of the apparatus is
comparatively simple. The two beams carrying the grating
and camera-box are made as level as possible and placed at
right angles by the " 3, 4, 5 " rule. The two axes at the ends
of the girder must be made parallel, while the girder is wider
stress. To do this the girder is supported at its ends on
two "horses;" and the axes are adjusted by the control-
screws until the two are vertical. This is the most difficult
adjustment.
   The camera-box, grating- holder, and slit are put in place
at the proper height. Most gratings give a brighter spectrum
on one side than on the other ; and so, before placing the
grating on its holder, it must be examined to see which side
should be used. A candle is held at the centre of the camera-
box, which is kept directly over the axis of the carriage ;
and the grating is turned and the girder lengthened until the
flame and its image coincide. By this, the grating is placed
perpendicular to the girder, and the girder itself is given the
correct length. The camera-box is then made vertical by a
plumb-line. To adjust it perpendicular to the girder, a piece
of plate-glass is fastened to its face, and a candle is held on
the girder near the grating. The camera-box is then revolved

378          Mr. J. S. Allies on the Concave Grating
until the flame and image come in line. The reflecting-prism
is now put in place so as to illuminate the entire grating, and
the slit opened. The spectrum formed at the camera-box is
observed by the eye, or thrown on a piece of paper ; and the
back-screw of the grating-holder is turned until it falls at the
right height. The camera-box is moved along its way, and
in general the spectrum rises or falls ; and this is corrected by
the side-screw of the grating-holder. These two adjustments
are repeated many times until the spectrum stays in place
however the camera-box is moved. Then the slit is narrowed,
and revolved until the best definition is secured. The instru
ment now should be in perfect adjustment ; and to test this
an exposed photographic plate, of which tho emulsion has
been partly scraped, giving it a lattice-work appearance, is
put in the camera-box, emulsion side toward the grating.
The spectrum formed on the plate and the emulsion itself
ought now to be in focus at the same time in all orders of
spectra ; that is, if the plate is observed with an eyepiece,
there should be no parallax between the two. In general,
further adjustment is found necessary. It was to this end
that the theory of errors, as above given, was deduced. Let
the camera-box be placed in focus when it is near the slit ;
and then, as it is moved away from it, suppose the parallax
increases proportionally to the distance along the way. This
would lead one to think that the two beams were not exactly
at right angles. Similarly for the other displacements. It is
found in practice that it does most good to turn the grating-
holder slightly around its vertical axis.
   If, in setting up the instrument, a micrometer-eyepiece is
used instead of a camera, practically the same adjustments are
found necessary.
                        Use of Instrument.
    Gratings in Practice.— Special gratings should be selected
for special purposes. Every grating has spectra of different
 brightness on the two sides ; and one should be used which is
 bright in the particular spectra desired. But more than this,
 even if the red of any one spectrum is bright, the violet may
 not be. This fact must be especially noted in working beyond
 the visible spectrum. Further the various parts of the grating,
 especially if it is concave, may give spectra of varying
 brightness. For instance, the second spectrum may be uni
 formly bright for all parts of the grating, while one end of the
 grating may give a bright third spectrum and the other end
 a faint one. This fact may be brought out by viewing the
grating directly with the eye. It is only when extreme

                         in Theory and Practice.                            379
accuracy is wished and the overlapping spectra of different
orders are to be used, that this imperfection must be guarded
against. Since a 10,000 grating has on the whole better
definition than a 20,000 one, and as it is much cheaper, it is
better to use one in all cases when possible. For use with the
micrometer-eyepiece, when of course the ultra-violet spectra
do not interfere, one can always be used.
    It is only when work is to be done with the camera in the
ultra-violet part of the spectrum that it becomes necessary to
use a 20,000 grating. This is due to the fact that, for the
same dispersion with a 20,000 grating as for a 10,000, there
are fewer overlapping spectra. The range of concave gratings
mounted as above are as follows :—
     Lines       Firat      Second       Third      Fourth          Fifth
   per inch. Spectrum. Spectrum. Spectrum.         Spectrum.     Spectrum.
    10,000      Entire.     Entire.     Entire.    To 0,000       To 4,800
    14,438      Entire.     Entire.    To 5,700    To 4,330       To 3,460
    20,000      Entire.   To 6,000     To 4,000    To 3,000       To 2,400
     These limits are taken at the centre of the photographic
plate. At the end of the plate the limit is somewhat greater,
being 6260 in the 2nd spectrum for a 20,000 grating.
     With a grating of 21-5 ft. radius, the width of the spectrum
varies from \ in. to 4 in. In the green of the 1st sj>ectrum
 of a 20,000 grating it is f in., and in the green of the second
it is 2| in. This gives an idea as to the width of the photo
 graphic plate which is required.
     The scale of the negatives in the various spectra, with
 gratings of 21"5 ft. radius, is as follows :—
                        Scale of Spectra as compared with Angst •iim's Map.

 i. e. using a 20,000 grating in the 3rd sivectrum, the scale is
 1'55. This means that 1*55 millim. on the photographic plate

 380         Mr. J. S. Ames on the Concave Grating
 includes 1 Angstrom unit. For gratings of 10 ft. radius, the
 scale is diminished in the ratio of 100 : 215 or 20 : 43.
    Since with a concave grating all the spectra are in focus at
 the same time, it is important to know what wave-lengths of
 the different spectra are on the photographic plate or in the
 field of the eyepiece, for any position they may be in. For
 this purpose I have given a diagram of the overlapping
 spectra on the Plate. This explains itself :—Wave-length
 6000 in the 2nd spectrum coincides with wave-length 4000 in
 the 3rd spectrum, with wave-length 3000 in the 4th spectrum,
 and so on. The vertical lines give the range of the different
 gratings, as explained above. If it is desirable to cut off any
 interfering spectrum, glass plates or absorbing solutions may
 be used. A list of the principal absorbents, and the parts of
the spectrum which they let through, is given below.

   Before using a solution, an observer should always see
what its effect is by a preliminary experiment.
                         Methods of Work.
    A spectroscope is used for two purposes—to measure tbe
lines in solar or metallic spectra, or to establish coincidences
simply. For both of these, the concave grating is far
superior to any other on account of the overlapping spectra.
    The micrometer-eyepiece, of course, can be used only in
the visible spectrum, while the methods of photography give
us this and the invisible too. Rowland's micrometer-eye
piece, as noted above, has a run of 5 inches, and so can in
clude a great number of lines. When a metallic spectrum is
to be measured, the solar spectrum is turned on, a series of
measurements is taken, then the metallic spectrum replaces
the solar, another series is taken, then finally a series of solar
lines. All this is done in one run of the screw, and without
the observer leaving the eyepiece. The solar lines are found
on Rowland's map, and then the wave-lengths of the metallic
ones are deduced by interpolation. This same method of
interpolation will also give the relative wave-lengths of the
 solar lines, using the overlapping spectra. The probable error
 of a wave-length determined this way is ±0'01 Angstrom
 unit.
    Now that we have Rowland's map and his list of solar
 fines, the photographic process for the measurement of
 metallic spectra is generally used as far as the erythrosin
 plates extend or to the D line, although those expert in the
 use of cyanine plates may photograph below C or even A, as
 Mr. Burbank has shown in the Phil. Mag. for Oct. 1888.
    Owing to the astigmatism of the grating, it is not possible
 to adopt the usual method of illuminating part of the slit with
 tbe solar image and part with the spark or arc ; and so a
 different and far better plan is adopted. A compound photo
 graph of the two spectra is taken in the following manner :—
 The brass plate on the back of the camera-box (see fig. XIV.)
 is placed vertical, the solar spectrum is photographed along
 the middle of the sensitive plate, the sunlight is turned off,
  the brass plate is revolved through 90°, and the metallic
 spectrum is allowed to fall along the upper and lower parts of
  the photographic plate. Then, finally, the sunlight is turned
  on again along the middle of the plate. If there has been
  any gradual displacement of the camera during the operation
  the error is eliminated by this process, if the two times of
  exposure to the solar spectrum are the same.
     It is important to notice that record must in all cases be

382         Mr. J. S. Ames on the Concave Grating
kept of thermometer- and barometer-readings ; for tho cor
 rections due to variations in temperature and pressure may
be considerable.
    Since no absorbing solution is known which lets through
the ultra-violet rays alone, the following method has to be
used to determine what lines on any negative are ultra-violet
ones. A compound negative, as just described, is taken,
having all the overlapping spectra at the point in question
along the middle of the plate, and the visible lines alone,
obtained by inserting absorbents, along the top and bottom.
Those lines present in the first and not in the second are then
ultra-violet ones.
   The time of exposure varies. For arc or solar light five
minutes is the average time required for the most sensitive
part, in the third spectrum on plates registering 18 on War-
nerke's sensitometer. Ten minutes are required above the
D lines in the second spectrum, using erythrosin plates. One
hour is needed for cyanine plates, photographing down to the
C line. As a practical example, the entire iron and solar
spectra were photographed in the second and third spectra
from the D lines down to the extreme ultra-violet in nine
hours. This includes time spent in developing. Thirty
plates, each 19 inches long, were exposed, giving of course
many duplicates. Only 10 plates are necessary in the second
spectrum of a 20,000 grating for the whole spectrum from the
D line to the extreme ultra-violet, wave-length 2000. In one
case Liveing and Dewar used 170 plates for the ultra-violet
spectrum alone.
   With a very powerful induction-coil, worked by a Siemens
alternating dynamo, with 6 gallon-Leyden jars, 10 minutes is
enough in the most sensitive part and 30 in the extreme ultra
violet, wave-length 2200.
   A compound negative taken in the above manner is placed
on a dividing-engine, and measurements made on the lines of
the two spectra, using a low-power microscope with a single
stretched cross-hair. Since the solar spectrum continues
down to 3200, the same orders of the two spectra can be com
pared thus far. Beyond this it is necessary to use different
orders. For instance, wave-length 2800 in the third spectrum
can be compared with solar lines about wave-length 4200 in
the second. This same method is used to determine the
relative wave-lengths of the solar spectrum.
   To enlarge photographs with a scale of wave-lengths, like
Rowland's map of the spectrum, one must proceed as follows.
   To make the scale, a thick plate of glass, slightly longer

                     in Theory and Practice.                383
than the negative, is albumenized and then treated with
collodio-chloride. It is then put in any developer until it
turns black. A longitudinal strip of the width of the nega
tive is scraped off, and on the edge of this strip the scale is
ruled with a dividing-engine. The negative is clamped in
place to this scale, and together they are put in the enlarging
camera. The accuracy with which the scale can be made and
the negative fitted to it is most satisfactory. On Professor
Rowland's new map the greatest error is "03 of an Angstrom
unit, and the probable error is less than "02 of a unit. If the
scale is, say, "0001 too large or too small, the photographs
can be made to fit the scale by altering the distance between
the grating and camera-box by "0001 of its amount, and then
focusing by moving the slit in or out.
   When this scale is once made, it can be used to give direct
readings for the wave-lengths of the lines on any negative
simply by placing the negative on the scale.
   A word should be said as to the difficulties of ruling gra
tings, which may explain why so many orders for gratings
remain unfulfilled. It takes months to make a perfect screw for
the ruling-engine, but a year may easily be spent in search of
a suitable diamond-point. The patience and skill required
can be imagined. For the past year all attempts to find a
point for the new ruling-engine have failed, and it is only
within a few days that one has been found. Most points
make more than one " furrow " at a time, thus giving a great
deal of diffused light. Moreover few diamond-points rule
with equal ease and accuracy up hill and down. This defect
of unequal ruling is especially noticeable in small gratings,
which should not be used for accurate work. Again, a gra
ting never gives symmetrical spectra ; and often one or two
 particular spectra take all the light. This is of course de
sirable if these bright spectra are the ones which are to be
used. Generally it is not so. These individual peculiarities
of gratings were fully treated by Professor Rowland in his
lectures during the spring term of 1888 ; and have been
embodied by him in a complete mathematical theory of the
grating, which he has nearly ready for publication. It is not
easy to tell when a good ruling-point is found ; for a
"scratchy" grating is often a good one; and a bright ruling-
point always gives a " scratchy " grating. When all goes
well, it takes five days and nights to rule a 6-inch grating
having 20,000 lines to the inch. Comparatively no difficulty
is found in ruling 14,000 lines to the inch. It is much harder
to rule a glass grating than a metallic one ; for to all of the

above difficulties is added the one of the diamond-point con

 has ruled only three glass gratings, one of which has been lost,
 and the other two are kept in his own laboratory. These two
 were used by Dr. Bell in his determination of the absolute
 wave-length of the D lines.

XLVI. On Helmholtz's Theory of Mercury-dropping Elec
     trodes, and the. Difference of Potential between Clean Mercury
     and Electrolytes. By J. Brown, Belfast*.
 WITHIN the last few years considerable attention has
            been attracted on the continent by a hypothesis put
forward by von Helmholtzf, regarding mercury-dropping
electrodes as a means of testing potentials of liquids.
     The hypothesis is given in § 8 below. Researches based
 on it have been undertaken by several authors, but chiefly by
 Ostwald, whose short communication J, published in 1886,
first drew my attention to the subject. His complete work §
 gives tables of contact potential-difference for many metals
 and liquids ; and the conviction, on electrochemical grounds,
 that these were incorrect led to an examination of the hypo
 thesis on which they were based, and to a conclusion respect
ing the action of mercury-dropping electrodes different from
 that of von Helmholtz.
    The recent publication of a paper || by Exner and Tuma, in
which these authors come to the same conclusion, encourages
me to give a rdsumi of the arguments on both sides, beginning
with a very much condensed translation of the portion of von
Helmholtz's paper referring to the subject (p. 933,1, of which
I shall endeavour to give as correct a rendering as is possible
in a few words. The quotation-marks are for convenience,
and are not to be taken as implying verbal exactness.
     2. " The current which occurs on unequal [successive]
immersion of similar electrodes in the same liquid is due to
the alteration produced by local action on the surface of the
first-dipped electrode. A similar action occurs when mercury

is allowed to run out in small drops under the surface of a
liquid, the surface of each drop forming out of the interior of
the pure metal which has not yet been in contact with either
air or liquid. According to all Quincke's* observations, the
positive current in this case always goes in the direction of
the falling drops of mercury.
   3. " Thiit is to say, the mercury which collects on tho
bottom of the containing vessel, and which concentrates on
its surface the films that nave been produced by the changes
referred to, has greater positive potential than the upper,
continually renewed surface. Such a difference of potential
implies an electric double layer, whose positive half is inside
the lower mercury and its negative on the anion of tho fluid
in contact.
   4. " This double layer forms gradually, since it has been
shown by Quincke that slow dropping produces weak differ
ences of potential ; whilo, as the speed of dropping increases,
a maximum difference of potential is reached, after which
increasing the speed of dropping has no further effect. The
maximum will occur as soon as the new portions of the upper
 mercury form into drops so quickly that they cease to bo
 charged sensibly before they break away, and therefore the
 upper surface remains in a perfectly unchanged state.
    5. ''According to Faraday's law, the passage of positive
 electricity into tho metal can only occur by electrolysis, in
 which is concerned some substance having less attraction for
 positive electricity than the mercury. This may probably bo
 atmospheric oxygen dissolved in the liquid, to which we may
 ascribe sufficient affinity for negative electricity to draw it out
 of the mercury and replace it with positive electricity. Tho
 slowness of the charging would then be due to the smallness
 of the quantity of oxygen present and its slow renewal by
 diffusion. Further experiment is needed to prove this
 hypothesis. Quincke shows that boiling the electrolyte does
 not stop the phenomenon, but a very small quantity of oxygen
 would be enough.
    6. " If the effect were due to any component of the elec
 trolyte which is present in large quantity, the charging of the
 surfaces in contact would take place in an insensibly short
 time.
    7. " Although this is to be understood merely as a hypo
 thesis, it is sufficient for what follows that, under the received
 conditions, mercury in contact with liquid charges itself, only

386          Mr. J. Brown on Helmholtz's Theory of
slowly, positive to the liquid. The slowness of the charging
is well shown in Lippmann's capillary electrometer, where
the diffusion is limited by the narrowness of the tube, and
the fine thread of mercury only slowly creeps to a position of
equilibrium different from that of freshly dropped mercury.
    8. " From this I conclude that, when a quickly dropping
but otherwise insulated quantity of mercury is in contact by
the dropping-point with an electrolyte, the mercury and elec
trolyte can have no difference of potential. If, for example,
the mercury were positive, then would each falling drop form
on its surface a double layer, taking positive electricity out
of the mercury and so making its potential less and less until
it became equal to that of the liquid."
    9. Instead of the elaborate theory here described, necessi
tating hypotheses of an admittedly unproved and rather
doubtful character, I think it can be shown that there is a
 much more simple explanation of the action of dropping
 electrodes. The arrangement constitutes simply a voltaic cell
 in which the elements are clean mercury, electrolyte, tar
 nished mercury.
    10. Suppose a drop with a fresh surface is made to pro
 trude a little from the funnel-point immersed in a suitable
 electrolyte, such as dilute sulphuric acid. Electrolytic action
 at once takes place ; a film of the mercury is oxidized or
 chemically acted on by the anion of the electrolyte, and there is
 formed an electric double layer, but with the signs of its com
 ponents the reverse of those supposed by Helmholtz, viz.
 negative in the metal, positive in the liquid, the difference of
 potentials of its components being large because of the clean
 ness of the metal ; that is to say, the clean upper mercury is
 at a lower potential relatively to the electrolyte than the tar
 nished lower mercury, and therefore on joining these two a
 current flows from the lower to the upper through the con
 necting wire, and continues till the upper has become as
 tarnished as the lower. Let the drop now protrude a little
 further. A corresponding enlargement of the surface takes
 place, and a portion of fresh untarnished metal is exposed,
 causing increased electrolytic action and current, which dies
 away as the surface of the drop becomes again tarnished.
     Suppose now the drop to increase slowly and continuously
 till it separates and falls off. As it increases the surface is
 continually somewhat freshened, and so a constant but moderate
 current is kept up. Moderate because the amount of fresh
 surface being exposed is small compared with that of the
 already tarnished surface. But if the drop increase quickly
 the more rapid formation of fresh surface causes an increase

                 Mercury-dropping Electrodes.                387
in the current. The limit to this increase occurs when the
current which can flow, taking into account the resistance of
the arrangement and the small electromotive force available,
combined with any purely local action at the surface of the
drop, has not time to effectively tarnish it before it breaks
away.
   11. It follows that in the experiment described in § 4 the
potential of the resting mercury remains constant, while that
of the dropping mercury falls with the increasing speed of
dropping till the maximum is reached, as described in § 10.
I give the following considerations as supporting this view
and as showing my difficulties in accepting that of von
Helmholtz.
   12. Since in § 3 the positive potential of the lower mercury
is said to be due to the concentration on its surface of the
films produced on the drops, and in § 4 that maximum
difference of potential occurs when the drops form and break
away before they have time to get charged at all, it follows
that with quick dropping, producing maximum difference of
potential, the alteration of mercury surface forming the re
quired double layer must, according to von Helmholtz's view,
take place during the fall of the drops through the liquid and
after they have separated from the upper funnel.
   With somewhat slower dropping the alteration would be
partly before separation and partly during the fall.
   In either case the length of fall is a factor in the result,
and making it small or zero should at least decrease the
current and electromotive force of the arrangement.
   And, further, since the current is in both cases carried by
the falling drops and not by the electrolyte through which
they fall, any variation in the resistance of the electrolyte
should have no effect on the current.
   13. I have found, however, by experiment, that decreasing
the fall increases the current and has no effect on the electro
motive force, while decreasing the resistance of the electrolyte
increases the current.
   A thistle-funnel drawn out to a fine tube whose orifice was
about "17 millim. diameter, and which delivered with a head
of 42 centim. of mercury (the whole length of the funnel)
about | cubic centim. per minute, was fixed with its point
just below the surface of a column of spring-water 5£
centim. diameter by 33 centim. high, contained in a tall glass
over a little mercury at the bottom.
   The difference of potential of this bottom mercury and that
in the funnel, measured by a quadrant electrometer (giving
 72 divisions for the E.M.F. of a Daniell's cell), was, with the
                               2 C 2

 388         Mr. J. Brown on Helmholtz's Theory of
 point of the funnel just under the surface of the water (" up "),
 or within about 3 millim. of the lower mercury (" down "),
 as follows :—
    Up 26 divisions. Down 23-5. Up 23-5. Down 235.
 Up 23.
    The electromotive force is therefore not sensibly influenced
 by the length of fall.
    The somewhat larger first deflexion is perhaps due to a
 higher degree of oxidation on the lower mercury, afterwards
 modified by the fresh drops falling on it. This effect is
 marked when the lower mercury has only a small surface
 more easily affected by the mixture of fresh mercury.
    14. To experiment on the current from this arrangement,
 the same apparatus was used with the addition of a glass
 tube of 7 millim. diameter, open at the ends and fixed upright
 in the glass jar, its lower end a few millim. above the resting
 mercury. The point of the funnel was placed in this tube
just under the surface of the water, and the dropping and
 resting mercury connected to the terminals of a reflecting-
 galvanometer. The deflexion was 57 divisions. Lowering
 the funnel through about 30 centim. increased this to 400
divisions.
    Decreasing the length of fall, therefore, increases instead
of decreasing the current, and the increase is due here to the
decreased resistance of the electrolyte, for when the narrow
tube was removed and the same experiment performed in a
wide vessel, the current did not sensibly vary, since the chief
resistance was then at the small surface of the drops as they
formed at the funnel-point.
   It was stated by Quincke* that "the strength of this
current decreases with increased resistance of the fluid,"
though the experiment on which he appears to base the
conclusion may be open to another interpretation.
   The hypothesis that the current is in any way produced by
the carrying down of charges on or in the falling drops is
negatived also by several of Konig's experiments, where the
dropping mercury did not fall into the resting mercury in
connexion with the electrometer but into another part of the
apparatus t.
   I find also that when the resting and dropping mercury are
connected through a galvanometer, the current remains the
same whether the drops fall into the resting mercury or not,
provided they are formed in the electrolyte.

    15. The " law " ascribed to Faraday, in § 5, would not, I
 think, have been recognized by that philosopher.
    The mere combination of free oxygen with the metal would
 not, according to Faraday's view, be an electrolytic action at
all, as might be shown by many quotations from his work,
e. g. " But in considering this oxidation or other direct action
upon the metal itself as the cause and source of the electric
current, it is of the utmost importance to observe that the
oxygen or other body must be in a peculiar condition, namely
in the state of combination ; and not only so but limited still
further to such a state of combination and in such proportions
as will constitute an electrolyte" *.
    An anion, according to Faraday t, is tho substance which
u goes to the anode of the decomposing body," and the anode
is the " negative extremity of the decomposing body ; " and he
expressly repudiates tho application of the terms electro
negative or electropositive to substances according as they are
 urged by the supposed influence of a direct attraction to tho
positive or negative pole.
   The supposition that individual atoms or molecules can
possess any specific electric charges of their own appears to me
to be of a very speculative character, but if oxygen have any
such charge it must surely be a negative one, since it travels
towards the positive pole of a voltameter.
    16. Referring now to § 6, the charging of the surfaces
does take place, according to the view I advocate, in an in
sensibly short time, and is due to a component of the electro
lyte present in large quantities ; but, as shown in § 10, it is not
immediately connected with tho attainment of a maximum
difference of potential at a certain speed of dropping ; this effect
being due not to a gradual charging but to a gradual tarnish
ing—a phenomenon experimentally demonstrable, and which
is not improbably also the cause of the action in Lippmann's
electrometer, referred to in § 7.
   In § 7 are given the phenomena on which depend the con
clusion expressed in § 8.
   I have translated § 8 in full as it contains the hypothesis on
which so much work has been carried out, but it is evident that
it has only the validity of the previous sections on which it is
based. Indeed Ostwald, who gives a long description of his
arduous work with these dropping electrodes, admits \ that
the question is not whether they assume exactly the same
potential as the liquid, but how much the difference is ; a

390         Mr. J. Brown on Helmholtz's Theory of
question which he attempts to answer by a comparison of the
indication of the dropping electrode with that of a capillary
electrometer, and the adoption of several hypotheses which
cannot be said to appeal directly to one's sense of exactness.
   17. In the paper referred to above by Exner and Tuma
these authors refer to the improbability of any considerable
current being produced by the mere carrying down of electric
 charges on the falling mercury drops ; and they adduce ex
 perimental evidence to show that such charges are not pro
 duced by any simple contact action between the mercury and
 electrolyte, as supposed by Ostwald, who seems to regard the
 arrangement as analogous to the water-dropping collector of
 Sir W. Thomson. The conditions, however, are quite different
 from those of Sir W. Thomson's collector, where the potential
 measured is that originally existing at the point where the
 drops form, and is usually independent of any action between
 the drops and the medium in which they form.
    18. Their paper then puts forward as the true theory of the
 observed current the explanation given in § 9, viz. that the
 arrangement is simply a galvanic cell : clean mercury—acid —
 oxidized mercury ; and it is further pointed out that the
 current carries by electrolytic convection hydrogen to the
 resting mercury whereby the latter is deoxidized.
    It would appear therefore that, leaving local action out of
 account, the oxidizing of the dropping, and deoxidizing of
 the resting, mercury go on simultaneously ; and as the oxide
 formed on the drops falls on the resting mercury, I presume
 we must conclude that the ultimate source of current in this
 cell is the gravity potential of the upper mercury, which is
 used up in producing the drops, and changes first into energy
 of surface tension and then into current.
    19. In conclusion, it is important to remark that the view
 here adopted implies that electrolytes, such as dilute acids,
 which attack mercury, are positive to clean mercury in contact
 with them ; for if not, and if the electrolyte is negative to the
 dropping mercury, it must (in order that the observed current
 may be produced) be still more negative to the resting
 mercury ; that is to say, the difference of electric potential
 is least where the conversion of chemical potential energy is
 greatest—a rather improbable assumption, and one not borne
 out by analogies with other voltaic combinations.
    If this be admitted, it follows that the results of all those
 recently made researches which are based on the assumption
 that mercury is positive to electrolytes, must be considered
 doubtful.

Some doubt must arise as to the correctness of the conclusions
arrived at in this paper, since the}' are found, as stated
towards the end of it, to agree with those obtained by dropping
electrodes.
   The hypothesis adopted in the main part of the paper may
be briefly referred to.
    From a mathematical discussion of the electrical forces
supposed, on more or less speculative grounds, to be present
in a double layer at contact of mercury and electrolyte, it is
concluded that at maximum tension of the surface between
mercury and another liquid no difference of potential exists
 between these substances.
    Quincke expressly states (p. 204) that the electromotive
force has no relation to the capillary constant at the common
surface of mercury and liquid.
   Exner and Tuma consider (p. 8) that maximum surface-
tension occurs simply when the mercury surface is clean, i. e.
free from oxide &c. If polarized with either 0 or H, the
surface-tension is diminished. No experimental evidence in
support of this view is given, but it seems a not improbable
assumption.
    It seems to me difficult to suppose that the surface of clean
mercury can by any means, so long as it remains clean, be
brought to the same potential as that of the surface of dilute
acid in contact with it. If we assume, as seems generally
admitted, that there is a natural contact electromotive force
 of an electrolytic kind at the dividing surface, this local
" Potentiahprung " would seem a necessary consequence, and
would, if the potentials of any other portions of the liquid and
             * Wiener Anzeiyer, No. 10, p. 2.'i2

not itself be annulled.
   It would only disappear when the surface of contact was so
chemically altered as to preclude or fail to produce any elec
trolytic action, in which case the new substance formed would
imply new conditions of surface-tension, and the hypothesis
that the alteration in surface-tension could be referred solely
to electrical forces on the double layer would be no longer
tenable.
   Most of these questions (depending, as they do, on a know
ledge of the real differences of potential between metals and
electrolytes, which has not yet been obtained) would have been
set at rest if one could accept undoubtingly the experimental
results contained in the last part of MM. Exner and Tuma'a
paper, which treats of the measurement of the contact-
difference of potential of metals and electrolytes.
   The potential of the electrolyte is tested by a mercury-
funnel dropping within a paper cylinder which is moistened
with the electrolyte in question, and in contact with the metal
which is put to earth.
   To get a correction for the zero of the instrument, the
funnel is afterwards made to drop inside a carbon or platinum
cylinder also to earth, which is assumed to give zero-potential
at the funnel-point. It does so only if it may be assumed
that there is no contact-difference between the platinum or
carbon and the air or water-film condensed on it; an assump
tion which, though probably nearly correct, is as yet unproved,
and which therefore detracts from the value of the results
obtained.
XLVII. The Strength of the. Induced Current with a Magneto-
   Telephone 'Transmitter as Influenced by the Strength of the
   Magnet. By Charles R. Cross and Arthur 8. Williams*.
IT is a well-known fact in practice, as well as an evident
       consequence of theoretical considerations, that the
effectiveness of a magneto-telephone, when used either as a
transmitter or as a receiver, varies with the strength of the
magnetism of the core. But the relation of the one to the
other has never been studied, so far as we are aware.

strength of the current produced by a magneto-transmitter
under varying conditions of magnetization, and of the mag
nitude of the momentary changes in the magnetic condition
of the core of the receiving-telephone when subjected to the
action of undulatory or other brief currents, as influenced by
the strength of the primitive permanent magnetization of the
core. The present paper contains only the results of a series
of experiments relating to the first of these ; that is, to the
effect of varying strength in the magnet of the transmitter,
the study of the allied problem of the receiver being still in
progress.
   The apparatus employed consisted of a cylindrical bar of
soft iron, about 4£ inches in length and \ of an inch in dia
meter, around one end of which was placed a coil of fine wire
similar to that used in ordinary telephonic practice. The
resistance of this coil was 100 ohms. It was placed in circuit
with a ballistic mirror -galvanometer, from whose deflexion
the momentary current produced in the coil by any variation
in the strength of the core could be determined. The dia
phragm, which was in all cases 2^ inches in diameter, was in
its usual place opposite the end of the magnet about which
the wire coil was wound, and about Tg0 of an inch from that
end. By means of a rod carrying a cam moved by a weight,
a rapid inward push of definite amount was given to the dia
phragm, thereby inducing a current in the coil already referred
to, and so deflecting the needle of the ballistic galvanometer.
The soft iron bar was also surrounded by a second helix,
through which was passed a current from a storage battery,
serving to magnetize the core. A tangent-galvanometer
inserted in this circuit gave the strength of the magnetizing
current. A magnetometer placed in the prolongation of the
axis of the core, which last occupied an east and west position,
made known the relative strengths of the field produced by
the core under different conditions of magnetization.
   Corresponding observations of the magnetometer-reading,
and of the current induced when the diaphragm was moved
by the cam, were made throughout a widely varying range of
strength of field, and the results were represented graphically
by constructing a series of curves in which ordinates represent
the relative strength of field, and abscissa? the current due to
a given predetermined throw of the diaphragm (about -j-J^y of
an inch), as ascertained from the readings of the ballistic
galvanometer.
   One of these curves is shown at 1, fig. 1, the core in this
case being a cylindrical bar of Norway iron 4^ inches long

 396      Messrs. Cross and Williams on the Strength of the
    An examination of fig. 1, as well as of the various curves
 following it, will show that the effect of increasing the
 strength of the magnet of the transmitter is in all cases to
 cause at first a rather rapid increase in the strength of the
 induced current, which later increases less rapidly, rising
 soon to a maximum value, from which it falls off, at first
 rapidly, and afterwards more and more slowly as the strength
 of the field is further increased. We proceed to consider tbe
 explanation of these results.
    It is evident that three distinct sources of variation exist to
 affect the current furnished by a magneto-transmitter as the
 strength of the magnet is increased. First, the direct effect
                                Fig. 2.
                                 Iron.
                        '22
                             Induced Current.
of the increased strength of field in which tho diaphragm
moves is to increase proportionally tho strength of the induced
current, since it increases correspondingly the rate of change
in tho number of lines of force enclosed by the coil of the
instrument; second, an approach towards saturation of the

        Current with a Magneto-Telephone Transmitter.      397
magnet, so far as it alone is concerned, will tend to diminish
the induced current, on account of the smaller variation in
the strength of the pole due to a given motion of the dia
phragm ; and, third, the nearer approach toward saturation
of the diaphragm will have the same tendency.
   The rapid rise in the induced current at the beginning is of
course due to the predominating influence of the increasing
strength of the field in which the diaphragm moves, as both
core and diaphragm are then but slightly magnetized. The
subsequent changes in the current must be explained by a
consideration of the increasing magnetization of either the
 core or the diaphragm, or both.
    It will be seen by comparing Tables I., II., and III., that
the value of the maximum induced current for a given ex
cursion of the diaphragm is approximately the same with all
the three cores used, and that the same is true as to the
strength of field corresponding to this maximum current.
Moreover, saturation curves constructed for the several cores
showed that in all cases the magnet was still very far removed
even from half-saturation when the maximum induced current
was obtained. From these facts it appears that the degree of
saturation of the magnet is practically unimportant, so far as
 the general results shown in fig. 1 are concerned.
    It remains to observe the part played by the increasing
 magnetization of the diaphragm. Other things remaining the
 same, as this approaches more and more closely towards satu
 ration the increase in the number of lines of force passing
 between it and the magnet on the approach of the diaphragm
to the magnet must become smaller and smaller; and this
 change will tend to oppose the effect of the increased abso
 lute strength of the magnetizing force. The small mass of
the diaphragm will evidently cause it to show the effect of an
 approach to saturation while the core is far below that con
 dition. And such an action will clearly explain the observed
 changes in the current strength.
    In order to test this matter still further, the experiment
 was tried of varying the mass and material of the diaphragm.
    The results are shown by the curves in figs. 1, 2, and 3,
 which are constructed from the data given in Tables 1. to X. ;
 further results of the same character are given in Tables XI.
 and XII.

402 Effectiveness of a Magneto-Telephone as a Transmitter.
   Curve 2, fig. 1, represents the results when two of the
ordinary ferrotype diaphragms were superposed, forming a
diaphragm of double thickness, and curve 3 of the same
figure shows the results when three such diaphragms were
superposed. Each diaphragm was 001 of an inch thick.
The curves of fig. 2, marked 21, 22, 23, respectively, show
the results of similar experiments with diaphragms of sheet
iron whose thickness was 0-030, 0"027, 0'024 of an inch,
respectively (Nos. 21, 22, 23, B.W.G.). Fig. 3 shows the
results when a steel diaphragm 0-017 of an inch thick (No. 2G)
was used, the curve v being that for untempered steel, and
r that for tempered steel. Steel diaphragms respectively
0-026 and 0"012 of an inch thick (Nos. 22 and 30) gave
similar results, as will bo seen from Tables XI., XII., and
XIII.
   An inspection of these curves shows immediately that the
greater the strength of the field required to saturate the dia
phragm, the greater is the strength of the field at which the
maximum current occurs. Thus in fig. 1 the maximum cur
rent with curve 1 corresponds to a strength of field of about
12 units of the scale used, while with curves 2 and 3 the
corresponding strengths of field are 20 and 43 units respect
ively. Also in fig. 2 the maximum currents will be seen to
correspond to greater strengths of field in proportion to the
thickness of the diaphragm ; and in fig. 3 similar though less
marked results hold for tempered as compared with untem
pered steel of the same thickness.
   It would also be expected that the value of the maximum
current would be greater with a thick than with a thin dia
phragm. This was usually the case in our experiments.
Thus the curves 1, 2, 3 of fig. 1 give maximum currents of
 27-5, 50-2, and (32-G units respectively. Kesults of a similar
nature are shown by fig. 3, the maximum current with the
untempered diaphragm being far greater than with the tem
pered one. Curve No. 23 of fig. 2 is apparently an exception.
 It is probable, however, that this is in appearance only, and
 that the three curves of that figure are not strictly comparable
with one another. The rigidity of the diaphragms here used,
especially of the thicker ones, is considerable ; and any slight
yielding of the supports of the rod which carried the cam
 would prevent the actual throw of the diaphragm from being
as great when this had considerable thickness, and would
 greatly diminish the strength of the current produced.
    The peculiarity of curve 2, as compared with 1 and 3, is
 probably caused by the want of both magnetic and mechanical
 continuity in the material of the multiple plate formed by the
 several diaphragms used.

      On Diamagnelism and the Concentration of Energy.        403
   In those cases where steel diaphragms were employed,
there was always a notable induced current, even when the
reading of the magnetometer was zero. This was probably
due to a slight residual magnetization of the diaphragms.
   The results stated in this paper may serve to explain a
phenomenon which has seemed somewhat obscure. Frequent
attempts have been made to increase the efficiency of a
magneto-transmitter by polarizing the diaphragm as well as
the magnet ; a common way of doing this being to employ a
horseshoe-magnet, one leg of which is in contact with the
edge of the diaphragm, while the other, about which the coil
is wound, is placed in its usual position opposite the centre.
But as a general rule little or no gain has seemed to result
therefrom, so far as can be judged by the performance of
such instruments in actual practice. It is quite probable in
this case that the increased approach to saturation of the
diaphragm may have so great an effect as entirely to prevent
the expected improvement.
    It will also be seen from our results that an increase in the
 thickness of the diaphragm of a magneto-transmitter tends to
allow of the use of a stronger magnet, and for a given ampli
tude of vibration to produce a stronger current. But it must
 bo remembered, on the other hand, that the greater rigidity
of the thick diaphragm will diminish this range of vibration
 under the action of the voice, a difficulty which may to a
 certain extent be remedied by using a diaphragm of large
 diameter.
 XLVIII. On Diamagnetism and the Concentration of Energy.
    By J. Parker, B.A., late Scholar of St. John's College,
    Cambridge* .
 MANY of the discoveries which have been made in
          Physical science in recent times may be classed under
 two great heads—the principle of the Conservation of Energy
 and Carnot's principle. These principles are closely related ;
 the former being mainly an experimental conclusion, the latter
 a deduction from the first by means of Carnot's axiom. It
 follows, therefore, that whenever the principle of Energy ceases
 to hold, Carnot's principle will fail at the same time, but that
 the failure of Carnot's principle does not necessarily invalidate
 the principle of Energy.
    Carnot's principle only holds when the material system which
 we are considering is restricted to receiving or losing energy
 from other systems in the forms of heat and mechanical work ;
                   * Communicated by the Author.

404    On Diamagnetism and the Concentration of Energy.
but the passage of heat may take place either by conduction
or radiation. The simplest case is obtained by supposing that
there are only two external bodies with which the system can
exchange heat. It was then assumed by Carnot that, in
a complete cycle, it will be impossible, without an expenditure
of mechanical work, to transfer heat by means of the system
from the colder of the two bodies to the hotter. Mechanical
work can therefore only be obtained from the system, during
a complete cycle of operations, when it absorbs neat from the
hotter of the two bodies and gives out heat to the colder.
Consequently, if the energy of a material system consist
entirely of heat of uniform temperature, it will be impossible
to transform any of it into work.
   Now it is found that all kinds of energy tend to pass into
heat, and the passage of heat from a hot body to a colder
(without the production of work) is an everyday occurrence.
It has therefore been predicted with confidence that our uni
verse is approaching a state in which the whole of its energy
will be in the form of heat of uniform temperature, and all
kinds of mechanical action impossible.
   The following consideration, however, appears to offer a
serious difficulty to the universal application of Carnot's
principle. Thus, let A be a piece of permanently magnetized
hard steel ; and let B be a piece of a soft diamagnetic sub
stance, as bismuth, which, when brought within the influence
of A, becomes magnetized by induction and is repelled by A.
Then suppose that the following cycles of operations are per
formed at constant temperature:—
   (a) Let B be removed from a position P, remote from A,
to a second position Q, near A, so slowly that at every instant
the magnetization of B has its maximum value ; and let the
work expended be called W. Then let B return slowly to its
original position P by the former path reversed. The work W,
which had been expended, will be recovered ; so that, on the
whole, there will be neither gain nor loss of mechanical
work.
   (b) Let B be removed from P to Q so rapidly that the
magnetization of B has not time to alter sensibly. The work
done on B will be less than W. After allowing B to remain
long enough in the position Q to attain its permanent mag
netic state, let it return rapidly from Q to P by the first path
reversed. The work restored by B will be greater than W.
There is therefore a gain of work in this cycle performed at
constant temperature, contrary to Carnot's principle.
   There are three ways of looking at this difficulty : —
   (1) We may suppose that the work which has been obtained

      Prohable Cause of the Displacement of Shore-lines.          405
has been created from nothing. This would involve a con
tradiction both of the principle of Energy and of Carnot's
principle, and is the view generally held at present.
    (2) The development of magnetism in diamagnetic bodies
may be instantaneous, unlike all other physical phenomena,
which require time.
   (3) The work which has been gained may have been pro
duced from heat ; so that the principle of Energy stands,
while Carnot's principle falls. Employing this work to
transfer heat from a cold body to a hotter, we have a means
of producing inequalities of temperature— that is, a Concen
tration of Energy—without external assistance. Carnot's
principle wrill then require to be modified.
   It has been shown by Clausius that for any cycle which
satisfies Carnot's principle in its usual form, we have 1 ^=0
if the cycle be reversible, and If —        Q < 0 in other cases, Q
being the heat absorbed when the absolute temperature is t.
It seems probable that these results may be true for soft para
magnetic bodies, but that for diamagnetic bodies we should
have J ~^ = 0 f°r a reversible cycle, and J*^ >0 m other
cases. We might then obtain expressions for the energy and
entropy of a magnetized system, and a thermodynamical
theory could be formed for Magnetism as easily as for
Electricity.
XLIX. On the probable Cause of the Displacement of Shore
   lines, an Attempt at a Geological Chronology. By A.
   Blytt*.
THIS memoir is an attempt to further develop and establish
       ideas which I put forward five years ago. It contains an
attempt to establish a chronology in geology. It sets forth
what the English call " a working hypothesis," without claim
ing to be anything else. It was the distribution of plants
 which first introduced the author to this great question ; but
the problem of a chronology in geology cannot be solved
without the co-operation, it may perhaps be said, of all
naturalists. It certainly cannot finally be solved by any
one man. In putting forth my hypothesis I must in the

406              A. Blytt on theprobaMe Cause of
first place beg for indulgence for the many faults and im
perfections with which such an attempt must be affected, and
express a hope that in any case the hypothesis may be found
worthy of being further tested.
    Having endeavoured in several memoirs on the distribution
of plants, on peat-mosses, shore-lines, terraces, and morainic
ridges, to show that climates undergo periodical changes, I
published in the Transactions of tho Society of Sciences for
1883 (No. 9) a memoir on Alternation of Strata and its
possible significance for the chronology of geology and the
theory of the modification of species. The essential contents
of this paper, as regards the present question of geological
chronology, were as follows : —
    Alternation of strata, under which term is understood an
alternation of geological formations of different constitution,
can be produced by local conditions of rapidly passing
change, without the action of general and persistent causes.
But there are also causes of the latter kind which effect
an alternation of the strata. Two such periodically acting
causes are traceable in the geological series of deposits—a
shorter, somewhat regular one, and a longer, more irregular
one. The former effects a change of climate, the strength of
the marine currents alternately diminishing and increasing
during thousands of years ; the latter, longer period effects
a rise or fall of the sea in relation to the land, and an alterna
tion of deep-sea formations with shore-formations or fresh
water deposits. The opinion has been expressed that these
periods, which are traced in the series of deposits, might
possibly stand in connexion with the two cosmical periods
revealed by Astronomy—the precession of the equinoxial
points, and variations in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit ;
although in the memoir referred to it is not attempted to
 show in what manner such a connexion could be established.
 But if, with the aid of these two hypotheses, we construct an
 " artificial " series of strata, we find that one with no less
 than 46 changes of deposit may be recognized, bed by bed,
in the Tertiary formations of the Paris basin.
    This result may encourage us to test still further the cor
rectness of the two suppositions. As regards the precession
this has been attempted in my paper " On the probable Cause
of the Periodical Change in the Strongth of the Marino
Currents." •

                the Displacement of Shore-lines.            407
   The contents of this memoir are essentially as follows :—
The precession of the equinoxial lines causes the summers in
about 10,500 years to be longer, and in the following 10,500
years shorter, than the winters. The conditions are opposite
in the northern and southern hemispheres. The difference
between the number of winter and summer days increases with
the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.
   The cooling of continents under high latitudes in the winter
produces a diminished pressure of air over the sea. This low
pressure draws air from lower latitudes. For this reason, in
the Atlantic south-west winds prevail. Thus, in the winter,
the south-west winds of the North Atlantic are on an average
three times as strong as in the summer, in consequence of
the great refrigeration of the mainland. In the semi-period
when the winter falls in aphelion the average annual wind-
force is consequently greater. Now it is the prevalent wind
that produces the powerful marine currents, such as the
warm current in the Atlantic Ocoan. The strength of the
marine currents is dependent upon the average wind-force for
the last great time-period. Now, as this average wind-forco
is periodically variable in consequence of the precessions, the
strength of marine currents and tho temperature of the sea
must also be subject to a periodical variability. For about
 10,500 years the warm sea-current will increase, to diminish
in the next similar period, and so on constantly through all
time. When the winter falls in aphelion, the difference
between the littoral and inland climates will increase. Tho
 propelling force of currents in the sea will increase and
 diminish by 1-5 per cent, upon their total annual value
according as the winter falls in aphelion or perihelion, and
according as the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is small or
great.
   Such an alteration in the strength of the marine currents
will produce an alteration of the climate, which, however, will
not be very important, but which will nevertheless be great
enough to leave its traces in the deposits. During colder and
drier seasons the streams are fed in great part by spring
water. This water has drained slowly through the beds and is
charged with dissolved materials ; but the small quantity of
water and the feebler stream carries less clay, sand, and
 gravel. During rainy seasons the rain carries down quantities
 of such materials, but it flows off rapidly, and, as it for tho
 most part runs only over the surface, it has not time to
dissolve so much. Although the springs flow more abundantly
during rainy seasons, their water only mingles with tho rain
 water. The streams are therefore poorer in dissolved material,

408                A. Blytt on theprobable Cause of
but they contain more water, and their more powerful current
carries more clay, sand, and gravel into the basin. Hence
the drier seasons will be richer in purely chemical deposits,
which will be transported in the clearer water ; the wet
seasons in mechanical deposits. Strata of both kinds are
formed, of course, at all times, but they are deposited at
different places in accordance with the variation in the
quantity of rain. Thus, I assume that when thick deposits
of river-sand and clay alternate with each other, when soft
clay and marl alternate with hard marl or limestone, when
thick strata of loose sand alternate with sandstone, which is
bound together by chemically produced cement (iron, silica,
lime), when clay alternates with Septaria-beds &c, then, in
each case, the first-named deposit shows itself to belong to
seasons with a warmer sea and a greater quantity of rain,
which, as regards Western Europe, will mean seasons with
the winter in aphelion.
    That this alternation of deposits implies a period of several
thousand years' duration is shown by the fact that the fossils
change rapidly through the strata. In the Tertiary forma
tions there are only a few, often only 4-5, such changes of
deposits in each stage. The whole Oligocene period has only
about 30, the Miocene still fewer, and the Pliocene barely 20
such changes.
    In this way, in my opinion, the precessions stamp them
selves upon the strata, and this should therefore furnish a
means of measuring time. The greater the eccentricity of the
orbit, the more strongly marked will the periods be ; when
the orbit approaches the circular form, they are less
 recognizable*.
    Referring for other things to the two memoirs cited and to
my paper "On Variations of the Weather in the course ofTime"
 (Letterstedtske Nordish Tidskri/t, 1885, in English in Forh.
  Vid. Selsk. i Christiania, 188t>, No. 8) I will pass on to
 examine whether there is any probable ground for supposing
 that the other proposition is also correct, whether it is con-
    • But the perihelion also shifts to and fro. The time between two
 aphelia in the winter solstice varied thus in postglacial times by fully
 4600 years. This must have some influence. The longer a period with
 winters in aphelion lasts the longer will the warm currents in the Atlantic
 increase in strength, and the greater will be the changes of climate. The
 mild period during which Bergenian sea-animals lived in the Christiunia
 Ijord, and which has left its traces elsewhere in our hemisphere, was, in
 my opinion, a consequence of such an unusually long period with the
 winter in aphelion. The winter solstice fell in aphelion (according to
 Croll) 61,300, 33,300, and 11,700 years ago. The middle of the Atlantic
 period with Bergenian sea-animals in the Christiania Fjord fell, from the
 testimony of the peat-mosses, 33-34,000 years ago, therefore in accordance
with the period of 28,000 years.

                the Displacement of Shore-lines.             409
ceivable that under high latitudes the sea-level rises and sinks
with the eccentricity of* the earth's orbit.
   Great part of the earth's surface consists of strata which
still lie undisturbed in their original horizontal position.
These parts are called " tables " by Suess. But in many
places the crust of the earth is so traversed by clefts and
fissures that it may be compared to a breccia. Fragments
are often displaced relatively by thousands of feet. Strata
which originally lay horizontally arc folded, thicknesses of
7000-8000 feet are bent as if they were straws (Kjerulf,
 Udsifft over Norges Geologi, 1879, p. 76). Moreover, the
folded strata are upheaved far above tbeir original level.
Even marine formations so recent as the Eocene are uplifted
to heights of 21,000 feet above the sea (Suess, Antlitz tier
Erde, l. p. 564). Sometimes they stand vertically, or are in
verted, so that older strata cover the younger ones. Through
fissures eruptive masses are brought forth, and have covered
thousands upon thousands of square kilometres. The dis
tribution of land and sea also varies. It is indeed supposed
that the great depths of the ocean and the groat continents
have essentially retained their original distribution from the
most ancient times, but the shore-lines wander periodically to
and fro ; and these changes of the earth's surface have taken
place from earliest times, and are still in action at the present
day.
   Geologists in general seek the explanation of these phe
nomena in the cooling and contraction of the body of the
earth. The earth's crust folds, just as the skin of an apple
wrinkles as the apple dries. The leading geologists of the
present day adopt this theory, and A. Geikie in his ' Text-book
of Geology' (London, 1882, p. 287) says with perfect justice:—
" With modifications, the main cause of terrestrial move
ments is still sought in secular contraction."
   According to this doctrine changes in the crust of the
earth are due to the interior contracting more strongly than
" the crust," so that the latter is too large for it. Its weight
drags it down. By this means great horizontally acting
pressure is produced in the crust, which must then become
folded and cracked in places. The fragments sink down.
By this means are formed what Suess has called " Einbruche."
When a part of the crust remains in position while all around
it sinks, there is produced what Suess has called a " Horst."
The old theory of forces acting vertically from below is most
decidedly rejected by Suess. He and Heim have shown, by
their investigations of the Alps, that the foldings of the Alps

410             A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
aro caused by lateral pressure, and that such lateral pressure is
sufficient to lift great chains of mountains into the air. -But
Suess goes still further, for in a memoir, " Ueber die vermeint-
lichen siicularen Schwankungen einzelner Theile der Erdober-
flache" (in Verh. K. K. Geol. Reichs. 1880, pp. 171 et seqq.)
he even denies any elevation by forces acting vertically from
below—neither mountain nor continent is elevated in this
manner. He says (/. c. p. 180) :—" There are no vertical
movements of the solid ground, with the exception of those
-which proceed directly from the formation of folds. We
shall have to resolve to abandon the doctrine of the secular
oscillations of continents."
   A. de Lapparent, who sharply criticises Suess's theory of
"Horste" (Bull. Soc. Geol. France, ser. 3, tome xv. pp. 215
et seqq.), nevertheless agrees with him that the cooling of the
earth has formed great folds in the crust, and denies that any
elevations are not caused by foldings. Thus he says (/. c.
p. 21 7) :—" It is no longer necessary to oppose to the doctrine
of absolute elevations produced by forces acting directly from
below upwards, a protestation which has lost its object. For
the partizans of vertical impulsions aro nowadays more than
scattered, and with the exception of a very few belated
persons no one would now venture to ascribe to such an
action an important part in the formation of mountains."
As he makes no limitation, it must be assumed that he will
not recognize any forces acting from below to elevate whole
land-masses.
   According to a statement of Suess's, in his Antlitz der Erde
 (1885, Bd. i. p. 741), he seems to find an essential reason
for denying elevation by forces acting perpendicularly from
below in that we aro quite ignorant of any force which could
be capable of causing such an elevation.
    The theories of Hutton and von Buch as to the action of
 such forces seem therefore to be rejected by geologists of the
 present day. Nevertheless there are still a few who hold
 similar opinions. Thus J. C. Bussel (U.S. Geol. Surv. 4th
 Ann. Beport, Washington, 1884, pp. 452, 453) says that the
 fractures in " the Great Basin " are not in consequence of
any lateral pressure, but are caused by an extension in a
horizontal direction :—" The fractures are closely related to
 an extension of the strata caused by upheaval." It seems to
me improbable that such a relation should be explicable by a
folding. C. E. Dutton also (U.S. Geol. Surv. (3th A*nn.
Beport, 1885, p. 198), at the same time that he recognizes that
many chains are folded by lateral pressure, says, with regard
to the mountain-masses in Western North America :—" The

                   the Displacement of Shore-lines.                   411
mountains of the West have not been produced by horizontal
compression, but by some unknown forces beneath which
have pushed them up"*.
    It is not my intention to maintain that refrigeration has
not at all contributed to give the surface of the earth the form
which it now possesses. But I think that an auxiliary theory
is required, which, while it will not entirely supersede the old
theory, may yet serve to explain things which the old theory
cannot render comprehensible.
    Henry H. Howorth has written two memoirs, namely,
" Recent Elevations of the Earth's Surface in the Northern
Circumpolar Regions" (Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc. vol. xliii.
1873, p. 240) and " Recent Changes in the Southern Circum-
fiolar Regions" (op. cit. vol. xliv. 1874, p. 252), in which ho
 las brought together what was at that time known as to the
displacement of shore-lines in the last section of geological
time, and the principnl residt of his investigations is summed
up in the following words :—" The South Polo, as well as tho
North, is a focus of protrusion, the land around it is being
gradually elevated." In the last section of geological time,
i. e. in the Postglacial period, the land has, in general, sunk
under lower and risen under higher latitudes.
    Suess arrives at a similar result in his above-cited memoir
(Verk. K. K. Geol. Reiclis. 1880, pp. 174-175). He has
likewise studied tho displacement of coast-lines over the whole
earth during the period nearest to the present time, and sums
up the result as follows :—" Terraced land [i. e. land which
has recently risen in relation to the sea] appears ererywhei-e
in the high northern latitudes, so far as man has hitherto
penetrated into these solitudes. It also extends far, although
not everywhere equally far, down into the temperate latitudes,
 but generally decreasing in height. In other words, around tho
North Pole and far down the sum of the negative [t. e. descend
ing] movements of the coast-lines is greater than the positive ;
towards the south, however, these two sums approximate more
and more. In tropical seas, in the regions of the coral forma-
   • The current doctrines with regard to refrigeration and compression
are discussed by Peirce in a discourse before the American Academy on
the 11th Muv, 186!) (see Proc. Anier. Acad. Arts nnd Sci. vol. viii. 1873,
p. 106), as also by O. Fisher (Physics of the Earth's Crust, 1881) nnd
Button (" A criticism upon the Contractional Hypothesis," in Amer.
Journ. Sci. ser. 3, vol. viii. 1874, pp. 113 et seqq.). They all consider
that contraction is not sufficient to explain the known phenomena; nay,
the last-named even thinks that the phenomena are opposed to this.
A. de Lapparent, on the other hand, in his memoir " Contraction et
refroidissement du globe " (Bull. Soc. Qiol. France, ser. 3, vol. xv. 1887,
pp. 383 et seqq.) seeks to prove that they are quite sufficient.

412              A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
tions, the opposite condition occurs, the sum of the positive
movements preponderates. Further towards the south, beyond
25°-35° south Latitude, the terraced land of the north begins
again in South America, South Africa, South Australia, and
New Zealand, i. e. the same preponderance of the negative
movements, with the same oscillating* character as in the
north." The exceptions (according to Suess) are few and of
little importance.
   Howorth and Suess have therefore both come to the same
result. But their explanations are directly opposite. Howorth
thinks that it is the land which has risen under higher lati
tudes; that the earth, as it were, swells up towards the poles
and contracts under the tropics. Suess, who will not admit
any other elevations than those which are the consequences
of foldings, is of opinion that it is the sea which has flowed
towards the lower latitudes. He indicates as a possible ex
planation changes in the length of the day and the centrifugal
force. But this change should then only have acted upon
the sea, and therefore, since the sea has flowed towards the
equator, the day should have been considerably shorter in the
last geological period. We shall see hereafter that there is no
known cause which could have produced such a shortening of
the Sidereal day as would serve to explain what Suess wants to
explain. The old theory of refrigeration is scarcely fitted
to explain these conditions indicated by Howorth and Suess.
Even Suess, who is a zealous adherent of the theory of con
traction, is obliged here to seek for another explanation.
   Another theory, however, has come forth in our day, a
theory which, no doubt, is destined to play a great part in
geology. It is derived originally from the celebrated
philosopher J. Kant. In 1754 he wrote a memoir entitled
" Untersuchung der Frage : ob die Erde eine Veranderung
ihrer Achsendrehung erlitten habe?" In this it is shown
that, by reason of the attraction of the moon and sun, the sea
is constantly in a movement opposite to the daily revolution of
the earth. The friction of the tidal waves against the bottom
and coasts of the sea diminishes the force of the axiiil
revolution and works constantly in the same direction, so
that the sidereal days must for this reason always become
longer and longer. The moon always turns the same side
   * With this word Suess alludes to the circumstance that the coast
lines and terraces occur at various levels one above the other. He
thinks that each of these levels indicates an oscillation of the sea. I
believe that the greater part of these levels are merely a consequence of
climatic changes due to the precessions. (See Fvrh. Vid. SeUk. ChrUt.
1881, No. 4.)

                   the Displacement of Shore-lines.                  413
towards the earth because the earth's tidal action on the mass
of the moon while still fluid constantly rendered the axial
revolution of the moon slower, until at last the moon was
compelled to turn always the same side towards the earth*.
In this way also, at some far distant period, the earth will
come to turn the same side always to the moon. This opinion
of Kant's has been recognized as correct by the first physicists
of the present day, by men such as Robert Mayer, Helmholtz,
and W. Thomson.
   There are certain peculiarities in the moon's movements
which astronomers are inclined to explain by the assumption
that the sidereal day gradually increases by reason of the
friction of the tidal wave. But with regard to this we will
merely refer the reader to Thomson and Tait's ' Treatise on
Natural Philosophy,' and to a memoir by the first-named
author, " On Geological Time " (Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow,
vol. iii. 1868, pp. 1 et se<j<].).
   In their ' Natural Philosophy,' Thomson and Tait treat
the problem of the earth's axial rotation. They state that
there are various forces which may be efficient in altering it—
some make the sidereal day shorter, others make it longer.
The latter are preponderant, and among them, again, the tidal
wave plays the greatest part; so that for this reason in the
course of time the sidereal day becomes always longer and
longer. Refrigeration is the most powerful force which con
tributes towards the shortening of the sidereal day, but its
action is calculated by Thomson (Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow,
I. c. p. 28) at only ^^oo of the tidal wave ; and this last
action cannot be annulled by any of the other forces, which
act sometimes in one, sometimes in another direction (trans
port of material from higher to lower latitudes, or vice versa,
accumulation of ice at the poles, &c), and which in course of
 time cease to act, the tidal wave acting always, for millions of
years, in the same direction (Thomson, "Geological Dynamics,"
 Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow, vol. iii. part 2, 1869, p. 223).
    In this way, therefore, the sidereal day must in course of
time always become longer and longer. Now, what influence
 has this upon the earth ? If this were fluid throughout, it is
 clear that it must at once change its form. According
as the sidereal day became longer and the centrifugal force
 diminished, its compression must have decreased. But the
 old theory of a fiery fluid interior is now rejected by physicists,
   * la it possible that the great abundance of old volcanoes in the moon
 may be explained by the great change which its axial rotation, and there
fore probably also its compression, has undergone ?—A. B.

414               A. Blytt on tfie probable Cause of
and Thomson assumes that the earth is on the whole a solid
body. Now will this solid body retain its form without refer
ence to the length of the sidereal day, or will it yield and
accommodate itself? The sea, as a matter of course, will at
once yield, and, as the centrifugal force decreases, it will sink
under lower and rise under higher latitudes. We know that
the earth's present form agrees, at all events in some degree,
with the length of the sidereal day. It has at present a com
pression which about agrees with that which it should have
from calculation, with its present axial rotation. As it may
now be rendered probable that the earth, since it acquired a
solid surface, has lost so much of its axial rotation that the
sidereal day has become several times longer, the circumstance
that the compression suits that agreeing with the axial rota
tion seems to show that the solid earth has really changed its
form. Jupiter and Saturn have a sidereal day respectively
of 9 h. 55 m. and 10 h. 15 m., and a compression of -j^ and
 jJjj. In Mars, the sidereal day of which is about 24 h. 37 m.,
observations have not been able to prove definitely any com
pression. There would seem, therefore, to be a connexion
between compression and axial rotation. But it may indeed
be objected that Jupiter and Saturn are still possibly melted
masses.
     W. Thomson and Tait seem to be of opinion that the
earth will not change its form. They assume that it must
have become solid not so many millions of years since, seeing
that the compression nearly coincides with the axial rotation.
     J. Croll (' Climate and Time,' 1875, p. 335 ; see also Amer.
Journ. Sci. ser. 3, vol. xii. 1876, p. 457) thinks that the
sidereal day lengthens so slowly that denudation will have
time to adjust the form of the earth so as to coincide with the
length of the sidereal dav. Just as the sea sinks under low
latitudes, the continents in the same latitudes will also become
lower by denudation, but under higher latitudes the rising
 sea will protect the land instead of denuding it ; and in this
 way the earth must then, by denudation alone, acquire a form
always suitable to its axial rotation. But this is evidently
 erroneous. Imagine the earth formed of ellipsoidal layers
with increasing solidity inwards. When the centrifugal force
 diminished, equilibrium would be disturbed throughout the
 whole mass, and in the interior tension would constantly
increase. Nay, not even at the surface can denudation alter
the compression. For we know from the recent investiga
 tions of the deep sea, that in this deep sea, far from the con
 tinents, no products of weathering are present : only volcanic
 ashes and cosmical dust are deposited. Thus denudation is

                   the Displacement of Shore-lines.                    415
not even capable of obliterating the inequalities of the surface,
still less the internal tension produced by the lengthening of
the sidereal day. And as the day has become considerably
longer, the sea ought to be collected towards the poles and
the land under the equator, in case the solid earth had not
changed its form.
    Others think that the earth may actually change its form.
The first who expressed this opinion, so far as I can find, is
Herbert Spencer. In the Philosophical Magazine (1847, vol.
 xxx. p. 194) he published a small memoir, entitled " The Form
 of the Earth no proof of original Fluidity," in which he main
 tains that even tho solid earth may change its form, according
 as the centrifugal force changes. When a body increases in
 size, the power of resistance to external forces increases only
 as the square of the dimensions, while the wasting and de
 structive forces (weight, centrifugal force) increase in the
 same proportion as the mass of the body, and therefore as the
 cube of tho dimensions. As the size increases we therefore
 come to a point at which even the most solid body must yield
 to the forces. We must therefore assume, says Spencer, that
 the earth, by reason of its size, must yield and change its
 form, in case the centrifugal force, for example, changes ; for
 the most solid matter known to us, exposed to the same
 forces which act upon the earth, would overstep tho bounds of
 solidity before attaining a thousand-millionth part of the
 earth's size. This argument, in Prof. Schi0tz's opinion, is not
 tenable. At any rate, I believe that Spencer is the first who
 expressed the opinion that even a solid earth can change its
 form. In the above-cited discourse of 18G9, Peirce says that
 the lengthening of the sidereal day may be supposed to have
 altered the form of the solid earth. And Principal Dawson,
 in his 'Story of the Earth and Man' (ed. 9, 1887, p. 291),
  says that this alteration of form by reason of the lengthening
  of the sidereal day must have taken place at longer or
  shorter intervals. So long as the crust of tho earth did not
 yield, the sea will have flowed towards the poles ; but when
  the tension becomes so great that the solid crust bursts, the
 equatorial regions will sink in and tho sea will flow again
  towards the equator*.
    * Similar opinions are expressed by Dr. E. Iieyer ("Die Bewegnng im
 Festen," in Jahrb. K. K. Geo!. Xeichs. Wien, vol. xxx. 1880, pp. oi:i et
 sei/q.). W. li. Taylor, in a memoir " On the Crumpling' of the Earth's
 Crust" (Amer. Journ. Sci. ser. 3, vol. xxx. li-8o, pp. 249 et seqq.), ex
 presses himself against the theory of the earth's contraction, and thinks
 that the lengthening of the sidereal day is the cause of the changes in the
 crust. A. Winchell, in a memoir on the " Sources of Trend and Crustal
 Surplusage" (Amer. Journ. /. c. p. 417), endeavours to show that the

416                A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
   In the Philosophical Transactions for 1879, Parts I. & II.,
Prof. G. Darwin has published a memoir the results of which
are briefly as follows. He assumes that the earth possesses a
small degree of plasticity, and calculates the internal friction
which the tidal action of the moon and sun produce in such a
body. He finds that both the sidereal day and the month
have become much longer, that the distance of the moon has
increased, that the obliquity of the ecliptic has diminished,
and that a great part of the internal heat is developed by the
internal friction. 46,300,000 years ago, according to his
calculation, the sidereal day was 15 h. 30 m., and the moon's
distance 46-8 terrestrial radii (against 60-4 at present). But
56,180,000 years ago the sidereal day was only 6 h. 45 m.
long, the moon's distance only 9 terrestrial radii, and the
month only 1*58 day            of its present amount) . The interior
heat produced by friction in 57,000,000 years, if applied at
once, would suffice to heat the whole earth 1 700° Fahr.* He
concludes that the compression has constantly diminished :—
" the polar regions must have been ever rising, and the equato
rial ones falling, though as the ocean followed these changes
they might quite well have left no geological traces f. The
tides must have been very much more frequent and larger,
and accordingly the rate of oceanic denudation much acce
lerated. The more rapid alternation of day and night
[57,000,000 years ago, according to Darwin, the year had
1300 days] would probably lead to more sudden and violent
storms ; and the increased rotation of the earth would aug
ment the violence of the trade-winds, which, in their turn,
would affect oceanic currents!.
   Tresca (Comptes Rendus, 1864, p. 754; 1867, p. 802, &c.)
diminishing centrifugal force has produced foldings in a north and south
direction. J. £. Todd, in a paper entitled " Geological Effects of a vary
ing Rotation of the Earth (Amer. Naturalist, vol. xvii. 1883, pp. 15 et
seqq.), first enumerates the various forces which may act in accelerating
and retarding the axial rotation. He assumes that the axial rotation
decreases and increases abruptly, that it acts first upon the sea and after
wards upon the solid crust, and that for this reason the sea rises and
sinks abruptly in relation to the land.
   * This neat, produced by the internal friction, must contribute con
siderably to diminish the secular refrigeration. Lapparent has not taken
account of this in the above-cited memoir on the contraction and cooling
of the earth.
   t In a subsequent article, however, Darwin supposes that the coast
lines will shift in consequence of the lengthening of the sidereal dav
('Nature,' Sept. 2, 1886, p. 422).
   J The numerical values given above make no claim to represent the
actual values ; they are merely the maximum values, which, according
to Darwin, are generally possible.

                  the Displacement of Shore-lines.             417
 has shown that ice, lead, and also east iron, even at ordinary
  temperatures, may be squeezed so strongly that their interior
   arts change their relative positions like particles in a fluid,
   ron, in the solid state, by strong pressure, is squeezed into
 cavities and adapts its form to the surroundings. On cutting
 through such pressed pieces it has been found that the par
 ticles or crystals have arranged themselves by a flow-like
 movement suited to the form of the cavity into which the
 piece has been pressed.
    We must hero also refer to the interesting investigations of
 Reusch upon pressed conglomerates.            Under the strong
 pressure which has acted in the earth's crust, the pebbles in
 conglomerates are squeezed out into lance-shaped bodies,
 and these bodies have even become folded. (See Reusch,
 Siturfossiler oq prexsede Konglomerater i Bergensxkiferne, Univ.
 Progr. Chrisiiania, 1882, pp. 15, 117.)
    By reason of the enormous pressure which prevails in the
 interior of the earth, it must be supposed that masses from a
 certain depth are more or less in a plastic state. A constant
 lengthening of the sidereal day will cause the equatorial parts
 to increase in weight. So long as the earth does not change
 its form, a constantly increasing weight will act upon the
 internal mass from lower towards higher latitudes. There is,as
 Darwin indicates ('Nature,' Sept. 2, 1886, p. 422), reason to
 believe that, finally, when the tension has reached a certain
 amount, the earth will yield. A flow of plastic mass will be
 directed towards higher latitudes, and persist until the earth
has approximated to the form suitable to the length of the
sidereal day. When we consider the numerous testimonies
as to changes in the solid crust of the earth, and the frequent
elevations and depressions of the solid land relatively to the
sea, we may well agree with Darwin that this view may claim
more probability than that of Thomson and Tait.
    Wertheim has proved by experiment (according to Fock,
Larobok i Fysiken, Stockholm, 1861, pp. 202, 219) that there
is really no definite limit of elasticity for any matter, but that
they all, by the action even of quite feeble forces, undergo
small persistent changes, especially if these forces have acted
for a somewhat long time. When with feeble pressures we
find no permanent change of form, this is because the force
has not acted long enough. The action of the force, therefore,
when it has a greater resistance to overcome, depends upon
time. " By tension," says Schi0tz (Lcerebog i Fysik, Christi-
ania, 1881, p. 65), " lengthening constantly increases, although
very slowly, after it first commences ; therefore a weight which
has acted for a short time will not produce persistent elonga-

418             A. Blytt on the probable Caune of
tion, such as it would if it were allowed to act for a longer
time. This applies not only to tension, but generally ; and
hence it comes about that wires slacken in course of time, and
that beams bend little by little. A thread is worn out by less
force when the pressure is long continued than when it is
applied for a shorter time."
    It seems to me that here we have a force which may be
capable of effecting displacements in the solid earth. I believe
that this is " the unknown force from below " which has ele
vated the mountains of Western North America, and to which
 Dutton appeals. The sidereal day increases very slowly. The
 sea adjusts itself in accordance with the smallest change in the
 length of the day, and rises slowly under high latitudes. But
 the solid earth offers resistance to change of form, and begins
 to give way only when the tension reaches a certain amount.
 When this period has arrived the crust also begins to rise
 under high latitudes. Under lower latitudes the movement
 takes place in the opposite direction. The solid earth pro
 bably is a little behind the sea in its movements ; and while
 the sea moves evenly and uninterruptedly, the change of form
 in the solid earth must perhaps take place more spasmodically,
 with intervening periods of rest, during which new tension is
set up.
   " The elevation of mountains," says A. Geikie (' Text-book
of Geology,' 1882, p. 917), "is in most cases due to a long
succession of such movements;" and (I.e. p. 919) "the ele
vation of mountains, like that of continents, has been occa
 sional, and, so to speak, paroxysmal." Upheavals of the
 crust take place repeatedly along the same fissure (see, e. g.,
 Briigger, BildungsgescMchte des Kristianiafjords, 1886, p. 78).
 Something of the same kind occurs in volcanic eruptions.
 Volcanoes rest for a shorter or longer time between the dif
 ferent eruptions. Basaltic layers alternate with sedimentary
 deposits. Earthquakes are a consequence of a tension set up,
 to which the crust suddenly yields. All this indicates that
 the crust of the earth does not immediately accommodate
 itself to the forces, but that it yields only when the constantly
 increasing pressure has approximated to a certain amount.
 It seems, moreover, to follow from geological investigations
 that there are periods in the earth s history when changes
 have taken place on a larger scale than usual. In his ' Text
 book' above cited (pp. 197-198) A. Geikie refers to the great
 eruptions (" fissure-eruptions ") which have taken place, in
 both the Old and the New World, in which melted masses
 burst forth from numerous fissures and overflowed thousands

                 the Displacement of Shore-lines.              419
of square miles. The Vulcanism of the present day seems
feeble in comparison with these gigantic eruptions.
    We will now pass to the inquiry whether these changes in
the form of the earth may stand in any relation of dependency
to the periodical variations of the eccentricity of the earth s
orbit. We start from the fact that Thomson and Tait are
right when they say that the tidal wave is the most powerful
of the forces which contribute to change the length of the
day. But besides the tidal wave of the sea, the interior
friction accepted by Darwin, (" the bodily tides ") is also
effective. Both, of course, are dependent upon the distance
of the sun and moon ; and we may therefore examine whether
the tidal action of these bodies upon the earth varies with the
 eccentricity of the earth's orbit. It appears from Darwin's
 investigations that the lunar tides in very distant periods must
have been much greater than now. I disregard this, as the
time in question is so long ago, and because the profiles, which
later on will combine in curves for the eccentricity of the
earth's orbit, come down from a past geologically so near.
When I perceived that the dependence of the tidal wave upon
 the eccentricity might bo of geological importance, I applied
 to the observer H. Geelmuyden, who, with his usual kindness,
has given me the following answer: —
    " The action of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, e, upon
 the force which produces tide and ebb, and which, for the sake
 of brevity, 1 will call the tidal force, is as follows :—Let r bo
 the sun's distance, then the sun's tidal force is
                              1 - ,.3>
 where C represents the sun's mass and the earth's radius.
 Jn the course of the year r varies ; but the mean value of -3
 is found by a simple integration to be          ^e2)3/2' wnere a *s
 the unchangeable mean distance. Consequently, the annual
 mean value of the sun's tidal force becomes
    " From this it follows that, when the eccentricity increases,
 the tidal force also increases ; if the former increases Ae and
 the latter AP, then
                      AP 3e.Ae „ .
                      — = T-7=Se.Ae,
                                                    2E 2

420              A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
as 1— e2 in the denominator is of no significance. If past
times be 3e= J0, and Ae= — 0"00043 per thousand years, then
3e . Ae= — 0'00002, or the sun's tidal force decreases for every
thousand years by sonao of its value. When the eccentricity
has its greatest possible value, 0'0667 according to Leverrier,
e2 = 0 00445, 3/2 e2= 0'00667, then P = l-00667-8; or the dif
ference between maximum and minimum is , J(0 of the value.
    " The monthly mean value of the moon's tidal force will of
course, in the same way, be dependent upon the eccentricity
 of the moon's orbit ; but as this is not subject to any notice
 able secular variation, it does not come under cousiderat'on.
 On the other hand, the moon's mean distance is dependent,
 although only to an extremely small extent, upon the eccen
 tricity of the earth's orbit, namely so that the moon's tidal
 force becomes
                       P'=^(l-?.3/2««).
    " Here, therefore, the eccentricity acts in the opposite
 direction, namely so that the force diminishes as the eccen
 tricity increases ; but as the factor q, by which 3/2 e1 is
 multiplied, is only about 3/400, while the magnitude outside
 the brackets —,3 = 5/2 . -3 (the lunar tides being in propor
 tion to the solar tides most nearly as 5 : 2), its action upon
 the whole tidal wave is ?g 0- . 0 = >^ of the former."
    Thus we see that the tidal force rises and sinks with the
eccentricity of the earth's orbit. It varies by about 5i» of
its value from the highest to the lowest eccentricity. This
force is the most important force for the alteration of the day,
and it makes it longer. The most important force for short
ening the day, according to Thomson, will be the refrigeration
of the earth, but he has calculated its value at only -g^o of
the tidal force (and he has only taken into account the marine
tidal wave). If, therefore, the tidal force diminishes and
increases by        of its value, this periodical variation cannot
compete with forces which act in the opposite direction ; and
we may therefore conclude that the sidereal day is constantly
becoming longer, but that its increase is periodically stronger
and weaker. It increases in length more and more rapidly
so long as the eccentricity of the earth's orbit increases, more
and more slowly so long as the eccentricity diminishes. In
other words : the centrifugal force diminishes and the equa
torial regions increase in weight more and more rapidly

                 the Displacement of Shore-lines.             421
under an increasing, and more and more slowly under a dimin
ishing eccentricity.
   As has been stated, there prevails, even among physicists,
a disagreement as to how far the earth will change its form,
in case the centrifugal force varies. Thomson is most inclined
to believe that it will not; Darwin is of opinion that it will.
And among other physicists whom I have consulted a similar
divergence prevails upon this point. One thinks that a
lengthening of the day even by several hours will be incapable
of altering the form of the solid earth ; another believes that
the solid earth will probably change its form just as easily as
the sea. And with regard to the rapidity with which the
sidereal day lengthens, opinions are just as much divided.
Darwin regards as possible variations much greater than
those which agree with the action of the tidal waves
calculated by Thomson for recent times. It is therefore clear
that this problem can hardly yet be finally solved, and that
different hypotheses will be for the present admissible. We
will therefore select that which is best fitted to explain the
facts, assuming that the variation of the tidal wave with the
eccentricity of the orbit may possibly be the cause of the
periodical displacement of ccast-lines. But we put forth this
hypothesis with all possible reserve. Divergences of opinion
between the most esteemed physicists upon this matter, and
the neat manner in which the hypothesis is supported by
many facts, alone give us the courage to put forward con
jectures which many will probably regard as not only bold,
but even improbable.
    The motive force of alterations in the form of the earth
 should therefore be periodically variable with the eccentricity
 of the orbit. The sea, which is fluid, adjusts itself at once in
 accordance with the smallest change in the length of the day.
 But the solid earth offers resistance ; and the day lengthens
 slowly and imperceptibly. With such small forces, as we
 have already seen, it becomes a matter of time. Even small
 forces can produce an effect, if they only have time to work
 in. It is therefore probable that the solid earth will be behind
the sea in its movements. Some time will elapse before the
 "crust" and the inner plastic mass begin to yield. The
 ground under a building often begins to give way only when
 the building has stood for some time. If, then, the solid body
 of the earth lags behind the sea in its movements, and the move
 ments both of the sea and of the solid earth occur periodically
 more strongly and more feebly, because the motive force is
 stronger and weaker according as the eccentricity of the orbit
 increases or diminishes, it was conceivable that the coast-lines

422             A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
would come to be displaced up and down once for every time that
eccentricity increases and diminishes. For there must be the
greatest probability that the solid earth may yield at one place
or another when the tension in the interior becomes strongest.
   It is important now to examine whether the action of the
tidal wave and variations in its strength are great enough to
explain the displacement of coast-lines. This is a mathema-
tico-physical problem, and it is not for me to solve it. 1 put
it as a question for the decision of competent men, and shall
confine myself to the following remarks :—
    If the sidereal day has been once several times shorter, and
the earth at the time was a solid body, the tension and pres
sure in its interior will increase with the length of the sidereal
day, until finally the tension becomes so great that the earth
begins to yield. It will then accommodate itself, if not in its
entirety, at least partially, until the tension is equalized, at
any rate in part. Perhaps then a state of repose will occur,
during which a new tension will accumulate, which may in
troduce a new change of form. And these spasmodic changes
of form in the body of the earth when strained to the limit of
its power of resistance would occur precisely when the eccen
tricity had approached its highest value, and the tension
increased most rapidly, or some time afterwards. Under such
circumstances, possibly, the small variation which the tidal
force undergoes with the eccentricity would turn the scale,
and determine the time for the changes of the solid earth.
   Thomson says (Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow, 1868) that it is
still hopeless to attempt to solve the question of how rapidly
the sidereal day lengthens, by means of tidal action. Byway
of trial he calculates (/. c. p. 2(5) the action of the existing
tidal wave to be so great that the earth in 100 years should
be retarded 1 80 seconds, with which corresponds a lengthening
of the day of 0"01 second; and if wo take this retarding power,
for the sake of simplicity, as constant, the day, in 100,000
years (the time which is on the average occupied by an oscilla
tion of the eccentricity) should become 10 seconds longer.
Moreover, Thomson reckons only the marine tidal wave. To
this should now be added Darwin's " interior tide," his "bodily
tides," which I know no means of calculating. For many
millions of years, when the moon was nearer and the tidal
action considerably stronger, the day also increased more
rapidly. But nowadays its increase is undoubtedly much
slower, and we cannot expect great general changes of level
in a short time from this cause.
   To a lengthening of the day by 10 seconds (according to
Todd, /. c.) corresponds a shortening of the equatorial radius

                 the Displacement of Shore-lines.           423
by 5-6 m., and a double lengthening of the polar radius,
therefore, by 11'2 m. What value the lengthening of the
day had in Tertiary times we do not know. It cannot well
have been remarkably greater than in recent times. And it
seems therefore in any case to follow, as stated above, that
the vertical displacement of coast-lines can scarcely have been
in general more than a few metres under any oscillation, in
case our attempted explanation is correct. Therefore we must
now see whether the displacement of coast-lines was so very
considerable.
   We must first examine how much is deposited in each pro
cessional period, and how great is the thickness of the stages.
The thickness of the deposit depends, in the first place, upon
the situation of the place, whether it lies near or far from the
land or the mouths of rivers, and upon the nature of the
deposit ; chemical deposits are commonly thinner than me-
clianical ones. As a mean number for each precessional
period (20,000 to 21,000 years), I have obtained the following
values for the different kinds of alternating deposits :—
      Marl and siliceous limestone, from 0-6-2'2 m.
      Clay and siliceous limestone, 1*3 m.
      Marl, gypsum, siliceous limestone, marine, 1*3—V4 m.
      Ditto, freshwater, 2*8—2'9 m.
     Limestone and marl, l-8-2'5 m.
      Marl, argillaceous limestone, ironstone, sandy marl, 2 m.
      Sand, calcareous sandstone, marine, 2-2 3 m.
      Ditto, freshwater, 3 m.
     Sand, clay, ferruginous sandstone, marine, 5-6 m.
     Clay, limestone, ironstone, sand, 5-7 m.
     Sand, marly clay, ferruginous sandstone, lignite, up to
        30-60 m.
   In each stage, when there has only been one oscillation of
the sea, there are usually 4 or 5 such alternating deposits ; so
the thickness of the stages is generally but small. I may cite
the following examples. First, from the Paris basin :—the
Calcaire Grossier, which represents 25 deposits and several
(5-6) oscillations, is only 31*5 m. thick ; Sables de Beau-
champ, 13-14 m. ; the Calcaire de St. Ouen, with 10 alternating
deposits, is only 6-7 m. ; marine gypsum, 16-17 in. ; palustrine
gypsum, 20 m. ; Sables d'Etampes, 11-12 m.
   In the Isle of Wight the beds are thicker, but also richer
in mechanical deposits :—Plastic Clay, 26 m. ; London Clay,
61 m. ; Lower Bagshot (sand, clay, lignite, and ferruginous
sandstone, with 7 alternating deposits), in all, 200 in. ;
Brackleshain, of the same kind as tho preceding and without

424             A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
any alternation, 33*5 m. ; Middle Bagshot, 91 m. ; Upper
Bagshot (sand, without alternations), 37 m. ; Lower Headon,
21 in., Middle, 7 m., and Upper Headon, 26 m. ; Osborne
Series, 19 m. ; Benibridge Limestone, 7-6 m. ; Bembridge
Marl, 23 m. ; and Hempstead Series, 52 m.
   From Belgium we have the following thicknesses :—Mon-
tien (coarse limestone with Foraminifera), 93 m. ; Heersien,
32 m. ; Landenien, about 60 m. ; Ypresien, 140 m. ; Bruxei-
lien, 50 m.; Laekenien, ]()m.; Weinmelion, up to 80 m.
(only determined by boring) ; Tongrien, 21 m. ; Rupelien,
60 m. ; Anversien, 3-4 m. (but near Utrecht, in an Artesian
well, 130 m.).
   The thicknesses in the basin of Mayence are as follows :—
Alzeyer Sand, 50 m ; Septaina-clay, 50 m. ; Elsheimer Sands,
60 m, ; Cyrena-marh, 40 m. ; Ce?v'//m»n-limestones, 25 in. ;
CorWewZa-limestones, 25 m. ; Litorinella-chy, 20 m. In Italy
Seguenza gives the following thicknesses :—Bartonien (in
part conglomerates, and perhaps several oscillations), 300 in.;
Tongrien, 50 m. ; Langhien, Astien,and Saharien,each 200 in.;
Zancleen, 300 m. The Swiss Mollasse (which is a shore-
formation) is so thick that it forms whole mountains ; but,
according to Charles Mayer-Eymar, the Aquitanian has a
much greater and, indeed, quite exceptional thickness near
Bormida, in Tuscany. Here we find (probably inclined from
the first) freshwater and superiorly marine shore-formations
with manifold alternations of sandstone and shales, the thick
ness of which, although it has not been exactly measured, is
believed to be 3000 in., and all supposed to be formed in the
Aquitanian period. And the same stage (according to
 Giimbel) has a similar thickness in Bavaria. Etna, which is
12,000 feet high, has been built up by volcanic eruptions in
the most recent geological period, and since the Mediterranean
had acquired a fauna essentially the same as at the present
day.
    The formation of the Mediterranean, with its strong vul-
 canism, has been distinguished (according to Suess and Neu-
 mayr) by very considerable displacements of the earth's body.
 The Egean Sea and the Adriatic have been formed by depres
 sions in the latest geological period. Under such circum
 stances, very thick deposits may be formed near land in a short
 time. Eocene marine deposits are uplifted 21,000 feet above
 the sea in folded ranges (e. g., in Upper Asia). But all these
 are only local disturbances. If we turn, on the other hand, to
 localities where the conditions have been more quietly deve
 loped, we find, as inay be seen from the preceding statements,
 that the stages have only a small thickness. The deposits

                   the Displacement of Shore-lines.                   425
which form them are partly freshwater formations, partly
formations from shallow seas ; there are no well-marked deep-
sea formations among them. They are to a great extent—
perhaps for the most part—formed in inland seas and bays, in
basins which were separated by banks from the open sea. We
may arrive at this conclusion from the circumstance that salt
water and freshwater formations so frequently alternate in the
Tertiary deposits ; for it is only when stratified formations take
place in basin-shaped depressions that freshwater basins can
be formed when the sea retires.
    And if we have deep basins which are separated by banks
from the open sea, a rising or sinking of the shore-line by some
few metres will be sufficient to submerge or lay dry the banks.
The deep basin will then alternately be salt and fresh. And
a rising of the sea by a few metres will likewise suffice to cause
the formation of thick saltwater deposits in the basin. If the
bank then again rises a few metres, the basin will remain fresh,
and thick freshwater beds can be deposited above the marine
beds. In this way the formation of alternating salt- and fresh
water beds may continue, under small displacements of the
 coast-line, until the basin is filled up.
    It would seem to be more difficult to reconcile the hypo
thesis with the very considerable elevations which particular
countries have undergone in the period which has elapsed
 since the Glacial period. Thus near Christiania and Trond-
heim the highest trace of the sea from the Postglacial time is
 situated 188 metres above the sea. But in other parts of our
 country the highest marine terraces are much lower, so that
 it would seem as if the elevation has not been everywhere
 equally great. It seems to have been weaker and weaker
 outwards from the centre of the country. In Southern Sweden
 and Denmark it has also been inconsiderable in the same
 period. Penck has shown (" Schwankungen des Meeres-
 spiegels," in Jahrb. Geogr. Ges. Milnchen, Bd. vii.) that an in
 land ice exerts an attraction upon the sea, which, for this
 reason, stands higher on the coast of a country, when the
 land is covered with ice. The melting of the inland ice may
 therefore have caused the sea on our coasts to sink somewhat,
 but the difference between the situations of the highest marine
 traces in the different parts of Scandinavia is so great *, even
 in neighbouring localities, that it could not bo explained in
 this way; and the most probable explanation would be that the
 land has risen in different degrees at different placesf. It is
    * See E. von Drygalski, " Die Geoiddeformationen der Eiszeit," in
  Zeitschr. d. Get.f. Erdkunde in Berlin, Bd. ixii. 1887, pp. 109 et seqq.
    t A similar unequal elevation has probably also taken place during

426               A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
also a probable supposition that the crust has not everywhere
the same power of resistance to the interior pressure, and
especially that the plastic mass may press in under the more
yielding parts of the surface. We have a striking example of
this in the laccolites noticed in North America. Eruptive matter
is here pressed up from below, and has lifted the beds into
dome-shaped vaults, so that the elevations have been different
in degree in different places, and greatest in the middle of the
domes. We may imagine that similar forces, but on a much
larger scale, have contributed to the elevation of Scandinavia,
—that Scandinavia is, sit venia verbo, as it were a laccolite on
a larger scale. We must in the next place remember that the
changes of the earth's surface which have taken place in the
Tertiary and Quaternary periods, however great they seem to
be in our eyes, are inconsiderable in relation to the whole mass
of the earth. Even small forces, where they act upon a great
mass, may produce very considerable local effects, provided
that the changes do not everywhere occur upon the same scale.
If we consider that in this way the elevations are not every
where equally great, then a depression of the equatorial belt
of only a couple of metres will suffice to cause many such
countries as Scandinavia to rise many metres, and there will
still remain pressure which is not exhausted.
    Of course it is not said that, whenever the eccentricity has
attained a high value, Scandinavia will rise to an equally great
amount. If the elevation has been great in a given period,
it is probable that the next period of elevation will have more
difficulty in upheaving the previously elevated land. The
position of the weakest points will vaiy. The next time,
perhaps, the elevation will chiefly affect other localities. If
we consider the Tertiary formations in Europe, we see that
the series of deposits is nowhere complete. It is only by com
bining all the deposits formed at different places that we can
obtain a complete outline. In part this is certainly due to
the fact that the changes of form in the solid earth have not
taken place simultaneously everywhere. The great eccentri
cities produced upheavals at different times in different places.
   There is, lastly, a circumstance of great importance which
may here be indicated, and which shows how quietly oscilla
tions take place under normal conditions. Although according
earlier periods of elevation. In the Bergen conglomerate, the old shalea
are situated at a higher level, the further one goes from the shore. (See
Kjerulf, Udsigt over det sydl. Norges Geologi, Uhristiania, 1879, pp. 154
-150, &c. ; and Helland in Arch.f. Math, og Naturv. lid. vi. Christiauia,
1881, p. 222.)

                 tlie Displacement of Shore-lines.           427
to our hypothesis, the radii of the higher latitudes constantly
lengthen, while those of lower latitudes are shortened, yet
through long geological periods coast-lines return repeatedly,
during their displacements, to their old position. Thus A. de
Lapparent (Bull. Soc. Geol. France, ser. 3, vol. xv. p. 400)
says :—" I have indicated, in the Cotentin, an agreement
between the actual shores and those at which the sea stopped
at various epochs of geological history. I have there shown
shore-lines reproduced, almost without variations of altitude, in
the Hettangian, Sinemurian, Liassiun, Cenomanian, Danian,
Parisian, Tongrian, Pliocene, and present epochs           , and
that eight or nine times at least, since the Primary era, the
coincidence of the shores has been reproduced at the same
point ; " and in the same work (p. 277) he says :—" It is only
by tens of metres that, on the coast of the Cotentin, we must
reckon the differences between the successive levels of the seas,
from the Trias down to the present day." Here we see that
the variations of level have taken place with great regularity.
The sea has risen, and later on the land has been elevated ;
and these alternate risings and sinkings have occurred with
such regularity that the coast-line again and again, at long
intervals, ha3 returned about to its old place.
    After this there seems really to be a possibility th.it our
hypothesis is sufficient to explain the displacements of the
shore-lines which have taken place. We have hitherto con
sidered the conditions under high latitudes. Under lower
latitudes all may sink. Here " Horste " may be formed such
as ISuess supposes, and as to the occurrence of these localities
Lapparent's criticism is unsatisfactory. He has attacked
Suess's theory of " Horste " in its entirety, but he has cri
ticised it specially only for such localities (Colorado, Vosges,
Black Forest, and the central plateau of France) as lie under
high latitudes. The localities named have (according to
Lapparent) risen more than their environment, which also is
quite in accordance with the opinion above developed. But
under lower latitudes, when a general sinking takes place in
the course of time, resistant parts will form true " Horste " in
Suess's sense. And it scarcely goes against our hypothesis
to assume, with Suess, that the Indian Ocean is formed by
depression, and that Africa, Madagascar, India, &c. are
•' Horste," parts of the crust which have remained in position,
 or which have sunk less than the neighbouring regions. In
these countries, so far as their geology is known at present,
there seem to be few marine formations of the Mesozoic and
 Cainozoic epochs.
    I have said above that the different parts of the crust may

428      Probable Cause of the Displacement of Shore-lines.
be assumed to have different powers of resistance against the
interior pressure. This may, in fact, be concluded from the
fact that the surface is uneven, and that old, originally hori
zontal formations have been upheaved unequally at different
spots. In other words, there is an inequality of the surface,
which has a deeper cause than the operation of eroding
forces.
    Changes of the earth's crust in reality happen in the most
various degrees at different times. The greatest convulsions
occur in the folded mountain-chains, and this has been the
case in all geological periods. It is worthy of note that
places where great foldings took place in ancient times seem
to have been subsequent^' unaffected by processes of folding*.
For upon the abraded summits of old folds there often lie
other old formations in an undisturbed horizontal position.
The most highly folded chains are also those in which plica
tions have been continued to the latest time f. Along both
 sides of the Pacific Ocean from Cape Horn to the Aleutian
 Islands, and opposite to this along the east coast of Asia as
far as the Sunda Islands, strike mighty chains associated with
series of volcanoes; and from the Himalaya through the
 Caucasus, Balkans, Pyrenees, and Atlas a similar series of
vast chains stretches through localities which are often
volcanic. These highest mountains of the earth are also the
youngest ; they are still the least affected by the tooth of time.
    But these strongly folded localities are of small extent in
comparison with the other parts of the earth's surface.
    On both sides of these folds there are, namely, great
plateaux and plains, quite or nearly without any plications,
 and, on the whole, with undisturbed horizontal beds. These
 are Suess's "tables" (Tafehi). Africa, Western North
America (in the Eastern there are no younger plications than
 from Carboniferous times), Brazil, Australia, Arabia, Persia,
 India, Siberia, and Russia are such " tables," in which the
 crust is much less disturbed. And no doubt the same thing
 applies to the sea-basins, or at any rate to the greater part of
 of them.
    When the sidereal day lengthens the sea at once adjusts
itself to the new conditions. It sinks under the lower and
rises under the higher latitudes. According as the interior
   * If the earth's axis, as some astronomers (e.g. Gylden) think, may
shift its position in the course of time, calculations as to the pressure
produced by the lengthening of the day will also change, and the situations
of the parts of the crust exposed to the greatest pressure will also shift.
   t The following summary is founded upon Suess's interesting studies
in his great work AntUtz der Erde.

                          Geological Society.                    429
pressure upon the crust increases towards the poles, the
opposite pressure upon the sea-bottom also increases in the
same regions, because the sea rises. But the parts not covered
by the sea are exposed alone to the increasing pressure from the
interior without any exterior counterpressure being developed.
Under lower latitudes the same thing takes place. Accord
ing as the crust increases in weight the sea sinks, and the
pressure upon the interior increases more rapidly in the
continents, where nothing is removed, than in the sea, where
the level of the water sinks. Therefore I think that the
continents are weak points. The sea's movements weaken
the effects of the diminishing centrifugal force for all parts
covered by the sea, but the pressure acts with undiminished
force everywhere on the solid land, both under low and under
high latitudes. Whatever the cause may have been that origi
nally determined the distribution of land and sea upon our
globe, it seems to me that we may reasonably assume that the
sea's mobility is a preservative force, which perhaps has con
tributed to make the continents and oceans, broadly speaking,
 retain their form from the most ancient times until now.
    There is also reason to believe that the continents may yield
more easily than the bottom of the deep sea, and that they
may rise and sink more readily. And they are also separated
from the depths of ocean by lines abounding in volcanoes,
lines of weakness, where the connexion between the parts of
the crust seems to be weaker than elsewhere. Processes of
plication may also perhaps be a consequence of the movement
of " tables " not being of the same kind on both sides.
    But the boundaries between the deep ocean and the foot of
the continents do not everywhere coincide with the existing
 shore. Along the coasts there are often shallow tracts in the
 sea. These are the foot of the land which the sea has flooded,
 and the great deep sea only commences further out.

      1. " On the Subdivisions of the Speeton Clay." By G. W. Lamp-
 lugh, Esq.
    This paper gave the results of a long series of observations made

430                      Geological Society :—
during favourable opportunities at the cliff-foot and on the beach at
Speeton from 1880 to 1889. The chief points brought forward by
the author were as follows :—
   The sandy blue shales now seen in the cliff near Filey are not in
place, but are erratics in the Drift, and most, if not all, of them are
derived from the Lias.
   The bituminous shales with Belemnites Owenii, classified as Upper
Kimeridge, extend upwards to the Coprolito-bed and the beds de
scribed as Portlandian by Prof. Judd, having been wrongly placed
in this part of the section. No unconformity is traceable at the
Coprolite-bed, or at any other horizon, between the Jurassic and
Cretaceous portions of the clays.
   The clays may be most conveniently divided into zones by re
ference to the Belemnites, as follows : —
   Marly shales below the Red Chalk = zone of B. minimus and
allies.
   Upper division of the "Neocomian," including the " Cement-beds"
and part of the Middle Neocomian of Judd = zone of B. semicanali-
eulatus and allies.
   Lower division of the Neocomian from the top of the Pecten-cinctus
zone down to the base of the supposed Lower Neocomian zone of
Ammonites noricus= zone of B. jaculum.
   From the base of the noricus-zone to the Coprolite-bed = zone of
B. lateralis (zone of Amm. Astierianus of Judd).
   The Bituminous shales below the Coprolite bed = zone of B. Owenii
and varieties.
   The clays of the zone of Bel. lateralis have strongly marked
Jurassic affinities, and it is from this zone that the coronated Am
monites were obtained, these being the beds supposed by Leckenby
to be of Portlandian age. A very well-marked band of nodules,
with some scattered coprolitic pebbles, caps the lateralis-beds, and
this band constituted the " Coprolite-bed " of Leckenby.
   The thickness of the clays above the coprolites has been over
estimated ; it is probably not more than 300 feet.
   The ranges which have been assigned to some of the characteristic
fossils, especially Ammonites Astierianus, Amm. speetonensis, and
Toxaster complanatus, need to be revised and altered.
   The term " Middle Neocomian," as applied in the Speeton section,
is unnecessary and misleading, seeing that a " Lower Neocomian "
fauna occurs both above and below the beds with Middle Neoco
mian types ; and, as stated by Meyer, marly shales exist between
the lied Chalk and the Neocomian clays, strongly Buggestive of a
passage from the one to the other, and these beds contain many
Gault forms. Thus there is probably at Speeton a continuous series
of clays from the Jurassic to the Upper Cretaceous, and the deposi
tion of these beds appears to have gone on contemporaneously with
the erosion of the beds inland.

   2. " Notes on the Goology of Madagascar." By the Rev. R.
Baron. With an Appendix on some Fossils from Madagascar, by
R. Bullen Newton, Esq., F.G.S.
   The central highlands of Madagascar consist of gneiss and other
crystalline rocks, the general strike of which is parallel with the
main axis of the island, and also, roughly, with that of the crys
talline rocks of the mainland. The gneiss is frequently hornblendic;
its orthoclase is often pink ; triclinic felspar also occurs in places ;
biotite is the most common mica, but muscovite is not uncommon ;
magnetite is generally present, often in considerable quantities.
The gneiss is often decayed to great depths, forming a rod soil, and
the loosened rock is deeply eaten into by streams. The harder
masses of gneiss, having resisted decay, stand out in blocks, and
have been mistaken for travelled boulders of glacial origin. Other
more or less crystalline rocks are mica-schists, chlorite-schists, crys
talline limestone, quartzite (with which graphite is often associated),
and clay-slate.
    Bosses of intrusive granite rise through the gneiss. That east
of the capital contains porphyritic crystals of felspar which near the
northern edge of the granite are arranged roughly in a linear di
 rection ; here also the granite contains angular fragments of gneiss.
 For the most part the granite of Madagascar is clearly intrusive, but
 this may not always be the case.
    The volcanic rocks are of much interest. The highest mountains,
 those lying to the S.W. of the capital, consist, in their higher parts,
of a mass of lava, for the most part basaltic, but with some sani-
dine-trachyte. The lava-streams are sometimes 25 miles long, and
successive flows, up to 500 feet in thickness, are exposed by the
valleys. From the great denudation which this area has undergone
 and from tho fact that no cones now remain, we may assume that
this volcanic series is of some antiquity. Of the newer volcanic
sories there are numerous very perfect cones, dotting the surface of
 the gneiss in many places. No active volcano now exists in the
island, but the occasional emission of carbonic-acid gas, the occur
rence of numerous hot springs and deposits of siliceous sinter, and
 the frequency of small earthquake-shocks, seem to show that
 volcanic forces are only dormant and not entirely extinct.
    The ashes generally lie most thickly on the side of the cone
 between north and west ; this is accounted for by the prevalence of
 the south-cast trade-winds. Tho volcanic aroas are ranged roughly
 in a linear direction, corresponding with the longer axis of the
 island.
    Sedimentary rocks occur mainly on the western and southern
 sides of the island. The relations of these to each other have not
 yet been determined ; but from the fossils (referred to the European
 standard) it seems that the following formations are represented :—
 Eocene, Upper Cretaceous, Neocomian, Oxfordian, Lower Oolites,
 Lias. Possibly some of the slaty beds may turn out to be Silurian
 or Cambrian. The crystalline 6chists, &c, are probably, for tho

  432                     Geological Society        -
  most part at least, Archaean. Recent deposits fringe the coasts and
  are largely developed on the southern part of the island.
     East of the central line of watershed there is a long depression
  containing a wide alluvial deposit, probably an old lake-bed. Ter
  races fringe its sides in many places. The lagoons of the eastern
 coast are due to alluvial deposits.
     The paper concluded with somo remarks on the geological antiquity
 of the island, its separation dating from early Pliocene times, if not
 earlier. This is the conclusion arrived at by Wallace from its fauna ;
  the author's detailed researches into its flora, recently described
 before the Linnean Society, show that while about five sixths of
 its genera of plants are also found elsewhere, chiefly in tropical
 countries, at least four fifths of its species are peculiar to Madagascar.
     The Appendix, drawn up by Mr. It. Bullen Newton, F.G.S.,
 consisted of Notes upon the fossils collected by the author, with
 tables, and descriptions of two now species, namely, Astartc (?)
 Baroni and Sphosra madagascariensis, both from deposits of Lower-
 Oolitic age.
    3. " Notes on the Petrographical Characters of somo Itocks col
 lected in Madagascar by the ltev. It. Baron." By F. H. Hatch,
 Ph.D., F.G.8.
    This paper was divided into two parts, the first treating of the
 petrographical characters of the older crystalline rocks of the eastern
 and mountainous part of the island, the second of the nature of
 the lavas that have been erupted from volcanic vents situated
 mainly in the same portion of the island.
    i. The Older Crystalline Bods are represented in Mr. Baron's
 collection partly by foliated specimens, partly by rocks showing no
 parallel structure in the hand-specimen.
    The foliated specimens have, with few exceptions, the structure
 and composition of gneiss. The author subdivided them into an
 acid and a basic series. The acid series, which embraces rocks com
posed of abundant quartz with orthoclase as the dominant felspar,
he terms gremitile-gntiss ; the basic, series, which consists of rocks
containing little quartz and much plagioclase felspar, tonalite-gntiss.
    The unfoliated specimens comprise granite, gabbro or norite,
pyroxcne-granulite, and pyroxenite.
    The majority of the granites are of the granitite-type—t. e. they
are granites with one mica ; but granites xuith two micas are also
represented.
    The remainder of the rocks are of a basic type. They are inte
resting, in the first place, on account of the striking combinations of
fresh and beautiful minerals they present, as, for example :—plagio
clase, hypersthone, olivine, brown hornblende and green spinel, in
an olivine-7iorite ; or, plagioclase, green pyroxene (omphacite or
diallage), hyperstheno, hornblende, garnet and iron-ore, in jryroxene-
granulite ; or, again, diallage and hyperstheno in pyroxenite.
    But of greater interest is the fact that these basic types, which

          Colloid Silica in the Lower Chalk of Berkshire.         433
are so well known in other territories of old crystalline rocks—
Saxony, Brittany, Scandinavia, Scotland, the Hudson River, etc.—
constitute in Madagascar, as they do at Kilima-njaro on the
adjacent mainland, a large part of the ancient platform on the sub
merged portions of which tho sedimentary rocks have accumulated,
and through which the volcanic lavas were erupted.
   ii. The Volcanic Rocks.—In composition these are acid, inter
mediate and basic, mainly the latter. Tho acid and intermediate
types described are sanidine-trachyte and hornblende-awjite-andesite.
The basic rocks consist of various types of basalt. They vary with
respect to the presence or absence of corroded quartz-grains,
olivine, porphyritic hornblende, and biotite. In one interesting typo
tho hornblende appears in small idiomorphic crystals as a constituent
of the ground-mass. A felspar-free variety, or mayma-basalt, is also
represented. This rock contains only a small quantity of olivine,
and is therefore intermediate between Rosenbusch's Limburgite and
Dolter's augitite.

   1. " Supplementary Note to a Paper on the Rocks of the Atlantic
Coast of Canada." By Sir J. W. Dawson, K.C.M.G., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In a paper in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for
November 1888, tho author referred to the Oleiiellus-fauna, as cha
racterizing the Middlo Cambrian. This fauna, he has now no doubt,
from the recently published observations of Walcott and Matthew,
should bo regarded as characteristic of tho Upper Member of the
Lower Cambrian. From this arises a new view of tho physical
geography of the period, namely, that the Lower Cambrian was,
in America, a period of continental depression, and tho Middle
Cambrian a period of continental elevation, leading to the important
conclusion that a time of elovation intervened between theHuronian
and the early Cambrian, which may represent the apparent gap
between these systems in Eastern America. Ho thinks that this
new view deserves a special mention in connexion with the proba
bility that the Huronian and Kewenian beds arc of littoral origin.
   2. " The Occurrence of Colloid Silica in the Lower Chalk of
Berkshire and Wiltshire." By W. Hill, Esq., F.G.S., and A. J.
Jukes-Browne, Esq., F.G.S.
   In the Lower Chalk of Berks and Wilts are beds which contain a
large amount of disseminated colloid silica ; these are comparable in
general structure to the Malmstones of the Upper Greensand. Dr.
Hinde's study of the latter led him to believe that tho globular
colloid silica which they contain was directly derived from tho
remains of siliceous sponges, and the authors' studies of the Chalk
specimens have confirmed this conclusion by adding several important
pieces of evidence.

   They found that the amount of free disseminated Bilica increases
in proportion to the number of spicules and calcite-casts of spicules
which occur in the rock, and observed that the great similarity be
tween the siliceous chalk and the Malmstone was heightened by the
occurrence of similar siliceous concretions in both rocks, the material
of which might be described as siliceous chalk, indurated by a cement
of chalccdonic silica. The conditions in which the silica was found
in the Lower Chalk were described, in examples varying from those
containing least to those which held most silica ; in the latter the
 amount of colloid silica was estimated at 12-01 per cent, by weight.
After noticing the vast amount of silica present in rocks with a
maximum thickness of 70-80 feet, the authors discussed the diffi
 culty of accounting for this, and drew attention to Prof. Sollas's
statement that many living siliceous sponges constantly shed some
of their spicules.
    A further question arose as to whether the formation and accu
 mulation of globular silica went on contemporaneously with the
deposition of the calcareous material upon the sea-floor, or whether
the conversion of the spicules into such silica took place after the
consolidation of the rock, and (he authors gave reasons for sup
 posing that the latter was the case, the change having occurred
 when the rock was in a sufficiently oozy condition to admit of easy
 molecular distribution, lleasons were given for supposing that the
 disseminated colloid silica had not been derived directly from the
disintegration of spicules in which a globular structure had been
previously developed, but that the globular silica was precipitated
from solution whilst the beds were still permeated by sea- water.
   The precipitation of the chalccdonic silica was regarded by the
authors as a secondary and subsequent operation. They were dis
posed to regard all nodular concretions resembling Hints and phos-
phatic nodules as growths, which were more or less contemporaneous
with the deposition of the materials of the enclosing rock, and in
conclusion they offered some comments upon the problem of the
formation of flints.

   1. "The Elvans and Volcanic llocks of Dartmoor." By 11. N.
Worth, Esq., F.G.B.
   The object of this paper was to give reasons for the belief that the
present granite of Dartmoor passed upwards into felsitic and volcanic
rocks, remnants of which are to be found in the Triassic conglome
rate of Devon, in the detritus of the bottom lands of the moor itself,
on the beaches of tho channel, and in ancient river-gravels and
pebble-beds ; to indicate tho wide range of character taken by the
felsites of the Dartmoor district; and to point out some of the

evidence which exists in the in-situ elvans for the development of
the most varied of these forms from a common magma.
    Special opportunities for the study of two of the elvanite dykes in
the neighbourhood of Tavistock have lately presented themselves.
The Shillamill elvan exhibits a centre composed of quartzose felspar-
porphyry graduating laterally through numerous varieties into
" claystono porphyry ;" whilst the Grenofen elvan retains the same
structure in breadth, but changes in length from a rock containing
so little felsitic matter that it is essentially a fine-grained porphyritic
granite to one with a compact semivitreous ground-mass, in which
felspars, quartz, and mica are porphyritically developed.
   As evidence afforded of the existence of distinctly volcanic rocks,
mention is made of a deposit of wator-borno and water- worn detritus,
indicating a Dartmoor origin for a large portion of its constituents,
along with rolled flints and pebbles of Carboniferous, Liassic, and
Cretaceous limestone, with which were associated typical andesites
and specimens of volcanic grit such as arise from the denudation of
volcanic cones. This occurs on the limestone at Cattedown near
Plymouth, and bears testimony to a very ancient denudation.

         THE SENSITIVE FLAME AS A MEANS OF RESEARCH.
                       BY W. LECONTE STEVENS *.
A LITTLE over thirty years ago the discovery was published in
      this Journal t that under certain conditions a naked flame of
illuminating-gas may become sensitive to sonorous vibrations. Nine
years elapsed before any development grew out of this acquisition
to science. In 1867 Mr. "W. F. Barrett J, who was at that time
an assistant in the laboratory of the Koyal Institution, published
his independent discovery of the sensitiveness of flame ; and the
use of the manometric flame, in the hands of Rudolph Koenig,
was subsequently developed with great skill for the analysis of
compound tones. The use of Professor Barrett's flame has become
widely known, especially through the familiar volume of lectures
on Sound by Professor Tyndall. Govi in Italy, Barry in England,
and Geyer in America independently discovered the method of secur
 ing a sensitive flame, with no pressure higher than that of the ordin
ary street mains, by causing air to mingle with the gas after it issues
from the nozzle, and allowing the mixture to burn after passing
 through wire gauze. While this flame may be made exquisitely

 sensitive, it is not so convenient in practice as the high-pressure
 flame of Professor Barrett. It is well known that these flames
 are usually sensitive only to sounds of high pitch, and through a
 limited range of pitch, this range becoming generally narrower
 with increase of sensitiveness. During the last few years Lord
 Rayleigh has used the sensitive flame with signal success in study
 ing certain analogies between sound and light. His interesting
 lecture on " Diffraction of Sound," delivered a little over a year ago
 before the Royal Institution *, served as my starting-point ; and I
 am further indebted to him for special instructions without which
 I should perhaps not have succeeded in performing satisfactorily
 all the experiments mentioned in his lecture. As this lecture has
 not thus far been re-published in America, a brief resume of it may
 possibly be acceptable.
    Waves of light are so short that special precautions are needed
 to exhibit the phenomena of diffraction. Light emanating from
 a point and interrupted by an obstacle produces a shadow that may
 be regarded for all practical purposes as geometric. Waves of
 audible sound, on the contrary, are so long that when an obstacle
 is interposed the effect of diffraction masks that of radial propaga
 tion, and hence it is not usually easy to make a sound shadow
 manifest. The difficulty in sound is not to produce diffraction,
 but rather to limit it by using the shortest wave-lengths possible.
 The pitch employed by Lord Bayleigh was more than 20,000
 vibrations per second, corresponding to a wave-length of less than
 two thirds of an inch. To measure this the waves are reflected
 from a surface arranged vertically across the direction of propaga
 tion, thus producing interference with the direct waves. The
 position of the nodes and ventral segments is determined by
 moving the reflector toward or from a sensitive flame interposed
between it and the source of sound. The flame flares in a ventral
segment and burns quietly at a node. The distance between two
points of quiescence is a half wave-length, from which the pitch is
readily computed. Knowing the wave-length, if this be small in
comparison with the diameter of an obstacle such as a disk, it is
possible to calculate the deflexion necessary for the meeting of
secondary waves behind it, from its opposite, edge?, in order to
produce a maximum or mimimum of intensity. In this way, as
much as eight or nine years ago, Lord Bayleigh repeated acousti
cally the celebrated experiment suggested by Poisson to Fresnel.
and first performed by Arago, by which a bright point was found
at the middle of the shadow of a small di-h. Applying the formula
for Iluygen's zones, an acoustic diffraction-grating was made bv
which sound was converged to a focus, as if by a lens, the
flaring of the flame at this focus being very violent. Around
it, according to the theory, there should be several successive rings
of motion and quiescence, or, in other words, of noise and silence.
The first ring of noise, and the rings of silence that precede and

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             437
follow it are detected without difficulty by means of the sensitive
flame.
   All of these experiments by Lord Rayleigh have been repeated
by me. The source of sound used is Galton's adjustable whistle,
through which a blast is sent from a cylinder of compressed air
of oxygen. The sensitive flame is fed from a similar cylinder of
compressed coal-gas, the pressure of the supply being carefully
regulated in each case by means of a water manometer-gauge.
The whistle is capable of giving a pitch as high as 18,000 or 20,000,
but as this limit is approached the intensity becomes too much
diminished, and practically the best pitch it yields is about 13,000
vibrations per second. Lord Kayleigh's whistle is slightly different
in construction, and probably better than the Galton whistle.
But there is no difficulty in obtaining good results with this pitch.
The greatest practical difficulty is that of keeping the sensitiveness
of the flame exactly right, the slightest variation of pressure
making it inconstant, and causing it to give misleading indications
when the attempt is made to apply it to purposes of measurement,
   1 have attempted by means of the whistle and flame to verify
acoustically the experiment in light first performed by Gritnaldi
and analysed by Dr. Thomas Young, that of producing diffraction-
bands by transmitting waves in the same phase through two
small openings, and exploring the air with the sensitive flame for
the hyperbolic lines of maximum and minimum motion. The
whistle, giving forth waves 10-5 inch in length, was placed 34 inches
 from the screen of cardboard, whose width was two feet. Near
the middle of this were cut two vertical slits, 3 inches apart,
and each \ inch wide. The position required by theory for the
hyperbolic bands was determined, the screen being at right angles
to the direction of the whistle from its middle point. The middle
line of maximum motion behind the screen was detected without
difficulty. It was discontinuous, as might be expected when the
wave-length is so considerable in comparison with the distance
between the apertures. The nearest hyperbolas on the two sides
of this were found in their right position, and traced back rather
more than a foot from the screen, but they were not so well defined
as the middle line. The next pair of hyperbolas was also found,
but with poor definition. By using slits a half inch in width
 results were perhaps a little better, though in neither case could
any measurements approximate to exactness.
    Fresnel's celebrated experiment of producing interference-bands
by reflexion of light from two mirrors inclined at an angle of
nearly 180° was tried by Professor A. M. Mayer and myself con
jointly, using sound-waves. A large plate of glass was rested on
the table, and another plate inclined to it at an angle of 152°, the
whistle being 67 inches from the flame, 4 inches from the inclined
mirror, and 13 inches above the table. Six interference-bands
were detected by means of the flame, their mean distance apart
being 4 inches. By subsequent calculation this result was found
correct to within a tenth of an inch. An important source of

438            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
uncertainty, however, in this experiment arises from the waves
proceeding directly from whistle to flame. Even if a screen is
interposed, enough space has to be left below it to allow for the
passage of sound-rays reflected from the two mirrors. From the
lower edge of the screen, therefore, waves are diffracted and may
interfere with either or both sets of waves reflected from the
mirrors. The trouble from this source caused the abandonment
of this plan of experiment.
   A modification of the Fresnel experiment, is that of using but a
single mirror, which may be rested horizontally on the table, and
allowing the waves reflected from it to interfere with those radiated
directly from the whistle. The effect is obviously the same as if
they proceeded from two sources, but interference-bands can be
produced on only one side of the median line. In the accompany
ing diagram AM is the plane of the mirror, S the source of sound,
and S' the virtual source from which the reflected waves may be
regarded as coming. Let the nozzle from which the flame issues be
placed first at A and then lifted vertically. The flame will flare
at the points B, C, D, &c, whose distances respectively from S
and 8' differ by an even number of half wave-lengths. Midway
between A and B, B and C, &c., are points of complete interference
where the flame should burn quietly. The distance AB is approxi-
mately equal to AM  , ,, X. The accompanying table gives a compa-
                   8S
rison between the results of theory and experiment, in which the
height of the whistle above the table, MS, is 10 inches ; the distance
AM is 36 inches, and the wave-length, X, is 1*05 inch. The suc
cessive measurements are of distances above the table at which the
flame became quiescent. The first column is calculated from the
formula; the others are the records from five sets of experiments.

  OX THE LAW OK SOLUBILITY OF GASES. BY M. WOUKOLOFF.
   MM. Louguinine and Khanikoff and M. Wroblewski made
some researches in order to ascertain the accuracy of Dalton's
law of the solution of gases, by determining the solubility of
carbonic acid gas in water under pressures greater than that of
the atmosphere. MM. Louguinine and Khanikoff found that
carbonic acid dissolved to a greater extent than required by Dal
ton's law, and that the difference increased continuously with the
pressure; while M. Wroblewski discovered that the absorption
was always in arrear, and that the quantity of gas dissolved did
not keep up with the increase in pressure. These physicists
worked under conditions but little favourable to the verification
of Dalton's law. This law, in its ideal form, assumes that there is
no chemical action between the liquid and the gas in solutiou ;
while carbonic acid is capable of forming hydrates with water, as
M. Wroblewski has shown, and the high pressures and low
temperatures in the experiments of MM. Louguinine, Ivlianikoff,
and Wroblewski must favour the formation of such hydrates.
   My determinations have been made under conditions more in
conformity with the requirements of Dalton's law. I give here
the result of my researches on the solution of carbonic acid in
carbon disulphide under feeble pressures and at various tempera
 tures. Experiments with liquids as volatile us carbon disulphide
 are especially suitable for showing the general course of the
 phenomenon, since the limits of error are very large. Indeed, the
great variation in the vapour-pressure with the temperature and,
above all, the considerable alteration in this pressure caused by
the gaseous atmosphere, must have a great influence on the results,
although I have taken every possible precaution. I have made
 special experiments to determine the influence of the gas on the
 vapour-pressure, and to diminish the errors in the final result. I
 have taken a considerable quantity (SSO gr.) of carbon disulphide.
   Let A be the quantity of gas dissolved in 1 cubic eeutim. of carbon
disulphide (reduced to 0° and 700 millim.), P, t, the pressure and
the temperature respectively, and Pp Alt the values corresponding

    We see that if carbonic acid docs not rigorously follow Dalton's
 law when dissolving in carbon disulphide, the deviations are very
 small and are of the same order as those which it shows in respect
 to the law of Mariotte. At low temperatures its absorption is
 greater, and at high temperatures less, than that indicated by
 Dalton's law.— Comptes Rendus, April 1, 1889, p. 074.
      ON A VOLTAIC CUHUENT OBTAINED WITH BISMUTH IN A
              MAGNETIC FIELD. BY DR. G. P. GRIMALDI.
    The experiments made by Nichols * on the influence of magnetism
 on the passivity of iron led me to investigate whether there was
 anything analogous in the case of bismuth.
    After many fruitless attempts I made the following experiment
 with favourable results.
    A wide U-tube contains a dilute solution of bismuth chloride iu
 hydrochloric acid ; in the vertical limbs dip two wires of chemically
 pure bismuth very carefully polished.
    One of these wires with the tube containing it is placed between
 the conical pole-pieces of a Faraday's electromagnet of medium size,
 in such a way that the surface of the liquid, is in the most intense
 part of the field. The two wires are joined up to a very sensitive
 Thomson's galvanometer with astatic needles. On closing the
 circuit a current is observed in the galvanometer which might be
 thought to be a primary one due to a diversity of the two bismuth
 wires. This current, which at the outset varies rapidly, diminishes

after a certain time, becoming less inconstant, and may be compen
sated by means of a shunt containing a standard element, and the
galvanometer brought back to zero. If, then, the electromagnet is
excited with a very powerful current, a permanent deflexion is
observed in the galvanometer ; if the magnetizing current is opened,
especially if this be done with a certain rapidity, the galvanometer
returns to zero*.
    I shall publish as soon as possible the results of a special inves
tigation of this phenomenon ; for the present I restrict myself to
indicating in this note the most interesting results hitherto ob
served.
    The current produced by magnetism, and which I shall call gal
vanomagnetic, is independent of the direction and of the intensity
of the primary current. "Whatever be the direction of this, the
galvanomagnetic current, through the bismuth fields hitherto ex
 amined, is in the galvanometer from the magnetized bismuth to the
nonmagnetized one, and in the liquid from the nonmagnetic metal
 to the magnetic one.
    While the primary current varies greatly in intensity and also
in direction, the galvanomagnetic current maintains in general an
 almost constant intensity, and also remains unchanged when the
 primitive current passes through zero in changing its sign.
    The intensity of the galvanomagnetic current depends greatly
 on the state of the surface of the bismuth, and to have regular
 results it is necessary to carefully polish the bismuth wires. To
 give an idea of the magnitude of the electromotive force of the gal
 vanomagnetic current, I may mention that in the various experiments
 hitherto made under good conditions with various wires, and in
 various modifications, it has varied from [ $ \ 0 0 to 24W of a Darnell,
 the magnetic field being produced by a Faraday s apparatus of
 mean size excited by a current of 8 to 12 amperes, and with conical
 poles 7 millim apart.
     With a less powerful magnetizing current the results are smaller ;
 with a circuit of two amperes the galvanomagnetic current is scarcely
 appreciable.
     The direction of the galvanomagnetic current is independent of
 the direction of the field ; its intensity has sometimes varied a
 little when the field was reversed and sometimes remained con
 stant.
     This research was carried out in the Physical Institution of the
  Roman University with the means placed at my disposal.—Jtendi-
  conti delta R. Accademia dei Lincei, January 6, 1889.
     * It is unnecessary to say that the galvanometer was so distant from
  the electromagnet that it was out of the sphere of its influence. It was
  also ascertained that if the circuit was closed when the tube and the
 bismuth wires were excluded, the magnetic field did not produce any
  current.

WHY IRON RAILS WHICH ARE IN USE DO NOT RUST SO RAPIDLY
                  AS UNUSED ONES. BY W. SPRING.
   The fact that iron rails on those sections of a road which are
much travelled over do not rust so rapidly as in those places
which are not travelled over, or, which are kept in store, has been
variously explained but not in a satisfactory manner. According
to the author they rust in consequence of atmospheric moisture
just like other iron. Whenever a train passes over them the rust
previously formed combines under the joint influence of the
pressure and friction to form magnetic oxide of iron ; according to
the author this proctects the iron in consequence of the electrical
polarity which it imparts by making it passive, and thereby pre
serves the rail from further destruction. In confirmation of this
explanation the author pressed ferric hydrate between iron plates
under a pressure of 1000 to 1200 atmospheres. If the ferric
hydrate was dry there was no reaction ; but if the hydrate was
moistened with a few drops of water, then, near the iron, it
became black and adhered to the metal ; the surface of the plates
was visibly attacked, and quantitative analysis showed the presence
of magnetic oxide. The author holds that this is the process
which naturally takes place. On the surface of the rails, where
the wheels pass, he has found magnetic oxide mixed with varying
quantities of ferric oxide, and a small quantity of pure iron.—

EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES ON THE TENSION OF THE VAPOUR
                  OF SOLUTIONS. BY F. M. RAOULT.
   The object of the present research is to investigate how far the
tension of volatile liquids varies when different solids are dissolved
in them. The quantities to be determined are the tensions of the
vapour/ of a pure volatile solvent, and then f, that of the same
solvent containing in solution a known weight of the solid, the
temperature remaining constant.
   Two methods were used—a statical and a dynamical one. The
statical is essentially that of Dalton, and consists in measuring the
depression produced in barometric columns, when equal volumes
of the pure solvent and of the solution are severally introduced.
This method, the details of which are described, gives the most
accurate results.
   The dynamic method is easily applied when the law is known
according to which the vapour-tension of the pure solvent varies
with the temperature. It is sufficient then to boil successively the
solvent and the solution in the same reflux apparatus, and to note
exactly their boiling-points under the atmospheric pressure. In
these conditions the vapour-tension of the boiling solution is given

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             443
by the barometer, that of the pure solvent by a table prepared in
advance.
    It follows, from the researches of Yon Babo, Wiillner, and
others, that the ratio y  f between the vapour-tension of a salt in
aqueous solution and the tension / of pure water is sensibly inde
pendent of the temperature ; the exceptions to this rule are pro
bably due to an incipient dissociation of the salts dissolved.
    The author has investigated whether this holds also for other
solvents, and has found that it does with sufficient nearness.
    The experiments of Von Babo and of Wiillner have shown that
if a number N of molecules of a salt be dissolved in 100 grammes
of water, the vapour-tension undergoes a diminution which, for
the same temperature, is proportional to the number of molecules
dissolved. This is expressed by the formula
                              f-f = K
 where K is a constant depending on the nature of the salt.
    This law only holds if the solutions are very dilute ; for stronger
 solutions the formula should lx> replaced by the following one:
 where N' is the number of molecules of the fixed substance con
 tained in 100 molecules of the mixture. The value of N' is given
 by the formula
                                    100 + N'
     The ratio f—y,^f being what is called the relative diminution of
 vapour-tension of the substance in question, the latter formula may
 be thus expressed in ordinary language. For all solutions of the
  same kind the relative diminution of vapour-tension is proportional
  to the number of molecules of the solid dissolved in 100 molecules of
  the mixture.
     The author cites a series of experiments made with benzoate of
  ethyl, dissolved in ether in proportions varying from 9 to 07 per
  cent., the results of w hich closely agree with those calculated by
  the modified formula.
      The author further found that there is a relation between the
  lowering of the freezing-point and the diminution of the vapour-
  tension of the same solution. For dilute aqueous solutions of the
  same nature and the same concentration, the number which expresses
  the relalivet ension of the vapour is always near the -j-J-jy part of that
  which expresses the lowering of the freezing-point.
      This holds also for other solvents than water ; thus, with ben
   zine the ratio appears to be about 63.

444           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   It thus appears from these researches that :—
   1. Any solid which dissolves in a volatile liquid diminishes the
vapour-tension of this liquid.
   2. In all volatile solvents the molecular diminution of the
vapour-tension due to different compounds in solution approaches
two mean values, which vary with the nature of the solvent, and
one of which, called the normal, is twice that of the other : it is
that which is most frequently produced.
   As determined from a large number of solvents, values are given
for this constant which amount to 0-0104.
   Hence it may be said that even 1 molecule of a solid dissolved in
100 molecides of any volatile solvent diminish the vapour-tension of
the liquid by an almost constant fraction of its value, and near to
0-0104.
   The formula            /-/' = 0.0i04
may be utilized to determine the molecular weight of solid or vola
tile bodies. If P is the weight of a substance dissolved in 100
grammes of a volatile liquid, M' the molecular weight of the
solvent, and M that of the body dissolved, we have
            N =            from which M- = 0-0104 x
                     M                  M'              /—/
   It is thus possible to calculate M when M' is known, and con
versely.
   This method of determining molecular weights is more difficult
to carry out, and is less exact than the cryoscopic method, which
depends on the freezing-point of solutions ; but it may be of great
service in many cases.—Journal de Physique, [2] vol. viii. p. 1.
  ON CHEMICAL ACTION BETWEEN BODIES IN THE SOLID STATE.
                              BY W. SPRING.
   The author mixed copper filings with perfectly dry pulverulent
mercuric chloride, and kept the mixture in closed glass tubes
which he shook from time to time. A very slow decomposition of
the two bodies set in, with the formation of cuprous and mer-
curous chlorides. In like manner there was a decomposition of
dry potassic nitrate with powdered sodic acetate freed from water
of crystallization ; for, after standing for four months in the drying-
vessel, the mass was deliquescent in the air, from which the
presence of potassic acetate may be inferred, since the original
salts are not deliquescent. This reaction takes place much more
rapidly at a high temperature ; for although the melting-point of
the two salts is above 300°, the mixture in question fused in a
water-bath in three hours to a white mass, which was also seen to
be deliquescent in air.—Bull, de VAcad. Hoy. de Beige, vol. xvi.

LII. On the Electromagnetic Effect of Convection-Currents.
   By Prof. Henry A. Rowland, and Cart T. Hutchinson,
   Fellow in Physics, Johns Hopkins University* .
                             [Plate IX.]
THE first to mention the probable existence of an effect of
        this kind was Faraday T, who says :—" If a ball be elec
trified positively in the middle of a room and then be moved
in any direction, effects will bo produced as if a current in
the same direction bad existed." He was led to this conclu
sion by reasoning from the lines of force.
   Maxwell, writing presumably in 1872 or 1873, outlines an
experiment, similar to the one now used, for the proof of this
effect.
   The possibility of the magnetic action of convection-currents
occurred to Professor Rowland in 1868, and is recorded in a
note-book of that date.
   In his first experiments, made in Berlin in 1876, Prof.
Rowland used a horizontal hard rubber disk, coated on both
sides with gold, and revolving between two glass condenser-
plates. Each coating of the disk formed a condenser with
the side of the glass nearer it ; the two sides of the disk were
charged to the same potential. The needle was placed per
pendicular to a radius, above the upper condenser-plate, and
nearly over the edge of the disk. The diameter of the hard
rubber disk was 21 centim., and the speed 61 per second.

446          Messrs. Rowland and Hutchinson on the
   The needle system was entirely protected from direct elec
trostatic effect. On reversing the electrification, deflexions of
from 5 to 7'5 millim. were obtained, after all precautions had
been taken to guard against possible errors. Measurements
were made, and the deflexions as calculated and observed
agreed quite well ; but it was not possible to make the
measurements with as great accuracy as was desired, and
hence the present experiment.
   Helmholtz*, in 1875 and later, carried out some experi
ments bearing on this subject. According to the " potential
theory " of electrodynamics which he wished to test, unclosed
circuits existed. The end of one of these open circuits would
exert an action on a close magnetic or electric circuit. So
the following experiment was made by M. Schiller f, under
his direction.
   A closed steel ring was uniformly magnetized, the magnetic
axis coinciding with the mean circle of the ring. This was
hung by a long fibre and placed in a closed metal case. A
point attached to a Holtz machine was fixed near the box, and
a brush-discharge was kept up from this point. If the point
acted as a current-end, a deflexion would be expected, on the
potential theory. No deflexion was observed, although the
calculated deflexion was 23 scale-divisions. The inference is
that either the potential theory is untrue, or else that there is
no unclosed circuit in this case, i. e. that the convection-
currents completing the circuit have an electromagnetic
effect.
   Schiller's further work, not bearing directly upon con
vection-currents, leads him to the conclusion that all circuits
are closed, and that displacement-currents have an electro
magnetic effect.
   Dr. Lecher is reported to have repeated Professor Rowland's
experiment, with negative results. His paper has not been
found.
   EontgenJ has discovered a similar action ; he rotates a
dielectric disk between the enlarged plates of a horizontal
condenser and gets a deflexion of his needle. He apparently
guards against the possibility of this being due to a charge on
his disk. A calculation of the force he measures shows it to
be almost one eighth of that in the Berlin experiment. His
apparatus is not symmetrically arranged, the disk being much
closer to the upper condenser-plate ; the distances from the
upper and lower plates are 0*14 and0'25 centim. respectively.

           Electromagnetic Effect of Convection-Currents.    447
 He uses a difference of potential corresponding to a spark-
length of 0'3 centim. in air between balls of 2 centiin. dia
meter, t. e. about 33 electrostatic units, equal to the sparking
potential between plane surfaces at 0"26 centim. The disk is
an imperfect conductor, and altogether it does not seem clear,
in spite of the precautions taken, that this is not due to
convection-currents.
   In the Berlin apparatus, as stated above, the needle is
near the edge of the disk ; the magnetic effect produced is
assumed to be proportional to the surface-density multiplied
by the linear velocity ; hence the force will be much greater
at the edge of the disk than near the centre ; but the field will
be more irregular, and so make accurate measurements more
difficult.
   In the present apparatus a uniform field is secured by using
two vertical disks rotating about horizontal axes in the same
line ; the needle system is placed between the disks, opposite
their centres. The disks are in the meridian ; they are gilded
on the faces turned towards the needle. Between the disks
are placed two glass condenser-plates gilded on the surfaces
near the disk ; and between these glasses is the needle. The
whole apparatus is symmetrical about the lower needle of the
astatic system.
   Each disk is surrounded by a gilded hard rubber guard-
plate in order to keep the density of the charge uniform at
the edges. The guard-plates are provided with adjusting-
screws to enable them to be put accurately in the plane of the
disks ; and the glass plates in turn have adjusting-screws for
securing parallelism with the guard-plates. The gluss was
carefully chosen as being nearly plane. Disks, glass plates,
and guard-plates all have radial scratches, to prevent con
duction-currents from circulating around the coatings.
   In the periphery of the disk are set eight brass studs
which penetrate radially for about 5 centim., then turning off
at a right angle run parallel to the axis until they come out
on the surface of the disks. They there make contact with
the gold foil. Metal brushes set in the guard-plate bear on
these studs, and in this way the disks are electrified.

   The needle system is enclosed in the brass tube T, ending
in the larger cylindrical box in which are the' mirror and upper
needle. This is closed in by the conical mouth-piece Q, across
the opening of which is placed a wire grating. The mirror is
shown at M, the upper needle at W and the lower at N. The
system is hung by a fibre-suspension about 30 centim. in
length, protected by a glass tube. The needle-system is
made by fitting two small square blocks of wood on an
aluminium wire ; on two sides of each of the wooden blocks
are cemented small scraps of highly magnetized watch-spring.
The needle thus made is about 1 x 1 x 10 millim.
   The mirror is fixed just below the upper needle, and is read
by a telescope 200 centim. distant. The plane of the mirror is
at an angle of 45° with the plane of the disks for convenience.
The whole is supported by the board 00 attached to a wall-
bracket.
   Two controlling magnets (WW) with their poles turned in
opposite directions are used. By means of the up and down
motion of either magnet, any change in the sensitiveness can
be attained ; and by the motion in azimuth, the zero point is
controlled. The advantage of its use lies iu the extremely
delicate means it affords of changing the sensitiveness, much
more delicate than with a single magnet.
   The bed-plate B is screwed to one end of a table, at the
other end of which a countershaft is placed (fig. 2). This is
run by a electric motor in tbe next room, the belt running
through the open doorway. The motor is 14 metres from the
needle.
   Although the disks aud countershaft were carefully balanced
when first set up, and the table braced and weighted by a heavy
stone slab, yet at tbe speed used, 125 per second, the shaking
of the entire apparatus was considerable ; the needle was so
unsteady that it could not be read. This was seen to be due
to vibrations of the telescope itself aud not to the needle.
To prevent it, each leg of the table on which the telescope
rested was set in a box about 30 centim. deep filled with
sawdust, and a heavy stone slab was placed on top of this
table. This entirely did away with the trouble ; the swing of
the needle was as regular when the apparatus was revolving
as when it was at rest.
   The two hard rubber rings (HR) mentioned above have

        Electromagnetic Effect of Convection-Currents.       449
grooves cut in their peripheries ; in these grooves wires are
wound. These serve as a galvanometer for determining the
needle-constant. When not in use they are held in the
position shown in the figure, but when it is desired to deter
mine the needle-constant they are slipped on the shoulders
(AAA A) and pushed up in contact with the back of the disks.
Each has two turns : this arrangement will be referred to as
the disk-galvanometer.
   If a known current is sent through the disk-galvanometer,
and the geometrical constant bo known, the part of the con
stant depending on the field and needle is determined.
   The current is measured by a sine-galvanometer, placed in
another part of the room. To determine H at the sine-gal
vanometer a metre brass circle is put around the sine-galva
nometer, and the needle of the latter used as the needle of the
tangent-galvanometer thus made. Using this tangent-gal
vanometer in connexion with a Weber electrodynamometer,
H at the sine-galvanometer is measured.
   The charging was by a Holtz machine connected to a
battery of six gallon Leyden jars. These latter are in circuit
with a reversing-key, an electrostatic gauge, and the disks.
   The potential was measured by a large absolute electro
meter ; all previous observers have used spark- length between
balls, with Thomson's formula. Greater accuracy is claimed
for this work, largely on this account.
   In this instrument the movable plate is at one end of a
balance-arm, from the other end of which hangs, on knife-
edges, a balance-pan. This movable plate is surrounded by
a guard-ring.
   The lower plate is fixed by an insulating rod to a metal
stem, which slides up and down in guides. The distances are
read off on a scale on the metal stem. The zero reading is
got by inserting a piece of plane parallel glass whose thick
ness has been measured. The lower plate and guard-ring
 have a diameter of 35 centim., and the movable disk a dia
 meter of 10 centim.
   The routine of the observations was as follows :—A deter
 mination of H and the needle-constant (y9) was first made.
 The electrostatic gauge was then set at a certain point, and
 readings of difference of potential were taken. The disks
 were now started, electrified, and a series of three elongations
 of the needle taken ; the electrification reversed and three
 more elongations taken, &c.
    About every five minutes speed-readings had to be noted,
 and at each reversal it was necessary to replenish the charge
 in order to keep the gauge-arm just at the mark. In this way

450        Messrs. Rowland and Hutchinson on the
a " series " of readings consisting of about 25 reversals was
made. After the series, electrometer readings were again
taken; the conditions were then changed in some way, and
another series begun.
   The circumstances to be changed are :—distance of disks
from needle ; distance of glass plates from needle ; electrifi
cation ; and direction of rotation.
   The calculation of the deflexion is based on the assumption
that the magnetic effect of a rotating charge is proportional
to the quantity of electricity passing any point per second,
just as with a conduction-current. Below are the formula;
used.

   As soon as the attempt was made to electrify the appa
ratus, difficulties of insulation were met with. The charged
system was quite extensive, and the opportunity for leakage

          Electromagnetic Effect of Convection-Currents.        455
was abundant ; in addition, the winter here has been very
damp. Most of the trouble of this kind has been due to
the glass in the apparatus ; in no case where glass was used
as an insuLitor has it proved satisfactory, not even when the
air was dry. First, the stand with glass legs, on which the
Leyden-jar battery was placed, was found to furnish an
excellent earth-connexion.
    Paraffin blocks interposed stopped this. The reversing-
key had three glass rods in it, all of which were found to
leak ; six different specimens of glass, some bought par
ticularly for this as insulating glass, were all found to allow
great leakage. Shellacing had no effect. Hard rubber was
finally substituted for glass ; and after that the key insulated
 very well, even in damp weather.
     On charging the glass plates, the disks being earthed,
 it seemed almost as it' there was a direct earth-connexion, so
 rapid was the fall of the charge. This was not regarded at
 the time, as the plates were always kept earthed ; but later,
when it became necessary to charge the plates, the insulation
 had to be made good.
     Investigation showed that this was caused by leakage
 directly through the substance of the glass to the brass back-
 pieces (H H). Hard rubber pieces were substituted, and the
 trouble was entirely removed.
     There was at first a deflexion in reversing the electrification
 while the disks were at rest. This was of course due to direct
 electrostatic effect ; but it was not for some time clear where
 the point of weakness in the electrostatic screen lay. It was
 found to be the faulty contact between the tinfoil covering of
 the glass tube and the brass collar ; the brass had been
 lacquered. After this was corrected there was never again
 any deflexion on reversing the charge, although the pre
 caution was taken of testing it every day or so.
     The currents induced in the axle by the rotation caused no
  inconvenience ; if the disks are rotated in the same direction
  their effect is added, while the effect of the axles is in opposite
  directions. Even when the disks were rotated oppositely, the
  deflexion due to the axles was only 3 or 4 cm., and remained
  perfectly constant.
      On running the disks, unelectrified, without the glass plates
  between them and the needle, a deflexion of 4 or 5 cm. was
  noticed. This was perfectly steady deflexion, and could
  easily bo shown to be due to the presence of the plate, as it
  ceased when the plates were replaced.
      This was very troublesome for a time, especially as the
   presence of a brass plate in place of the glass was found to

456          Messrs. Rowland and Hutchinson on the
diminish the deflexion, but did not bring the needle back to
zero as the glasses did. On looking at the figure (Plate IX.
fig. 1) it will be seen that there is a brass ping (I) closing the
bottom of the tube in which the needle is placed. The rapid
rotation of the disks caused a very appreciable exhaustion at
the centre, and consequently a steady stream of air was sucked
down the tube through the open mouthpiece, and out through
the imperfect connexion of the plug. Air-currents were not
at first suspected, as the deflexion was so very steady. The
brass plate used was smaller than the glass, and hence did not
completely shield the tube.
   After the brass back-pieces (H H) bad been taken out, and
a hard rubber substituted, it was found that with one direction
of rotation the needle was extremely unsteady ; it would ran
up the scale for several centimetres, stop suddenly, Ac—
evidently a forced vibration. This was traced to air-currents
also. Now, the air blew into the open mouth of the cone.
The apparatus had been run for some months with this open,
and not the slightest irregularity had been seen. But the
hard rubber pieces were very much larger than the brass ones
which were removed ; they filled up the lower space to a
greater extent, and deflected the air upwards more than
before, causing the unsteadiness. With the opposite rotation
the air was thrown down instead of lip, and consequently
did not affect the needle.
   The first systematic observations were made in January
1889, with the disks charged and plates earthed. The de
flexion on reversing was got without difficulty, and it was in
the direction to be expected ; that is, with positive electrifica
tion, the effect was equivalent to a current in the direction of
motion of the disk. A number of series were taken in the
next two months; they agreed among themselves well
enough, but did not follow the law assumed. The deviation
can best be explained in this way :—The equations above show
                                             -= D
that for a fixed position of the disks A a a N  — cc N
                                                     —.If then, N
and ji being constant, the condenser plates are moved up to
the disk, step by step, thus varying e, and D be changed at
the same time so as to keep D/e oc a, a constant, the deflexions
should be constant,
    Such was not found to be the case ; the deflexions were
directly proportioned to e instead of being constant : that
is, with greater difference of potential, the deflexions were
greater, although the surface-density remained constant.
Finally this was found to be due to a charge on the back
 surface of the gold coating. The end of the axle comes

         Electromagnetic Effect of Convection-Currents.       457
nearly up to the surface of the disk and taken with all the
brass work must form a condenser of a certain capacity with
the inner face of the gold foil.
    This made a change necessary in the method of working ;
the disks had to be earthed and the glasses charged. This
was done ; but now the deflexions were found always to be
greater with positive rotation (Zenith, North, Nadir, South)
then with negative.
    It was considered possible that the brushes might have
something to do with this, so they were taken off". Earth
connexion with the disk was made by drilling through to the
surface of the disk in the line of the axle and setting in a
screw, which came flush with the surface and also made con
tact with the axle ; this, however, made no difference, the
deflexions for negative rotation were always smaller.
    Table I. gives the results of a number of observations.
All were taken with the plates charged and the disks earthed
by means of the axle.
    The meaning of the letters has been given ; 1//S is directly
proportioned to the needle sensitiveness.

   The deflexions are about the same as those obtained in the
Berlin experiments —5 to 8 millim. on reversing. The force
measured then was 1/50000 H ; now it is 1/125000 H. The
sensitiveness of the needle in the two cases was almost the
same. In the former experiment a force of 3 x 10" 7 deflected
the needle V of arc ; the corresponding number now is
2"7 x 10-7, slightly more sensitive. The scale distances were
110 and 200 centim. respectively. So this experiment gives
about the same scale-deflexion at twice the distance with a force
140 as great. The agreement between the two is seen to
be quite good.
   The observations, except Nos. 1, 2, 15, and 18 given above,
were taken in pairs—first one direction of rotation and the
other immediately afterwards, everything except the rotation
being kept constant.
   The table shows that, in every case except one, the de
flexion for negative rotation is appreciably smaller than the
corresponding positive.
   The difference is too great to be due to accidental errors
in the readings, as the following table, giving the successive
deflexions in the case of #13 and #14 will show.

   This is a fair example of the way the deflexions run. As a
further illustration of this take $17 and #18 ; these two are
identical in arrangement, but the direction of rotation is in
one case got by crossing the belts from the countershaft to
the disks and leaving the main bolt straight ; in the other the
main belt is crossed while the auxiliary belts are straight.
The deflexions are the same. This, too, shows that the
difference cannot be due to any effect of the countershaft.
The cause of this has not yet been explained. The work is
to be continued with this and also with new apparatus, mado
like the Berlin apparatus, but with the disk much larger, 30
centiin. in diameter ; at least double the speed then obtained
will be used. This ought to give deflexions on reversal of
1*5 to 1*7 centim.
   The values of V do not agree so well as might be looked
for ; but when, in addition to the numerous difficulties already
mentioned, the smallness of the deflexion is considered, and
the possibility of the needle being affected by currents or
magnets in other portions of the laboratory, so far away as
not to be guarded against, and which might well be changed
between the time of taking the observation and the deter
mination of the needle-constant, and, Anally, that a disturb
ing cause of some kind is still undoubtedly present, the
agreement is seen to be as good as could justly be expected.

   There seems to be a misunderstanding in certain quartern
as to the nature of the deflexion obtained in Prof. Rowland's
first experiment. The paper reads :—" The swing of the
needle on reversing the electrification was about 10 to 15 mm.,
and therefore the point of equilibrium was altered 5 to
7*5 mm." This has been construed to mean that the deflexion
was merely a throw, and that no continuous deflexion was
obtained. This is entirely erroneous; there was always a
continuous deflexion. The throw was read merely because
the needle was always more or less unsteady, and better
results could be got by seizing a favourable moment when
the needle was quiet and reading the throw, than by attempt
ing to take the successive elongations, or waiting for the
needle to come to rest. In the experiment described above
the needle was very steady and no such trouble was

was kept up ; on reversal, it would move off to a new and
perfectly definite position about 6 to 7 mm. away, and remain

LIII. On the Character of the Complete Radiation at a given
   Temperature. By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. U.S., Professor of
   Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution*.
BY complete radiation is here meant the radiation which
        would ultimately establish itself in an enclosure, whose
walls are impervious, and are maintained at a uniform tem
perature. It was proved by Stewart and Kirchhoff that this
radiation is definite, not only in the aggregate, but also in its
various parts ; so that the energy radiated with wave-fre
quencies between n and n + dn may be expressed by
                                 F(n)dn,                                (1)
where, for a given temperature, F(n) is a definite function
of n. The reservation implied in the word ultimately is ne
cessary in order to exclude radiation due to phosphorescence
or to chemical action within the enclosure. The radiation
commonly characterized, so far at any rate as its visible ele
ments are concerned, by the term white, is supposed to be
approximately similar to the complete radiation at a certain
very high temperature.
   As remarked by Kirchhoff, the function F, being indepen
dent of the properties of any particular kind of matter, is
likely to be of a simple form ; and speculations have naturally
not been wanting. Within the last two years the subject has
been considered by W. Michelsont and by H. F.Weber}
The former, on the basis of an a priori argument of a not
very convincing character, arrives at the conclusion that at
temperature 6 the radiation between the limits of wave-length
\ and \ + c?X may be expressed
                   Ikd\=B0-if(0)e~£1\-*r-'d\.                ...        (2)
According to Stephan the total radiation is proportional to 0*.

(4) merely by the omission of the factor n4, thus correspond
ing to p= — 1 in (2) ; so that
                          F{n)dn = Ae—"dn                               (5)
The agreement between (5) and the measurements by Langley
of the radiation at 178° C. is considered by Weber to be
sufficiently good.
    In contemplating such a formula as (5), it is impossible to
refrain from asking in what sense we must interpret it in
accordance with the principles of the Undulatory Theory,
and whether we can form any distinct conception of the cha
racter of the vibration indicated by it. My object in the
present paper is to offer some tentative suggestions towards
the elucidation of these questions.
    The first remark that I would m;ike is that the formula
must not be taken too literally. If there is one thing more
certain than another, it is that a definite wave-frequency
implies an infinite and unbroken succession of waves*. A
good illustration is afforded by intermittent vibrations, as
when a sound itself constituting a pure tone is heard through
a channel which is periodically opened and closed. Such an
intermittent vibration may be represented byt
                    2(1 + cos 27rm<) cos 2imt,                           (6)
 where n is the frequency of the original vibration, and m the
frequency of intermittence. By ordinary trigonometrical
transformation (6) may be written
          2 cos 27rnf+ cos 27r(n + »<)<+ cos 2-rr(n—m)t ; . (7)

462          Lord Rayleigh on the Character of the
which shows that in this case the intermittent vibration is
equivalent to three simple vibrations of frequencies n, n + tn,
n — m.
   In order to distinguish wave-frequencies, whose difference
is small, a correspondingly long series of waves is necessary ;
and of no finite train of irregular vibrations can it be said
that waves of a certain frequency are present, and waves of a
frequency infinitely little different therefrom absent Neither
can the. proportions, in which the two are present be assigned.
In professing to assign these proportions, (5) and similar
 formulae make assertions not directly supported by experi
 ment. In a sense all the formula? of mathematical physics
 are in this predicament ; but here the assertion is of such a
 nature that it could not be tested otherwise than by experi
 ments prolonged over all time.
    In practice it is, not time that brings the limitation, but the
 resolving power of our instruments. In gratings the resolv
 ing power is measured by the product of the total number of
 lines and the order of the spectrum under examination *. It
 will be allowing a good deal for the progress of experiment if
we suppose that in measurements of energy it may be possible
to discriminate wave-lengths (or frequencies) which differ by
 a millionth part. But a million wave-lengths of yellow light
 would occupy only 60 centim., and the waves would pass in
 2 x 10" 8 seconds ! Waves whose frequencies differ by less
 than this are inextricably blended, even though we are at
 liberty to prolong our observations to all eternity.
    At any point in the spectrum of a hot body there are,
 therefore, mingled waves of various frequencies lying within
 narrow limits. The resultant for any very short interval vf
 time may be identified with a simple train, whose amplitude
 and phase, depending as they do upon the relative phases of
 the components, must be regarded as matters of chance.
 The probability of various amplitudes depends upon the
 principles explained in a former communication, " On the
 Resultant of a large number of Vibrations of the same Pitch
 and of Arbitrary Phase. "f After an interval of time com
 parable with 10~9 second the amplitude is again practically a
 matter of chance; so that during the smallest interval of
 time of which our senses or our instruments could take cog
nizance, there are an immense number of independent com
 binations. But, under these circumstances, as was shown in
the place referred to, we have to do merely with the sum of
 the individual intensities.

    In his excellent memoir, Sur le mouvement lumineux *, M.
Gouy suggests that the nature of white light may be best
understood by assimilating it to a sequence of entirely irre
gular impulses. It was by means of this idea that Young t
explained the action of gratings ; and although J. Herschel %
took exception, there is no doubt that the method is perfectly
sound. The question that I wish to raise is whether it is
possible to define the kind of impulse of which an irregular
sequence would represent the complete radiation of any
temperature.
    The first thing to be observed is that it will not do to
supposo the impulses themselves to be arbitrary. In proof
of this it may be sufficient to point out that in that case there
would be no room for distinguishing the radiations of various
temperatures. If the velocity at every point were arbitrary,
that is independent of the velocity at neighbouring points
however close, the radiation could have no special relation to
any finite wave-length or frequency. In order to avoid this
discontinuity we must suppose that the velocities at neigh
bouring points are determined by the same causes, so that it
is only when the interval exceeds a certain amount that the
velocities become independent of one another. This inde
pendence enters gradually. When the interval is very small,
the velocities are the same. As the interval increases, the
arbitrary element begins to assert itself. At a moderate dis
tance the velocity at the second point is determined in p:irt
by agreement with the first, and in part independently. With
augmenting distance the arbitrary part gains in importance
until at last the common element is sensibly excluded § .
   * Journ. de Physique, 1880, p. 364. I observe that M. Gouy had an
ticipated me (Enc: Brit. xxiv. p. 425) in the remark that the production
of a large number of interference-bands from originally white light is a
proof of the resolving power of the .spectroscope, and not of the regularity
of the white light. It would be instructive if tome one of the contrary
opinion would explain what he means by regular white light. The
phrase certainly appears to me to be without meaning—what Clifford
would have called nonsense.

   § The following may serve as an illustration. Out of a very large
number of men (say an army) let a regiment of 1000 be chosen by lot,
and let the deviation of the mean height of the regiment from that of
the army be exhibited as the ordinate ot a curve. If a second set of 1000
be chosen by lot, the new ordinate will bear no relation to the old. But
if at each step but one man of the regiment be eliminated by lot, and
 one successor De chosen in the same way, the new ordinate will be almost
the same as the old one, and not until after a laige number of steps (of
 the order of 1000) will the new ordinate become sensibly independent.

    Now this is precisely the condition of things that would
result from the arbitrary distribution of a large number of
impulses, in each of which the medium is disturbed according
to a defined law. A simple case would be to suppose that
each impulse is confined to a narrow region of given width,
and within that region communicates a constant velocity*.
An arbitrary distribution of such impulses over the whole
 length would produce a disturbance having, in many respects,
 the character we wish. But it is easy to see that this par
 ticular kind of impulse will not answer all requirements. For
 in the result of each impulse, and therefore in the aggregate
 of all the impulses, those wave-lengths would be excluded,
 which are submultiples of the length of the impulse. The
 objection could be met by combining impulses of different
 lengths ; but then the whole question would be again open,
 turning upon the proportions in which the various impulses
 were introduced. What I propose here to inquire is whether
 any definite type can be suggested such th.it an arbitrary
 aggregation of them will represent complete radiation. It
 will be evident that in the definition of the type a constant
 factor may be left arbitrary. In other words, the impulses
 need only to be similar, and not necessarily to be equal.
     Probably the simplest type of impulse, <f>(x), that could at
 all meet the requirements of the case is that with which we
  are familiar in the theory of errors, viz.
                             £(*)=<r^                                   (8)
  It is everywhere finite, vanishes at an infinite distance, and is
  free from discontinuities. A single impulse of this type may
  be supposed to be the resultant of a very large number of
  localized infinitesimal simultaneous impulses, all aimed at a
  single point (,r=0), but liable to deviate from it owing to
  accidental causes. I do not at present attempt any physical
  justification of this point of view, but merely note the mathe
  matical fact. The next step is to resolve the disturbance (8)
  into its elements in accordance with Fourier's theorem. We
  have
  treated as infinitesimal), the resulting curve will have the required pro
  perty, and would exhibit a possible form for complete radiation. It
  seems not unlikely that the law is here the same as that obtained below
  on the basis of (8).

could be assigned. And if the value of n were changed, by
however little, the resultant would again bo indeterminate.
Within tho smallest assignable range of n there is room for an
infinite number of independent combinations. We are thus
concerned only with an average, and tho intensity of each
component may be taken to be proportional to tho total
number of impulses (if equal) without regard to their phase-
relations. In the aggregate vibration, the law according to
which the energy is distributed is still for all practical pur
poses that expressed by (5).
   If we decompose each impulse (8) in the manner explained,
we may regard the whole disturbance as arising from an
infinite number of simultaneous elementary impulses. These
elementary impulses are distributed not entirely at random ;
for they may bo arranged in groups such that the members of
each group are of the same sign, .and are, as it wero, aimed at
the same point under a law of error ; while the different
groups are without relation, except that the law of error is
the same for all. It is obviously not essential that the
different groups should deliver their blows simultaneously.
Further, it would have come to the same thing had we
supposed all tho impulses to be delivered at the same point

in space, but to be distributed in time according to a similar
law. In comparing the radiations at various temperatures,
 we should have to suppose that, as the temperature rises, not
 only does the total number of elementary impulses (of given
 magnitude) increase, but also the accuracy of aim of each
 group.
    We have thus determined a kind of impulse such that an
 arbitrary aggregation of them will represent complete radia
 tion according to Weber's law (5). One feature of this law
 is that F(n) approaches a finite limit as n decreases. In this
 respect W. Michelson's special law (4) differs widely ; for,
 according to it, F(n) vanishes with n. This evanescence of
 F(n) implies that the integrated value of each of our com
 ponent impulses is zero. If we wish to inquire further into
 the law of the impulse, we have to determine ^(ar) so that

    Other proposed forms for /(«), such as those included
 in (2), might be treated in a similar way ; but the above
 examples may suffice. The simplicity of (8) compared, e. g.,
with (25), may be regarded as an argument in its favour.
 But we do not know enough of the mechanism of radiation
to draw any confident conclusion. What we most require at
present is more complete data from experiment, such as have
been promised by Prof. Langley. As regards the radiation
of very low frequency, a question may arise as to whether it
is included in our present measurements. Some authorities
have favoured the view that, when the frequency is suffi
ciently diminished, all kinds of matter become transparent ;
but the electric theory seems to point in the opposite direction.

In comparing any theoretical formula with experiment, we
must not forget that what we learn directly from the latter is
the difference of radiations at two temperatures.
    One more remark in conclusion. If the complete radiation
for a given temperature be represented by (5), it follows that
temperature may be defined by the value of a. The contrary
would imply that the law of distribution is the same at all
temperatures, and would be inconsistent with ordinary obser
vation respecting " red " and " white heats." Now the
dimensions of a are those of a time ; so that temperature may
be defined by a time, or (through the velocity of propagation)
by a line. Thus in Prof. Langley's curves, which represent
 the distribution of energy in a diffraction spectrum, the wave
length corresponding to the maximum ordinate may be
regarded as a linear specification of the temperature to which
the curve relates.

LIV. On an Electrostatic Field produced by varying Magnetic
               Induction. By Dr. Oliver Lodge*.
IN common no doubt with many others, I have long wished
       to find some connexion between static electricity and
magnetism. My early notions in this direction were such
ideas as the following :—
    (1) To spin a long bar-magnet on its axis, suspending in
its field a sort of quadrant-electrometer needle charged oppo
sitely at either end, and to look for a deflexion. The iron
core of an electromagnet was supposed to serve.
    (2) To construct a cylindrical or drum-shaped horseshoe-
magnet like two iron wheels joined at the nave, and wound
with wire there ; to spin this on its axis and suspend a charged
pith-ball between the two rims t.
    (3) To nse a varying magnet instead of a moving one
[quite probably this was suggested by Prof. Fitzgerald in a
conversation I had with him some ten years back] ; for
instance, to suspend a charged gold leaf between the edges
of the pole-pieces of an electromagnet, and watch it through a
microscope when the exciting current is started or stopped.
    Many other varieties of the experiment are in my note
books, but these are enough to show the idea.
   * Communicated by the Physical Society : read May 11, 1889.
   t I find, on reference to Dr. S. P. Thompson's book, that one may
describe this arrangement as the field-magnet of a Mordey dynamo.

470      .   ' Dr. 0. Lod ge on an Electrostatic Field
    The importance of the experiment seemed to me (rightly or
wrongly) to lie in a possible crucial criterion between Max
 well's theory and some of the contemporary German theories ;
because it seemed to deal with something less than an open
circuit, viz. no circuit at all.
    It also struck me as a sort of converse experiment to that
which Prof. Rowland has recently and so successfully carried
out : the classical experiment of deflecting a magnetic needle
by a rotating charged disk.
    This can hardly be considered a connexion between electro
 statics and magnetism, because a static charge in motion, if
not a contradiction in terms, is essentially a current ; and
 what the experiment proves is the truth of Maxwell's view
that all electricity in motion, no matter whether by conduction,
displacement, or convection, is a true current, and exerts mag
netic effects. I should rather say that Rowland's experiment
 proves the truth of this view of Maxwell so far as convection
is concerned. The question of displacement is a ticklish one
just now, upon which I shall be safer to be silent*.
    But, now, think of a charged gold leaf hanging between the
poles of a magnet. If the gold leaf move it constitutes a
current, and therefore at once feels a force urging the current
 (i. e. the line of motion) across the lines of force in the
orthodox way. Instead of supposing the gold leaf to move,
let the magnet move. The same thing will happen, because
the relative motion is the same as before. (If absolute motion
of the static charge through sether is essential, then this last
statement falls flat and may possibly be false.)
    If this force were observed, it would be a connexion between
magnetism and a static charge, provided any motion of the
charged body due to the earth's motion in its orbit were shown
to be inoperative or unessential.
    Or, instead of moving the magnet, let its strength be varied j
lines of force pass by the charged body, unless it is symmetri
cally situated, in this case as in the other ; and hence the
effect may naturally be expected to be the same in either
case.
    The experiment I wished to try was therefore not exactly a
converse of the Rowland experiment, but was closely related
to it.
    Two years ago my friend Mr. A. P. Chattock came to
   * I say this with reference to what went on at Bath, not with reference
to anything that has happened since. This paper was written two or three
months ago, before I had heard anything of a communication from Dr. S.
P. Thompson to the Royal Society.

           produced by varying Magnetic Induction.           471
Liverpool to act as Demonstrator, and I found him imbued
with similar notions, and also with more practical ideas for
carrying them out. Especially was he convinced of the fact
that an actual magnetic field in which to suspend the charged
body was entirely superfluous, but that varying magnetic
induction in a region near the charged body would be equally
effective and easier to manage. He wished to use, in fact, a
closed magnetic circuit with all its lines enwrapped in itself,
and to hang the charged body near but outside the circuit, so
that no lines of magnetic force really ever passed through the
charge, at least when the magnetic induction was steady.
But when the magnetic induction was varied, say by reversing
a magnetizing current round the closed magnetic circuit or
ring solenoid, Mr. Chattock pictured lines flashing past the
charged body in enormous numbers and producing the desired
effect.
   I am bound to say that the idea of the closed magnetic
circuit was not natural to me at first, and I resisted the views
of the inventor of the magnetic potentiometer for the best part
of a week. At the end of that time my conversion had taken
place ; and from that time to this some sort of closed magnetic
circuit, with one or other form of charged body inside it, has
been set up in my laboratory and experiments made with it
from time to time.
   The theory of the effect I have observed it may be useful
just to write down in the most elementary manner.
   The magnetic induction in a solenoid being I, the E.M.F.
induced in any complete circuit round it, when I changes, is
If an E.M.F. act on a statically charged body at a distance r
from centre of solenoid, the work done in driving it once
round a circle is
                         eQ=27irF,                            (2)
where F is the mechanical force exerted on the charged body.
   Now if the E.M.F. in (2) is the same as in (1), and is caused
by the induction I being either generated or destroyed, it will
only last a very short time, and we must therefore consider
what is the whole impulse of the force during the time it lasts,
viz.

472          Dr. 0. Lodge on an Electrostatic Field
And this is the momentum generated whenever the sole-
noidal magnetism is generated or destroyed. This therefore,
or some simple multiple of it, is what is observed in the ex
periment.
   Now in calculating out a numerical value for this we shall
write
                1= ^Wn, ^* =fiC times a leDgth,
and
               Q = SV         = KV times a length.
Hence in the product IQ occurs the product /iK, and this is
the reciprocal of the square of the velocity of light.
   This amply accounts for the smallness of the observed effect.
By various devices the geometrical parts of I and Q can
be increased somewhat to make the observation more easy,
but nothing can get over the fact that the velocity of light
squared occurs in the denominator of the expression.
   To return to the account of experiments devoted to finding
this effect. If there is any importance in the result, and I
hope there is, though I sometimes fear there is not, much of
the credit belongs to Mr. Chattock. The only reason why
this is not a joint paper is because he had left the laboratory
before a result was obtained.
   I must mention also that he showed me, somewhere about
this same time, an ingenious paper read before the Society of
Telegraph Engineers some two or three years back by Mr.
George Forbes, in which that gentleman, making free use of
the analogy between a magnetic circuit and a voltaic circuit,
predicted almost the precise arrangement which we have found
successful, as a magnetic analogue of a tangent-galvanometer.
    Some other predictions were also made on the strength of
the same analogy ; but I have made no experiments like them
at present.
   The experiment of which I have to speak may be described
as follows : —You buy at a shop a large hank of iron wire
weighing 28 lbs. or so : you cover it with tape and wind it
over with No. 14 copper wire connected to a reversing-key
and storage battery. At the centre of the ring you place a
glass vessel in which are delicately suspended two oppositely-
charged very light conductors, made, for instance, of aluminium
foil, connected to each other and to a mirror by a shellac arm.
You then work the reversing-key by hand in unison with the
natural period of vibration of the suspended arm, so as to keep
on reversing the magnetism in the ring, and you hope thus

            produced by varying Magnetic Induction.          473
to get tip a microscopic swing in the arm or to check an
already existing one.
   Under these circumstances a result may very well be observed ;
but it will be certainly due to a spurious cause unless far more
elaborate precautions are taken.
   For a whole day, last Christmas twelvemonth, I got the
most beautifully consistent results. The deflexion reversed
with the current, with the sign of the static charge, and every
thing just as it ought. But before jumping to any conclusion
the precaution was taken of going through the operations
with the key while one end of the wire was disconnected and
the battery circuit therefore not complete. The effect was
much stronger.
   The whole thing was a mere electrostatic effect due to the
action of the slope of potential in the conducting-wire on the
very sensitive electrometer-like needle.
   To get over this effect was very troublesome and seemed
impossible. A number of obvious things were tried, such as
cutting the wire in the middle and adjusting its two halves
symmetrically ; putting the middle of the wire to earth, &c.
Putting a carefully selected portion of the wire to earth
did, indeed, get over the difficulty ; but so sensitive was the
arrangement that a variation of an inch in the position of the
earth-contact on the length of the wire made a perceptible
difference. The effect seemed altogether larger than what
we wanted to observe ; so, at length, I had the whole glass
box containing the charged needle coated with tinfoil.
   The result was a beautiful steadiness. The slope of potential
was utterly cut off and not a trace of oscillation could be
detected on open circuit.
    But then neither could anything be detected when the
circuit was closed. If the needle were at rest, it remained at
rest; and if it were in motion, its motion subsided without the
least reference to what one happened to be doing with the key.
I came sorrowfully to the conclusion that in cutting off the
electrostatic disturbance we had neutralized the thing we
were looking for.
    But on writing this view to Mr. Chattock, I found he did
not agree with it. His view was that the magnetic lines
had to get through the space in the centre of the coil, and
that, though a sheet of tinfoil might delay them momentarily,
it could make no difference in the end; since the time required
 for the reversal of the split-up mass of iron was far less than
that of a semi-oscillation of the needle.
    Not feeling absolutely sure either way, I determined, at

474           Dr. O. Lodge on an Electrostatic Field
any rate, to try a more sensitive arrangement. Hitherto the
suspending-fibre had been horizontal, and the time of oscil
lation fairly quick, the mirror, as it were, lying on its back,
and the light^beam reflected down to it by a 9having-glass.
   All this was now changed. The iron ring was set up ver
tically, and the needle was delicately suspended, care being
taken to keep its moment of inertia very small. The ring
was wound, not all over, but only over a sector of some 45 ,
and this wire-covered portion was then carefully screened by
sheet copper from being able to see the needle and thereby affect
it electrostatically. The copper did not form a closed circuit.
   The needle was again a pair of scraps of aluminium-foil
attached to the ends of a shellac arm holding also a mirror.
The charging "was done after a proof-plane fashion, and the
insulation was pretty good. Asbestos and sulphuric acid kept
the air of the box dry.
   Taking suitable precautions and trying the magnetic ex
periment under the new conditions, with the electrostatic
effect of the wire carefully screened off, but no other part of
the iron ring screened from the needle, an effect was observed,
and it was small. But it, was irreversible.
   I traced it, after a little difficulty, to Foucault currents set
up in the aluminium scraps. One might certainly have ex
pected such currents there ; but I did not expect them to
 matter, except by reason of heat, because the metal is in no
magnetic field—except, indeed, the earth's. However, it must
be that some few stray lines escape from the iron circuit and,
 crossing through the air, affect the currents excited in the
metal by the changing magnetic induction.
   So I had to abandon aluminium, and selected very thin
mica, silvered chemically, and held curved to the proper cur
vature by silk threads. But even in the thin silver film
 Foucault currents could still be detected ; so the film was
scored regularly all over with a needle-point. But though
this diminished the effect to almost nothing, it was still com
parable to what we wanted to observe.
    So I beat about for other conductors, good enough to charge
statically, but bad enough not to have currents induced in
them. At length I hit upon the thin gelatine stuff which is
wrapped round crackers. It was not exactly this, but it was
some variety of gelatine that Davies ultimately used, con
structing it into a pair of little cylinders, say £ inch long by
£ inch in diameter, very light, and only just conducting enough
to receive a charge after they had been in the artificially dried
air of the glass box for some time. The shellac arm and every
thing were made afresh, and as slight and fragile as possible.

            produced by varying Magnetic Induction.            475
   I also proceeded to construct a larger and more carefully
made iron ring, instead of a mere hank as bought. I thought of
making a figure-of-8 ring, winding one loop with wire, and
hanging the needle in the other loop ; but practical difficulties
postponed the adoption of this plan, a circular ring being so.
much easier ; so I went on with the notion of winding the
copper wire only over a sector, and screening that by copper
sheet. To make this ring an enormous quantity of fine iron
wire was procured, and wound for a great part of a month
on a suitable wooden mould in a slow-motion lathe, the wire
being passed through a flame and through a stick of shellac on
its way, so as to roughly insulate its turns, in case we wanted to
employ rapid reversals.
   The winding continued until the wooden mould began to
break down, when it was extracted, all matted together, and.
mounted on a stone pillar standing on rock in the laboratory.:
   Some natural difficulty is found in getting the charged
needle to hang as wished, with its mirror in the right aspect..
Some difficulty is also found in arranging that the stability of
the needle shall not be too much increased by its electric charge,
so that it oscillates violently about some point and is not pro
perly slow and sensitive.
   Another and very tedious difficulty is to arrange so that the
position the needle is willing to take up before and after charge
is nearly the same ; for if the two be very different the spot
of light -will not keep still, but will sail steadily along as the
charge slowly leaks away. To detect small effects the spot of
light must be very still. It was difficult to secure this without
at the same time applying too severe a constraint, either electric
or other, to the needle. It had to be done pretty much by
 selecting carefully the shape to be given to the curved plates
 of the needle, and to the enclosure opposed to them.
    All these difficulties were gradually more or less overcome
 through the patience and skill of my laboratory assistant,
 Mr. Benjamin Davies.
    There remained a few irregular disturbances, some of which
could bo traced to couvection-currents, others to the ordinary
 movements about a building, and others again to the passage
 of London and North-Western trains in their tunnel, some
 150 yards away and 60 feet down, in the sandstone rock.
    The laboratory at Liverpool is very favourably situated as.
 regards shaking. It is a substantial stone building, with
 walls 2 feet thick, on sandstone rock, which is partially isolated
 from the railway by the remains of an old quarry, which has
 been filled with rubble. Street traffic is very distant, and has,
 never been appreciably felt to my knowledge. Students

476          Dr. 0. Lodge on an Electrostatic Field
tramping about in the daytime appear to be the cause of most
of such irregularities as are felt ; but this cause is happily
absent at certain hours of the day (or night), and there remains
literally nothing but the passage of the North-Western trains,
and these are distinctly felt, though only with the most delicate
means. The most serious shaking is during a gale. The
building then certainly quivers.
   To illustrate the unusual steadiness, it may be interesting
to mention that Mr. Chattock rigged up the Cavendish Gravi
tation experiment in my lecture-theatre, taking such precaution
as I naturally suggested about suspending from a ball of lead
hung from the wall by elastic ; and twice I have successfully
exhibited the experiment to a fairly large audience, the first
time very well indeed. Convection-currents are the real
trouble in this experiment, and these can, by elaborate tinfoil
screens, be nearly avoided*.
   After a few preliminary experiments with the new ring and
needle, I began seriously to mistrust the effect of the copper
near the ring. Sheet copper was used to screen off the wire
from the needle, and it was also used all over the outside of
the arrangement to screen off stray electrostatic actions around.
But I fancied I understood now what the effect of such con
 ductors was. The motion of the electricity in them was just
of the same sign as the motion of the electrostatic charge for
•which we were looking ; and if the motion by conduction were
permitted, the reaction of the charge thus momentarily redis
tributed on the conducting metal might just mask the direct
 effect of the same electromotive force on the charged body ;
and would mask it, in so far as it was suitably placed for
masking it.
    Metals do not screen off the magnetic effect of a moving
 electrostatic charge (vide Rowland), but they might screen off
the converse electrostatic effect of a varying magnetic in
duction.
    On the other hand, by arranging a copper conductor so that
 the effect of electric charges induced in it by the E.M.F. should
 assist the direct effect of the E.M.F. on the charged body, then
 no doubt a deflexion might be rendered visible.
    So I led a short wire round the outside of the ring, and
 brought its ends into the box where the needle was, one on
each side of the needle.
   * Since seeing Mr. Boys's beautiful Docket-arrangement for exhibiting
 the same effect at the Royal Society soiiee this week, I am out of conceit
 with this apparatus. Evidently the experiment is going to become a
commonplace of the class-room.

             produced by varying Magnetic Induction.          477
   A distinct and proper deflexion was now observed.
   A wire was then taken 10 times round the ring, and con
nected to a common quadrant electrometer. The deflexion
was easy to see. It could also be just seen with only one turn
of wire.
    This kind of experiment seems likely to furnish a method
of determining "v"; and it ought to be a good method, because
it is v2 which is really measured.
   However, what I had wanted to see was not any effect
assisted by the concentration of a conductor, but a result in free
dielectric. And this at length has been obtained.
    All copper screens and everything of the sort were removed.
The ring was wound with only a few turns of thick wire so
as to reduce the slope of potential needed to propel a cur
rent through it. The wire was wound symmetrically in two
halves, and the far ends were connected to a plug-key, so that
one might work with either closed or open circuit.
    The reversing-key was a quite distinct mercury arrange
ment specially made for strong currents, fixed to a table on
which stood tlie screen for receiving the spot of light, which
was a small disk of translucent paper in a drum of tin plate
mounted on an independent stand. The light of a lamp was
brought on to the mirror independently of this stand by a 45°
looking-glass. Such a screen is handy,because one can follow
the rather erratic spot of light all over the table, wherever it
chooses to take up its temporary abode.
    The middle of the battery was put to earth, so that the
potentials of the two halves of the wire might be equal and
opposite. The needle was then adjusted by trial and error,
its glass box being pushed in and out of the ring, its sus
pending fibre being turned by a tangent screw, &c, until the
electrostatic effect obtained by working the reverser on open
circuit was very small. It could never be got quite zero;
and even when small it would not always remain small for
long.
    However, on now closing the circuit by the plug-key, the
residual electrostatic effect would be certainly largely reduced,
and the wished-for effect might be seen. It was seen ; the
hair-line of the spot of light oscillated over two or three
millimetres when the key was worked in unison with the
vibrating arm. It assisted the residue of the electrostatic
 effect when the charging of the needle was in one direction,
and it neutralized or reversed the residual electrostatic effect
when the charging of the needle was inverted.
    It is this reversal of whatever disturbing effect remained

which I depend upon as a proof of the correctness of the
observation.
                       Added later {May 10).
    More recently Davies has noticed a peculiar disturbance
 when working on open circuit, and when the residual elec
 trostatic effect is very small ; viz., that it is not constant in
 direction. It begins with a kick one way, and then a larger
 motion the other way. By working the reversing-key quickly
 one kind of swing can be got up; by working it slowly, the
 other kind of swing can be got up.
     I do not know the meaning of this effect. It is difficult to
 believe that the fact that the wire is coiled round iron causes
 the electrostatic charging of its ends to be slow ; though that
 is the kind of thing it looks like. More probably it is due to
 some trivial disturbing cause, but the effect is singularly clear
 and persistent.
     To get over the electrostatic effect more completely, and
 still without the use of a screen, a single layer of copper ribbon
 was wound on, in about 10 turns, and its outer turn was put
 to earth.
     Another disturbing effect was now noticed : it reversed
  with the current, and it reversed also when the needle was
  turned through 180°, but it did not reverse when the charge
  was simply reversed ; nor did it cease when the needle was
  uncharged. Moreover it was not altogether temporary ;
  there was a residue permanent. Plainly it was a direct
  magnetic effect.
      On taking a map of the field with iron filings, a considerable
  number of lines of force were found to be leaking across the
  ring, and these would be able to deflect the needle if it had a
   trace of permanent magnetization ; which it is quite likely to
  acquire.
      It was taken out and tested between the poles of a powerful
   magnet—the gelatine was distinctly magnetic, the shellac
   was feebly diamagnetic.
      A number of substances were now tried in order to find
   something sensibly devoid of magnetic properties, and ulti
   mately a paper was found which was barely diamagnetic.
   With this a new needle was constructed. Wire was once
   more wound all over the ring, and its field tested with iron
   filings till hardly any stray lines could be found.
      The mirror was removed, and a small pointer supplied in
   stead, so as to be read with a microscope. And in this way
   the last observations have been made.

    The only disturbance now found was due to heat from
the wire below the glass box containing the needle, and to
get over this Davies rigged up a number of concentric cylin
drical jackets of tin plate round the box containing the needle.
These certainly constituted an electrostatic screen. Never
theless, 1 had hope that though such a screen might diminish
the effect it would not destroy it.
   I had a letter from Davies yesterday saying that a very
minute effect could be seen with the screens all on, and that
it did everything properly as regards reversals. On taking off
one screen it increased. On taking off another it increased
more, but showed signs of superposed spuriousness. On
taking off the third screen the effect was masked by spurious
actions.
   Everything points to the fact, therefore, that we have now
several times observed the true effect, and I entertain practi
cally no doubt of it.
   But inasmuch as some of the observations have been made
so lately, and some even since I left Liverpool this time, I
would not wish the Society to suppose that I regard the
research as finished and complete. I should like to clear up
distinctly the effect of screens.
   I must speak in high praise of the skill and neat-fingeredness
of my laboratory assistant Mr. Davies in carrying out the
rather troublesome requirements which this finnicking re
search has at various times seemed to necessitate.
             LV. Table of Standard Wave-Lengths.
                By Professor H. A. Rowland *.
 IN the ' American Journal of Science ' for March, 1887, and
      the Phil. Mig. for the same date, I have published a
preliminary list of standards as far as could be observed with
the eye, with a few imperfectly observed by photography, the
whole being reduced to Bell's and Peirce's values for absolute
wave-lengths. Mr. Bell has continued his measurements and
 found a slightly greater value for the absolute wave-length of
 the D line, and I have reduced my standards to the new
 values.
    Nearly the whole list has been gone over again, especially
at the ends around the A line and in the ultra-violet. The
 wave-lengths of the ultra-violet were obtained by photographing
   * From the ' Johns Hopkins University Circular ' for May, 1889.

480              Prof. H. A. Rowland's Table of
the coincidence with the lower wave-lengths, a method which
gives them nearly equal weight with those of the visible
spectrum.
   The full set of observations will be published hereafter; but
the present series of standards can be relied on for relative
wave-lengths to '02 division of Angstrom in most cases, though
it is possible some of them may be out more than this amount,
especially in the extreme red.
   As to the absolute wave-length, no further change will be
necessary, provided spectroscopists can agree to use that of
my table, as has been done by many of them.
   By the method of coincidences with the concave grating
the wave-lengths have been interwoven with each other
throughout the whole table, so that no single figure could be
changed without affecting many others in entirely different
portions of the spectrum. The principal difference from the
preliminary table is in the reduction to the new absolute wave
length, by which the wave-lengths are about 1 in 80,000
larger than the preliminary table. I hope this difference will
not be felt by those who have used the old table, because
measurements to less than       division of Angstrom are rare,
the position of the lines of many metals being unknown
to a whole division of Angstrom. As the new map of the
spectrum has been made according to this new table, I see no
further reason for changing the table in the future.
   No attempt has been made to reduce the figures to a vacuum,
as the index of refraction of air is imperfectly known ; but
this should be done where numerical relations of time-period
are desired.
   In the column giving the weight, the primary standards
are marked S and the other numbers give the number of
separate determinations of the wave-length, and thus, to some
extent, the weight.
   Many of these standards are double lines, and some of them
have faint components near them, which makes the accuracy
of setting less. This is especially the case when this com
ponent is an atmospheric line whose intensity changes with
the altitude of the sun. The principal doubles are marked
with d; but the examination has not been completed yet,
especially at the red end of the spectrum.

 LVI. On the Visibility of Faint Interference-Bands. By
    Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S., Professor of Natural Philo
    sophy in the Royal Institution*.
 IN a recent paper on the limit to interference when light
       is radiated from moving molecules t, it was necessary to
 form an estimate of the ratio of illuminations (A) at the darkest
 and brightest parts of a system of bands corresponding to the
 moment when they just cease to be visible from lack of con
 trast. In the comparison of uniformly illuminated surfaces,
 brought well into juxtaposition, A might be as great as "99 X ;
 but in the case of bands, where the transition is gradual, a
 higher degree of contrast between the brightest and darkest
 parts may be expected to be necessary. In order to allow
 lor this, I supposed that A might be estimated at "95, the
 intensity of the light and the angular magnitude of the bands
 being assumed to be suitable. But since widely different
 estimates have been put forward by others, I have thought it

worth while to test the matter with bands that are well under
control.
    In the first experiments light polarized by a Nicol fell upon
a slit, against 'which was held a somewhat stout selenite.
 Direct examination of the slit through an analysing Nicol
 revealed no colour on account of the thickness of the selenite ;
but when a dispersing-prism was added, the resulting spectrum
was marked out into bands, whose brightness and contrast
 depended upon the relative orientations of the Nicols and of
 the selenite. The theory of these bands is well known*. If
 the Nicols bo parallel, and if the principal sections of the

 sion for the brightness is
                           1— sin* 2a sin3^p,
 where p denotes the difference of retardations of the two rays
 to whose interference the bands are due. At the brightest
 place p = 0, and at the darkest sin2£p=l, so that
                            /» = l-sins 2a.
 The bands are thus invisible when a = 0, and increase gra
 dually in distinctness with a. When a = 45°, the darkest
 place is absolutely black t.
    The selenite was mounted upon a divided circle, and the
 observation consisted in finding the two positions, on either
 side of a = 0, at which the bands manifested themselves with
 the desired degree of distinctness. The angular interval
 between the two positions was then taken as representing the
 value of 2a. In order that the bands should be recognizable
 with certainty it was found that 2* must be at least 14°. For
 a distinct and continuous impression 2a= 17°. Corresponding
 to these, we have for 1 — h,
                sin2 14° =-0585,       sin1 17°= -0855.
    In these observations the earliest recognition of the bands
 was somewhat interfered with by a want of smoothness in the
 spectrum due to irregularities in the selenite. Any irregu
 larity, whether of this kind or caused by dust upon the edges
 of the slit, gives rise to horizontal markings in the spectrum
 which distract the eye. In a second set of experiments this
   » See, for example, Ene. Brit. "Wave Theory," § 22.

assuming that bands involving 5 per cent, of the brightness
might still be visible.

 LVII. On the probable Cause of the Displacement of Shore
   lines, an Attempt at a Geological Chronology. By A.
  Blytt.
                               [Plate X.]
                       [Concluded from p. 429.]
THE Trias period has received its name because it shows a
       distinct triple division. It commences with freshwater
and littoral formations, upon which follow formations of
deeper water, and then closes with freshwater and shore-
formations. At its commencement the land was high re
latively to the sea ; as it went on the sea rose higher and
higher ; then the land again began to rise, and at the end of
the period it was again high in relation to the sea. And
these great changes in the situation of the coast-line were no
doubt effected by means of many smaller oscillations.
   But just as it is with the Trias, so is it also with other
geological formations. They commence with littoral forma
tions (there is often a conglomerate at the bottom) ; these are
followed by deeper marine formations, and at the close we
have again shore-formations. The name of Trias would
therefore really apply to all of them. The first person to call
attention to this remarkable triple division of formations
would seem to have been Eaton. It was subsequently dis
cussed by J. S. Newberry in his memoir entitled " Circles of
Deposition in American Sedimentary Rocks " (Proc. Amer.
Assoc. 1873, vol. xxii. p. 185), and Hull (Trans. Geol. Soc.
Glasgow, 1868, iii. pt. 1, p. 39) ; see also A. Geikie, 'Text
book of Geology,' p. 498, where further references to litera
ture will be found. Principal Dawson called these tripartite
periods " cycles," and in his ' Story of the Earth and Man ' he
established the following cycles of this kind :— 1. Cambrian ;
2. Lower Silurian ; 3. Upper Silurian ; 4. Devonian ;
5. Carboniferous; 6. Permian; 7. Trias; 8. Lower Jurassic ;
9. Middle Jurassic ; 10. Upper Jurassic ; 11. Cretaceous ;
and 12. Tertiary*. It appears therefore that these cycles are
periods of long duration ; each of them has certainly lasted
several hundred thousand years. And in the middle of each
cycle the great overflows of the sea have attained their
highest point. The cycles alternate with continental periods.
During the elevation of the land the horizontal position of the
strata was often disturbed, so that the deposits of the new
cycle lie unconformably upon the older ones.
   In this way the development has gone on, at any rate in
the northern hemisphere. Mojsisowics, Suess, and others
    * We shall see hereafter that this formation includes two cycles.

 488                A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
 have pointed out that it has taken place simultaneously in the
 same direction in Europe, Asia, and North America. These
 great changes have taken place over the whole of the northern
 hemisphere, and on both sides of the oceans they have con
 stantly had the same direction. And the same geologists
 have justly insisted that this law is one of the most remark
 able results of geological investigations.
     The development of organic life, as we now know, has
 gone on uninterruptedly from the earliest times. There has
 certainly never been any general destruction, never any com
 pletely new creation. The new has developed from the old
 through transitional forms and in the course of millions of
 years. If we knew all the deposits which have been formed
 it would be impossible to draw any boundaries between geo
 logical formations. One would imperceptibly pass over into
 the other. The boundaries between formations correspond
 with great gaps in the series of beds. In the time which
 intervened between the youngest bed in an older and the
 oldest in a younger cycle, the land in the northern hemi
 sphere lay so high that no marine deposits were formed in the
 parts of the earth's crust which are accessible to our investi
 gations. Nevertheless the development of living forms went
 on its even course. But when, after a long time, the land
 was again submerged, the life in the sea had changed, and
 beds with new fossils were deposited upon the old ones. And
 it is from the animal remains of marine deposits that the form
 ations are determined. Hence the sudden change of fossils
 where a new formation commences is not due to any catas
 trophe, but simply to a shorter or longer interruption in the
 formation of deposits in the parts of the earth which we are
 able to examine. There is no doubt that there are transition-
 beds between formations, but they lie concealed from us at
 the bottom of the sea. It is only in certain strongly plicated
 chains that these beds are upheaved and can be examined.
 Thus in the Alps there are transitional beds between the
 Cretaceous and Tertiary, between the Permian and Trias, &c*
    * "As long ago as 1846, Darwin, in his observations in South America,
showed that certain assemblages of fossils presented a blending of cha
racters which are of Jurassic and Cretaceous age respectively. Since
that date, the .study of the fossil faunas of South Africa, India, Australia,
New Zealand, and the Western Territories of North America has fur
nished an abundance of facts of the same kind, showing that no classifi
cation of geological periods can possibly be of world-wide application "

    If we should attempt to establish geological formations by
the aid of the known remains of terrestrial animals and plants,
the boundaries of these would not coincide with those which
are defined by marine animals *. Thus, to mention an example,
the appearance of Dicotyledons does not coincide with the
boundary of any formation ; but they first appear with a
number of forms in the Upper Cretaceous period (Ceno-
manian).
    From Tertiary times, with the exception of the deposits in
the great mountain-chains, we know only formations of shallow
seas. The Tertiary deposits which correspond to the deep-sea
strata of older formations, and which were deposited further
from the land during that period without their formation being
interfered with by the numerous minor oscillations of the coast
lines, still remain for the most part concealed from us in the sea.
    Land-formations, freshwater and littoral formations such as
we have in abundance in our Tertiary basins, are greatly ex
posed to destruction, for they are more frequently elevated above
 the protecting sea. In the older cycles such formations are
 more rare, probably to a great extent because they have been
 destroyed by denudation. We may therefore conclude that
 the Tertiary formations would much more resemble those of
 the older cycles if our knowledge of them all were equal. Of
 the older cycles we often know especially the deep-water for
 mations, of the youngest chiefly those of more shallow waters.
 At some far distant period the exposed Tertiary formations
 will come to equal those which are now visible from older
  cycles.
     Dawson {I.e. pp. 176-179) expresses the notion that the
  remarkable regularity with which such cycles recur may
  perhaps have a cosmical cause and be conditioned by one
  or another astronomical period. But he seems afterwards to
  reject this idea, because the Palaeozoic cycles have deposits
  which are four or five times as thick as the Mesozoic (I. c.
  p. 195), and we might therefore believe that more time must
  have been occupied in their formation. But, on the other
  hand, he notes that in Palaeozoic times changes in the organic
  world went on much more slowly in relation to the formation of
  deposits than subsequently, so that the fossils extend through
  greater thicknesses of strata than in the thinner, newer cycles.
  If I were to judge from these facts adduced by Dawson, I should
     * u The growth of our knowledge concerning the terrestrial faunas and
  floras of ancient geological periods has constantly forced upon the minds
  of many geologists the necessity of a duplicate classification of geological
  periods, based on the study of marine and terrestrial organisms respec
  tively/ (J. W. Judd, he. ci*. p. 427.)

 490             A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
 come to a different conclusion ; I should regard it as a probable
 supposition that the formation of deposits went on more rapidly
 in Palaeozoic times than later on. If the moon at that time
 were nearer to us and the sidereal day shorter, as Darwin
 thinks, the tidal wave must both have been stronger and have
 acted more frequently than at present. The coasts would be
 destroyed much more rapidly, and the sea would have much
 more material to deposit. A cycle of this period would
 be thicker than the younger cycles, and the fossils would
 extend through a greater thickness of strata than in the latter.
 For I see at present no probable ground for the supposition
 that the development of new species would be accelerated in
 the same degree as the formation of deposits.
    There is therefore reason to assume that it is owing to these
great changes in the form of the earth, occurring at long
intervals, that we can distinguish between geological forma
tions. But such great changes in the distribution of land and
sea must necessarily also bring with them considerable changes
 of climate, and at the same time also changes of living forms.
 I have already, in one of my memoirs, put forward the opinion
that the glacial period had its origin in a change of the dis
tribution of land and sea. If the land gained a great extension
in the middle and higher latitudes, especially if there should
be a formation of bridges across the sea such as the supposed
bridge through the Faroes and Iceland from Scotland to
Greenland, the warm sea-currents would be excluded from the
higher latitudes. The northern seas would then become icy
seas, and where the snowfall is sufficient inland ice would bo
formed. In a memoir entitled " Naturliche Warmwasser-
heizung als Princip der klimatischen Zustande der geolo-
gischen Formationen " (in Abhandl. Senckenb. Gesellsch. vol.
xiii. p. 277 et seqq.), J. Probst (like Sartorius von Walters-
hausen, in his Untersuchuiigen iiber die Klimate der Gegenwart
und Vergangenheit, 1865 J has with justice pointed out the
great importance which warm sea-currents have, and have
had, in rendering milder the climate of high latitudes.
    It has been generally accepted among geologists that during
the older formations animal- and plant-life was more uniform
over the whole earth than at present. But this opinion must
be changed according to recent investigations. Thus J. W.
Judd says (' Nature,' March 1, 1888, pp. 424 et seqq.), with
regard to the oldest fossiliferous deposits (the Cambrian) :—
" Even at that early period there were life-provinces with a
distribution of organisms in space quite analogous to that
which exists at the present day." Examples of geographical
provinces are indicated by him in the Silurian, Trias, Jura,

                the Displacement of Shore-lines.              491
and Cretaceous ; and he says further :—" I believe that the
study of fossils from remote parts of the earth's surface has
abundantly substantiated Prof. Huxley's suggestion that geo
graphical provinces and zones may have been as distinctly
marked in the Palaeozoic epoch as at present."
   Most deposits of ancient times belong to periods in which
the land lay low in relation to the sea, and the difference
between the geographical provinces is far less in the great
depths of the sea than near the shores and on the solid ground.
It has also hitherto been a general theory that the climate in old
times was warmer and more uniform over the whole earth
than now. The further we go back, it is said, the warmer it
was, and this has been regarded as connected with the interior
heat of the earth. The Glacial period was an interruption of
the continuity of its gradual cooling. In periods of over
flow, when the land lay low and the sea had great exten
sion under high latitudes, warm marine currents had much
easier access to the Poles than during continental periods.
As we now know most about the deposits formed during
periods of overflow, and as most of the deposits of continental
periods are either removed bv denudation or concealed under
the sea, it is still probable that the deposits of older cycles
might show less strongly marked geographical provinces, and,
as a rule, bear witness to warmer climates even under high
latitudes. But the great changes in the distribution of land
 and sea compel us to assume that, hand in hand with them,
 occurred a periodical alteration of climate, which has been far
 greater and more radical than the change produced by the
precessional periods.
    Ramsay, Croll, J. Geikie, and others have thought that
they found more or less certain traces of Glacial periods in the
older formations (see, e. g., J. Geikie, ' The Great Ice Age,'
 ed. 2, 1887, pp. 566 et seqq.). Some of these traces seem to
 prove that, at any rate, there have been more Glacial periods
 than the Post-tertiary one. Nevertheless von Riehthofen
 remarks (Fnhrer fur Forschungsreisende, p. 362) that these
 supposed traces of Glacial periods are perhaps only a pheno
 menon of abrasion, and that the action of the waves upon the
 shore could produce conglomerates with striated stones. As
 regards these supposed old Glacial periods, the most certain
 traces (see J. Geikie, /. c.) appear to be furnished by the
 Devonian Sandstone, " Old Red, in England and Scotland,
 by the commencement of the Carboniferous period (Scotland),
 by the Permian conglomerate (England), and by the Eocene
 (Switzerland). The most striking evidence (with striated
 stones) is from the periods when the land had great extension.

492             A. Blytt on theprobable Cause of
   As regards these great overflows, it must be remem
bered that it is only in folded chains and in strongly elevated
regions (e. g. in the Alps, Himalaya, Colorado, &c.) that sea-
formed deposits of the later and latest geological periods occur
at very considerable elevations above the sea. These great
elevations, if we consider them in relation to the whole, can
only be regarded as quite local phenomena. At the time
when the deposits were formed they lay much lower, and
when we now find an alternation of marine and freshwater
deposits in such formations we must not suppose that the sea
rose and sank in relation to the land by thousands of feet at
each oscillation. During the period of formation the shore
line need only have moved up and down a few metres. After
wards the whole system of strata was lifted high above its
original level by locally acting " geotectonic " forces.
   Therefore I assume that even the great overflows do
not depend upon any very considerable displacement of coast
lines in a vertical direction. When there are large flat coun
tries with basin-shaped depressions, a small elevation may
suffice to produce great geographical changes.
   Possibly also these overflows may be due to changes in
the eccentricity of the orbit.
   We will now test our hypothesis by a comparison between
the astronomical periods and the geological series of deposits.
   The curve of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit has been
calculated from Leverrier's formulae by J. Croll (' Climate aud
Time,' 1875, p. 312) for a period of four millions of years ;
three millions of years backward, and 1 million forward from
the present time. The curve is also calculated according
to the same formula? by McFarland (Amer. Journ. Sci. [3]
vol. xx. 1880, p. 105). His calculation extends from 3,250,000
years backward to 1,250,000 years forward in time. He has
calculated with shorter intervals of time than Croll (Croll
50,000, McFarland 10,000 years), which, however, has had
no particular influence in altering the form of the curves.
McFarland has in the same place calculated the curve for the
same period of time from new formulae of Stockwell's. The
two curves, taken in the gross, show a uniform course through
out their length, but as regards the first half Leverrier's curve
is thrown somewhat backward. Stockwell's formulae are con
sidered to be more accurate than Leverrier's.
   Both curves are given by McFarland. If we compare them
together it appears :—
   1. The curves coincide with only a small essential difference
from the present day until 1 million years back.

                  tlie Displacement of Shore-lines.             493
   2. If we omit the portion between 7' and 8' of Leverrier's
curve, Leverrier's and Stockwell's curves are in all essential
points identical also as regards the older part, although the
agreement is not so complete as for the last million of years.
The reason of this is that the calculations are less certain with
regard to the older periods ; when the number of years enters
as a factor in the formula, small errors in the values adopted
for the planets' masses will be enlarged in proportion to the
time, and the result becomes less certain.
   3. A very remarkable consequence proceeds from these cal
culations. The curve repeats itself after the lapse of 1,450,000
years, when it is calculated according to Stockwell's formula?.
In the period of 4£ million years for which McFarland has
calculated it, it repeats itself in this way with remarkable re
gularity a little more than three times. In each of these cycles
there are 16 arcs of the curve. Thus the arcs which in the
accompanying plate (PI. X.) are indicated by 1-16 correspond
with 1'—16' and 1"-16". From calculations which he made
at my request, Mr. Geelmuyden has declared that the course
of the curve will probably be sufficiently correct to bo adopted
with safety as the foundation lor geological considerations, and
that uncertainties in the curve caused by errors in the masses
employed by Stockwell will probably not be of any importance.
   4. The mean value of the eccentricity is least at the limits
of two cycles ; it rises in the first and sinks in the last halt' of
each cycle, and therefore attains its greatest value about the
middle of each cycle. Thus for the first and second of the
calculated cycles and their subdivisions it is as follows :—
       Cycle I.      +3,250,000—2,720,000 years, 0-0304.
                     -=-2,720,000—2,150,000 years, 0-0332.
                     -=-2,150,000—1,810,000 years, 0-0203.
       Cycle II. + 1,810,000— 1,250,000 years, 0-0247.
                     -i- 1,250,000— 700,000 years, 0-0340.
                     -~ 700,000— 350,000 years, 0-0280.
       Cycle III. -~ 350,000 to the present time, 0-0291.
   Now as, according to our hypothesis, the sea-level under
high latitudes will rise and fall with the eccentricity, then it
must not only rise and fall once for each arc of the curve, but
the " mean sea-level " for longer periods must also rise and
fall with the mean value of the eccentricity, and such cycles
as cycles I. and II. must then correspond to two cycles in the
geological sequence of deposits. The limits between the
cycles of the curve must correspond to the periods of denu
dation which divide the geological cycles, and the middle
must correspond to the periods of overflow.

494             A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
   The correctness of the two hypotheses put forward in my
memoir on the Alternation of Strata may, as already indicated,
be tested in one way by the comparison of geological profiles
with the curves of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. A
first attempt was made at the time with the Upper Eocene
and Oligocene beds of the Paris-basin.
    Many difficulties, however, stood in the way of this work.
First and foremost the calculation of the curve is less certain
for distant periods. This difficulty is to a certain extent got
rid of by the circumstance that, as the curves repeat them
selves, it may be less essential.
   Another difficulty is in tho finding of long and accurately
described profiles without gaps in the series of deposits.
Survey-profiles are not sufficient. Geologists often only state
that there are few, some, or many alternations of strata,
without giving definite numbers.
   A third difficulty is the distinguishing between the alterna
tions of deposits which are due to precessions and those which
have their cause in other more transitory and local conditions.
In the case of shore-formations this difficulty is especially
perceptible ; but it has proved to be less than I supposed at
first.
   A fourth difficult}' consists in the determination of the
number of oscillations of coast-lines. The higher a place was
situated, the more rarely was it overflowed ; the lower it lay,
the more rarely was it uplifted above the sea. And move
ments of the solid body of the earth, as might be supposed,
have not been so uniform everywhere as those of the sea,
    A fifth difficulty lies in the finding of perfectly typical
profiles of the stages produced by the oscillations. When the
sea rose and sank slowly the number of marine alternations of
strata will be less, and of land and freshwater formations
greater, the higher the place lay and the shorter the time
 which it remained submerged in the sea during each oscilla
 tion. But this difficulty is of importance only 'when the
 continuous profiles are so short that they do not embrace
 several oscillations.
    In the absence of longer, connected and accurately traced
profiles I have first endeavoured to determine the number of
oscillations of coast-lines as regards the Tertiary and Qua
ternary periods. Each of these oscillations, of which there
have been about 36 from the commencement of the Tertiary
period until now, has, in temporarily submerged localities,
produced an alternation of marine beds with freshwater or
terrestrial formations. To each more considerable oscillation
corresponds a geological " stage." In these "stages" there

                 the Displacement of Shore-lines.                   41)5
is a certain number of alternations. By studying the litera
ture of the Tertiary basins of Europe I have in this way
formed a combined profile, which, as regards the alternations
of stratn, is not yet completed throughout, but which goes
from the commencement of the Tertiary to the present time,
and which I shall now proceed to describe.
   The mode in which profiles can be compared with the
curve to test the correctness of the hypotheses is as follows :—
Each arc in the curve will correspond to an oscillation of the
sea. It is supposed that under high latitudes the coast-lines
move up and down with the curve. Such an oscillation I call
a " geological stage." Each arc will therefore have its corre
sponding oscillation or " stage," and in each " stage " there
will be as many alternations of strata as there are processional
periods in the corresponding arc. When the eccentricity
only sinks inconsiderably between two or more arcs, the arcs
run into one another and form, as it were, ranges with two or
three small summits. We have then "stages" with more
oscillations and more alternations of strata than the ordinary
ones. We shall see examples of this in what follows. We
can draw a line which indicates the boundary between marine
and freshwater formations. This line may be nearly or quite
horizontal. Whether it is to be drawn high or low depends
upon how much above the sea the place was situated where
the deposits were formed at the time when the deposition
took place. The higher it lay, the higher must the line
be drawn. The place may have been so elevated that it
never was submerged. Then the lines are situated higher
than the curve, and all the deposits are freshwater or terres
trial formations. But it may have lain so low that it never
rose above the sea, and all the deposits are marine formations.
 But the line may cut the curve. Then marine formations
alternate with land- and freshwater-formations. The former
 correspond to those arcs of the curve which project above the
line; the latter to those which lie below it. And when there
are no gaps in the series of deposits, there will be as many
alternations of deposits in the marine, freshwater, and terres
trial formations as there are precessional periods in the cor
responding arcs of the curve.
    As a starting-point I will take the profile of the Paris-
 basin*, which I will endeavour to join on to recent times.
 Afterwards I will refer to the lower and middle parts of the
 Eocene period.

496              A, Blytt on the probable Cause of
Soc. Geol. Fr. 1878, pp. 243 et seqq.) shows the following
oscillations and alternations of strata, and may, as regards the
continuous portion, fit into Stockwell's curve, as appears from
the arc-numbers cited for each oscillation : —
   Sables de Guise, marine.
   Calcaire grossier infeVieur et moyen, marine, with 7 alter
      nations.
   Calcaire grossier ; Caillasses k Cerithium, 2 marine alter
      nations, and between them a deposit with freshwater
      shells.
   Calcaire grossier ; Caillasses a Lucina, marine, with 5
      alternations.
   Calcaire grossier : Caillasses a Cardium, marine, with 11
      alternations. Gap in the series.
   Sables de Beauchamp, freshwater and marine, about 4
      alternations. Arcs 14-15.
   Calcaire de St. Ouen, freshwater, 4, above which a marine
      deposit (summit of arc 16), then 6 freshwater alter
      nations. Arcs 15-2'.
   Gypsum, marine, about 11 alternations. Arcs 2'-4'.
   Gypse palustre, freshwater, about 6 alternations. Arc 5'.
   Marne verte, brackish, 2 alternations. Arc 6'.
   Calcaire de Brie, freshwater, 1 alt. Between arcs 6' and T.
   Marne et Mollasse, sables de Fontenaye, marine, 3 alter
      nations. Arc T.
   Meulieres de Montmorency, Calcaire de Beauce (p. p.),
      freshwater. Between arcs 7' and 8'.
   There is only one discrepancy :—Arc 16, the summit of
which should correspond to the marine deposit in the middle
of the Calcaire de St. Ouen, does not go so high that we
should expect an inundation of the sea. But the oscillation
is at any rate also indicated in Stockwell's curve, and the
marine formation consists of a single bed, and is so faintly
marked that it has only recently been recognized.
   Another profile from another place in the Paris-basin (la
 Frette, Bull. Soc. Ge'ol. Fr. 1876, pp. 471 et seqq.) has the
 same number of alternations as the above and extends from
 13 to 2'. The marine bed at 16 is wanting in this profile,
otherwise the same oscillations are indicated.
   The profile at Mery-sur-Oise has in all 71 alternations of
strata, of which 25 are in the Calcaire grossier. A great
part of the calculated curve is therefore filled up by the oc
currence of 37 alternations without a gap in the series of
deposits. With arc T the marine formations of the basin

                 the Displacement of Shore-lines.              497
terminate. In Miocene times came the volcanic outbursts in
the Anvergne.
   These oscillations of the coast-lines were not confined to
the Paris-basin. The                of deposits in the basin of the
Gironde, which seems to have been connected with the Paris-
basin only through the Atl mtic Ocean, is as follows (according
to Vasseur, Ann. Sci. GM. vol. xiii. pp. 398 et se<j</.) :—
   The Tertiary formations commence with the Middle Eocene :
Nummulitic sand and coarse limestone, marine. After this,
elevation and erosion. Then again followed a depression :
clay with Ostrea cucullaris (arcs 14-15), and another elevation:
lacustrino limestone of Plassac, and simultaneously with this
brackish-water limestone of Begadan (16-1'). Then a new de
pression:—marine limestone of St. Estephe and limestones and
marls with Anomia girondica (2'-4'). Elevation and erosion :—
Mollasse (freshwater) of Fronsadais (6' ?). Depression:—Cal-
caire a Asteries de Bourg (marine, 7'). Elevation :—lacustrine
limestone of l'Agenais, level 1 (between 7' and 8'). This is con
temporaneous with the Calcaire de Beauce of the Paris-basin.
In the basin of the Gironde fresh oscillations took place, namely
the following, which are Miocene :— Faluns de Bazas, marine,
8'; elevation: lacustrine limestone of l'Agenais, level 2 (between
8' and 90 ; depression : Faluns de Lcognan et Merignac,
marine (9 ). The so-called Mollasse of Anjou, which is wanting
in the basin of the Gironde, is, according to Tournouer {Ann.
Sci. GM. 1. c. p. 62) younger than 9', but older than the
Faluns de Salles of the Gironde ; both are marine, and pro
bably indicate two oscillations, It)*, 11'. Then followed another
Miocene oscillation, which has left its traces in the basin of
the Loire, in the marine Faluns of la Dixmerie (arc 12').
   Thus the Miocene period in France had five oscillations.
I have not, however, been able to obtain detailed profiles of
all these series of deposits.
   We now pass to England. In the Memoirs of the Geolo
gical Survey of Great Britain, 1856, we have accurate profiles
of the Tertiary formations of the Isle of Wight (by Forbes
and Bristow). The series of beds, from below upwards, has
the following oscillations and alternations* :—
   Plastic Clay (brackish?), 4 alternations.
   London Clay, marine, at least 11 alternations.
   Lower Bagshot, (in part ?) freshwater, 7 alternations.
   Middle Bagshot (Bracklesham and Barton) , the first fresh
      water, the second marine, and with 5 alternations.
   Upper Bagshot, without alternations.
                       • See Postscript, p. 513.

498             A. Blytt on the prohable Cause of
   This part of the series is in part older than the Calcaire
grossier, and there are at least one, probably two gaps in it.
The following series, on the contrary, is continuous :—
   Lower Headon, freshwater and brackish, 7 to 8 alternations
      (arc 13 and the first part of 14).
   Middle Headon, marine, 1 alternation, at 14.
   Upper Headon, freshwater and brackish, 5 alternations,
      between arcs 14 and 15.
   Osborne, freshwater, 3 alternations, between arcs 15
      and 1'.
   Bembridge limestone, freshwater, 3 alternations, between
      arcs V and 2'.
   Bembridge oyster-bed, marine, at least 1 alternation,
      at 2'.
   Bembridge marl, freshwater, 6 alternations, arcs 2' and 3'.
   Hempstead marl, freshwater and brackish, 2 alternations,
      4' or 5'?
   Hempstead Corbula-beds, marine, imperfect above by de
      nudation, 1 alternation.
   The profiles of the different stages are taken at different parts
of the island which have lain at different levels. Bearing
this in mind, the series may be fitted into the curve, and at
any rate correspond with them pretty closely.
   The number of alternations in this last continuous part of this
series of deposits is about the same as in the contemporaneous
deposits of the Paris-basin, although the beds are more than
three times as thick (48 metres in tho Paris-basin, 156 metres
in the Isle of Wight).
   With the marine deposits of Hempstead the marine form
ations of England are interrupted, and it is only in the
Pliocene that we have indications of a new marine submergence.
The basalts and volcanic eruptions of Ireland and the Hebrides
are probably, at any rate in part, Miocene. Basaltic dykes
extend in places across the whole of England ; but the chief
outbreaks were on the western side, and hence they can be
traced through the Faroes to Iceland.
   We will now see whether we can fill up the curve from
7', where the continuous profile from the Paris-basin closes,
up to recent times. The uppermost bed of the Paris-basin
lies upon the boundary between Oligocene and Miocene. As
we have already seen, the Miocene period in France had five
oscillations. In Transylvania (according to Koch, in the
Fdldiard Kdzlony) there are five Miocene stages, namely :—
Koroder beds, Kettosmezo beds, Hidalmas beds, Mezoseger
beds, and Feleker beds. All these stages are marine. Even

                  tlie Displacement of Shore-lines.           499
if they are not throughout separated by freshwater formations,
as in the case of several, at any rate, of the French Faluns,
they may nevertheless be regarded as corresponding to five
oscillations. In the deeper seas the bottom will not always be
upheaved above the sea under low eccentricities ; but the
oscillations will nevertheless operate in changing the fauna,
and also frequently the constitution of the deposits.
    The Miocene deposits of the Vienna-basin are divided into
 three principal stages,—the first and second Mediterranean,
and the Sarmatiau. But if we study the detailed profiles
 more closely, there appear to have been here also five Miocene
 oscillations. Thus (according to Suess, Sitzungsb. Wiener A had.
 1866) the first Mediterranean stage shows the following
sequence of strata from below upwards :—
    Beds at Molt, with oyster-shells (broken), at the top with
       lignite, 4 alternations, arc 8'.— Supposed by Suess to be
       on the same horizon with the Faluns of Bazas.
    Beds near Loibersdorf, Gauderndorf, and Eggenburg,
       marine, probably with 8 alternations, at any rate in
       part younger than the beds at Molt (arcs 8' ? and 9').
    " Schlier " with gypsum, at the top with land-plants.—
       Suess calls it " ein ersterbendes Meer," and seems inclined
       to regard it as a peculiar stage. Alternations, but scarcely
       more than two. The last part of arc 9'.
     Beds at Grund, marine, with few (3-4) alternations,
       to judge from Suess' profiles.—The fauna forms a trans
        ition from the first to the second Mediterranean stage,
        and this deposit at Grund is with reason regarded by
        several Viennese geologists as representing a distinct
        stage. Arc 10'.
     This was followed by the greatest submergence, the second
  Mediterranean stage (arc 11'), contemporaneous with the
  French Faluns de Salles. The sea rose quite up into the
  inner Alpine Vienna-basin. I have been unable to make out
  the number of alternations in this stage. I have only seen
  sections of the littoral formations described.
     Finally, the last Miocene oscillation, the Sarmatian stage,
  arc 12'. In some localities (e. g. near Constantinople) this
  stage commences with freshwater covered by marine formations
  (see Suess, Antlitz der Erde, i. p. 419). According to a
  profile from Hungary (by Peters in Sitzungsb. Wiener Akad.
  1861) the stage has 4 alternations.
     This stage is followed by the Pliocene Congeria-beds, which
  in the Vienna basin are represented only by brackish-water
  formations, according to Fuchs {Jalirb. k. k. Geol. Reichs.

500            A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
1875) with 4 alternations ; arc 13'. And with these the
marine formations of the Vienua-basin, Hungary, and Tran
sylvania come to a close. Volcanic outbursts commenced in
these countries even in the Oligocene period ; they became
very frequent in the Miocene, and during this period the Alps
rose to great altitudes.
    In the basin of Mayence the marine Oligocene formations
 (Weinheimer marine sand and Septaria-clay) are followed first
by a freshwater formation ; then the Miocene period com
menced with a depression. But during volcanic eruptions the
basin was upheaved and became more and more freshwater. A
 continuous formation of beds took place. Over the Cerithium-
 limestone, the Corbicula-limestone and Littorinella-clay were
 deposited, in all with 20 or more alternations (according
to Lepsius, Das Mainzerbecken). All these deposits are
Miocene.
    We now pass further forward in time. The Pliocene has
 four oscillations, 13', 14', 15', and 16'. We have already
mentioned the Congeria-beds of the Vienna-basin. In Eng
land there are three oscillations :—Coralline Crag (14'), Red
 Crag (15'), and Cromer Clay or Westleton Shingle (16').
 Profiles of these are to be found in Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc
 Lond. 1871 (by Prestwich). The climate of Europe began to
 become colder in the Pliocene. Even the oldest deposit in
the Pliocene of England contains stones which may have
been grooved by ice, and at the close of the Pliocene there
were already great, glaciers ; the Pliocene was followed by the
 Glacial epoch. We have seen how, during strong and ex
 tensive volcanic action, previously marine basins were during
 Oligocene, and especially Miocene, times uplifted above the
 sea not to be depressed afterwards (Paris, Vienna, Hungary,
 the Mayence-basin, and we may add Switzerland), and we
 have seen that the Alps were upheaved in Miocene times. The
 Faroes and Iceland were built up, at any rate in great part,
 at the same time by basalts and lavns ; perhaps, moreover,
 the submarine bank which connects Europe with Greenland
 was uplifted during the last portion of the Miocene period.
 In the Mediterranean, according to Neumayr (see Suess,
 Anllitz der Erie, i. p. 425) the coast-lines at the close of the
 Pliocene lay even lower than at the present daj\ No doubt
 all these elevations have had much influence upon climate.
 Changes in the length of the day are dependent upon varia
 tions of the eccentricity. Geographical changes follow upon
 the increase of the day, and climate changes with the distri
 bution of land and sea.
    The Coralline Crag in England (according to Prestwich)

                the Displacement of Shore-lines.             501
has a thickness of only 25 metres, and cannot have many
alternations. After this stage was formed the land rose, but
was again partially depressed under the sea. During this
depression was formed the Red Crag, with the Chillesford
Clay. In the Coralline Crag two shore-lines were hollowed
out one over the other and the new stage lies now on the old
shore-platforms. The Red Crag is thinner than the Coralline
Crag and cannot include many alternations.
   In Belgium, also, we have two Pliocene stages, which cor
respond to the two English Crag-stages :—the Scaldisien,
Stages sup^rieur et interieur. To these two oscillations of
the North Sea correspond two contemporaneous ones of the
Mediterranean. Suess calls them the third and fourth Medi
terranean stages. And even in the earliest part of the
Pliocene the Mediterranean fauna indicates a somewhat colder
climate (Suess, I.e. i. p. 431).
   Italy possesses thick Pliocene formations. Seguenza de
scribes deposits 500-600 metres in thickness from this period.
I have been unable to obtain profiles of these deposits. They
are in part conglomerates and shore-formations, like the great
Miocene Mollasse of Switzerland, and near the shore thick
deposits can be formed in a short time.
   The profiles of Roussillon (by DepeVet, in Ann. Sci. Gdol.
vol. xvii. 1885) show four alternations in tho stage contem
poraneous with the Coralline Crag (arc 14'). The overlying
stage in Roussillon is a freshwater formation. The land had
risen. The freshwater stage has several alternations, probably
6-8, so far as I can see from the profiles given, which, how
ever, are not quite accurately described (arcs 15'— 16').
   We now turn again to England. The fossils of the Red
Crag show a colder climate than that of the Coralline Crag,
and the Chillesford beds, which belong to the last portion of
the Red Crag, have distinctly arctic shells. The Glacial
epoch was advancing. After the Red Crag was formed
England again rose and became united by land with the
continent. Extinct mammals wandered in its forests, which
consisted of existing trees (spruce, pines, &c.) and show a temr
perate climate, milder than that of the Chillesford beds, and
about as at present. " The forest-bed of Cromer " was over
lain by marine deposits—Westleton Shingle and Cromer Clay
(arc 16'). In the latest terrestrial formation at Cromer
Nathorst has found Arctic plants (Salix polaris, Ac.), and the
Cromer Clay indicates the vicinity of inland ice. With this
the Pliocene closes.
   As regards the Quaternary oscillations, we will take the

502              A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
English deposits as described by J. Geikie (' Groat Ice Age,'
ed. 2, pp. 387 el seqq.) as our guide.
    The Quaternary period commences with the retrogression
of the ice and with a considerable denudation. Then the sea
again rose and covered a great part of the east of England.
The inland ioe again extended itself and formed a bottom-
moraine, " the great chalky boulder-clay " (arc 1"). After
this glacial period an elevation of the land seems to have fol
lowed, and the ice retreated. But a new depression followed
(Bridlington Crag) and a new glacial period (purple boulder-
clay, arc 2"). A fresh elevation seems to have followed, with
a new interglacial period. Then came a new depression, which
was very considerable, and which at Moel Tryfaen in Wales,
at Macclesfield, and in Ireland has left marine shells at heights
of 1000 to 1300 feet above the sea (nearly .approaching that
at which the old " seter " or beach-lines in Osterdalen, La3sje,
Ac. occur). Like the preceding depression, this was also
 followed by a glacial period, the last (Hessle boulder-clay,
arc 3"). Finally the land rose and the ice melted. The
 Postgliicial period came with its four peat-beds (the last
portion of 3'' and 4"). To arc 4'' corresponds a small oscil
lation of the sea immediately before the recent period. In
Scania, Garavallen,a raised beach-formation, rests upon peat;
in Gotland, in the British Islands (Carse Clay, &c.),and even
in North America, we may trace the same oscillation of the
sea ; it was no doubt too great to be capable of explanation by
local conditions, compression of peat-beds by shifting sand-
dunes, &c.
     We have already seen that the land (according to Howorth
 and Suess) in many places under high latitudes rose consider
 ably in the Postglacial period, and that a corresponding
 depression took place in the warm coral-seas. The last oscil
 lations therefore affected a great part of the earth. From this
 we may conclude that this was the case also with the oscilla
 tions of former times, and that they have their cause in general
 cosmical conditions. The small oscillation (arc 4") forms
 an interruption in this great upheaval under high latitudes.
 A similar interruption of the depression, if our theory be
 correct, must be exhibited under the tropics ; and in reality
 in the equatorial parts both of America and the Old World,
 there are numerous evidences of such a small postglacial
  oscillation in coral-reefs, which have been upraised several
  metres and are now lying dry (see Suess, Antlilz der Erde,
  ii. pp. 630 et netjg.). These coral-reefs may date from the
  same time when the northern peat-beds were submerged. The
  sunken peat-beds with the marine deposits formed during the

                   the Displacement of Shore-lines.            503
depression have been again uplifted, and the raised coral-hanks
have probably again begun to sink (at Bombay there is a sunken
forest), but the depression has not yet brought them down
beneath the sea.
    We may make one or two further observations upon the
Glacial period and its formations. Contemporaneous with
"the forest-bed of Cromer" (according to Heer) are the
lignites of Diirnten in Switzerland. The fossils show this.
They have nearly the same plant-remains, and the same
extinct animals. The lignites rest upon and are covered by
bottom-moraines, and are therefore " interglacial." They
have 7 alternations of peat and forest-beds, and may be
fitted into the curve between the arcs 15' and \". From this
the Alps must have had large glaciers even during the time
of the Red Crag. And there is no improbability in this if
we remember that Leda arctica and other Arctic animals were
already living on the English coast at this period, and that the
 Chillesford beds indicate a much colder climate than the
 subsequent forest-bed of Cromer.
    It is instructive to see how each rising of the sea in England
 during the Quaternary period had as its consequence the
 increase of the inland ice. This seems to agree with Croll's
 theory, that glacial periods are a consequence of great eccen
 tricities. But the scanty traces of glacial periods in the older
 formations, and above all the distribution of glaciers at the
 present day, show that geographical conditions have the
 greatest influence. It is only when these are favourable that
 a high eccentricity can cause the glaciers to increase ; if they
 are very favourable, there may be a glacial period even during
 a small eccentricity, as in Greenland at the present day.
 When the eccentricity increases, the precipitation during
 rainy periods also increases. If the sea is cold, the precipi
tation will fall as snow, and in this way the glaciers will grow
 as the eccentricity increases.
    North Germany (according to Jentzsch) has also had three
 glacial periods with corresponding bottom-moraines (and
 oscillations?); and in the Alps there have been (according to
 Penck, Vergletsch. d. deutsch. Alpen) at least three glacial
 periods.
• We have thus filled up the curve to the present time, and
 connected the profile of the Paris-basin therewith. We will
 now trace the oscillations back to the close of the Cretaceous
 period in order, if possible, to see how many oscillations are
 included in the Geological period known as the Tertiary.
    The Cretaceous period is separated from the Tertiary by a
 period of denudation, during which the land was high rela

504              A. Blytt on theprobable Cause of
tively to the sea. The oldest marine formation of the Tertiary
period in Europe is considered to be the limestone of Mons, in
Belgium. This indicates the first oscillation ; but this sub
mergence appears not to have left traces in the other Tertiary
basins. The first marine inundation of the Paris-basin during
Tertiary times formed the conglomerate of Rilly and Nemours.
It was followed by an elevation of the land, and the marine
conglomerate was covered by the freshwater limestone of
Rilly. This oscillation in the Paris-basin is perhaps repre
sented in Belgium by the so-called " systeme Heersien,"
which is at the bottom a purely marine formation, but has
remains of land-plants at the top. Then came a new oscilla
tion, and now England also was partially submerged. Here
was deposited the marine Thauet Sand, and upon this the
Woolwich and Reading Series ( = Plastic Clay), the latter
partly a brackish and freshwater formation, and which shows
that the shore-line had again retreated. In Belgium the
" systeme Landenien " was formed during this oscillation—
below purely marine, above brackish. In the Paris-basin
there was formed the marine sand of Bracheux, which was
followed by a freshwater formation with lignite (the Lignites
de Soissonnais). Then followed a new depression, and again
an upheaval. This has left no traces in the Paris-basin ; but
in England the London Clay was formed, and in Belgium the
" systeme Ypresien." The London Clay commences with a
shore-formation of shingle or gravel (Oldhaven Beds), and
the upper part of the stage shows that the sea again became
shallower, in consequence of a new elevation of the land*.
The " systeme Ypresien" in Belgium is divided into two sub-
stages: —the older, a clay with Foraminifera ; the younger
sandy, with numerous fossils, and therefore probably indicating
a shallower sea. A new submergence formed, in Belgium,
the marine " systeme Paniselien " (sand), and in the Paris-
 basin the marine sand of Cuise. With this the Lower Eocene
 closes. It has therefore, in all probability, 6 oscillations.
    The Middle Eocene is represented in France chiefly by the
" Calcaire grossier." In this stage there are 5-6 substages,
and in several places breaks in the series of deposits. The
Middle Eocene is on the whole marine, but with intercalated
freshwater beds, and it probably also represents 6 oscillations.
In Transylvania it commences (according to Koch in Foldtani
Kdzlony, 1883, pp. 118 et seqq.) with alternations of clay and
marl, upon which follow alternations of gypsum and marl
 (" lower gypsum horizon," 1st oscillation). Above it, marine
   * This Btage, as was shown above, contains at least 11 alternations, and
 therefore probably corresponds with at least two arcs of the curve.

                the Displacement of Shore-lines.              505
deposits, the Perforata-beds :—from below upwards—(a) an
oyster-bed, (/9) argillaceous marl, (y) calcareous marl ("lower
striata-horizon "), (8) a shell-bed (" lower perforata-horizon''),
(e) clay (" upper striata horizon," second oscillation ?),
(?) clay with a few hard marly beds and the same fossils as
in yS, (rj) another oyster-bed, (0) clay with oysters, (t) cal
careous marl (" upper perforata horizon," third oscillation ?) ;
above this the Ostrea-clay, a thick clay with oysters and
marly beds, and with a sandy calcareous bed in the middle
(fourth oscillation).     Over this again the Lower Coarse
limestone, generally in two thick beds (fifth oscillation),
covered by a thick bed of clay varied with layers of sand,
probably a freshwater formation, and covered by freshwater
limestone. Finally, the last (6th) oscillation, the Upper
 Gypsum horizon, gypsum alternating with clay ; and above it
coarse limestone alternating with gypsum ; in other places
clay with Foraminifera, marine:—the Upper Coarse limestone.
I have cited all these details in order to show that these beds,
which are all contemporaneous with the " Calcaire grossier "
of Paris, seem to indicate six oscillations.
   Above the " Calcaire grossier " the Upper Eocene com
mences with the continuous series of the Paris basin, which
has already been described.
   The Lower and Middle Eocene therefore appear to include
12 oscillations, six of which pertain to each of the two
divisions of the formation. By this the first cycle of the
curve is filled up ; so that the beginning of the cycle will
about fall upon the boundary between Cretaceous and Eocene.
In the Paris-basin the Middle Eocene has 25 alternations of
strata, and perhaps one or two breaks. Six oscillations about
correspond to 25-30 processional periods.
   At the commencement of the cycles the mean value of tho
eccentricity is low ; it rises in the middle of the cycle, and
sinks again towards the conclusion. The position of the
shore-lines must also depend upon the mean value of the
eccentricity. But as it increases very slowly through very
long periods, it will be very long before its action is to be
seen on the solid earth. The middle of the cycles ought thus
to correspond to the overflows of the sea, the beginning
and close to the periods of denudation which separate the
formations. Breaks in the series of beds may therefore be
expected under high latitudes, especially at the limits between
the cycles.
   The boundary between Cretaceous and Eocene is indicated
by what Suess {Antlitz der Erde, ii. 7ter Abschn. p. 376) calls
a negative phase : the sea had. retreated in higher latitudes.

506             A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
During the Eocene it rose again, and the Eocene sea had a
great extension ; we find its formations even in the heart of
Upper Asia. The limit between the Eocene and Oligocene is
again distinguished by a negative phase. In the latter part
of the Oligocene period, ;md still more during the Miocene,
the sea again rose ; between the Miocene and Pliocene it
retreated far, and at the beginning of the Quaternary epoch
it rose again. Similar great oscillations are also to be traced
in North America and in Patagonia. But marine Miocene
deposits are wanting in the last-mentioned locality, where the
Miocene freshwater beds are associated with great quantities
of volcanic products.
   At the commencement of the Tertiary period, when the sea
had retreated far under high latitudes, the climate of Europe
was temperate rather than tropical (see Saporta, Le Monde den
Plantes avant 1'apparition de I'homme, 1879). According as
the sea rose, and the Eocene overflow advanced, the climate
became warmer ; and at the close of the Eocene period the
eliiriate of Southern Europe was hot and dry. The abundant
Tertiary flora of the Arctic lands is (according to Saportr. and
Gardner) rather Eocene than Miocene (as Heer supposed).
At the boundary between Eocene and Oligocene the sea
retreated, and the Arctic Tertiary flora began to migrate into
Europe, supplanting the more southern plants. Then came
the Miocene overflow, and wTith it a rich tropical or subtro
pical flora. But in proportion as the Miocene sea retreated, the
European flora also, little by little, lost in richness and beauty,
and the tropical elements became more and more rare. During
the Pliocene epoch the sea retreated still further, and the
climate became colder and colder until the Glacial period
came in. But the last Quaternary overflow has again,
after several oscillations, caused the ice to retreat, and our
climate has again become temperate. There is thus clearly a
relation of dependency between the climate and geographical
conditions. Great seas under high latitudes produce warm
climates and vice versd.
   Now, we have seen that these great geographical changes
were in all probability a consequent e of the rising and sinking
 of the mean value of the eccentricity ; and we must therefore
 believe that these great changes of the climate had a cosmical
 origin, and occurred at the same time over the whole earth.
 We still know too little of the geology of tro| ical countries;
 but there is ground for the belief that here also great changes
 have taken place in the distribution of land and sea, and that
 these changes must also have had an influence upon the
 climate of the warm countries.

    It is, further, probable that the force of vulcanicity stands
in relation to the changes in the eccentricity. Each of the
great geological formations, from the Pre-Gumbrian itself, has
had its volcanoes (see A. Geikie, ' Textbook,' pp. 259-260) ;
and we have already seen that the same author states that
there have been periods in the earth's history when vulcanicity
was much more powerful and widely distributed than at other
times. We have seen how the upheaval of the land was accom
panied by volcanic outbursts ; and as regards the Tertiary
period, at any rate, it appears that the great overflows of
the sea were followed by periods during which the solid
ground began to rise during violent and wide-spread volcanic
eruptions.
    For easy reference we will finally enumerate all the arcs
in the curve, and name the geological stages supposed to cor
respond to them. To some extent we adopt the names given
by Charles Mayer Eymar*.

He divides his stages into two substages—one with " mere amples," and
 one with " mere basses." Some of his stages, however, represent several
 oscillations. He thinks that the precession of the equinoxes is the cause
 of the changes in the level of the sea. The whole of the Tertiary and
 Quaternary periods must, according to him, have had a duration of only a
 little over 300,000 years. He founds his views upon Schmick's unti
 hypothesis of the dependence of the sea-level upon the precessions.

    The limits between the cycles of the curve are not drawn
 arbitrarily. The beginning and the close of the first two
 cycles are distinguished by their unusually low eccentricity.
 The last arc in one cycle and the first in the following one
 have, together, a duration of about 150,000 years; and in all
 this time the eccentricity was very low. In these two cycles,
 likewise, the highest mean eccentricity occurs in the middle
 of the cycle.
    The Eocene period appears to have had 1 6 oscillations, and
 should correspond to the first cycle ; the Oligocene, Miocene,
 and Pliocene have likewise together 16 oscillations, and cor
 respond to the second cycle. The Lower Eocene corresponds
 to arcs 1-6, the Middle Eocene to 7-12, and the Upper
 Eocene to 13-16. In the same way the Oligocene cor
 responds to arcs l'-7', the Miocene to8'-12',and the Pliocene
 to 13'-16'. There is thus a certain analogy between the older
 and the younger Tertiary periods. We have here 6 divisions,

                  the Displacement of Shore-lines.            509
 which nearly correspond to each other in the following
 manner :—
    Lower Eocene to the Oligocene : the former with 6, the
      latter with 7 oscillations.
    Middle Eocene to the Miocene : the former with 6, the latter
      with 5 oscillations.
    Upper Eocene to the Pliocene : both with 4 oscillations.
    The great overflows of the sea occur in the middle of the
 cycles, in the Middle Eocene, the Upper Oligocene, and the
 Miocene. In the middle of the cycles the mean value of the
 eccentricity was greatest. At the commencement and the
last part of the cycles, when the mean value of the eccentricity
was small, the sea retreated far, as between the Cretaceous and
 the Eocene, and in the Upper Eocene and Pliocene. The
notion therefore presents itself with great probability that
there is a connexion between the cycles in the curve repre
senting the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and what is called
a geological epoch, or what has also been called a " cycle " or
" circle of deposition." The two Tertiary cycles are as it
were great stages, each composed of 16 smaller ones. Just
as each of these 16 represents a small oscillation of the sea, so
does each cycle represent a great oscillation ; but this great
oscillation has been accomplished by means of the 16 small
ones. In the same way the mean value of the eccentricity
rises and falls in each cycle with 16 oscillations ; it is low at
the commencement of the cycle, attains its greatest value in
the middle of the cycle, and falls again towards the close.
These agreements between the cycles of the curve and the
formations, between the arcs of the curve and the stages, and
between the number of the arcs' precessions and the alterna
tions of the strata in the stages wherever these could be
checked, appear to me to be so striking as to exclude the
notion of an accidental coincidence, and distinctly point to a
causal relation.
   If we would test the correctness of our hypotheses by
means of the older formations, the following points must
be borne in mind:—After investigating the laws of the varia
tions of eccentricity, Geelmuyden told me that it is probable
that a cycle of about 1,500,000 years must appear in the
curve, but that without more extended investigation we can
not conclude that this will continue unchanged for unlimited
periods. Even in the calculated curve the Cycle III. is
distinguished from the other two by a much lower eccentricity
in the arcs 4"-9".
   If the polar compression in old times was greater, then the

510             A. Blytt on tJie probable Cause of
precessional period was also shorter. According to Geel-
muyden it would be very nearly proportional to the square of
the time of rotation. For example, to a rotation-time of
16 hours corresponds a (synodic) precessional period of
10,000 years, consequently only half the present period. The
shorter the period the less marked (other things being equal)
must the climatic period be, and the more indistinct the
alternation of the strata.
    Further, it must be remembered, that in Palaeozoic and
Mesozoic times the moon was probably much nearer. In that
case the lunar tide was much stronger, and stronger in pro
portion to the solar tide than at present The day was
shorter, and the stronger tidal wave acted more frequently.
The shores were more rapidly destroyed. Deposition, no
doubt, took place more rapid ly. The sidereal day increased
more quickly in length than at present. All these circum
stances must have had an influence upon the form of the
earth, upon the distribution of land and sea, upon the dis
placement of shore-lines, upon the changes of climate, upon
 the ocean-currents, upon the distribution of chemical and
 mechanical sediments and the alternations of strata, so that,
 without taking these and perhaps other circumstances into
 consideration, we cannot prove the applicability of the
 hypotheses to the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic series.
    In conclusion, I will briefly notice the chief points in my
 hypothesis.
    The precession of the equinoxes and the periodical change
 in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, are reflected in the
 series of strata and furnish the key to the calculation of the
 duration of geological epochs.
     Precession causes winter and summer to be alternately
 longer and shorter. In the semi-period when the winter is
 longer than the summer, the difference between the inland
 and coast climate becomes more marked. The atmospheric
  currents become stronger. As a consequence of this the
  currents of the ocean increase in strength, and this again
  reacts on the climate. The periodical change of the climate
  caused by precession is not very considerable, but still great
  enough to leave its mark in the alternations of strata, and in the
  formation of shore-lines, terraces, series of moraines, &c. One
  alternation of strata corresponds to each precessional period.
     The eccentricity of the earth's orbit is periodically variable.
  Its mean value rises and falls in periods of about 1 £ million
  years, with 16 oscillations. Such a rise and fall I call a

                  the Displacement of Shore-lines.            511
 cycle, and each cycle, in the calculated curve, is composed of
  16 arcs.
     The tidal wave, which is the most important agent in
 altering the sidereal day, and which makes it longer, rises and
 falls to a certain extent with the eccentricity. It so pre
 dominates over the other forces which alter the length of the
 sidereal day, that the day steadily lengthens on the average
 more rapidly in the middle of the cycles when the mean
 value of the eccentricity is greatest, and more slowly at the
 boundaries between them, when it is least, and, as regards
 the individual arcs, with increasing rapidity during rising,
 and decreasing rapidity during falling eccentricity.
     The interior of the earth is plastic in consequence of the
 great pressure. The surface or " crust," opposes the greatest
 resistance to change of form. But as the sidereal day
 lengthens and the equatorial parts of the earth increase in
 weight, a constantly increasing strain acts outwards towards
 higher latitudes, and this strain increases until the resistance
 is overcome. It must also be remembered that forces which
 are too small to effect any sudden alteration in a solid body,
 may, nevertheless, produce a change of form when they act
 for a long time.
    Hence the lengthening of the sidereal day does not act
 only upon the sea, but also upon the form of the solid earth.
 The earth constantly approaches more and more to the
 spherical form ; but the solid earth, in its movements, lags
 behind the sea, which accommodates itself at once to the
altered time of rotation.
    As the motive power of these movements of the sea and
 the solid earth is periodically variable in accordance with the
 eccentricity of the orbit, these movements also take place
periodically more rapidly and more slowly. And as the
 sea always adjusts itself to the forces before the solid earth,
it is probable that the shore-lines oscillate up and down once
for each rising and sinking of the eccentricity of the orbit.
This applies both to the individual arcs of the curve and to
the cycles. In such a cycle " the mean level of the sea "
rises and falls once during 16 oscillations.
    According to Darwin the sidereal day has become several
hours longer. It is therefore probable that so great a strain
must have accumulated in the mass of the earth, that a
slight increase of the strain would suffice to effect changes of
form at the weakest points. It is also probable that these
partial changes in the solid body of the earth must occur
especially during great eccentricities, or some time after
them, when the motive power increases most rapidly.
                               2M2

512             A. BIytt on the probable Cause of
   The change in the tidal wave with the eccentricity is
supposed to be sufficiently great to explain the displacement
of shore-lines. A vertical displacement of the shore-line by
a few metres is sufficient to produce, in the deeper basins, an
alternation of many metres of thick marine and freshwater
deposits. And as regards the changes of the solid mass of
the earth, we must remember that the series of strata is not
complete at any single place. In other words, the oscillations
were not general to such an exient as to render them con
temporaneous everywhere. It is only by partial changes of
form, sometimes here, sometimes there, at those points which
were weakest at each period, that the solid earth has approached
the spherical form. To each arc of the curve, therefore, there
corresponds only a partial, not a general, alteration of the form
of the solid earth. And the oscillation of the shore-lines corre
sponding to the arcs, therefore, cannot be demonstrated every
where, but only in the basins where the forces at the time
exerted their action. Hence we can only obtain a complete
profile by combining the beds of all the Tertiary basins.
Nor were the changes of the solid earth everywhere equally
 great, but they were greatest at the most yielding parts of
the surface, so that very considerable local upheavals may be
consequent upon small changes in the length of the sidereal
day. This applies to the individual oscillations ; but even the
great overflows of the sea of which one falls in each cycle
need not be due to any very great rise in the level of the
sea, for great plains may be flooded and drained by a com
paratively small vertical displacement of the shore-line. But
these great changes in the distribution of land and sea were
undoubtedly great enough to cause considerable alterations of
climate. Great seas in high latitudes render their climate
mild, and vice verm.
    If now, keeping these principles in view, we compare the
curve of the eccentricity with the geological series of strata, we
find an agreement which indicates that the hypotheses are
correct. The two cycles of the calculated curve correspond
to two geological cycles. Each of these cycles has 16 arcs,
which correspond to 16 smaller oscillations of the shore-lines,
or 16 geological stages. In each of these stages there are as
many alternations of strata as there are precessions in the
corresponding arc. And the " mean sea-level " rises with the
mean eccentricity in the middle of the cycles, and falls at the
boundary between them, and hand in hand with the mean sea-
level the temperature in the higher latitudes also rises and
falls.                            *
   The theory here discussed agrees with Lyell's great

                 the Displacement of Shore-lines.             513
principle. Slow changes in the length of winter and summer
and in the force of the tidal wave produce periodical changes
of climate and displacements of shore-lines. The changes
take place so slowly that the effects begin to appear distinctly
only after the lapse of many thousands of years. There are
two astronomical periods which are the cause of tho great
and fundamental changes of which geology bears testimony
to us from long past days, and which will still continue, for
millions of years, to effect similar changes in the geography 0f
our globe, in its climate, and its animal and vegetable life.
                            Postscript.
   With reference to the profile of the Isle of Wight above
cited (p. 497), I must make a few remarks. Although with
some doubt, I have referred the Head on beds to the Upper
Eocene. But the difference between the faunas of the Gres
de Beauchamp and the Middle Headon is far too great for
these beds to be synchronous.
   The cause of the error is that I reckoned too many alterna
tions of climate in the Isle of Wight beds. In these fluvio-
marine deposits there is by no means the same regularity as
in beds which are formed in basins with less sedimentation.
The river eroded its borders and shifted its bed, banks were
formed and carried away, according as the direction of the
stream varied and the channel changed. Hence lenticular
intercalations were often formed in the beds, and as precipi
tous cliffs of the Isle of Wight break down, the minor details
of the profiles change in appearance. But with all this
irregularity there are certain beds which appear far more con
stantly, and which we can recognize in the different profiles
even although their condition is somewhat altered. By the
aid of these constant beds we find order in the variations,
and it appears that the great features of the profiles are main
tained unaltered ; and it is these great features that we must
follow when we wish to determine the number of climatic
alternations. In the Paris-basin, where sedimentation was
much less, chemically deposited beds play a much more
prominent part. In the Isle of Wight the stages are of
 much greater thickness. The Oligocene deposits of the Isle
of Wight are 156 metres in thickness, and more than three
times as thick as the contemporaneous beds in the Paris-basin,
which have a thickness of only 48 metres.
   In the dry periods the deposition of clay and mud was much
less, the water of the river was purer, and chemically formed

514               A. Blytt on the probable Cause of
beds had time to be deposited. Instead of clay and marl,
 limestone, Septaria-beds, ironstone, &c., were formed. These
 beds were undoubtedly formed much more slowly than the
 sand-, clay-, and marl-deposits which alternate with them.
 They are analogous to the forest-beds in peatmosses. Forest-
 beds often separate peat-deposits with different species of
 plants. This shows that the forest-beds indicate long dry
periods, during which the formation of peat ceased, and the
 flora became changed* ; when the quantity of rain again in
 creased and the formation of peat commenced anew, the
 forest-trees which grew around the mosses were changed, and
 the forest-beds thus make divisions between different substages
 or zones in the peat.
    Among the beds deposited in water (whether fresh- or
 salt-water formations) it is chiefly the above-mentioned che
 mically-formed beds that are formed in dry periods. And just
as in the peat-mosses forest-beds often separate peat-deposits
 with a different flora, so limestone- and Septaria-beds also fre
quently intervene between clay-, marl-, and sand-deposits
with a more or less different fauna, so that these chemically-
produced deposits often form boundaries between geological
 stages and substages. This is the case, for example, in the
 Fluvio-inarine series of the Isle of Wight, the main features
of which we shall now pass on to describe with the aid of
 Forbes's detailed and classical statements. We shall then see
that we have fewer climatic changes than I previously sup
posed, and that the series of beds in the Isle of Wight coin
cides as admirably with the curve of eccentricities as the
 Parisian deposits, although somewhat later on in time than
was hitherto supposed ; thus the agreement with the palseon-
lological results becomes complete.
    We begin from below, with 'the Upper Eocene Barton
 Clay. Judging from the fossils this is synchronous with the
 Gres de Beauchamn in the Paris-basin. It has 5 Septaria-
beds, and corresponds to arc 14 of the curve, which has the
same number of precessional periods. The Barton Clay is
covered by the Ileadon Sands (previously referred to the
Upper Bagshot), which have no alternations, and which were
probably formed in a comparatively short time.
    A great gap now follows in the series in the Isle of Wight.
In the Paris-basin the freshwater Calcaire de St. Ouen was
formed at this time. This is only 6-7 metres thick, but it has
lOalternations, which should represent 200,000 years according
   * See " Theori om Indvandringen af Norges Flora under vekslende
regnfulde og t0rre Tider," in Nyt Mag. for Nature, xxi. 1876 (pp. 52, 53
of separate copies).

                the Displacement of Shore-lines.            515
to my calculation. It might seem that this was a long time for
the formation of a stage of so little thickness ; but while this
stage was deposited the marine fauna was changed to such an
extent that a great geological boundary has been drawn
through this point, the boundary between the Eocene and
Oligocene. Ihe first marine Oligocene bed in the Isle of
Wight (the Marine Headon) has a fauna of which only 30-50
per cent, of the species occur in the Barton Beds. The fi-7
metres of the freshwater limestone in the Paris-basin probably
represents moro than half the time which elapsed between the
formation of the Marine Barton and Headon.
   Then the sea rose again, and the Oligocene period com
menced. The oldest Oligocene stage in the Isle of Wight is
the Lower Headon ; it is a fresh- and brackish-water forma
tion showing one oscillation of the shore-line. I have given it
7-8 alternations. The stage contains five limestones, separated
by deposits of sand and clay, and besides these, two horizons
with ferruginous concretions. Reckoning these, it has 7
periods. Marine fossils ( Cytherea, Mytilns) sometimes occur
in the middle of the stage ; freshwater and brackish forms
above and below. The Lower Headon thus represents one
oscillation of the shore-line (or a little more) with 7 climatic
changes.
   The next stage or oscillation is the Middle and Upper
Headon. These have together 6 alternations of strata, 4
limestones, and 2 beds with iron concretions separated by
clays and sands. The Middle Headon is brackish at the base,
but soon becomes a purely marine formation, with an abundant
fossil fauna. The Upper Headon contains fresh- and brackish-
water animals.
   Above the Headon come the Osborne Beds, a nearly pure
freshwater formation. It has 8-10 alternations:—2 Septaria-
beds, 2 ironstone bands, and 6 horizons with concretions
ot argillaceous limestone, separated by clay, and marl.
10 alternations represent 2 oscillations and 2 arcs of the
curve.
   Over the Osborne comes the Bembridge Stage. The Bem-
bridge beds consist of : first, a freshwater limestone, which
has 3 well-marked alternations of compact limestone with
clay and marl ; these 3 alternations recur in profiles from
the most different localities ; over this the marine Bem
 bridge Oyster-bed, and immediately above this a Septaria-bed,
 of which Forbes says that it is " very remarkable and con
 stant." Above this come the Lower Bembridge Marls with
brackish and freshwater animals, but without alternations ;
upon this a Septaria-bed, " sometimes siliceous, sometimes

stages, the Lower and Upper Benibridge Marls. In these
Upper Marls, which likewise contain brackish and freshwater
shells and even lignites, I have assumed 4 climatic alternations :—
there are two pyritous bands and a marly bed, and at the top,
at the limit of the overlying Hamstead* stage, a bed with fer
ruginous concretions capped with marl. But the two pyritous
bands and the first of the above-mentioned marls constitute
no palaeontological boundary, and are far from being so pro
minent as the Septaria-bed. I therefore regard it as the most
probable assumption that the whole of the Bembridge Marls
indicate only 3 alternations of climate, and thus for the whole
stage we have 6 climatic periods.
   Finally, we come to the Hamstead* Beds. These at the
lowest part consist of brackish and freshwater marls, in which,
besides a pyritiferous horizon of little importance, and which
forms no nalasontological horizon, we find indications of two
dry periods. One of these, the so-called "White Band," a
more or less hardened ferruginous bed rich in fossils, forms
the boundary between the two substages, the Lower and
Middle Hamstead Marls ; and higher up there is a bed of
ironstone concretions, which nearly coincides with the limit
between the substages of the Middle and Upper Hamstead
Marls. The uppermost part of the Hamstead Stage is formed
by the marine Corbula-bed, in which there is a bed with
Septaria. The stage therefore represents one oscillation with
3 climatic alternations ; but it is not completely preserved,
the top having been removed by denudation.
   If we now sum up the above statements, we obtain the
following numbers of oscillations of shore-lines and climatic
alternations :—
   Barton, 1 oscillation, with 5 climatic alternations.
   Headon Hill Sand, without alternations.
   Break in the series.
   Lower Headon, 1 oscillation (or a little more), 7 alterna
      tions.
   Middle and Upper Headon, 1 oscillation, with 6 alterna
      tions.
   Osborne, with 8-10 alternations, corresponding to 2 oscil
     lations.
   Benibridge, 1 oscillation, with 6 alternations.
   Hamstead, 1 (incomplete) oscillation, with 3 alternations.
   Besides the Eocene Barton there are 3 well-marked marine

Oligocene horizons in this series :—the Middle Headon, Bern-
bridge Oyster-bed, and Hamstead Corbula-beds. The Middle
Headon is regarded by palaeontologists as synchronous with
the marine gypsum in the Paris-basin. I have fitted the
Paris beds, so that the                   coincides with the arc
3', and the Fontainebleau Sands with the arc 7'. If we now
arrange the equivalent beds in the Isle of Wight in the same
arcs, we see that the Isle of Wight profile fits perfectly into
the curve of eccentricity, as follows :—
   Lower Headon to the arc 2' and perhaps the last part of V,
      with 7 alternations and 7 precessions.
   Middle and Upper Headon, with 5 alternations, to the arc
      3', with 5 precessions.
   Osborne, with 10 alternations, to the arcs 4' and 5', with 10
      precessions.
   Bembridge, with 6 oscillations, to the arc 6', with 5 or 6 pre
      cessions.
   Hamstead, with 3 alternations, to the first part of arc 7',
      with 3 precessions.
   It thus appears that the 3 marine horizons coincide with the
3 highest eccentricities, the summits of the arcs 3', 6', and 7',
while the lower arcs and parts of arcs correspond to brackish
and freshwater beds. The most unmixed freshwater forma
tion, the Osborne, coincides with the two lowest arcs, 4'
and 5'.
   For the sake of comparison, we will again carefully go
through the profile of the Paris basin, and compare this with
Stockwell's curve, commencing from the bottom. The beds
are numbered in the same way as in the original description
of Dollfus and Vasseur (Bull. Soc. GSol. Fr. ser. 3, torn. vi.

comes the marine bed (at the summit of 16). It must be
remarked that the corresponding arc in Leverrier's curve
reaches higher up. In the upper division of freshwater
limestones we have 6 alternations of hard limestone and

   It will be seen that the number of alternations of strata is
about the same in the synchronous formations in the Paris
and Hampshire basins. This shows that this alternation of
strata was due to a general cause, and that this cause is the
precession of the equinoxes seems highly probable.
   As, moreover, the curve of the eccentricity of the earth's
orbit appears at the same time to be a curve of the variations
of the sea-level, we may also conclude with probability that
for one reason or another the sea rose and fell with the
eccentricity.
          LVIII. On the Achromatism of Interferences.
                          By M. Mascart*.
1. TN a communication to the Acad^mie des Sciences, M.
    -L Corauf investigated the phenomenon of the displace
ment of interference- fringes in white light by the interposition
in the path of one of the rays of a refracting plate, and showed
that the now position in which the central fringe appears de
pends not only on the optical retardation, but also on the dis
persion of the interposed medium. He applied the name
" achromatic fringe " to that corresponding to the same phase
for the most important colours of the spectrum.
   Prof. Stokes | had already pointed out this property, and
had proved by experiment that observing the fringes through
a prism of small angle produces an apparent displacement of
the fringe from symmetry.
   It should also be added that, since the first application
of the method of fringe-displacement to the measurement of
indices of refraction, Fresnel§ recognized that it was in-

520     Jf. Mascart on (he Achromatism of Interferences.
correct. In one of his experiments on the topaz he only ob
served a retardation of 16'6 undulations, the calculated value
being 21, and he adds :—
   " The difference 4-4 is too great to arise from inaccuracy
in my micrometric measurements ; but it is possible that the
dispersion by the twofold refraction, that is to say, the differ
ence of energy of the twofold refraction for rays of different
colours, modified the superposition of the fringes produced by
these different rays in such a manner that eiTors were caused
in the determination of the position of the central band, and
that it was owing to a like source of error that the discord
ance in question partly arose."
   2. The employment of a prism produces another effect which
is very remarkable : at the same time that the refraction
changes the direction in which the fringes of different colours
appear it modifies their angular aperture in an unequal manner ;
the superposition of systems corresponding to neighbouring
wave-lengths is then much more complete than in the original
  henomenon, and a considerable number of fringes can be
  istinguished on either side of that which is achromatized.
   It was by observing in this manner through a prism the
rings produced by a layer of air between two glasses, that
Newton perceived more than forty of them ; the appearances
are then analogous to those presented by the employment of
a homogeneous light.
   To explain this peculiarity I shall consider, in a more gene
ral manner, any phenomenon of fringes localized on a sensibly
plane surface S, such as ordinary interferences received on a
screen, Newton's rings, the bands of chromatic polarization in
a crystal of variable thickness, &c. I shall assume, moreover,
that the fringes are symmetrical with respect to a straight line
to which they are normal, and that the point of observation is in
the plane of symmetry, the eye being furnished with a prism
of which the principal section is parallel to the same plane.
   Taking the axis of x on the right line of symmetry, and the
axis of y normal to the surface S, let h be the ordinate and
—a the abscissa of the point P, where the eye furnished with
the prism is situated, x the abscissa of the point M regarded,
i the angle which the ray MP makes with the normal, D the
deviation produced by the prism, and 0 the angle which the
refracted ray makes with the normal.
   The difference in path A of the rays which interfere
at the point M should be considered in general as a function
of x and of » ; the deviation D is itself a function of i and of
the index of refraction n. Denoting the wave-length by \,
we may then write

   The order m of the achromatic fringe is defined by the con
dition that, for a constant value of m, the angle 0 which de
termines the direction of the emergent rays be the same for
the neighbouring colours. If we differentiate these equations,
putting dm=0, and c?0=O, and replacing the expression
 — X^?, which depends only on the nature of the prism, by L,

   The law of the phenomenon of interference being known,
as well as the nature of the prism and its direction, equations
(1) and (2) determine all the quantities m, x, i, and 6 which
correspond to the achromatic fringe.
   As the angle of divergence of a fringe is iu general very
small, we shall obtain it by making dm = l in the differential
equations and considering \ and n as constants. The angle of
divergence dd of a fringe is then determined by the equation
                   V      cH / \cos2 1 ox at /
   For a fringe of any order this angle depends on the wave
length, but in the neighbourhood of the achromatic fringe we
may take into account equation (2), which gives
                            ^=1l|*m on                          (4)

   The factors L and ^ vary very slowly with the colour.
We see then that, whatever be the law of interferences, the
value of dd in the neighbourhood of the achromatic fringe is
in inverse ratio to the order m and is almost independent of
the wave-length, so that a very great number of fringes will
appear there.
   It is even possible, by making choice of a suitable inclina
tion for the prism, to render the coincidence still more perfect,
if the differential coefficient of the product         with respect
to the index of refraction is zero, which is given by the condition

    Calling A the angle of the prism, 0 the angle made by the
 entering-face with the surface S, r the angle of refraction of
 the ray MP on this face, r and e'the angles of emergence, we
 readily find that the equations which determine the order of
 the achromatic fringe, the angular distances of the neighbour

    We easily see that the employment of a grating as dispersion-
apparatus would not produce an analogous effect.
    We will apply these results to two particular cases.
   Interference-fringes.—Let us consider first the case of ordi
nary interferences, where the fringes are equidistant and sym
metrical with respect to one of them for all colours. The
origin being taken at the centre of the phenomenon, the
difference in path A is simply proportional to x, and we
                m\=a.v,       ¦-- =a,       =0.
                         'ox            d*
   There exists only one achromatic fringe, of which the
order m and the abscissa x are given by the equations
                   _m\ _j L                 sin A
                 ' ~ a ~ cos2 i cos Q9— i) cos r1'
These values of m and of x are the greater, all other things
being equal, the farther the prism is from the surface S.
   If the observation is made in a direction normal to the
surface, that is to say, the screen being discarded, on the path
of the interfering rays, there remains simply
                         m\ 1T          sin A

   Newtoris Rings.—If the rings are produced by a layer of
air between a plane surface and a spherical surface of radius R
which do not touch, the thickness of the layer at a distance x
from the centre may be expressed by
                          e=e°+m                               (6>

   This curions fact also presents itself, that the final equation
which will give one of the unknowns, such as x or 6, is not
of the first degree ; thus there may exist several distinct
achromatic fringes and several groups of visible fringes.
    If, for example, we make i=0, which corresponds to vision
along the normal to the surface, equation (7) reduces to                 ,
                 x3-2hL        S^A ,3 + 21^=0.

    The problem is possible only when the condition

                                   cos-* p cos' r
is satisfied, and the two corresponding values of x are in this
 case positive.
    One of these values is zero for e0=0. If, therefore, under
 these conditions, we observe ordinary coloured rings by means
 of a prism, the central spot remains achromatic, and we per
 ceive at some distance a group of branches of rings, the more
 compact and the more numerous the higher the order of the
 achromatized fringe. This is Newton's experiment.
    3. If the interference takes place between plane waves, as
 in Jamin's apparatus, the rings produced by diffusion in thick
 plates, the phenomena of chromatic polarization in thin plates
 with parallel faces, &c, we must replace equations (1)' by the
 following:—
                     A=w\ = /(i), 1
                     d=0-i = *(.»,!                                   W
 which amounts simply to suppressing the variable x.
     The order of the achromatic fringe, and the angle of diver
 gence of the neighbouring fringes, are in this case determined
 by the equations

524     M. Mascart on the Achromatism of Interferences.
The value of dB is the same as in the case of localized fringes.
I will take one example only.
    HerscheVs Fringes.—By placing the hypothenuse-face of an
isosceles prism on a thin plate of glass, in such a manner as to
leave between the surfaces a layer of air of sensibly constant
thickness e, W. Herschel* perceived a series of curvilinear
fringes parallel to the curve which defines total reflexion.
These fringes show themselves clearly when the rays of light
are made parallel : they are therefore produced by the inter
ference of plane waves. In this case the angle is zero, and
the difference in path equals 2e cos i. If we denote by <f>(i, n)
the deviation i + i'— A, which is the same thing as changing
the sign of i in the preceding equations, the angle of divergence
of a fringe of any order m is
          ,, 1 cos'j cosr'                   X1       cos/
         dl =— ¦—:—;                ., =m-T—„
              ' m sin i cos r cos t         4e* sin t cos r cos t'"
   As these fringes are very near to total reflexion, we may
replace the angles r, r1, and i' by their values R, R', and 1',
corresponding to this finite direction, and we have obviously
                     di' — m^         cosR'
                              4e* cos R cos I'"
   Thus Herschel's fringes present this very singular cha
racter, that their apparent size, at least in the case of the first
ones, is proportional to the order of the fringe and to the
square of the ratio of the wave-length to the thickness of tbe
layer of air.
   The condition for achromatism is
                          cos2 i _ sin A
                           sin i        cos /'
   The distance of the achromatic fringe from the limit of
total reflexion is therefore independent of the thickness of the
layer. The number of fringes visible in the neighbourhood of
this region is greater the greater the thickness of the layer
itself.
   Talbot t observed this phenomenon in light transmitted
through a layer of air compressed between the hypothenuse-
faces of two exactly similar prisms, and was able to coimt as
many as 200 fringes with white light.
   The fringes which appear at the margins of the polarized
field in Nicol's prisms or in Foucault's prism are to be
explained in the same manner.

A Treatise on Hydrodynamics, with numerous Examples. Vol. II.
        By A. B. Basset, M.A. Cambridge : Deighton, Bell, and Co.,
        1888.
"VX7E have not had long to wait for the completion of this impor-
  " tant work, and now we possess a valuable treatise on
Hydrodynamics carefully brought up to date. Considering the
great advances made by the recent work of Lord Rayleigh, Poincare,
Hicks, J. J. Thomson, G. H. Darwin, and Love, the author must
have devoted much time and trouble to the task of embodying their
results and processes in a concise form in this second volume.
    So many analytical difficulties of pure mathematics block the way
to future progress, that the present work is necessarily only addressed
to advanced mathematicians, conversant with Bessel, Elliptic, Sphe
rical Harmonic, Spheroidal, and Toroidal Functions ; and incident
ally in the course of the hydrodynamical investigations many
elegant theorems in Pure Mathematics drop out, important enough
to set up in his business a pure mathematician.
     Chapter xii. of the present volume is a rt.sumi of the chief
properties of these functions, required in chaps, xii. and xiv. on the
 properties of rectilinear and circular vortices, the latter embodying
 the most important researches of J. J. Thomson.
     In chapter xv. the motion of a rotating liquid ellipsoid under
 the influence of its own attraction is discussed, from the points of
 view of Jacobi, Eiemann, Dirichlet, Sir W. Thomson, Poincare,
 and G. H. Darwin. The discussion of the stability of the motion
 is one of the most refined operations of modern analysis, and
 important in its bearing on the subject of the Figure of the Earth,
 and General Cosmogony, including the Genesis of the Moon,
 recently investigated by Mr. Love, too recently, however, to be
 embodied in the present volume.
     Chapter xvii. treats of all the hitherto solved questions on
 Liquid Waves, and here analytical difficulties still restrict us to
 the consideration of waves of small displacement. This restriction
  is, however, a legitimate working hypothesis when we come to the
  grand Theory of the Tides, chapter xix., with which the names of
  Newton, but principally of Laplace are associated; and now
  recently undertaken afresh by Prof. G. H. Darwin.
      The remainder of the volume is devoted to the investigation of
  the simple cases of liquid motion it is possible to discuss mathe
  matically at present, when the disturbing effect due to a viscosity
  in the liquid in motion is taken into account. Some important
  experiments made recently by Prof. Osborne Reynolds have re
  directed attention to this important question, and shown the path
  for theoretical investigation.
      We venture to defend again the expression " with numerous
  examples " appearing on the title-page, an expression which will
  call forth disapproval in certain quarters. These examples are
  carefully selected and verified ; they afford a welcome recreation to

 condensing into a few lines a mass of information, which otherwise
 would, in the continental fashion, have swelled this book to double
 its present dimensions.
     The student of Hydrodynamics should be very grateful to the
 author, Mr. Basset, for an elegant treatise, which will place him
 abreast of the present state of development of the subject.

  ON THE PASSAGE OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH BAD CONDUCTORS.
                            BY HUGO ROLLER.
 'T'HE author closes the imperfect dielectric to be investigated with
  ¦*• a known resistance in the circuit of a voltaic battery, and
 determines the fall of potential, which is found to be proportional
 to the strength of the current.
     The transport of electricity through imperfect dielectrics is seen
 to be different from that through true conductors in three points.
     1. If a current of constant electromotive force traverses a
condenser formed of an imperfect dielectric, its intensity diminishes
with the time at first rapidly, and afterwards more slowly, ap
proaching a definite limit along an asymptotic curve. With one
and the same dielectric these changes in intensity take place the
more rapidly the greater the tension in the condenser, and the
smaller the quantity of dielectric between the electrodes.
     2. The strength of the current increases more slowly than the
electromotive force producing it.
    3. The apparent specific resistance of dielectrics diminishes with
their thickness.
     This behaviour involves deviations from Ohm's law, of which
the former is the more important, as the two latter may perhaps be
partially if not altogether referred to the difference in the variation
of intensity according to the dielectric tension and the thickness
of the condenser.
    Following an indication of Maxwell, the author endeavours to
explain the decrease iu the intensity of the current by referring
the apparent currents which pass through a dielectric to three
processes which are equivalent to currents.
     1. To dielectric displacement.
    2. To the formation of a residue.
    3. To true conduction.
    The influence of the first factor is soon exhausted, while the
latter is independent of the time. The author considers the
second, the influence of which becomes less with time, and finally
disappears, as a transition between dielectric displacement and
conduction. The quantities of electricity required for an electrical
displacement remain in the form of electrical energy, while the
quantities of electricity consumed in keeping up the conduction are
transformed into heat. Imperfect conductors are not able to

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                527
transport more than one part of the quantities furnished by con
duction ; a portion remaining in the transitional stage between
dielectric displacement and heat, in the form of a sort of packing
in the substance of the dielectric. The quantities of electricity
stored up in this way in the course of time form the residue. The
true resistance of the substance can only be obtained after its com
plete development. The current which traverses the imperfect
dielectric has thus acquired a constant intensity, for the quantity of
electricity arriving each moment is usually equal to that converted
into heat, and is not partially used in the formation of a residue.
   The investigation extended to the following substances :—
Petroleum ether, oils of turpentine, of linseed, castor oil, olive
oil, almond oil, bisulphide of carbou, oil of vaseline, benzole,
toluole, xylole, water, alcohol, ether, and the solid insulators in
ordinary use.
   Of liquids the best insulators are the products of distillation of
petroleum, although individual specimens differ very materially
from each other.
    The specific resistance of petroleum, ether, vaseline oil, and
benzole was in most cases higher than lO" Siemens units.—Berichte
der Akad. zu Wien, Feb. 1889.
         THE ISOTHERMS OF GASES. BY M. AROLDO VIOLI.
    The author deduces from the kinetic theory the general relation
between pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas. The begin
ning of the investigation is occupied by an historical account of the
efforts hitherto made in this direction which have led to various
formula?. On the basis of various hypotheses as to the mode of
action of the molecules, and of the surrounding atmospheres, the
following equation is finally established :—
    In this H is the pressure in metres of mercury, t the temperature
in degrees Centigrade, a. the coefficient of expansion of perfect
gases, v the volume reduced to 0°, a the constant of molecular
attraction, b the ratio of the volume of the molecules to the volume
of the gas, and E is a constant. Separate expressions are pro
pounded for the magnitudes a and b : namely
                                                 1
                a = 0-000004568JA^nfc - 13596/t'
                5=0-0005 s/ph;
in which p is the molecular weight for H3=2, h the pressure in
metres of mercury, and n the number of atoms in a molecule.
   These formula; have been applied to gases in various directions,
and the results compared with the theories of Van der VVaals and
of Blaserna. The conclusion consists of investigations on mole
cular velocity as well as on thecritical point.— Raid, delta S. Acc. dei
