  I. A Determination of the B.A. Unit in Terms of the Mecha
    nical Equivalent of Heat. By Lawrence B. Fletcheb,
 THE experimental work of the following investigation was
        completed in 1881, and forms the subject of a thesis
 submitted to the Johns Hopkins University in that year. In
 the present paper a more accurate method of calculating the
 currents from the deflection-curves is used, and some of the
 other calculations have been revised. The results of the two
 papers are substantially the same.
    Ihe experiment consisted of simultaneous thermal and
 electrical measurement of the energy expended by a current
 in a coil of wire immersed in a calorimeter. The result de
 pends upon the values of the mechanical equivalent and the
 uuit of resistance, and gives a determination of either in terms
 of an assumed value of the other.
    The old determinations of Quintus Icilius and Lens have
no value, as the resistance is uncertain, as pointed out by
Rowland and H. F. Weber.
    Joulef, in 1867, made a determination of the mechanical
equivalent by this method, assuming the B.A. unit as deter
mined by the Committee in 1863-4 to be equal to 109 C.G.S.
units. The value of the mechanical equivalent thus obtained
is more than 1 per cent, greater than Joule's water-friction

2     Dr. Fletcher on the Determination of the B.A. Unit
value. H. F. WeberJ, in 1878, used a similar method, em
ploying the Siemens unit, the value of which he also measured
in C.G.S. units. Weber's value of the mechanical equivalent
is about one part in two hundred greater than Joule's water-
friction value, and one part in four hundred greater than
Rowland's water-friction value.
   In both Joule's and Weber's experiments a possible source
of error seems to have been ignored. The wire was assumed
to be at the temperature of the water in which it was immersed,
and its resistance was calculated on this assumption. It is
evident, however, that the wire was hotter than the water,
inasmuch as it was giving heat to the water. The error due
to this cause is of uncertain amount. If corrected for this
error, the values of the equivalent, would be increased and
their excess over the water-friction values would become
Sreater than before. To avoid this source of error, the research
  escribed below was planned. The suggestion and general
plan of the research I owe to Professor Rowland.
   The theory of the method is as follows:—A current c, flow
ing through a wire of resistance R, for a time t, generates an
amount of heat represented by h = -j , where J is the me
chanical equivalent of heat. The wire being immersed in a
calorimeter and put in a circuit with a galvanometer, h, c, and
t can be measured. Then if R is measured in B.A. units, the
experiment will give a relation between the value of that unit
and the mechanical equivalent. In this research R was
measured during the actual experiment by connecting its
 terminals with those of a large resistance R' and measuring
the current c', which flowed through the latter. With this
arrangement cR=c'R', or R=-R'. Hence J= -° ^ \ in
                                   C                     it
which R does not appear, and the uncertainty attaching to its
temperature has no effect.
    The calorimeter was a cylindrical cup of sheet copper hold
 ing about 800 cubic centim. On the bottom of the cup lay a
 shtet-copper frame which supported three vertical glass rods.
 Around these the wire R was coiled, forming a helix. The
 ends of the wire were soldered to stout copper wires, which,
 insulated by short vulcanite tubes, passed through the wall of
 the calorimeter and turned down so that they could be placed
 in mercury-cups. The cover of the calorimeter rested in con
 tact with the water to secure uniformity of temperature. The
 cover had an expansion-tube and a smaller central tube, which
 formed one bearing for the stirring-apparatus, another bearing
 being given by a brass socket on the bottom of the calori

        in Terms of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.        3
meter. The stirrer consisted of a spiral blade of sheet copper
supported on a brass frame, the upper part of which was
tubular, and passed through the central tube of the cover.
The stirrer was kept in motion during the experiment by a
silk thread, which passed over a vulcanite wheel at the top of
the stirrer and ran io a driving-clock. The stirrer formed
the escapement of the clock, which ran very uniformly with
this arrangement. I estimated the heat generated by the
stirrer as two thirds of the whole work of the weights. This
is about one thousandth part of the heat generated by the
current, and only a rough determination of the correction is
needed. The thermometer passed through the tubular upper
part of the stirrer, and was clamped to a shelf above in such
a manner that its bulb was in the centre of the calorimeter
and surrounded by the stirring-blade, which, in turn, was
surrounded by the wire which carried the current. The wire
was composed of an alloy of platinum and iridium, and was
varnished to prevent conduction to the water. Its resistance
was about 1"8 ohm. The calorimeter was supported on legs
of vulcanite within a copper vessel with double walls, the
space between which was filled with water. This water-jacket
was provided with a hollow cover, also filled with water, and
its inner surface and the outer surface of the calorimeter wero
nickel-plated and polished. Thus the calorimeter was nearly
surrounded by an envelope of fairly constant temperature,
the thermometer, stirrer-thread, and connecting wires passing
through openings in the jacket.
    From the mercury-cups, in which the electrodes of the
calorimeter dipped, the wires of the main circuit ran to the
battery and galvanometer. These wires were 2'5 millim. in
diameter, cotton-covered, carefully paraffined, and twisted
together to eliminate direct action on the needle. The battery
consisted usually of 24 one-gallon bichromate cells, arranged
4 in series and 6 abreast, and gave a very steady current. In
 one experiment only 20 cells were used, 4 in series and 5
 abreast. The galvanometer-coil for the main current was a
single turn of stout wire laid in a groove on a wooden circle
 of about 80 centim. diameter. A sine-galvanometer was so
 placed that its needle was in the axis of the single-wire coil
and about 1 centim. distant from its plane. This excentricity
 was rendered necessary by the length of the suspending fibre.
The coil of the sine galvanometer was connected with the
calorimeter-electrodes by a second circuit, in which a resist
ance-coil of 30,000 ohms was included. The wires of this
circuit were kept apart, as the current was too small to exert
an appreciable direct action, and as great irregularity in some
                              B2

4      Dr. Fletcher on tlie Determination of the B.A. Unit
preliminary experiments in which the wires were twisted
together was finally traced to leakage, although the wires had
a double covering of silk. Both circuits were provided with
commutators. The sine-galvanometer had a horizontal bar
parallel to the axis of the coil. To one end of this was
attached a telescope, beneath which was a short scale which
was seen by reflection in the mirror of the needle, and allowed
a very accurate setting to be made without bringing the needle
to rest. The needle consisted of two thin strips of steel 1*2
centim. in length, separated by a piece of wood "6 centim. in
thickness. The circle of the galvanometer was graduated to
half-degrees, and read by verniers to one minute.
   The needle was acted upon by both currents simultaneously,
and by means of the commutators the actions were caused to
be in the same and in opposite directions alternately. The
current through the sine-galvanometer is d in the formula
     cdR't
J = —^—. The current through the coil on the wooden circle
is c + c', and was assumed equal to c, as c' was less than "OOOOTc.
Let G denote the constant of the fixed coil, G' that of the
sine-galvanometer, H the horizontal magnetic force, 0 and 0'
the deflections when the actions are in the same and in opposite
directions respectively. Then
                     Gccos0 + GY=Hsin0,
                     Gccos0'-GV = Hsin &.
Hence
           c=Q tan               0 = ^-11^.
Let I denote the length of the wire in the fixed coil, and b the
distance of the needle from its plane. Then
Hence the equation for J becomes
     J= [r'/(i+ -p-)] jpj tan Mfl + flQBin j(fl-y)

   I shall discuss in order the quantities contained in this
expression.
   R', the resistance of the secondary circuit, is the sum of the
resistances of the 30,000-ohm coil, the sine-galvanometer, and

        in Terms of the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat.         5
connecting wires. The whole was measured by connecting
the terminals of the circuit with a Jenkin-bridge and com
paring with other coils, using a high-resistance Thomson-
galvanometer. The provisional standard was a 10-ohm coil,
A, made by Warden, Muirhead, and Clarke. From this coil
the resistance of a 100-ohm standard, B, was obtained by means
of a comparator, C, of ten coils, each nearly equal to A, each
coil of C being compared with A, and C in series then com
pared with B. Then A, B, and C were arranged to form a
bridge with D, a 1000-ohm standard, whose resistance was
thus fixed. E and F, two 1000-ohm coils of a resistance-box,
 were then compared with D. Finally, a bridge was formed
with A, B, D + E + F, and R', the secondary circuit, giving
 R' in terms of A. Elliott's coils were used in making the
adjustments, which were always very small, and the tempera
 tures were carefully observed. The result is
                    R'=30012-4 at 19°-3 0.
R' consisted principally of the 30,000-ohm coil, and the varia
 tion of this only need be considered. Its temperature varied
 from 19° to 24° when in use, the mean temperature being
 22°-3 0. At this temperature R' = 30052, which value was
used throughout.
    The length of the wire in the fixed coil was determined by
 measuring with a steel tape the distance between two threads
 fastened on the wire before it was placed on the circle. When
 the wire was in position, the interval of a few centimetres
 between the threads was measured. The tape had been com
 pared with standards. Care was taken to avoid difference of
 tension in the two positions of the wire. The result is
                         1= 264-49 centim.
    The quantity b (the excentricity of the needle) was esti
 mated by holding the tape horizontally over the top of the
 circle, and reading the positions of the centre of the wire and
 the galvanometer-fibre. For most experiments b = l"2 centim.
 It was frequently remeasured, and a correction applied when
 it varied. The method of measurement is not very accurate ;
 but an error of 10 per cent, in b, which could hardly occur,
 would only involve an error of 1 part in 3000 in J.
    G7 had been determined by Professor Rowland* by mea
 surement during the construction of the coil, and also by
 comparison with another coil. The values are 1832*24 by
                 • Silliman's American Journal, 1878.

6      Dr. Fletcher on t/ie -Determination of the B.A. Unit
measurement and 1833"67 by comparison. The mean, giving
the second value twice the weight of the first, is 1 833- 19.
    Hence the constant term = 10996 + 10'.
    G' has recently been remeasured and found to be 1832-53.
My final result is corrected to this value.
    H was measured in the following manner :—The circle
bearing the fixed coil carried four smaller wires, which could
be connected with the battery and an electrodynamometer of
 the form described in Maxwell's treatise. These four wires
 with the needle formed a tangent-galvanometer, the other
 coils being open. Eight pairs of simultaneous readings of
 the galvanometer and electrodynamometer were taken, coin-
 prising all possible combinations of signs of the currents in
 the galvanometer and the two electrodynamometer-coils. I
 am greatly indebted to Professor S. H. Freeman, then Fellow
 of the University, for assistance in these readings.
     The expression for H is
 where C is a function of the dimensions of the electrodyna
 mometer-coils, I the moment of inertia of the suspended coil,
  n the number of turns of wire in the galvanometer, I' the
  mean length of one turn, V the mean distance of their planes
  from the needle, T the time of vibration of the small coil,
  a and <f> the mean deflections of electrodynamometer and gal
 vanometer.
     C was known from measurements during the construction
  of the instrument, and I had been determined by observing
  times of vibration with and without the addition to the sus
  pended coil of bars of known moment of inertia. These values
  of C and I had been verified by Dr. E. H. Hall and myself, in
  connection with a previous research, by comparing the values
  of H obtained by this method and by the magnetic method,
  the arrangement of the experiment being such as to make the
  two results obtain for the same point and time. The value of
  CVT is 0-18567.
      The measurements of I' and b' were made in the same
   manner as those of I and b.
      The results are Z' = 263'91 cenrim., 6' = 2*07centim., for most
  experiments. A correction was applied when V varied. Hence
      Each of the angles, a and if>, is the mean of eight readings

        in Terms of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.           7
taken to 1'. The former was about 13°, the latter 6°. T was
obtained by observing ten transits with a seconds-clock, allow
ing the coil to vibrate for several minutes, and then taking ten
more transits. The difference between the mean times of the
two series divided by the number of vibrations gives T very
exactly. The difference between the values before and after
the experiment never exceeded 1 part in 3000. The mean
value is about 2"42 seconds. H was determined before and
after the main experiment.
   The quantities in the formula for J remaining to be dis
cussed are t, A, and the deflections. To treat these intelligibly,
I proceed to describe the method of experiment exactly.
   First, a determination of H was made. The calorimeter was
then weighed, filled with distilled water at a temperature
usually 2° or 3° below that of the air, carefully wiped with a
towel to remove moisture, again weighed and placed in the
water-jacket. Its amalgamated electrodes were placed in the
mercury-cups with the terminals of the two circuits, the main
circuit being broken at the commutator. The water-jacket was
kept permanently filled, and stood in a room of fairly constant
temperature, so that its temperature changed little during the
experiment. The thermometer was placed in position and the
stirrer started. During a few minutes readings were taken of
the thermometer and of three auxiliary thermometers, giving
the temperatures of the jacket, the 30,000-ohm coil, and the
air near the stem of the principal thermometer, the time of
each reading being noted by a seconds-clock. The circuit was
then closed and a galvanometer-reading taken, one of the com
mutators was reversed and another reading taken, the time of
each reading being noted. The time of passage of the mercury
of the thermometer over several successive scale-divisions was
then taken, also readings of the other thermometers. Two more
commutator-reversals and galvanometer-readings followed,
then another set of thermometer-readings; and this alternation
was continued for about 40 minutes, during which time the
 thermometer rose about 12° G. Usually sixteen galvano
 meter-readings were taken and seven groups of thermometer-
 readings comprising 35 or 40 readings of the principal ther
 mometer. Then the circuit was broken and the calorimeter
 allowed to cool for two or three hours, during which time
 groups of readings were taken as before, the stirrer being kept
in motion. While this radiation-experiment was in progress
another determination of H was made. Finally, the thermo
meter was removed and the calorimeter taken out and weighed.
   The mean of each group of thermometer-readings, corrected
for stem error, gives very exactly the temperature of the ther

8     Dr. Fletcher on the Determination of the B.A. Unit
mometer for the mean time of that group. The difference
between any two of these mean temperatures, corrected for
radiation, gives by multiplication into the capacity of the
calorimeter and contents the heat generated in the interval.
Hence any two groups give a determination of J when com
bined with the proper values of 0 and 6'.
   I have combined groups taken 18 to 25 minutes apart, the
rise of temperature being 6° to 8°.
   In this calculation the differences of temperature of coil,
water, and thermometer are assumed to bo constant for this
interval. The water is cooler than the coil, and the thermo
meter cooler than the water. Both differences depend upon
the rate of generation of heat, and may be put approximately
proportional to the square of the current. The rise of the
thermometer after breaking the circuit is due to these dif
ferences, and was found to be less than 0O-05. The variation
of this quantity during the interval in question would be
about 3 per cent., as the current changed To per cent. Hence
the variation is 0o,0015; and as the rise of'the thermometer is
6° or 8°, the error is negligible.
   Two thermometers were used, designated as Baudin (J165,
and Baudin 7320. The former is graduated in millimetres, of
which about 12 equal 1° C. It had been used by Professor
Rowland in his determination of the mechanical equivalent,
and compared several times with the air-thermometer. Baudin
7320 is graduated to 0O-l C, one degree occupying about a
centimetre. It had been compared with standard thermo
meters, its errors plotted, and the error for each degree obtained
from the curve. The following tables give the reduction to
the absolute scale :—

   The table for 6165 is condensed from Professor Rowland's
paper* on the mechanical equivalent. Change in the zero
point has no effect on the differences of temperature used, but
the zero points were determined occasionally in order to get
the mean absolute temperature.
   The correction for radiation was made in the following
manner :—The groups of thermometer-readings taken after
breaking the circuit were reduced to mean readings at mean
times. Any two of these mean readings gave the radiation
for the intervening time. If tl and l" are the temperatures
at the beginning and end of an interval of T minutes, and t
is the mean temperature of the jacket during the interval, then
                     f-t" = cT[i(f + t")-rl
where c is the coefficient of radiation. In the calculation of
c, stem-corrections were applied and a correction made for the
heat generated by the stirrer. Hence in the main experiment
the temperature-correction for an interval T' is
                    A = cT'[J(Y-rV')-T,] + K,
where *' and s" are the observed temperatures corrected for
stem-error, t' is the mean temperature of the jacket, and K is
the stirrer-correction. The sum of the corrections A from the
beginning of the experiment added to the stem-corrected ob
served temperature at any point, gives the temperature which
 would have been reached in the absence of radiation. The
difference between any two of these theoretical temperatures
multiplied by the heat-capacity, gives the heat generated in
the interval.

   The coefficients of radiation were found to decrease with
decreasing difference of temperature between calorimeter and
jacket. When this decrease was regular the corresponding
value of c was used for each small interval of the main ex
periment. When the decrease was small and irregular the
mean value of c for that day w:is used throughout. In the
revision of the calculations, stem- and stirrer-corrections were
neglected in the calculation of both c and A, it being obvious
that, both being small and quite regular, they are eliminated
in this way; and the value of c corresponding to the difference
between calorimeter and jacket for each small interval of the
main experiment was used in all cases. The mean results of
the two methods differ about 1 part in 1000, and the figures
in the table of results below are the means of both calcula
tions. The mean values of c for the different experiments
vary between 0°-0035 and 0°-0046, the general mean being
0°-0040.
   The mean radiation-correction is about 5 per cent., and is
the most important source of variable error in the experiment,
as the temperature-differences are small, and errors of reading
have a large effect. But a 10-per-cent. error in the radiation
would only involve an error of 1 part in 200 in J; and as the
errors are irregular they are, in a great measure, eliminated
from the final result.
   The calorimeter was composed of 246 gr. copper, 45 gr.
brass, and 6 gr. solder. The specific heat of a mixture of
these proportions was measured with Regnault's apparatus.
Six determinations gave the value "0898 + *0005 for the mean
specific heat between 24° and 100°. Reduced by Bede's law
for copper to the mean temperature of my experiments, it
becomes '0877. The capacities of the coil and glass rods
were calculated from published tables. The whole capacity
is as follows :—
        Calorimeter .... 302-1 x -0877 = 26-49
        Coil                        32-5 x -0324= 1-05
        Glass rods ....              9-0 x -177= 1-59

                       Total capacity .... 30-4
   The values of the deflections were obtained b}r a graphical
method. The galvanometer-readings fell into 4 groups, lying
about 26° and 3° 45' on each side of the zero-point. The
readings of each group were plotted separately as functions of
the time. From each curve the theoretical mean readings for
each interval between two temperatures used in the calcula

         in Terms of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.                    11
tion of J were obtained by measuring a large number of
equidistant ordinates, calculating the area of the curve, and
dividing by the base-line. If a, b, c, and d are the mean
readings thus obtained, 20 = a—b and 20' = c— d as the galva
nometer was graduated from 0° to 360°. Thus the zero-
point was not used, though observed before and after each
experiment.
   Below are the results of one experiment in detail. Each
value of J is calculated from the two temperatures found in
the same horizontal line.

     The greater number of results on Nov. 24 is due to the
  fact that single thermometer-readings were taken instead of
  groups. The two experiments with 7320 show the greatest
  variation from the mean; but the mean of these two agrees
  closely with the general mean. Experiments made ou Nov.
  29 and Dec. 6 were rejected on account of leakage of 3 and
  6 grams respectively. The results, however, are 4220 and
  4227, falling within the limits of the series. The duration of
  the experiment was less than one fifth of the interval between
  the two weighings of the calorimeter ; and probably the loss
  during the experiment was the same fraction of the whole loss.
  Furthermore, the leakage during the radiation-experiment
  would affect the radiation-coefficient in such a manner as to
  approximately compensate for the effect of leakage during
  the main experiment. For these reasons I have retained the
  experiments of Jan. 26 and Feb. 16, which showed a leakage
  ofl gram and 1*5 gram respectively, but have given the results

        in Terms of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.        13
half the weight of the other. The remaining experiments are
satisfactory in this respect, the loss being a few tenths of a
gram, due principally to the removal of the thermometer.
   The result of the experiment is J = 42,039,000 0, where 0
is the value of one tenth of the 10-ohm coil in earth-quadrants
per second. Reduced to the new value for the constant of the
sine-galvanometer, it becomes J = 42,055,000 0.
   I have also calculated the experiment from the formula
     <?Rt
J= -jr—, where R is the resistance of the calorimeter-coil as
measured in the ordinary manner, corrected to the mean tem
perature of the water, and further corrected for superheating.
I estimated the superheating from observations of the main
and derived currents when the strength of the former was
                            c'R'
varied. The expression —— should give the true resistance
of the coil at any instant.   When the currents are smaller, the
                                                            c'R'
superheating is less, and the comparison of the value of —
for a zero-current, obtained by graphical extrapolation, with
its value for the full current, should give the superheating.
The method is not very accurate, as the observations with
the smaller currents are uncertain. I find the increase of
resistance due to superheating to be about 1 part in 700, cor
responding to a difference of temperature of 2° C. When
this correction is applied, the second method of calculation
gives J = 42,1 56,000 0.
   This result depends upon the square of the main current ;
and as the temperature of the coil changed 6° or 8° during the
experiment, its mean resistance is somewhat uncertain. Hence
this result has not the weight of the former.
   The discovery of this discrepancy has greatly delayed the
publication of this paper. It may be due to conduction
to the water, which was guarded against by varnishing the
wire and using distilled water, but was not proved to exist.
For let E be the difference of potential of the ends of the
coil, e the E.M.F. of polarization, R and r the resistances
of coil and water respectively. Then the current in the coil is
C= S, and the current in the water is c =       ->

             E(C+c)=f[1+ ?(>-!)].
   In the second method it is computed as
            (C + c)sR=                       I)] + smaller terms.
E was over 6 volts, « is about 1*5 volts. Hence the second
result is larger than the first, which agrees with the facts,
and the error of the first is less than one fourth of the differ
ence between the two. The discussion shows that the first
method of calculation is to be preferred; and I therefore take
J = 42,055,000 0 as the result.
   Since the completion of my experiments, a 10-ohm Elliott
standard in the possession of the University has been com
pared with the Cambridge standards and found correct at

II. Summary of Lecture on Calculating Machines, delivered
    be/ore the Physical Society of London, March 28, 1885, by
    Joseph Edmondson, of Halifax*.
CALCULATING machines are of two classes, the automatic
         and the semi-automatic. The former were invented by
Mr- Charles Babbage between 1820 and 1834, and were de
signed mainly for the computation of tables. When the primary
factors of a table are placed on such a machine, it will calcu
late the table and impress it line by line upon a stereo-mould
 with great celerity and absolute correctness. Mr. Babbage's
machine, so far as it was completed, is in the South Kensing
ton Museum ; and another machine by M. Scheutz (for the
principles of which he confessed his indebtedness to Mr. Bab
bage) is in the office of the Registrar General at Somerset
 House. These machines proceed by the method of Differences,
 and are therefore termed " Difference-Engines." Their work
 is limited to addition, but they indirectly perform subtraction
 by adding the complement of the subtrahend.
     If it be required to construct a table (of cubes for instance),
 the law of its growth must be found by reckoning mentally
 the first few terms of the table. Placing them in a line, the
 difference between each term and its successor is placed under
 the former. This process is repeated with the differences
until at last a line is reached in which all the differences are
cyphers. Thus :—
           Table ... A            1    8 27 64 125 216
           1st difference B       7 19 37 61 91

           4th      „      E      0    0
     The machine may now be set to work by placing the first
 column of figures in their respective places upon it. During
 the first half of the first revolution of the machine, the wheels
 containing the terms A and C have the terms B and D added
 on to them and become 8 and 18 respectively. During the
 second half-revolution, B and D have the terms C and E added
 on to them, becoming 19 and 6 respectively, and the second
 column is complete. Each succeeding revolution of the

16        Mr. J. Edinondson on Calculating Machines.
machine similarly produces each succeeding column, the upper
line being the term required for the table.
   The apparatus consists of identical parts, equal in number
to the digits required for the last column of the tables it is to
compute. It is therefore very complex and very costly, and
will not serve the purpose of computers in general, who must
have recourse to the semi-automatic class of instruments.
These are portable, of moderate cost, allow of very rapid
working, and require no special mathematical skill.
   In lt>G3 Sir Samuel Moreland produced an instrument by
which additions and subtractions could be worked, digit by
digit ; but it took more time than the ordinary mental opera
tion. It was left to Viscount Mahon (afterwards Earl of
Stanhope) to produce the first really practical instrument.
Besides a machine dated 1780, which was a great advance on
that of Sir Samuel Moreland, though on the same lines, he
invented three machines. Those of 1775 and 1777 were on
the table for inspection after the lecture, and abound in beau
tiful and effective contrivances. The third machine the lecturer
had not seen, and it has never been described. In that of
1775 is found the " Stepped Reckoner," the basis of the only
instruments that have come into extensive use.
   The reckoner of the modern machines, patented in 1851 by
M. Thomas de Colniar, consists of a cylinder divided into
10 sections, on which there are respectively 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, and 9 teeth. The teeth of one section being coincident
with an equal number of those of the next section, the whole
presents a stepped appearance. Each revolution of this
reckoner moves a pinion of 10 teeth, in gear with one of its
sections, as many teeth as there are upon that section. The
motion of the pinion is communicated to a dial with the digits
0 to 9 in orderly succession upon it. Thus, if the figure seen
through an aperture in the covering of the dial were 0, and
the pinion were in gear with the section having 3 teeth, the
first revolution of the reckoner would move the dial to 3 ; the
second to 6 ; the third to 9 ; this result being the multiple of
3 (teeth on the reckoner) by 3 (revolutions). A series of,
say, 8 reckoners, pinions and dials, each pinion being set to
the section having 3 teeth, would give in 3 revolutions the
product 99,999,999. The next revolution would bring in a
new feature—the carrying of the tens. Here lies the great
difficulty of Calculating Machines ; but the difficulty has been
overcome, though not without leaving room for improvement.
The 1 that will have to be carried from each dial to that im
mediately on its left cannot be pdded while the latter is being
operated upon by its reckoner. The machine must therefore

          Mr. J. Edmondson on Calculating Machines.            17
make an independent note of it until it can be dealt with.
Each dial has a tooth (the primary carrying-tooth) which
makes this note at the moment that the dial passes from 9 to
0, by pushing along the axis of the reckoner belonging to the
next higher digit a sliding-piece which revolves with the
reckoner and carries a single tooth (the secondary carrying-
tooth). Above this sliding-piece, and upon the same axis as
the pinion in gear with the reckoner, is a second pinion of
10 teeth. Before the sliding-piece was moved by the primary
carrying-tooth, the secondary carrying-tooth passed on the
side of this second pinion without affecting it ; but being now
brought into line with it, the pinion will be moved 1 tooth,
and will therefore add 1, as soon as the reckoner has added its
own proper number ; so that the fourth revolution, giving the
product of 33,333,333 by 4, brings the dials to 133,333,332.
 When the secondary tooth has done its work, an incline on
its side comes in contact with a projection on the frame of the
machine, which restores it to its original inoperative position.
Each reckoner is set to operate a little later than its neighbour
to the right, so that the carrying on the latter may be com
pleted before that on the former is commenced. The before-
named blank space on the reckoner is to allow time for the
carrying ; and for a " dead-point " in the machine, at which
the first-named pinions, which are movable longitudinally on
their axes, may be set to their required sections of the reck
oners, and other changes may be made in the setting of the
machine. The position of the pinions is shown by indicators
on the face of the machine, each of which can be set to any
required figure.
   Each pinion communicates its motion to its dial by bevel-
gear in the well-known combination of three wheels, which
permit the action to be reversed at will, so that the change
from + to — or from x to -f- is made instantaneously.
   In multiplying by more than a single digit, the dials require
to change their position in relation to the multiplicand, to
imitate the "stepping" of the lines in long multiplication.
They are therefore placed in a slide which can be moved, step
by step, from right to left or vice versa.
   Up to a recent date the machine of M. Thomas de Colmar
was the only one in use. A few years ago Mr. George B.
Grant, of Boston, Mass., brought out an instrument somewhat
on the lines of the Stanhope machine of 1777. It is very-
compact, is beautifully and substantially made ; but as sub
traction is performed by adding the complement of the
subtrahend, reversing is so tedious as to be fatal to the
general adoption of the machine. Its range is also very

18        Mr. J. Edmondson on Calculating Machines.
limited, and there are other defects inherent in the method of
its construction.
   Still more recently Mr. Tate, of London, has introduced a
machine on the lines of M. Thomas, in the internal mechanism
of which there are several improvements. The workmanship,
too, is very superior to that of the French instrument.
   Mr. Edmondson (the lecturer) having, in practice, found
certain inconvenient limits to the utility of these machines,
conceived the idea of obviating them by throwing the instru
ment into the circular form, and thus obtaining an endless
instead of a limited slide. This has produced a machine of
greatly extended powers ; for it can deal with a multiplier or
dividend of any number of figures, and can carry a quotient
to any number of decimal places. But its chief utility does
not consist in dealing with such largo numbers. It frequently
happens that quotients produced on a machine require to be
 further operated upon ; but as in the straight machines they
 are recorded on a special set of dials, which are not in the
general working line, they must be transferred by hand before
they can be dealt with in any other way than as multipliers.
 In the circular machine they come up in the working line
 ready for further operations. The circular form, in fact,
 gives a certain elasticity in the applications of the machine
which could not be described within the limits of the lecture,
 and which can only be appreciated by actual use of the in
 strument. Although the special set of dials for recording
 multipliers and quotients are dispensed with as non-essential
 in the circular machine, they could be easily and conveniently
 added, and would still further extend the powers of the
 instrument.
   The lecturer expressed his indebtedness to the following
gentlemen for the loan of valuable instruments on the table,

to the lecturer himself, attracted much attention after the

III. On a New Law, analogous to those known under the names,
    Law of Avogadro and Law of Dulong and Petit. By J. A.
    GROSHANSf.
WHEN the boiling-points and densities of substances are
          compared with their atomic composition, we find that
there is a law regulating this relationship which is analogous
to the laws mentioned in the title of this paper.
    I have called this law, The Law of " Density Numbers."
The density numbers (Densitatzalden) form a new class of
constants, which present themselves as attributes of the ele
ments, and are of the following nature.
    They are whole numbers. Each element possesses only
one, which may be easily determined ; but two or more
elements may possess the same number.
    Table I. contains a list of these new constants so far as they
have yet been determined. An asterisk affixed to a number
denotes that this is the number which appears to mej>robably
the correct one, but that verification is necessary. I venture
to hope that, when the scientific public realize the interesting
nature of this new law, the constants given in the Table will
be rigorously verified, and the gaps at present so numerous
 will then be filled up.

20                 M. J. A. Groshans on the
   The density-numbers of the elements increase with their
atomic weights, but are not proportional to these.
   The exact nature of these numbers is not yet distinctly
made out ; but the following provisional hypothesis, which,
I believe, may ultimately prove to be correct, will help in
forming a conception of their nature.
   According to this hypothesis, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
are simple bodies ; but the other elements are compounds of
other simple substances, the number of atoms of which is
shown by the density-number of each element.
   The law itself may be enunciated in the following simple
form :—
   " The densities of substances are proportional to the density-
numbers."
   For example, in the case of two compounds of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen (comparable with one another), and
with the formulae CpH„Or and Cy H^O,/, if n and »' equal the
sum otp + a + r and p + </ + r1 respectively, and the densities
are 8 and 8,
               8    n      n n'                  ,
               =7 = —, or -k = 57 = constant = k.
               & w         8 8'
   The law of Avogadro leads in the same way to a constant ;
for if the vapour-density of a substance at 0° C. and 760 mil-
lim. equals D, and its molecular weight is a, then
               ^r. — —.. whence ^ = constant.
               D' a'             D
This constant is unique, and is true of all bodies which can
be converted into vapour. Such is not the case, however,
with the law of molecular specific heats (axe). This constant
differs in the various groups of compounds ; each group
possesses a single constant which is peculiar to it. The law
of density-numbers resembles in this respect that of Dulong
and Petit.
   This new law is applicable to substances in every state of
aggregation ; but it is necessary that the substances should
be compared under similar conditions, such as :—
   (1) as gases at the boiling-point;
   (2) as liquids at the boiling-point ;
   (3) as solids (crystals hydrated or anhydrous);
   (4) in very dilute solutions.
   When dealing with substances which contain only carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, I shall continue to use the letter n for
the sum of the numbers of density ; but when other elements
enter into the composition of a body, I shall employ B to
indicate the above sum.

                     Law of Density-Numbers.                  21
   In the following pages I shall endeavour to give a fairly .
complete account of" the numerous applications of this law,
the study of which has occupied my leisure hours for many
years, ever since a happy chance disclosed to me a special
case, an account of which was published in Poggendorff's
Annalen, lxxviii. (1849) p. 112.
    When the law is applied to hydrated crystalline salts con
taining the same number of molecules of water, a hitherto
concealed relationship is discovered.
    If B is the sum of the numbers of density of the salt, and
S its density, it is found that ^ = k for all salts with similar
formulae and containing the same amount of water of crystal
lization, as will be seen from Table II., which contains the
data relating to six salts of the general formula MBj . 6H2 0.
 B in this case is equal to the sum of the density-numbers for
 the anhydrous salt plus 18, which is the value of B or n for
 H20. Thus, a reference to Table I. shows that CaCl2 6 H20
has B=7 + 2(4) + 6(3) = 33.

    The data for this table and for others are taken from the
 collections made by Landolt and Bornstein, Clarke's ' Constants
 of Nature,' and the experiments of Bodeker, Playfair and
 Joule, Schroder, Topsoe, and others on the densities of com
 pounds.
      The table shows clearly enough that the volumes k are
 practically equal, and by means of such groups it is possible
  to determine the density-numbers for the various elements.
  All the density-numbers in Table I. have been determined by
 employing the data given by hydrated salts and (where pos
 sible) the boiling-points, and the densities of aqueous solutions
 as well as all other available analogous data.
     At this point I shall return to Table I., in order to bring
  forward some views of a more general nature regarding the
  density-numbers.

                                     Triads.
   The name of Triads has been given to groups of elements
such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine, or phosphorus, arsenic,
and antimony ; and I shall retain the name, notwithstanding
the fact that each group contains at least four elements. Of
these four elements three are characteristic, while the fourth
may be regarded as a precursor, which, although participating
in the nature of the three principal elements, yet is distinct,
and possesses properties more or less different.
   The following table contains twenty elements arranged in
five triads. I have chosen those which appear to be complete,
and have added to the table the atomic weights and the
density-numbers with their differences.
   The density-numbers of the three principal elements in each
triad have a constant difference, which is in two of the groups
five units, in the other three six units.

elements all lie between 44 and 49*5. The equality of this
difference in the same triad is only approximate ; and the
opinion, formerly held, of their exact equality h;is been ren
dered untenable by the experiments of Stas and Marignac, as
shown in Table IV.

    Among the elements in Table I., besides those included in
the above triads, are to be found groups of two or more
 elements which present the same properties as the triads.

    The difference of 16 in the atomic weights does not corre
 spond to a constant difference in the density-numbers ; but a
 difference of 45 to 48 corresponds to 5, as is seen in Table VII.

pair, where the difference in the atomic weights 135 = 3 x 45,
that in the density-numbers = 15 = 3 x 5 ; but that this is
not the case with lead and tin ; for while the difference in
atomic weights ( = 89 = 2x45) is double, the difference in
density-numbers is treble. In time, I trust, as the gaps in
Table I. are filled up, it will be possible to extend and
generalize considerations of the above nature.

law to hydrated crystals, and shall apply it to the results of
the well-known experiments of Schiff on the density of alums

    I have omitted from the table the data for the compounds
in which potassium is replaced by ammonium. The value of
k is here also constant, but slightly greater than that for the
potassium compounds. The salts here considered have ap
proximately equal molecular volumes*. Thus the alums are
thus related :—

        Application of the Law to Bodies in Vapour at the
                             Boiling-point.
    If the boiling-point be s° Centigrade, and Da be the density
of the vapour at that temperature, the pressure being 760
millim., then T = 273 + s°; and the laws of Avogadro and Gay-
Lussac may be expressed thus :—
                            Ds _a        T'
                           DV~a' X T'

                            Ds _B
                           DV ~ B''
Hence it follows that
                           — = constant :

   • The equality (approximate) of the molecular volumes of isomorphous
bodies, which was long ago recognized, may be regarded as to some extent
an anticipation of the law of density-numbers, and may be explained as
follows :—
                     TO
  The constants it = — are equal according to the law. In certain cases
(such as the salts in the table) the relation (^j between the atomic
weight and the density-numbers is nearly the same for different members
                                                         a
of the same group ; hence it follows that the values of j (that is, the
molecular volumes) are approximately equal.

    Connection between the different Values of the Constant — .
    In an homologous series one observes generally certain
properties common to all the members ; e. g. :—
    (1) A regular increase in the boiling-points of the succes
sive members of the same series.
    (2) The amount of this increase varies slightly, but is from
16° to 20° for every addition of the group CH3. It was for
merly supposed that the differences were equal ; but, so far
as experiment has gone, we are able to point to only approxi
mate equality.
    In order to apply the law of density-numbers to homologous
series, it will be convenient to number the members of a series
1, 2, 3, 8fc, according to the place in the series occupied by
each. I shall call these numbers mi thus benzol has m=4;
it is therefore the fourth member of its series according to the
new Law, though at present the first one known*.
    Table XI. contains the substances each containing fourteen
atoms of hydrogen ; each is the seventh member of its respec
tive series, for m here equals 7. Such substances I shall call
 " corresponding " compounds. They have, as a rule, similar
properties, and have frequently the same constants Tn/a.
    1 may now sum up the results of observations on the con
stants — as follows :—
          a
    (1) These constants, of which we have already met two
 (62'2 and 73"6), form an algebraic series of numbers which
are the same for all bodies, whether metals or non-metals, and
their compounds.
    (2) In an homologous series the constants increase with the
successive additions of CH2, i. e. with the value of m.
    (3) There are numerous homologous series the correspond
ing members of which possess the same constant, e. g. :—

    The first three substances in Table XIV. do not exist, and
it is very commonly found that the first members of homo

to be met with : thus the series C H2n+3 gives rise by sub
stitution to C»H2n+iCl and CBH2»Cla. And all the corre
 sponding members of the three series possess the same

     The first members of the substituted series are chlorine and
hydrochloric acid, which both have x= 1*.
     As a general rule, the value of x is a whole number, but it
 sometimes happens that this is not the case. Thus, x=3% for
acetic acid, C9H40j; acetic anhydride, C4H603; and a
 similar substance differing from the anhydride in possessing
one atom of oxygen more, C4H604, methyl oxalate. All the
three are well known to behave anomalously. Thus the
vapour-density of acetic acid is abnormal. All three are solid
at temperatures below which their higher homologues are still
liquid ; and, finally, the aqueous solution of acetic acid is
 remarkable for possessing a maximum of density at 80 per
cent.

CO„, SOa, CSj, &c, we find that the value of x is a fraction much less
than unity.
    Just as eNperiment has shown that there are cases to which the laws
of Avogadro and those analogous to it are not applicable, so we find
si milar cases in which the law of density-numbers no longer holds good.

                  IV. On Colliding Water-jets.
                By H. Frank. Newall, M.A.*
LORD RAYLEIGH has recently (Proc. R. S. vols, xxviii.,
        xxix. 1879, and vol. xxxiv. 1882) investigated many
of the phenomena of liquid jets. I will recall one form of
experiment, and record an observation and a few experiments
bearing on it.
   Two horizontal jets of water, issuing from similar glass
nozzles and fed from two glass bottles, are made to collide at
a small angle. When certain precautions are taken, such as
using clean and tolerably dust-free water, the jets rebound
from one another ; but they are made to unite if each bottle
is connected with the pole of a cell (sach as Grove's or
Leclanche's). It is convenient to introduce a key.
   I have lately, in repeating this experiment, observed that
the colours of thin plates (Newton's Rings) are formed with
remarkable brilliancy between the colliding jets. The jets
are of circular section, but on impact they become flattened
against one another, so that the surfaces of separation aro
more or less plane,and vertical. Between these surfaces, which
 Lord Rayleigh has shown to be electrically insulated from
 one another, there is a very thin film (of air, I presume) in
 which the colours are visible. These afford a mode of obser
vation by which one may possibly gain information as to the
 nature of the action of electricity in determining the coales
 cence of the jets.
    I will first describe the appearance of the colours. The
 case I have examined most carefully is that when the jets
 start in the same horizontal plane and the surfaces of sepa
 ration of the colliding jets are vertical. There is some dif
 ficulty in getting a good view of the colours, on account of
 the corrugations produced in the jets at collision. I have
 found it best to take the plane of incidence of the light hori
 zontal, and to let the light fall against the direction of the
 water in the jets, and very nearly at normal incidence ; and
 I use a magnifying-glass to observe with.
    The figure shows the appearance of the jets about the place
 of collision, the bold lines denoting outline and marks on the
 near surface ; the dotted lines show the isochromatic curves :
 those to the right are those which seem to be least distorted
 by refraction. The bold lines at R show the small stationary
 ripples on the cylindrical surface of the jet just before the
                    • Communicated by the Author.

 32                  Mr. H. Frank. Newall on
 point of collision. The jets come from the right, as shown
 by the arrow.
    The form of the isochromatic curves is more or less con
 stant in character, though the colouring of the figures varies
 with the velocity of the jets and the angle at which they
 collide ; increase in either of these conditions lowers the order
 of the colours produced, as is to be expected. There is a
 certain symmetry in the figure, more marked on the right
 than elsewhere. I describe a particular case> which may be
 taken as a sample of the general appearances.
    Starting, then, from the right, close up to the ripples R,
 there appears green of the fifth order in a straight lino per
 pendicular to the axis of the jet, as shown at 1. The colours
 of higher order I have not made out, on account of the ripples.
 The line 2 is red of fourth order ; line 3 green of fourth
 order ; lines 4 are red of the third order. Here the symmetry
 in colour ceases. Lines 5 show yellow of the third order ;
 and line 6 blue of the third order. The curves appear to be
 drawn in to a point on the left ; but this 1 take to be an effect
 due to refraction through the uneven thickness of the flattened
jet. These broader bands of colour are bordered at top and
 bottom by the colours of higher order succeeding very closely
on one another, as suggested in the figure by the lines 7 ;
 and towards the left at the top, 8, there appear rings, which 1
 imagine are probably seen reflected from within the nearer
jet.
    It is necessary to see that the tubes leading the water from
 the bottles to the nozzles are kept quite still ; otherwise there
are irregularities in the velocity of the jets which give rise
 to flickering in the colours. And in order to keep the con
 ditions of collision as nearly the same as possible throughout
 one set of observations, it will also be found convenient to
 separate the jets, if they coalesce, by holding an electrified
 stick of sealing-wax close to cither of the jets for a moment.
    Having thus found means ofavoiding changes in the colours,
 I proceeded to test the effect of gradually increasing from
 zero an electromotive force across the film of air between the
rebounding jets, by connecting the water in the bottles eiec

                       Colliding Water-jets.                   33
trically with different points on a fine wire, which carries the
current between the poles of a bichromate cell. I have ex
amined the cases when the colours are of tolerably low order,
that is when the separating film is thin ; and I have not been
able to detect any change of colours, pointing to the gradual
approach of the jets. The colours remain constant, until the
electromotive force is raised to such a point that coalescence
takes place ; and then they disappear quite suddenly. I had
determined to give the matter one more trial, wishing to
observe the effects when the jets collide at an extremely small
angle. In this case it may be arranged that the colours pro
duced are not of lower order than the fourth in the thinnest
part of the film. This would be the most delicate means of
testing. But I have been completely foiled in my attempts ;
for the jets persistently refuse to rebound from one another
for longer periods than a small fraction of a second. I attri
bute this to the large amount of pollen in the air, blown from
fir-trees near the house ; for I find quantities of golden powder
collected on my table and elsewhere in the house.
   My observations then, so far as they have gone, eliminate
conclusively the explanation, which Lord Eayleigh has re
ferred to as possible though not probable, namely that the
action of electricity in promoting union may be ascribed to
the " additional pressure called into play by electrical attrac
tion of the opposed water-surfaces, acting as plates of a con
denser" (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxxiv. p. 145).
   The extraordinary capriciousness of union—the jets some
times coalescing with very much smaller electromotive forces
than at other times—made me for a time think that dust
might still be at work ; that the dust, which in the ordinary-
state of the jets is not able to cause coalescence, might, under
the possibly directive influence of the electromotive force
(much as in an experiment described by Faraday), be turned
across the separating surfaces of the jets, and so rupture them.
If this were the case, one would expect that a larger electro
motive force would be required to bring about coalescence,
when the water supplying the jets had been allowed to settle.
I left the water for five days to settle and found no appreciable
difference between the electromotive forces required to pro
duce union, when this " settled " water was used, and when
dusty water was used immediately afterwards. Nor did
diminution in the velocity of the jets affect the magnitude of
the requisite electromotive force.
   Lord Rayleigh regards the union as most probably due to
perforation of the separating skin, brought about by disrup
tive discharge. Let us consider tho case when the colour of

34          MM. Julius Elster and Hans Geitel on the
lowest order produced in the film between the jets is green
of the third order at normal incidence : the thickness of the
film is, roughly speaking, 2|/2 x 6000 x 10-8 centims., that is
 0,000075 centims. It appears that the highest minimum
 electromotive force to produce union is about 0*75 volt. This
gives a difference of potential in volts per centimetre of 10,000.
 Now Sir W. Thomson's experiments show that, to produce a
 spark between brass plates nearly 100 times further apart
 than the jets in the case we are considering, an electromotive
 force at the rate of about 80,000 volts per centimetre is re
 quired. De La Rue and Miiller have lately shown that the
substitution of saturated aqueous vapour for dry air between
the plates does not make any great difference. It is, however,
conceivable that there is diminished pressure between the jets.

     V. Observations on the Electrical Processes in Thunder
        clouds. By Julius Elster and Hans Geitel*.
IN an investigation, with which we have been some time
       engaged, on the production of electricity by the friction
 of finely divided liquids against solids of various temperatures,
we had occasion to observe the exceeding sensitiveness to
electrical induction of disintegrating jets of liquid as well as
of all solid and liquid particles suspended in a current of air.
This action is the chief source of error to be contended against
in such experiments ; and, as we shall have occasion to show
in a subsequent paper, it makes it very difficult to settle the
question whether electricity is produced when water-spray
rubs against cold bodies. The phenomenon has long been
known for jets of liquid, and has already had a practicalappli-
cation in Thomson's drop-collector and the water-induction
machine. It was an obvious idea to consider that inductive
actions of a similar kind are also at work in the processes
which take place in a thunder-cloud—that is, just to regard
the latter as a self-acting duplicator.
    The principle of this idea will be best seen from an experi
ment which can bo made by the simplest means.
    A cylindrical metal tube, A, open at both ends (about
50 centim. long and 8 centhn. in diameter), is fixed vertically
to a lateral insulated holder. A small vessel, B, which is also
cylindrical, can be inserted from the top, being held by an
insulated handle. This latter vessel is closed below, and is
   • Translated from a separate impression from Wiedemann's Annalen,
No. 5 (1885), communicated by the Authors.

              Electrical Processes in Thunder-clouds.          35
provided with an efflux-tube directed downwards and ending
in a narrow aperture. If now a small charge of + electricity
is imparted to the tube A, while at the same time the insu
lated vessel B filled with water is held over it, the drops from
B become negatively electrified, but fall through the tube A
without coming in contact with the sides. By this means B
itself is positively charged, and in an extremely short time
acquires a potential which is not much lower than that of A,
when tbe difference between B and A is not too great. If
now B, while still held by the insulating handle, is rapidly
inserted in A, and touches it momentarily, tbe electricity of
B passes almost completely over to A, according to known
electrostatic laws. If B be withdrawn to its original position,
the same operation may be repeated. It must be remem
bered that A has now a greater charge than before, and that
accordingly B is also more strongly influenced. It follows
accordingly that, by repeating the operation, the charge of A
increases in geometrical progression. In practico the limit is
soon reached. With such a duplicator it is easy to show a
considerable increase in the strength of the charge; it is only
necessary to connect A during the experiment with a gold-leaf
electroscope and to be somewhat quick in moving B. We
observed almost always a self-excitation of the apparatus, so
that after fortyfold oscillation of the vessel B a spark could be
taken from the tube A.
   The process in a thunder-cloud may be considered to be
analogous. Suppose that a given charge of + electricity is
imparted to one place in the lower Layer. As long as the cloud
is not dissolved in rain this electricity remains in nearly the
same place, or only slowly spreads with decreasing potential
over tbe entire cloud according to the conductivity of the
mass of vapour. The case is different when the cloud dissolves
in rain, where it may be assumed that the formation of drops
must take place in the upper, that is the colder, layers of air.
As far as the cloud rains it will acquire positive electricity ;
and if the formation of rain does not begin at too great a height
above the electrical layer, it is of not much lower potential
than the latter. The negatively electrified drops fall to the
earth through the lower inducing layer.
   But now, as has often been pointed out (so far as we know,
first by Hermann J. Klein), the contraction of surface, which
accompanies the formation of rain, must produce an increase
of potential. As the entire mass of cloud which was pre
viously charged with positive electricity by induction aggregates
together, and the individual particles of vapour coalesce to
form larger drops, the electricity is confined with increasing

3(3       On the Electrical Processes in Thunder-clouds.
potential to a smallor space, and must again act by induction
and with increasing power on the newly formed masses of
clouds. As soon as the formation of rain begins in those the
same process is repeated ; by a further aggregation of the
clouds a fresh increase of potential is produced, and so forth.
 It can easily be conceived that in this way the electrical po
 tential of a rain-cloud may go on increasing until discharge
 takes place.
    In the experiment just described the vessel A represents
 the lower inducing layer of cloud ; B the upper rainy part of
 the same. The contraction of surface, although corresponding
 but little to the actual process in the thunder-cloud, is repro
 duced by the introduction of the vessel B into A.
    The question of the origin of the initial charge of the lower
 layer of cloud will not be so easy to answer. In any case a
 very small potential will be sufficient, with a heavy rainfall, to
 be increased to the greatest amount. It is perhaps the ordi
 nary atmospheric electricity which, passing to the clouds,
 produces a greater local charge. Without being kept up
 by the fall of rain, the strongest charge would not last. To
 look upon the condensation of aqueous vapour in itself as
 a source of electricity appears to us inadmissible, as it is not
  clear in what way the separation of the electricities can take
 place in this process. Friction can only explain the initial
  charge, and is quite inadequate to account for the enormous
  disengagement of electricity which takes place in nature.
  We might, moreover, think of a friction of fine aqueous vapour
  against large drops or against hailstones. It is not impro
  bable that the difference between the capillary superficial
  tension of the smallest and largest drops of water may in
  friction produce a separation of the electricities ; but in any
  case such an excitation has not been ascertained with certainty.
  Supposing it, however, to be so, is the vis viva lost in this
 friction sufficient to produce the mechanical equivalent of even
 one flash ?
     It might be urged against the above view, that the diminu
 tion in volume of a cloud consists essentially in the coalescence
 of particles of vapour to form larger drops ; that therefore
 the electricity must accumulate on the latter, and ultimately
 be carried away with it as it falls. This is undoubtedly par
 tially the case. We must, however, remember that for a
 certain time the drops which form in the lower layer of cloud
 must be supported by the ascending current of air, the force
 of which must decrease with the height ; while the drops
 which come from the upper layers must reach the lower layers
 with greater velocity, and consequently must more easily

           On certain Cases ofElectrolytic Decomposition.        37
 overcome the resistance of the ascending air. Part of the
 charge is thus lost, but the part is smaller the more powerful
 is the ascending current. There is, moreover, a continual
 replacement, owing to uninterrupted condensation.
     With very fine rain, which at once falls to the earth, power
 ful charges will scarcely be expected. Much depends, in any
 case, on the rapidity of the formation of clouds and rain. The
rain which falls from a cloud must have the opposite electricity
to the cloud, and can of course act by induction on a second
cloud which it traverses, and which also rains.
    Moreover, after each flash of lightning the remainder of the
electricity will soon attain a maximum if the rainfall is suf
ficient, and the contraction in volume which is inseparable
from it.
    The essence of this theory is that the electricity of thunder
clouds acts by induction, and that the thunder-cloud is a self-
acting duplicator. The rain which falls from it plays the
part of the jet of water in Thomson's drop-accumulator, whilo
the increase of potential is occasioned by the enormous con
traction of volume and surface.
    This theory may claim over preceding ones the following
advantages :—
    (1) It enables us to regard the cloud as an aggregate of
discrete drops of water. Hence a charge imparted to a cloud
does not spread by conduction, but as soon as the cloud begins
to rain spreads from point to point by induction.
    (2) It does not require electrification by friction. It is not
impossible that friction may give the start ; but this becomes
unimportant in the further progress of the phenomenon.
    If it should come out, and a number of experiments we have
tried do not allow us to settle the point, that a production of
electricity by the friction of water-spray or rain against water
or ice cannot be experimentally proved, the presence of
atmospheric electricity is sufficient to start the phenomenon.
    (3) The theory finds the equivalent of the work expended,
in the establishment of a difference of potential, in the vis viva
of the falling drops of water.

88          Assistant-Prof. J. W. Clark on certain Cases
sions respecting their nature, beyond regarding a free motion
of the particles resulting either from fusion or from solution
as necessary for electrolytic conduction. Even this is not
¦without noteworthy exceptions ; for Faraday has described
some binary compound liquids (SnCl4, AsCI3, &c.*) which
neither conduct nor decompose ; whilst, on the other hand,
some compound solids are known which conduct metallically
 (CujSef, Ag2Set, SnS2, CuSf, to which perhaps must be added
 Pb02, Mn02, and Ag20), and some bodies which are solid
 and yet conduct electrolytically (Cu2St, Ag2S§). Further,
 zincic iodide§ neither conducts nor is decomposed when ren
 dered fluid by heat; whilst others (Hgl2§, HgCl2§, PbFl2||)
 have been considered as conducting without decomposition
 under the same circumstances. The nature of the conduction
 of the metallic sulphides is very imperfectly knownlT.
     Whilst thinking over these facts about a year and a half
 ago, it seemed to me very probable that a careful study of
 these exceptions to the general laws of electrolytic decompo
 sition might result in more definite conjectures respecting the
 condition of internal or molecular structure required for con
 duction and decomposition. To make such a study complete
 requires the determination and comparison of a number of
 physical constants [e. g. colour, conductivity, expansion, spe
 cific and latent heat, refractive index, specific inductive
 capacity, &c.) for substances which are normal and abnormal
 in their electrolytic behaviour. This cannot be completely
 done at present for want of data; but before passing to the
 consideration of those bodies to which my own investigation
 refers, I wish to briefly refer to a few previous papers relating
 to substances of remarkable electrolytic behaviour from this
 point of view.
      Hittorf states that sulphide of silver fuses at a clear red
 heat, but at a temperature of 180° C. it is sufficiently soft to
 adapt its shape slowly to that of the surface upon which it
 rests, and at the ordinary temperature it is malleable : a cast
 stick of it can be slightly bent without fracture, and it can be
 cut with a knife or turned in a lathe. This substance has a
 very low resistance, and even at the ordinary temperatures
 is electrolytically decomposable by a feeble current. Hittorf
 (J. c.)has concluded, from a long and careful series of expe
 riments upon it, that it conducts electrolytically only, and that

    || Faraday. Beetz (l'ogg. Ann. Bd. xcii. 1854) has since shown that
 conduction takes place in a normal electrolytic way. Faraday discovered
 that the solid Plumbic Fluoride began to conduct Wow a red heat.
    51 See Faraday, 'Experimental Researches'; and Hittorf (/. c).

                       of Electrolytic Decomposition.                     39
 its apparent metallic conduction results when a fine thread of
 metallic silver has formed between the terminals of the sul
 phide of silver bar.
     Hittorf (I. c.) has discovered that cuprous sulphide also con
 ducts electrolytically " und besitzt entweder gar keine oder
 ganz geringe metallische Leitung." Unlike sulphide of silver
 this body has a high resistance, but, like it, the conductivity
 increases with increased temperature. Cuprous sulphide molts
 at a white heat, and may be cast in the form of a rod which
 at the ordinary temperature is very brittle, although at a
 " higher " temperature it may be bent.
     Hittorf (/. c.) points out the difficulty of proving experi
mentally that the conduction of Cu2S and Ag,S is entirely
 electrolytic, because the formation of copper or silver by the
action of the current in the substance of the bars places
their ends in true metallic communication with the battery-
terminals.
     Cuprous selenide and argentic selenide closely resemble
their corresponding sulphur compounds to which reference
has just been made, and are described as being " soft " and
"slightly malleable" respectively (Watts's 'Dictionary of
Chemistry             Selenides ordinarily closely resemble sulphides
in their physical and chemical relations, and are consequently
regarded as being possessed of similar molecular constitutions,
Hittorf, however, says of cuprous and of argentic selenide,
that " beide sind gute metallische Leiter." Their electrical
behaviour is therefore of an exactly opposite nature to that of
their corresponding sulphur compounds.
    Faraday has noticed that conduction commences in heated
electrolytes at very different degrees of liquefaction and
softening.
    Plumbic chloride* conducts very appreciably at a tempera
ture far below that at which it fuses, and at which it is not
noticeably soft. Beetz (I. c.) has shown that glass begins to
conduct between 200° C. and 220° C, and Dr. Lodge reminds
me that this has recently been shown to take place at 100° C.
    It appears from the behaviour of these bodies that—-
    (i.) In some solid electrolytes there is a sufficient mobility of
the molecules at the ordinary temperature to enable electrolytic
conduction to take place ; in others it is conferred by a rise of
temperature which is insufficient- to render the solid liquid or even
   • E. Wiedemann, Ber. d. Kgl. Sachs. Oesellschaft der Wissenschaften,
1874. I have unfortunately been unable to refer to this paper ; but since
the above was written the author has kindly referred me to ' Die Elektri-
citiitslehrer ' (G. Wiedemann), Bd. i. S. 558, wherein it is stated that the
iodide and bromide of lead behave similarly.

40         Assistant-Prof. J. W. Clark on certain Cases
soft. A rise of temperature which is insufficient, to render a
solid liquid, or so soft as to change its shape, is also sufficient
for the equalization of strain as is shown in the annealing of
glass. Both electrolytic conduction and the annealing of glass
take place more readily at a high than at a low temperature.
    (ii.) Substances of apparently similar constitution may exhibit
oppositeforms of electrical conduction (Cu2Se, Ag2Se, and Ag2S,
CusS).
    Tho bodies to which my investigation refers are mercuric
chloride and mercuric iodide, which Faraday believed to
conduct metallically in the fused condition.
    Beetz, as I have recently found, states in a paper, " Uober
dio Leitungsfiihigkeit fur Elektricitat welche Isolatoren durch
Temperaturerhohung annehmen " (/. c), that he has obtained
evidence of the electrolytic decomposition of fused mercuric
iodide; and he attributes its apparent conduction without
decomposition to recombination of the products. Bo far as I
am aware, no attempt has been made to examine the nature
 of the conduction of fused mercuric chloride since Faraday
concluded that it probably conducted metallically.
                          Mercuric Iodide.
    Mercuric iodide is dimorphic, and at the ordinary tempera
 ture forms a scarlet powder which at 110° C. becomes yellow,
 and at that temperature acquires a very slight electrical con
 ductivity (Beetz). Mercuric iodide melts at 247° C. and
 boils at 342° C. It is an interesting substance on account
 of the ease with which it volatilizes at temperatures much
 below its melting-point ; and it is not unlikely that the ease
 with which the molecules are thus shown to be leaving the
 solid substance may be connected with a high diffusive rate
 when it is fused, and this may partially explain the readiness
 with which the products of its electrolytic decomposition often
 mix and recombine, thus simulating conduction without de
 composition. The mercuric iodide which I have used in the
 following experiments was prepared either by the precipitation
 of recrystallized and sublimed mercuric chloride with pure
 potassic iodide and sublimation of the product, or by the
 sublimation of the commercially pure substance.
    It may not perhaps be out of place to point out, in the first
 instance, the effect of heat upon mercuric iodide ; as it is
 sometimes stated in text-books of Chemistry that, when heated,
 it undergoes partial dissociation with liberation of iodine, where
 the edge of the liquid is in contact with the hot glass vessel.
 I have, however, convinced myself that this statement applies
 only to the commercially pure substance, which on sublima
 tion leaves a little impure oxide of iron, and which, on the

                  of Electrolytic Decomposition.               41
edges of the glass vessel in which fusion and sublimation are
effected, may decompose, yielding free iodine vapour. Pure
mercuric iodide may be fused and sublimed without under
going any such change ; nor have I any reason to believe that,
when strongly heated in a sealed glass tube, iodine is ever set
free, a slight darkening in the colour of the fused substance
being the only apparent alteration which it then undergoes.
   Here, too, perhaps it may be convenient to describe the
preparation of the graphite electrodes, which for some years
past I have found very convenient for the decomposition of
such substances as act upon platinum. These electrodes are
best made from the " leads " of Rowney's HH cedar pencils,
which may be easily removed after a few hours' soaking in
water has softened the glue sufficiently to allow of the pencil
being split in half. The " lead " is then removed with a knife,
and only requires heating to bright redness in a Bunson-
flame (to get rid of the shellac (?) which it contains) to render
it fit for use. A platinum wire twisted or bound round one
end makes a good connection for the battery-terminals.
   When pure mercuric iodide in a sealed glass tube is kept
in a state of fusion over a gas-flame, and electrolyzed by
means of two platinum-wire electrodes passing through its
ends, evidence of its decomposition may be obtained from the
iodine set free about the + pole, although no mercury is dis
coverable at the negative. The quantity of iodine thus set
free is, however, small, and does not usually seem to increase
with the length of time that the current is allowed to pass ;
whilst the decomposition, judging from the liberation of iodine
vapour about the positive or upper electrode in the tube,
appears to take place at temperatures very little above the
solidifying-point of the liquid mercuric iodide.
   Electrolysis of this substance kept fused in narrow V- and
W-shaped tubes over a gas-flame yields much the same results;
but in such tubes the resistance is very high, and it is more
over difficult to ascertain precisely what is taking place within
them. I therefore adopted a simple V-shaped glass tube of §ths
of an inch diameter and bent at an angle or about 30°, into
which was placed a sufficient quantity of mercuric iodide for
the experiment. The substance was then kept fused over a
gas-flame, and the two graphite electrodes introduced, one at
each end of the tube. In such a tube the behaviour of the
substance is easily observed ; and by blowing air dried over
chloride of calcium into the end, the issuing vapours are readily
tested for iodine with starch-paper. Under these conditions,
I found that when the substance was at a temperature near
the melting-point iodine could usually be detected with ease,
although at a higher temperature none could be shown to

 42        Assistant-Prof. J. W. Clark on certain Case*
 exist in the free state. A control experiment with fused
chloride of lead, using a current of the same strength and the
same distance between the electrodes, gave evidence of chlorine
without difficulty.
    Hence it appeared possible that this substance conducted
(as Ag2S had been supposed to do) in two ways—(a) electro-
lytically, at a temperature at which it just became liquid; and
(/S) metallically, at higher temperatures. But during some
 observations upon the expansion of fused mercuric iodide in a
thermometer-like tube, I noticed that the liquid underwent
great contraction during cooling from a temperature a little
above the melting-point, accompanied by a distinct loss of
fluidity. To the latter change I at once attributed the evi
dence of electrolytic decomposition, which I had observed at
a corresponding temperature, to be probably due, as it would
be less favourable to the mixing and recombination of the
products of electrolytic decomposition; and I therefore turned
my attention to the construction of an apparatus in which
they should be so separated as to render this less easy.
   The form of apparatus which I finally adopted is shown in
section in fig. 1. The tube (a b c)
containing two small porous bat
tery-pots (<7/), the graphite elec
trode, and the mercuric iodide to
be electrolyzed, is U-shaped, and
the two branches are connected
by a constricted portion (c), which
further materially hinders the
mixing of the fused products of
decomposition in the two branches
of the tube.       This apparatus
passes through a hole in the tin
cover (ji) which supports it, and
dips into the oil in the beake-,
which is heated to the desired
temperature by means of a gas-
flame or sand-bath, at which it is
kept constant by placing the
bulb of the air-thermometer (A)
in communication with a gas-
regulator. When mercuric iodide
is electrolyzed in such an appa
ratus with a current of about 0*02
ampere, iodine is liberated at
temperatures far above the melting-point of the substance.
If the current was too strong the circuit was usually

                  of Electrolytic Decomposition.               A?,
broken, apparently in consequence of the heat generated
at the + electrode volatilizing, or otherwise causing the
mercuric iodide to disappear from the porous pot. After
passing the current for some hours the gas was extinguished,
and when the apparatus had become cool the two branches of
the U-tube were cut asunder and broken open for examination.
In the + branch, both within and without the porous pot,
mercuric iodide and black feathery streaks of iodine were
found which gave the starch reaction, and the upper part of
 the glass tube was coated with volatilized iodine.
    Iodine dissolves freely in- fused mercuric iodide, producing
 but little change in the colour of the latter ; but just as soli
 dification commences, more or less complete separation seems
 to take place with the formation of these black patches rich
 in iodine (and Hg4I6 ?) and an evolution of iodine vapour,
 which in the previous experiments also helped to lead to the
 conclusion that electrolytic decomposition occurred only near
 the melting-point of mercuric iodide.
   The contents of the negative branch and porous pot were found
 to be of a slightly altered colour ; but no free mercury was
 discoverable. Repeated exhaustion of its pulverized contents
 with absolute alcohol revealed the presence of mercuroso- mer
 curic iodide (B-gJo or 2HgI2, Hg2I2), which might perhaps
 be inferred to be the first product of the electrolytic decom
  position of Hgl2, since it is formed when metallic mercury
  and mercuric iodide are titurated together in the proper pro
  portions. Mercuroso-mercuric iodide is ordinarily regarded
  as a distinct compound, and I suppose rightly so ; for it can
  exist without decomposition at a temperature at which mer-
  curons iodide undergoes decomposition with liberation of free
  mercury ; but the stability of this body seems to be greatly
  increased by the presence of a slight excess of mercuric iodide.
  Mercurous iodide (Hg2I2) dissolves readily in fused mercuric
  iodide in the proportion to form mercuroso-mercuric iodide.
  The formation of mercuroso-mercuric iodide by the action of
  the current upon mercuric iodide may therefore be represented
  by
                    (i) 2HgI2=Hg2I2 + I2,
                     (ii) 2HgI2-rHg2I2=Hg4Ia;
  or, considering it to take place in one step,
                         4HgI2=Hg4I6 + I2.
     The action being slow I repeated the experiment, replacing
  the mercuric iodide in the apparatus just described by some
  mercnroso-mercuric iodide precipitated nearly according to the

 44        Assistant-Prof. J. W. Clark on certain Cases
equation
           4KI + 1, + 2N204HgA = Hg4I6 + 4NOsKO.
    The precipitate was then washed, dried, fused, and finally
 sublimed from an evaporating dish on a sand-bath into a clock-
 glass which covered it. The substance contained a little mer
 curic iodide as impurity.
    The products of the electrolytic decomposition of this sub
 stance are mercury and iodine, of which the former is depo
 sited in the metallic condition, apparently according to the
 equation
                        HgJ,=4Hg+3ls;
whilst the iodine is absorbed by the Hg4I6 in the positive
branch of the tube, forming mercuric iodide ; thus,
                      3I2 + 3HgJ6=12HgI8.
    These results may be summarized as follows:—
    The conduction of fused mercuric iodide is electrolytic ; but
 decomposition and recombination may take place so rapidly
 as to give rise to an apparent metallic conduction; but my
 investigation gives no grounds for srq>posing that it does not
 quantitatively conform to Faraday's Laws.
    The causes rendering the proof of its electrolytic decom
 position difficult may be summed up as follows:—
    (1) Iodine is soluble infused mercuric iodide, and so is mer-
 curous iodide, in the latter case tcith the formation of Hg4I6.
    (2) Mercuric iodide is volatile, and the presence of its vapour
 renders the detection offree iodine difficult by the ordinary test,
and also promotes mixture in the electrolytic apparatus by dis
tillation.
    (3) It also seems possible that fused mercuric iodide possesses
 a high diffusive rate, which would further facilitate the mixture
and recombination of theproducts ofits electrolytic decomposition.
    (4 ) The electrical resistance offused Hgl9 is high.
    When pure mercuric iodide is fused over a gas-flame in a
 straight glass tube, ofabout 6 centim. in length and 0'5 centim.
in breadth, and electrolyzed between platinum wire or graphite
electrodes with a current of about O20 ampere, the resistance
shows some remarkable changes. Thus:—In an experiment
which I copy from my laboratory journal, the resistance of the
mercuric iodide in a sealed tube decreased as the temperature
rose, until the needle of the tangent-galvanometer which was
included in the circuit stood at 20 ; and on allowing the
temperature to rise still higher, it fell to 9°. During
cooling the inverse change occurred ; for on extinguishing
the gas and allowing the tube to cool, the needle advanced

                   of Electrolytic Decomposition.               45
from 9° to 20° or 21°, and then fell gradually to 0° as
conduction ceased. The cause of this change in the resist
ance is not very clear. I have assured myself that it is
not due to any impurity in the mercuric iodide employed,
nor is there a sufficient change in polarization of the electrodes
at the different tomperatures to account for it. With a very
feeble current these resistance-changes are not marked, and
indeed may escape observation in an experiment such as that
which I have described. I believe this effect to be due, first
to the formation, and then to the dissociation or other altera
tion at the higher temperature of the morcuroso-mercuric
iodide produced ; in support of which it may bo stated that
mercurous iodide undergoes rapid decomposition with separa
tion of mercury at about the same temperature at which this
change of resistance takes place. Perhaps not entirely uncon
nected with increase of resistance is the heat generated by the
current, in consequence of the transition-resistance at the com
mon surface of the + electrode and fused mercuric iodide,
which may occasion the formation of vapour on the surface
of the electrode. I have observed this give rise to a crepi
tating noise, and to the formation of a wave-motion spread
ing from the + electrode over the surface of the fused
substance, and, under favourable circumstances, becoming
so marked as to throw the whole tube in which the decompo
sition was being effected into violent oscillation.
                        Mercuric Chloride.
   Mercuric chloride far exceeds mercuric iodide in the ease with
which it volatilizes at temperatures below its melting-point. It
melts at 265° C. and boils at 295° C, and is more difficult to de
compose with the current than mercuric iodide. This is to some
extent due to its higher electrical resistance, which prevents
the use of any complex apparatus designed to represent the
products of decomposition and prevent their recombination.
The mercuric chloride which was used was prepared by the
sublimation of the repeatedly recrystallized pure commercial
salt.
    The apparatus with which I have succeeded in effecting the
electrolytic decomposition of fused mercuric chloride is shown
in section in fig. 2, and consists of a glass tube of about |ths of
an inch in diameter bent at an angle of 30°. The porous pots (ab)
and graphite electrodes (c d) project at each end, and the requi
 site temperature was supplied by the hot sand of a sand-bath.
 With potassic iodide and starch test-paper the evolution of chlo
 rine at the + pole was readily detected, even when a very feeble
 current was employed. After the current had been passed

46          Assistant- Prof. J. W. Clark on certain Cases
through the fused mercuric chloride for some time, the appa
ratus was allowed to cool, and its contents were subsequently
                                Fig. 2.
pulverized and exhausted with water, which left an insoluble
residue of mercurous chloride (Hg8Cl2), which was not entirely
confined to the inside of the — porous pot.
    Mercurous chloride dissolves in fused mercuric chloride,
probably giving rise to a mercuroso-mercuric chloride of
analogous composition to some of the well-known double
chlorides which mercuric chloride forms. The want of time
consequent upon the completion of an investigation on the
influence of pressure on electrolytic conduction, upon which I
Lave long been engaged, has prevented my examining this point.
    The conduction of mercuric chloride is electrolytic, giving rise
to chlorine and mercurous chloride; and there seems no reason
to doubt that it conforms quantitatively to Faraday's Law ;
but the volatility of this substance, as also in the case of
mercuric iodide, and of the products of their decomposition,
would render its further proof difficult.
    The causes rendering its electrolytic decomposition difficult
may be summed up as follows :—
    (1) The volatility of mercurous chloride and its solubility in
mercuric chloride.
    (2) The near melting- (2(35° C.) and boiling- (295° C.)
points and great volatility of mercuric chloride facilitate the
 mixing and recombination of the products of its decomposition,
and the vapour renders the detection of chlorine by the ordinary
test difficult.
    (3) As previously stated in reference to mercuric iodide,
 it is possible that the volatility of these substances is con
 nected with a high diffusive rate, when fused, which would
facilitate the recombination of the products of its electrolytic
decomposition.
    (4) The electrical resistance of the fused substance is much
higher than that of the mercuric iodide.
    Before concluding this paper, I wish briefly to refer to the
 properties of fused mercuric iodide and chloride with refer
 ence to the porous battery-pots in which the electrodes were

                    of Electrolytic Decomposition.             47
placed, and which seems sufficiently important to merit a few
words of description. These porous pots were 2 inches long,
\ inch in diameter, and varied from -X inch to i thick in the
walls. My attention was first attracted to their Dehaviour by
noticing that when they were partially dipped into fused
mercuric iodide, that liquid rapidly made its appearance in
the pot; and the subsequent analysis of the substance sur
rounding the porous pots after an experiment, showed the
presence of small quantities of the products of the decompo
sition effected by the current, such as iodine, mercuroso-
mercuric iodide, and mercurous chloride. Control experi
ments with water and with fused plumbic chloride showed
that these liquids were unable to penetrate the walls of the
porous pots.
   The explanation of the facility with which fused mercuric
iodide penetrates the walls of a porous pot and rises within it
beems to be of a complex nature. The imbibition of this fused
substance in the porous walls of the pot is due to capillary
action, and does not account for the liquid filling the pot; for
since it is of a capillary nature, this action must cease as soon
as the inner surface or wall becomes wetted. In the case of a
volatile liquid such as fused mercuric iodide this action may be
somewhat prolonged by its volatilization from the inner surface
of the pot-wall, and by the direct formation of crystals from the
vapour. The subsequent fusion of these crystals will account
for the presence of some liquid mercuric iodide within the
porous pot, but then this action must cease. Moreover this
 explanation apparently requires a difference of tempera
ture within and without the porous pot, which, from some
special experiments made upon the subject, can scarcely be
 assumed to exist ; and I therefore think that the explanation
 of the penetration of the liquid through the walls of the porous
 pot must he mainly sought in an easy transpiration of the fused
 mercuric iodide through its pores in consequence of the small
initial difference of level (" head ") of the liquid.
   I have already stated that analysis showed the presence of
some of the products of decomposition formed within the
porous pots in the undecomposed substance in which the latter
were partially immersed ; and this seems attributable to diffu
sion through the pot-walls. Little seems known respecting
the rates of diffusion of fused substances through porous dia
phragms; but the particular difficulties in the way of their
determination for such volatile substances (which may so
readily mix by distillation) seems of itself suggestive of a
molecular activity not unconnected with a long free mean
molecular path and of rapid diffusion.

 VII. On the Determination of the Heat- Capacity of a Ther
   mometer. By J. W. Clark, Assistant Professor of Physics
   in University College, Liverpool*.
I. TN the determination of specific heats a correction should
    JL be made for that part of the thermometer which is
immersed in the water of the calorimeter, as its specific heat
is not the same as that of an equal volume of water. Very
often this correction is reduced to a mere estimation on
account of the unknown weights of glass and mercury which
constitute the immersed portion of the thermometer.
   When two metals of known specific gravity are fused
together, and the volume of the resulting alloy is the sum of
the volumes of its two constituents, it is only necessary to
know the specific gravity and volume of the piece of alloy
to calculate the exact volumes of the metals comprising it.
Similarly, by determining the specific gravity and volume of
the thermometer, the volume of mercury which it contains can
be at once determined from
                        v — V(S— S8)                              , .

   The mean value of several very closely agreeing determi
nations of the specific gravity of different specimens of ther
mometer-glass is 3-199 for lead-glass and 2-512 for soda-glass.
Should it not be known of which sort of glass the thermo
meter consists, it may be readily ascertained by slowly intro
ducing the upper extremity of the instrument into the re-
ducing-flame of a blowpipe :—Soda-glass yields a vellow
flame, but lead-glass blackens, from the reduction of the oxide
of lead which it contains. It may be assumed that thermo
meters made on the continent consist of soda-glass ; those
mado in England are usually constructed of lead-glass.
   The total volume of the thermometer (V) is obtained
from its weight in air and in water.
   The volume of mercury contained in the thermometer having
been found by (1), the volume of that part of the thermometer
which is immersed in the water of the calorimeter has next to

be determined. This latter volume, less the contained volume
of mercury, is the immersed volume of glass.
   The total immersed volume (V3) of the thermometer is best
found from the weight (W) of the thermometer in air, and its
weight (Wi) when dipped in jvater to the same depth as it
dipped into the water of the calorimeter ; then
                           V3=W«rnL-W1erm-                          (2)
But, if the bulb be cylindrical and of the same diameter as the
stem, this volume may be calculated from the measured length
and diameter of the immersed portion ; for if of an irregular
shape it may be found by plunging it into a burette graduated
in cubic centimetres and partly filled with water j but in both
cases with a less satisfactory result than is given by (2).
   The volume of the glass of the thermometer (V2) immersed
in the water of the calorimeter is then
                              v,=v3-v1.
   These volumes of glass and mercury are converted into
their corresponding weights, using the mean specific gravities
of lead- and soda-glass already given. The sum of the pro
ducts of the weight of the immersed glass and its specific
heat, and of the weight of the mercury and its specific heat,
is the required water-value of the part of the thermometer
dipping into the water in the calorimeter.
    Regnault has given the specific heat of thermometer-glass
as 0*2; but for greater accuracy it would be desirable that for
this value the mean specific heat of lead or of soda thermo
meter-glass should be substituted according to circumstances *.

   To test the reliability of the method, I sacrificed the ther
mometer by cutting off the stem at the level at which it was
immersed in the water of the calorimeter, and weighed the
quantities of glass and mercury: there were9*63and7-64grms.
respectively, corresponding to a water-value of 2*182, which
ascribes to the above method an error of 3*7 per cent, in the
required collection. This negligible error is due to the volume
of the thermometer—consisting, not only ofglass and mercury,
but also of the unfilled bore of the tube—and to slight deviation
of the specific gravity of the thermometer-glass from the mean
specific gravity used in the calculation. It may be just worth
pointing out that when a fragment of the thermometer-tube
is obtained from the maker with the instrument, these errors
may be avoided and the true water-value obtained. Probably
a greater error than the above is introduced into ordinary
specific-heat determinations by the evaporation of the water
in the calorimeter.
   II. A second method for the determination of the water-
value of the immersed part of a thermometer may be employed,
but it requires that the diameter of the bore of the stem be
known. To determine this a fragment of the same thermo
meter-tube may be obtained from the maker of the instrument,
or a short piece of the upper part of the thermometer may be
very easily drawn-off before the blowpipe-flame, the closed
end of the fragment cut off, and the diameter of the bore
measured with a microscope furnished with a micrometer

eye-piece and stage-micrometer. Then the weight of mercury
(to), corresponding to an increase of temperature from 0° to
100° C, is given by
                           to=alxl3-6,                             (1)
where a is the area of the tube and I the length in centimetres
of 100° (<°) on the scale of the thermometer.
    The weight (W) of mercury in the bulb is then
                           W=^o+«>,                                (2)
where a is the coefficient of apparent expansion of mercury
in glass. For lead-glass a=0'000155, and for soda-glass
0-0001586. Having thus determined the quantity of mercury,
the quantity of glass may be found as in the first method.
With a thermometer containing a known weight of mercury,
this method gave a water-value for the immersed part of the
instrument which was 3-2 per cent, in error. I place much
less reliance upon this than upon the former method, as the
apparent coefficient of expansion of glass varies more than its
 specific gravity. The first method is quick and simple, and
 the results so excellent, that this second method may be almost
 regarded as unnecessary; but should any case arise in which it
 is found to possess advantages over the first, it might be possible
 to determine the coefficient by observing the increase in length
 of the thermometer when heated in steam.

  VIII. On the Error involved in Professor Quincke's Method
    of Calculating Surface-Tensions from the. Dimensions of Flat
    Drops and Bubbles. By A. M. Worthiugton, M.A.,
    Clifton, Bristol*.
 IN one of a series of well-known papers (Pogg. Annal.
       vol. cxxxix. part 1 ; and Phil. Mag. April 1871) Prof.
 Quincke has recorded a large number of measures of flat
 drops and bubbles, from which he has deduced the value of
the tensions, not only at the free surface of liquids, but also
 at the common surface of two liquids in contact.
    The numerical results obtained exceed very appreciably
the values of the surface-tensions deduced from observations
with capillary tubes, and Prof. Quincke attributes the diffe
rence partly to the exposure of the surface of the meniscus
in capillary tubes to atmospheric impurities, but chiefly to
the fact that with capillary tubes the edge-angle is not zero,
and that the quantity measured is not the surface-tension of

the liquid, but the surface-tension multiplied by the cosine of
the edge-angle. Thus a special significance has been attached
to the high values obtained by the method of flat drops or
bubbles, and these values have been widely copied and made
the basis of numerical calculations.
   The calculation of the results involves the integration of
the equation to the liquid surface
                   •    *(W')-D*-
   Prof. Quincke starts by writing g;=0, i- e. by assuming
that the drop or bubble may be treated not only as flat at the
vertex, but also as having an infinite diameter. It is true that
in § 5 of the paper referred to he himself comments on the
fact that these assumptions are only approximately correct ;
but he does not attempt to show that the error entailed by
these two assumptions is insignificant. It is the object of
this paper to show that the error is very considerable, amount
ing in most cases to as much as 10 per cent, of the whole
value, and that when duly corrected the values obtained by
this method do not appreciably exceed those obtained with
capillary tubes.
   Prof. Quincke's process consists in measuring by means of
a cathetometer-microscope the dimensions of a large drop or
bubble, such as is represented in section in figs. 1 and 2, that
has been placed on, or below, a horizontal glass plate.
           Fig. 1.                              Fig. 2.
   The dimensions measured are
    1) The distance K of the vertex from the plate.
    2) The distance k of the section of maximum radius from
          the plate.
   (3) The maximum diameter AB.
   The first two measures afford the value K— k of the dis
tance between the vertex and the section of maximum radius,
and the last affords the value L of the maximum radius.
   The physical meaning of the assumptions made in the
calculation may be explained in the following manner.
   Imagine a central slab to be cut out of the drop between
two parallel vertical planes at small unit distance apart, and
that the slab is again cut in half at right angles to its length,

        from the Dimensions ofFlat Drops and Bubbles.          53
so that we realize the portion ABCDE'E of the diagram
(fig. 3).                     Fig. 3.
                                                   T cos 8
   If the drop were of infinite radius, and therefore flat at the
top, the slab thus obtained would be equivalent to a similar
slab cut out of a mass of liquid, shaped as in fig. 4. If we
                               Fig. 4.
 now, on this supposition, consider the equilibrium of the
 mass represented in fig. 3, with reference to horizontal forces
parallel to its length, we can equate the hydrostatic pressure
on the rectangular end to the sum of the tensions exerted
 along the two edges AD and BC.            Thus writing, with
 Quincke, AB = K, and writing D for the difference between
the density of the drop or bubble and that of the surrounding
medium,
                       T+Tcos 6=

 Or, if we consider the equilibrium of that portion only of the
 slab which lies above the horizontal section of greatest area
 (see fig. 5), we may equate T to the hydrostatic pressure on
 the rectangular area of unit breadth and depth (K — k),
                              Fig. 5.

 54    Mr. A. M. Worthington on Calculating Surface-Tensions
    It is from this equation that Prof. Quincke calculates the
 value of T. It is evident that in neglecting the curvature of
 the vertex we are neglecting the pressure due to this curva
  ture transmitted to the whole area K - k. Thus, if b be the
  radius of curvature in question, the pressure disregarded is
  2T
 -^-(K— k). The surface-tension T has to balance this as well
 as the hydrostatic pressure due to the weight of the liquid,
 and neglect of this term will lead to too small a result.
    Again, in neglecting the curvature in the plane at right
 angles to the plane of the diagram, we evidently leave out of
 account the tension exerted along each edge AE, DE', of the
 slab, which produces a pressure ^  T on each unit area of the
 surface.                          w
    Since the surface is one of revolution, R' is the length of
 the normal intercepted by the axis, and writing <f> for the
 inclination of the normal to the axis measured on the side of
 the vertex, i. e. for the edge-angle of the drop- or bubble-
 forming fluid at any horizontal section, we have ^ = S'n -,

observe that the value of the integral (* S'n^ ^Z is calculated

value of ^ is calculated on the assumption that ^ is small,
even when x is large, i. e. that the drop is very flat, even far
from the vertex. Now the drop or bubble used by Prof.
Quincke was often far from satisfying these conditions. In
some cases the diameter was so small that the fraction ^
amounted to as much as              and the curvature at the vertex
was so considerable that the value of g cannot be satisfactorily
 calculated in the way described. Thus in the first measure
 of an air-bubble in water (Quincke, loc. ext. § 3, table III.)
 ^ = •319 ; while in the case of drops of petroleum in water it
 is as much as '3768.

   The corrected results with hyposulphite of soda, bisulphide
of carbon, and petroleum do not agree satisfactorily with the
measures made with capillary tubes.
   The general effect of the correction is to reduce the results
by about 10 per cent., but in some cases, especially of drops
of one liquid in another, the value of L is so small that the
accuracy of the correction may be questioned. I hope soon
to be able to lay before the Society fresh determinations of
the surface-tension in these cases. When L reaches or

        from, the Dimensions of Flat Drops and Bubbles.                    65
approaches 2 centims. the term r is generally insignificant,
                                                                       1
though the corrective factor C, which now reduces to ., ^ . ,
is still important. In fact a drop or bubble may be con
sidered flat before the radius can be regarded as indefinitely
great.
   In those cases where the corrected value still exceeds the
mean value obtained by the method of capillary tubes, the dif
ference which was previously considerable is now for the most
part insignificant ; witness water, olive-oil, turpentine, and
alcohol. It must also be remarked that the measures of flat
drops or bubbles agree among themselves far less satisfactorily
than the measures of capillary elevations. Thus the numbers
quoted as obtained with capillary tubes are themselves the
mean of several observations, not differing from each other
as a rule by more than 2 per cent., though made with tubes
of various diameters; while the observations of flat drops or
bubbles differ often by as much as 15 per cent., or even
more.
   This very variation is indeed a matter of interest, and not
 easily accounted for*. For though M. van der Mensbriigghe
 has well pointed out f that the bubble when first blown must
 exhibit a higher surface-tension, owing to the absorption of
 heat from, and consequent lowering of temperature of, the
 surface-layers, yet it is not easy to believe that this deviation
 from the normal value would be of long persistence ; nor
 indeed do Prof. Quincke's measures always show a diminution
 of tension with the time.
    I think, however, that we may draw the conclusion that
 the method of capillary tubes, when care is taken thoroughly
 to wet the walls above the meniscus, leads to values which
 are not discredited, as we had been led to think, by the results
 of the method of flat drops or bubbles. This is a satisfactory
 conclusion to come to, since the method of elevation in capil
 lary tubes is that which has been most frequently employed
 for measuring the surface-tension. Prof. Quincke's value
 ( 0825 gr. = 81 C.G.S. units) of the surface-tension of water
   * Mr. Bashforth (see ' An Attempt to teat the Theories of Capillary
 Action,' p. 10) remarks on the difficulty of making any accurate direct
 measurement of the height K —k, and Prof. Guthrie has somewhere
 noticed the same difficulty. But Prof. Quincke's measures of K—k do
 not show a percentage-variation much greater than that of the quantity
 K Vi, in determining which the same difficulties do not occur.

points out, to too low a result. Had he made use of the cor
rected value (T=-0735 gr. = 72'l C.G.S. units), the results of
p. 82, loc. cit., would have been in very close agreement with
theory.
    In conclusion, I would remark that the great value of this
particular paper of Prof. Quincke's does not, as it seems to
me, depend so much on the absolute accuracy of the results
presented as on the emphasis with which, at the time it was
written, it represented the capillary constant to be measured
as a surface-tension, and on the justice of the general con
siderations which are put forward, and which remain un-
impeached.

IX. The Stream-lines of Moving Vortex-rings. By Oliver
   Lodge D.Sc, Professor of Physics in University College,
   Liverpool*            [Plates II., III., IV.]
THE object of the present communication is to publish
       drawings of vortex stream-lines, some of which I made
originally for my own edification. Taking the lines of a
stationary vortex, as given by Sir W. Thomson in his memoir
on Vortex Motion (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol, xxv.), or as
copied into Maxwell's ' Electricity ' (plate 18, vol. ii.), I merely
superpose uniform motion upon them, in the shape of a series
of parallel lines, and join up the corners of the quadrangles
so formed.
   Another way of expressing the matter is to say that you
draw the lines of magnetic induction due to a circular ring
conveying a current, placed in a uniform magnetic field with
its lines exactly opposed to those inside the ring.
    I choose two strengths of uniform field for the sake of
illustration; one distinctly stronger, the other distinctly weaker,
than the central intensity due to the coil alone. The relative
 intensities at centre of ring due to field and coil respectively
 are about as 1 to 5 in fig. 1, and as 64 to 5 in fig. 2 (Plate II.).
 Or, taking the curves as representing stream-lines : in fig. 1
 the velocity of vortex-motion is equal to the translation-
velocity of the whole ring at a certain circle in its plane
 concentric with its core and of 3*3 times the diameter of the
 core, and also at two points on the axis ; while in fig. 2 the
 vortex-velocity and the translation-velocity are equal at a place
 1*5 core-radii distant from the centre of the ring outside, and
 at another circle, say two fifths the core dimensions, inside,
the ring.
    In fig. 1 the ring is moving so fast that the translational
 flow back of fluid through its centre overpowers the forward
 vortex-motion there. In fig. 2 the vortex-motion predo
 minates as far as a point on the axis which I reckon as T38
 core-radii distant from centre of ring, a point indicated by the
 crossing of the partially dotted stream-line. It will be under
 stood that though they look so different, the two Plates repre
 sent the same ring moving at different speeds. The size of
 the core or circular axis is the same in both diagrams.
    It will be observed that in fig. 2 the portion of fluid
 permanently partitioned off from the rest by reason of its
 vorticity is truly ring-shaped, and would become thinner or

 the core of the ring being prolate towards the axis ; while

68           Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Stream-lines
translated through the rest, forms an ovoid mass with dimples
before and behind—the dimples, however, becoming less and
disappearing when the translatory motion is made still slower.
The lines near the core are in this case rather displaced away
from the axis. The dottedness of the portion" of the line which
crosses the axis of the ring is purely subjective, and only
indicates uncertainty on my part as to its exact course, from
want of knowledge. It is probable that the same defect ex
hibits itself in my terminology, which is probably incorrect,
or at least unusual. Thus I cannot help calling the actual
circular axis of the ring its " core," instead of the whole of
the rotational portion, as is usual in dealing with rings of very
small cross section in proportion to area of ring itself. The
rings drawn are not of small cross section, and so one wants a
name for their innermost axis or core.
   We can try to apply Sir William Thomson's rule* for the
velocity of translation of very thin or high-speed rings, to the
case of fig. 2 ; though this ring is not nearly thin enough for
the formula to be properly applicable.
   Using the symbol X for the ratio of radius of ring itself to
its cross-section radius, the rule may be written:—
   2tt x velocity of translation
vortex velocity at centre of ring
 _             2X x velocity of translation             _,
    vortex velocity at surface of rotational portion
   In fig. 2 the value of X is about 3 ; and accordingly each
of the above terms is about 3 also ; or the two vortex velo
cities specified in the formula are nearly equal, and about
double that of the translational velocity.
   This does not agree with what I said before, about the ratio
of uniform field to ring-field at centre being as 64 : 5; hence
there is something wrong, but I don't know what. The lines
of uniform velocity in fig. 2 were taken 8 times as close
together as in fig. 1; and. this surely represents a velocity
64 times as great. I can only suppose that the ring is much
too fat for the formula.
   Plate III. is an attempt to represent a vortex-ring advan
cing in a very imperfect or viscous fluid, showing its gradual
increase in size, and decrease in forward velocity. It is easily
drawn by superposing a diverging equiangular pencil on the
stationary vortex which forms the basis of all three diagrams ;
but that it really represents the effect of viscosity does not
seem very probable. No slip, due to inertia of displaced fluid,
is shown in any of the diagrams. This figure better repre
sents a ring moving towards a large distant obstacle. As

                         of Moving Vortex-rings.                   69
   drawn, the vortex-velocity at centre is only a trifle greater
   than the translational velocity. This plate also represents
   the lines of magnetic force due to a circular current with a
   repellent pole on its axis, at a point 2-518 diameters away
   from the plane of tie circle. The dots on the curves indicate
   the distribution of the crossing-points which guide the drawing.
      Plate IV. shows the attempt of a ring to advance in an
   oblique direction, not normal to its plane. It is supposed to
  have been knocked out of a hole by a slant impulse. There
  is evidently a good deal of vibration, both of the ring as a
  whole and of its cross section ; and it looks as though a very
  little would suffice to break it up altogether. The resultant
  velocity at the centre of the ring happens, in the particular
  case here chosen, to be about zero.
      In cases of oblique progression a tendency to a bodily shifting
  of the uniform flow-lines, parallel to themselves, as they pass
  from before to behind the ring, is noticeable, and is exhibited
  in fig. 1. Perhaps this means a heaving or sinuous path of
  motion for the ring. The right mode of joining up the
  guiding-points is however in this case by no means obvious ;
  and fig. 2 (Plate IV.) is just as likely to be correct as fig. 1.
  In fig. 2 no shifting of distant stream-lines occurs, but then
  it hardly seems a real case of vortex-motion: at least it looks
  only like a ring shaking itself to pieces ; while fig. 1 suggests
  an attempt of the same ring to pull itself together.
     I have a number of other diagrams drawn in the rough, in
 dicating various features of the clash or chase of vortex-rings.
     The direct clash of two equal opposite rings, or the impact
 of one against a looking-glass, is of course very easy. The
 clash of two rings of different strength is more complex—one
 appears to be opened out over the other.
     The chase of two unequal rings, and the penetration of the
 front one by its pursuer, are well shown ; but if the rings are
 of equal strength they refuse to penetrate, and seem to amal
 gamate or pair, no matter at what different speeds they may
 be going.
     The deflection of one ring by anothor whose path is inclined
 to it, as calculated by Prof. J. J. Thomson in his ' Adams
 Essay,' * can also be illustrated, together with what I think
 corresponds to vibrations of the core about the circular form.
    But all these diagrams I propose to publish in a more
complete form later. This " experimental ' method of investi
gation, by diagrams based on simple superposition of velocities,
seems capable of great extension, because one is limited by no
approximations or conditions : the only difficulty is the inter
pretation of results.

70                 Notices respecting New Book*.
   Last year I examined air vortex-rings produced in the
well-known manner described by Prof. Tait*, in the light of a
powerful intermittent induction-coil Leyden-jar discharge.
The motion is, however, of too continuous a nature to exhibit
the advantages of this mode of illumination ; and though the
crispations of vibrating rings are well shown, there is no
obvious peculiarity noticeable which does not show itself
equally well in a steady illumination.
   This paper is only to be regarded as a preliminary note,
and, as Prof. Carey Foster has kindly reminded me, the uni
form field as I have drawn it is not quite correct. Tins indeed
will account for the discrepancy between theory and expe
riment mentioned above.
   The appearance of jets of water illuminated intermittently
is, as is well known, very striking ; and 1 have long imagined
that a waterfall illuminated in this way would be a striking
spectacle. The spark is scarcely bright enough for large-scale
illumination, though there is nothing to beat it for instanta-
neousness. A revolving slit-disk would, however, prove a more
manageable and less noisy method, and by a judicious arrange
ment of special lenses it can be made to give plenty of light.
But the speed of the disk must be high, and its slits narrow,
or the drops will be blurred and their characteristic statical
beauty lost.

T^HE work before us may be characterized as encyclopaedic. It
      is one of those valuable contributions to scientific literature
of which we owe so many to the laborious research of our German
friends, but which, for some reason, are found in English, for the
most part, only in the form of translations. But Dr. Hoppe's
book is not only a valuable collection and rSsumi of all that has
been done in Electricity from the earliest times down to the pre
sent date, but it is also a veritable romance, in which the story of
discovery in this particular science is told in a most fascinating
manner. We are nowadays so familiar with the achievements
of science, and so accustomed to see the giant of Electricity tamed
and made to serve the purposes of every-day life, that we are
apt to overlook the difficulties with which the earlier investigators
had to contend ; and it is just here that the charm of such a
history as the one before us lies,—that, being familiar with the
results of which the original discoverers were in search, we are
able to survey their labours, to trace where, having hit upon the
right track, they have pursued the truth, till their labours have
been crowned with success, and to admire the skill with which
they ha\e overcome the difficulties in their way.

    Dr. Hoppe divides his work into six Books, which deal with
 different epochs in the history of Electricity, and which are, of
 course, of very unequal bulk. The first gives us the history of
 discovery from the earliest times to Franklin, and occupies 28 pages.
 The second embraces the times of Franklin and Coulomb, 1747 to
 1789, 70 pages. Book III. gives us the history from Galvani's
 discovery to the year 1819, treating chiefly of galvanic electricity
 and the discoveries of Volta, Davy, Oerstedt, Zamboni, and
 others, occupying 73 pages. Book IV. treats of the connection
 between Electricity and Magnetism, and of the contributions to
 electrical science of Oerstedt, Poggendorff, Schweigger, Ampere,
 Faraday, and Nobili, in the years 1820-26, and covers 60 pages.
 Book V. extends from Ohm to the recognition of the law of conser
 vation of energy (1827-47, 260 pages), including, amongst others,
 the researches of Ohm, Pouillet, Kohlrausch, Faraday, Schonbein,
 Daniell, Grove, Bunsen, Poggendorff, Plante, Faure, Joule, Lenz,
 Peltier, Kirehhoff, Gauss, Wheatstone, Weber; and Book VI.
 treats of the technical applications of Electricity—of the electric
 light, dynamo machines, the electric telegraph, and telephone, &c. :
 this occupies 93 pages.
    It is not practicable, within the limits of a brief notice, to do
 more than mention one or two points which may be of interest.
 Dr. Hoppe discusses the question of the discovery of the Leyden
 jar at some length, and, apparently, gives his verdict in favour of
 Kleist as the actual discoverer ; at least he seems to adopt the
 name " Kleist's jar " instead of the usual term. Von Kleist, Bishop
 of Kammin, in Pomerania, on the 11th October, 1745, placed a
 nail in a medicine-glass and held it to the conductor of an electrical
 machine ; on touching the nail with the other hand he received a
 shock, especially if the glass contained mercury ; and this appears
 to be the first time the experiment was ever made. This result
 was communicated by letter to at least three people, in Berlin,
 Halle, and Danzig respectively, in November and December of the
 same year.
    In January 1746 a similar observation was made, accidentally,
by Cunseus, in Leyden, and repeated by Musschenbroek, Professor
of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Leyden, and
Gallamand, Professor of Philosophy at Leyden, who communicated
the discovery to the famous Abbe Nollet, in Paris, who, knowing
nothing of Von Kleist, accredited the discovery to the Leyden pro
fessors. It would appear, then, to be due to the accident of the
general ignorance of the German language, in comparison to the
widespread use of the French tongue, that this most important
discovery has been connected with Leyden and not with the name
of Von Kleist ; and there is some foundation for Dr. Hoppe's com
plaint, that whereas every schoolboy knows what a Leyden jar
means, perhaps not one ever heard the name of Von Kleist.
   Some of our common appliances or observations 3eem to date
back further than is usually supposed. We note that the date of
the first lightning-rod is given by Dr. Hoppe as 1754, and that

72                      Geological Society :—
it was erected by Procopiug Divisch, although the suggestion was
made by Franklin in 1749. The first observation of chemical de
composition by means of the galvanic current is ascribed to Dr.
Asch, of Oxford, in 1795. Humboldt, repeating the experiment,
first collected hydrogen from the galvanic decomposition of water;
and Nicholson, in 1800, making the necessary substitution of
platinum electrodes for those of brass or copper, first collected
oxygen from this source. The first olectro-plating was effected by
Hitter iu 1800, who deposited copper by means of the galvanic
current. The first construction of a secondary battery is assigned
to Gautherot, in 1802 ; and the first construction of a dry pile,
with which the name of Zamboni is usually associated, is shown to
rest with Behrons, who constructed such a pile in 1803, seven
years earlier than Zamboni.
   Respecting the rediscovery of Ohm's Law by Pouillet, Dr.
Hoppe writes :—" Pouillet does not say whether or not he was pre
viously acquainted with Ohm's law ; the attempt has since been
made to claim the priority of the discovery for Pouillet, which is
the more absurd since it has not yet been determined that Pouillet
was not acquainted with the researches of Ohm and Fechner.
For, as I have already had occasion to remark, when Englishmen
or Frenchmen do not cite a German work, that is no reason for
supposing that they are not acquainted with it. Since Pouillet had
been for a long time in scientific correspondence with Poggendorff,
as, indeed, appears from the abstracts of his work, which he him
self prepared for Poggendorffs Annalen, it appears to me very
probable that Pouillet was acquainted with Ohm's work, and that
his excellent experiments therefore, as, indeed, Poggendorff re
 marks in a note, were only a confirmation of Ohm's theory."
    The fifth and sixth books, which, of course, occupy the most
 space, are particularly full and interesting, but space forbids de
tailed reference. We merely mention the account given of the
introduction of the idea of " potential " into electrical theory, and
the history of the various forms of incandescent lamp. Dr. Hoppe
does not seem disposed to credit Edison with quite so much origi
 nality as he is generally supposed to have.
    Dr. Hoppe has produced a most valuable and interesting work,
 which will be cordially welcomed by those interested in the subject
 who are acquainted with the German language. It is to be hoped
 that an English version may be produced.

shire." By T. Mellard Eeade, Esq., F.E.8.
    The Author pointed out that the Triaasic rocks under the Low-
level Boulder-clay in the neighbourhood of Liverpool, where they
are not smoothed and striated, are usually broken up into rubble
and red sand, forming a bed of variable thickness occasionally con
solidated into a breccia. This deposit he had in former papers
attributed to the action of land-ice. AtMowbrey brick-and-tile works,
Great Crosby, is a section of Keuper marls, the only one existing
for many miles around. The marls are overlain by Low-level
Boulder-clay of the usual type, and between it and the marl is a
deposit from 3 to 4 feet thick, which at first sight is not readily
distinguishable from the marls, but which a careful examination
of the excavations from time to time as they progressed, showed
to be a distinct bed. In this bed, lying at all angles, were
found large blocks of sandstone, some of which were grooved and
 striated in an unmistakable manner. The matrix in which they
 were imbedded was of the same constitution as the marl, and evi
 dently formed out of it, showing in places strong evidences of
 contortion and kneading up. The sandstone blocks belonged to the
 Keuper formation, and some of them were very similar to bands
 intercalated in the marls near the bottom of the excavation. No
 erratic pebbles or boulders of any sort were found in this kneaded-
 up marl, whereas the Low-level Boulder-clay is full of them.
     The Author considered that the only feasible explanation of the
 phenomenon was that the marl had been worked up into a grey
  clay by the passage over it of land- ice, which had broken off the
  sandstone-bands at their outcrops, forcing the blocks into the dis
  turbed or worked-up marl. These outcrops, concealed by a mantle
  of Low-level Boulder-clay, must be to the northward, and therefore
  the blocks have travelled in the same direction approximately as
  the track of the striations on the neighbouring rocks.
      In conclusion, he contended that all the evidence points to the
  fact before insisted upon, that the intensest period of cold preceded
  the deposition of the Low-level Boulder-Clay, which is clearly a
 marine deposit.
     3. " The North-Wales and Shrewsbury Coal-fields." By D. C.
  Davies, Esq., F.G.8.
     After discussing the origin of Coal-beds, and the causes of their
  variation in structure and quality, the Author proceeded to describe
   the North Wales and Shrewsbury Coal-field, which consists of three
  parts:—(1) The Shrewsbury field south of the Severn, exclusively
   composed of Upper Coal-measures; (2) the tracts north of the
   Severn, extending from near Oswestry to north of Wrexham ; and
   (3) the Flintshire Coal-field. The first and second are separated
   from each other by the alluvial plain of the Severn and Vyrnwy,
   and the second and third by the Great Bala and Yulo faults.
      Some remarks on the scenery of the Welsh border-land followed,
   and then a general section of the Carboniferous system, as developed

in the country described, was given, the Permian beds being in
cluded, as the Author considered them the upper portion of one
great division of Palaeozoic time. The section was as follows, with
the maximum thickness of each subdivision :—
                                           Thickness in yards.

                                                 1255 yards.
   A detailed description of the strata was next given, beginning
with the lowest, together with details of each coal-seam as worked
in various parts of the field. After describing the beds from the
Millstone Grit to the Cefn rock in the North-Wales coal-field, the
Author proceeded to notice the Upper Coal-measures and Permian
strata in the Shrewsbury area, and showed that no break exists between
the two, the former passing gradually into the latter. He then
discussed the probability of Lower Coal-measures existing beneath
tho upper beds near Shrewsbury, and showed from sections that the
existence of tho lower measures might be anticipated. A similar
inquiry as to the presence of the Coal-measures beneath the New
Ecd Sandstono of the Vale of Clwyd should also, in the Author's
opinion, be answered in the affirmative.
   The organic remains found in tho different beds were briefly
noticed, and then the faults of the district were discussed at some
length. Tho principal faults run north and south, with an upthrow
to the east, but are crossed by lines of fracture running east and
west.
   In conclusion, the correlation of tho strata in the North Wales
and Shrewsbury coal-fields, and especially of the coal-seams, with
the beds found in other parts of Great Britain, was discussed, and
a section was given to show the representation of the different
measures in various coal-basins. The Author was disposed to adopt
four subdivisions rather than three only, as usually accepted, and
pointed out some of the characteristics of each subdivision.

  ON THE DEPTH TO WHICH DAYLIGHT PENTRATES IN SEA-
          WATER. BY MM. H. FOL AND ED. BARASIN.
TN a previous paper * we gave an account of some experiments
      which we had made in the Lake of Geneva, with a view to de
termine the limit of penetration of sunlight in water, and we
announced our intention of making similar experiments in the sea.
                    * Phil. Mag. January 1885, p. 70.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                     75
   Thanks to the kind assistance of Dr. J. Barrois, director of the
zoological station of Villefranche-sur-mer, the ' Albatros,' despatch
boat of the French Navy, was placed at our disposal for several
days. The intelligent and ready cooperation of the lieutenant of
the ' Aboiville,' the commander of this vessel, and of all the officers,
greatly contributed to the success of these delicate experiments.
   Our mode of proceeding was the same as in the experiments on the
Lake. A Monckhoven gelatinobromide-of-silver plate was immersed
to a given depth, in the apparatus, which remained open during a
fixed time. On this occasion we were obliged to preserve the
sensitive layer from the chemical action of the sea-water by covering
it with a thick coating of varnish. The light acted from the back
of the plate and through the thickness of the glass. Bepeated
washings with spirits of turpentine and absolute alcohol sufficed to
remove the varnish before proceeding to develop. As on the former
occasion, we employed oxalate of iron as the developing agent,
which in every case was allowed to act for ten minutes.
   The experiments were made on the 25th and 26th of last March,
and were favoured by bright and calm weather. We found the
depths we wanted, that is to say from 400 to 600 metres, off Cape
Ferrat, which protects the entrance to the Bay of Villefranche.
Leaving unnoticed the plates of minor interest, we will quote the
following, which appeared to us sufficient to solve the question.
   a. Between lOh 30m and lOh 40m a plate exposed at a depth of 200
           metres to begin with ; the boat drifting away from the shore we
           were obliged to let out 60 metres more rope in order to prevent
           the premature closing of the apparatus.
   b. From 12.46 to 12 50 at a depth of 280 m.
   c. Between 11.30 and 11.40 at a depth of from 345 to 350 m.
   d. Between 10.55 and 11.5 at a depth of 300 m.
   e. From 10.15 to 10.25 at a depth of 380 m.
           This experiment was made under especially favourable circum
           stances ; there was neither wind nor swell, the boat remained
           absolutely motionless, the line perfectly vertical, so that we were
           not obliged to let out the line throughout the time of exposure.
  /. From 1.20 to 1.30, under a cloudy sky, but still luminous enough,
      All these plates, with the exception of plate /, were exposed while
   On developing, the plates a and b proved to be greatly over
exposed. On the plates e, d, and e, the strength of the impression
went on diminishing in a ratio corresponding very regularly with the
increase of depth. On the plate e the strength of the impression
was notably inferior to that produced by an exposure during the
same length of time to the air on a clear night with no moon. It
is comparable to that produced by an exposure of half the time,
say of five minutes only, under these latter conditions.
   Lastly, the plate/ did not bear the least trace of any impression
whatever. It is no doubt to be regretted that this last experiment
did not take place, like the others, under a perfectly clear sky.
But the impression on plate e, at 380 m., was already so faint that

  76            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  we may conclude from it, with sufficient certainty, that the extreme
  limit could not have been more than 20 metres lower. Moreover,
 the experiments made in the Lake of Geneva have shown that
 the dispersion of sunlight by a light layer of clouds does not cause
 any considerable diminution in the depth to which it can penetrate
 in water.
     We believe we are justified in concluding from our experiments
 that, in the month of March, in the middle of the day and in bright
 sunlight, the last glimmers of daylight are extinguished at 400
 metres from the surface, in the Mediterranean.
     After these results, those of the experiments which we have still
 continued in the Lake of Geneva, since the publication of our previous
 notice, have scarcely more than a local interest. To the absorption
 peculiar to the water is in this case added that resulting from
 particles in suspension, more or less abundant according to the
 level. We hope, however, to determine an interesting point relative
 to the influence exercised by the seasons on the degree of trans
 parency of these waters.
     We know that the experiments of M. Forel have shown that
 albumenized silver paper is blackened, in winter, at a depth of 100
 metres, whilst in summer it undergoes no alteration at a depth of
 45 metres. It would be interesting to ascertain whether this
 variation of transparency with the season is peculiar to the super
 ficial layers, or if the same law also holds good at lower levels.
     On the 18th of March of this year we repaired to the middle of
 the Lake in the ' Sachem,' a steam-yacht belonging to M. E. Eeverdin,
 which her owner had kindly placed at our disposal. As in the
 former experiments on the lake, M. F. A. Forel kindly volunteered
 to accompany and assist us. The weather was fairly bright ; a
 light layer of clouds dispersed the light without completely stopping
 the direct rays of the sun. The exposure of the following plates
 was made in the manner described in our former paper :—
    Plate 10 : from 9h 20m to 9.30, at a depth of 158 metres.

    The time of exposure was therefore uniformly ten minutes in
each case excepting the last, which remained uncovered, at 280
m., during thirty-five minutes. Nevertheless not the slightest trace
of an impression is visible, either upon this plate or upon plates
13 and 12. Plate 11 shows a very faint impression, somewhat like
that of plate e at 380 m. in the sea. Lastly, plate 10 at 158 m. is
acted on to about the same extent as plate e. We place the ex
treme limit of penetration of daylight in the Lake of Geneva in
winter at about 200 metres.
    It follows from a comparison between this series of experiments
and the preceding, that light does not penetrate in March more
than 20 or 30 m. lower than in September ; in the month of August
the difference is perhaps a little greater. Accordingly the strata of

water below 100 metres do not obey the law of variation of trans
parency established by M. Forel for the more superficial layers.
   Compared with the series of plates exposed in tho Lake, the
series which we have brought back from the Mediterranean show
a more slow and regular gradation, which leads us to think that,
whilst in the Lake the light would be quickly intercepted by the
more or less turbid deep layers, in the Mediterranean the absorption
due to the pure water alone would be the principal, if not the only
factor in the arrest of the luminous rays.—Comptes Rendus, April

ON THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF SOLID MERCURY AND OF
   PURE METALS AT LOW TEMPERATURES. BY MM. CAILLETET
   AND BOUTY.
   The electrical resistance of pure metals increases with the tem
perature. From the experiments of Matthiessen * and those of
M. Benoitt, the mean coefficient of increase in the resistance for
one degree between 0° and 100° differs little in various metals, and
is only slightly removed from yt$i that is, the coefficient of the
expansion of gases. If the same law held at low temperatures, the
resistance of a metal, varying like the pressure of a perfect gas
under constant pressure, would furnish a measure of the absolute
temperature, and would cease to exist at absolute zero.
    Our experiments have been made with mercury and various
other pure metals. The mercury was contained in a spiral capillary
glass tube terminating in two large reservoirs in which dipped two
thick electrodes of amalgamated copper. The reservoir of a
hydrogen-thermometer^ was in the interior of the spiral ; and the
whole being immersed in ice, or in a bath of methylic chloride or
of ethylene cooled by a current of air, according to the method
which one of us has given. To work with another metal, copper
for instance, the wire is coiled in a spiral form on an ebonite tube
in which are long slits, so as to be certain that the liquid was pro
perly mixed, and that the bath and the resistance were measuring
at the same temperature.
   We have only made relative measurements. The resistance in
vestigated was compared with that of a column of mercury at 0°,
by means of a "Wheatstone's bridge and a very sensitive reflecting-
galvanometer. The following are the results which we have
obtained :—
   1. Mercury.—The empirical formula given by MM. Mascart,
De Nerville, and Benoit, for the apparent resistance of mercury
in glass above 0°, also holds for the freezing-point. When it
solidifies, its conductivity suddenly increases in a ratio, which at
 —40° is equal to 4-08. The resistance of solid mercury decreases,

then, regularly as the temperature sinks; between —80° and
— 92°'13 it is represented by the formula
                                      1+at
in which * is the temperature on the centigrade-scale with
                             «= 0-00407.
   This coefficient of variation «, which is almost five times that for
liquid mercury, is very near that of other pure liquids in the solid
state.
   2. Silver, Aluminium, Magnesium, Tin.—For these various metals
the resistance is represented by the formula
                             r'=ro(1 + a<);
and the values of a, deduced from numerous experiments made at
various temperatures, are the following :—
       Metal.                 *.             Range of temperature.
      Silver              0-00385            + 29-97 to -101-75
      Aluminium.... 0-00388                  + 27*77 to - 90-57
      Magnesium           0-00390               0 to - 88-31
      Tin                 0 00424                0 to - 85-08
   These values of a, which are very near those for the same bodies
near 0°, according to Matthiessen's experiments, are almost identical
for the first three metals ; the value of a for solid mercury is
between the value common to magnesium, aluminium, and silver,
and that for tin.
   3. Copper.—The most complete experiments are those which we
have made with copper. They gave the following values for a
deduced from a series of thirty measurements, which have been
 divided into three groups :—
                               a.          Ranjre of temperature.
                          '0-00418              0     to - 58-22
      Copper             • 0-00426         — 68-65 to —101-30
                          [0-00424         -113-08 to -122-82
    These values are a little greater than those which follow from
 the formulas of Matthiessen and of M. Benoit for temperatures
 near 0°*. The variation of resistance is almost absolutely regular,
 and would enable us, in case of need, to dispense with a hydrogen-
 thermometer in measuring temperatures between —20° and —123°.
 No appreciable variation of a is observed at this latter temperature,
 which would seem to indicate that the agreement, at any rate ap
 proximate, of the hydrogen-thermometer and the copper spiral
 thermometer might be pursued still further.
    4. Iron, Platinum.—Both these metals differ greatly from the
 others in the variation of their resistance above zero ; they diverge
 from it in the same direction at low temperatures. The formula
                              r« = ro(1+*0
             • a =0-00367 (Matthiessen); 0 003637 (Benoit).

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              79
holds for iron from 0° to —92°, with «=0-0049, but it does not
hold for platinum. The value of a deduced from the formula (2),
which near 0° would be about 0-0030, increases as the temperature
sinks, and becomes 0'00342 for a lower limit equal to — 94°-57;
hence platinum approaches the other pure metals as the temperature
sinks.
    In conclusion, our experiments prove that the electrical resistance
of most metals decreases regularly when the temperature sinks
from 0° to — 123°, and that the coefficient of variation is appreci
ably the same for all. It seems probable that this resistance would
become extremely small, and therefore the conductivity very great,
at temperatures below —200°, although our experiments do not
enable us to form any precise idea of what would take place in
those conditions.— Comptes Jtendus, May 11, 1885.
OPTICAL METHOD FOB THE ABSOLUTE MEASUBEMENT OF SMALL
                LENGTHS, BY M. MACE DE LEPINAY.
     M. Mouton* gave an ingenious method for measuring, in wave
 lengths, the thickness of a quartz plate cut parallel to the axis,
 which depends on a determination, by means of a known grating,
 of the wave-lengths of Fizeau and Foueault's dark bands. Un
 fortunately it depends on our really very imperfect knowledge of
 the values n'—n of the two indices of quartz for different radia
 tions, and cannot therefore give numbers which are exact to within
  1 J60. On the other hand, the corrections for temperature are
 considerable : nr&w ^or a degree Centigrade.
     I. The method which I have used, which is analogous in prin
 ciple to the preceding, depends on an observation of Talbot's bandst,
 obtained by intercepting half the pencil of sunlight which falls on
 a known grating by a quartz plate with true parallel faces. The
 spectra deflected on ilie side of the plate are then channelled with
 lines, in general extremely fine, but which for that very reason
 tend to a point as exact as that of the spectrum. By using the
 third spectrum of a grating of            millim., I have been able to
 apply the method directly to a quartz plate parallel to the axis, about
 4 millim. in thickness. It is known that the wave-lengths corre
 sponding to the centre of each of these dark bands are related to
 the thickness of the plate e, and the index n, by the formula
                              an — l
 p being an even whole number, which measures the number of the
  order of the fringe observed, and which increases by two units in
  passing from one band to the other, counting from red to violet.
  We thus obtain as many values very near the desired thickness as
  are observed, and the mean is taken.
      In the preceding formula the index is directly given to within

calculated by taking the mean of the very concordant measurements
of the indices made by Eudberg, Mascart, and Van der Willigen,
taking for the wave-lengths the means of the measurements made
by Mascart, Ditscheiner, Van der "Willigen, and Angstrom ; the
latter numbers were transformed so as to correspond to the wave
length XD2=5-888 x 10-» adopted by M. Mascart. The constant
of the grating having been determined each time so as to satisfy
this condition, we see that the thicknesses are provisionally
measured as a function of what M. Mouton calls Fraunhofer's
millimetre.
   II. A double correction for temperature must be introduced in
the thicknesses thus calculated. If by 0 we denote the tempera
ture to which correspond the indices given by the formulae above,
by t that at which the measurements were made, the thickness «0,
at 0° of the plate, should be calculated by the formula
                   2e0(l + kt)(n+ y'O -vt—1) =p\ ;
k, v, and v being coefficients determined, the first by M. Benoit,
the two others by M. Dufett. It is more simple and just as exact
to correct the thickness e0, originally calculated by one or other of
the two simplified formula),
           «0= 0-999741(1 -0-0000019 t)e ordinary rays,
or. V*.: <o=0-999709(l -0-0000001 t)e extraordinary rays.
   These two formulas}: apply to the case in which the plate is cut
parallel to the axis.
   III. I applied this method to two quartz plates cut parallel to
the axis made by Hoffmann. The thinnest of them measured
directly (123 bands observed, ordinary rays) gave
                    «„= 0-402958 cm. +0-000001.
On the other hand, we measured the difference in thickness of two
plates (123 bands observed, extraordinary rays). From this was
deduced for the thickest plate,
                     e0=0-602316 cm. ±0-000003.
   IV. We may add that this method may lead to a new determi
nation of the absolute value of the wave-length of the ray D2. The
thickness of the second plate, which M. Benoit kindly measured
with the apparatus of the Bureau international des Poids et
Mesures, was found equal to 0-00236 to within If or 2m. From
this we get for the wave-length of the line D2, the number
                           X—5-8884 x 10-»,                    o

   Notice to Contributors of Memoirs.—Authors are reminded that, under an
arrangement dating from 1871, the acceptance of Memoirs, and the days on which
they are to be read, are now, as far as possible, determined by Organizing Commit
tees for the several Sections before the beginning of the Meeting. It has therefore
become necessary, in order to give an opportunity to the Committees of doing
justice to the several Communications, that each Author should prepare
an Abstract of his Memoir, of a length suitable for insertion in the pub

XIII. The Polymerization of the Metallic Oxides. By Louis
   Henry, Professor of Cltemistry in the Catholic University of
   Lonvain*.
                           Introduction.
ONE of the principal objects of Physical Science, in fact its
       principal object, is to determine the natural relation of
things. It is by comparisons logically established between the
things themselves that these relationships are disclosed. An
essential condition to be observed in researches of this kind
is to compare only those objects which are really comparable.
Stated in the terms of chemical science, this general condition
of all work undertaken with a truly scientific object consists
in establishing a comparison only between the chemical mole
cules themselves. Molecules are, in fact, for the chemist the
veritable chemical individuals—they are the bodies themselves
in their simplest, and at the same time their most complete,
expression. Molecules find a graphic representation simple
and concise, and sometimes even sufficiently perfect, and in
every case susceptible of a great degree of precision, in the
chemical formulae at present in use.
   Formulae, however, only maintain their full and complete
utility so long as they are the exact and complete representa
tion of the molecules of bodies,—of bodies between which che
mical actions occur, of bodies which we possess in reality, and
which are the veritable objects of our comparisons. This re
presentation becomes exact and complete only when the for-

Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 20. No. 123. August 1885.          Q

82           Prof. Louis Henry on t/ie Polymerization
mula indicates the three facts fundamental to the being of the
molecule, viz. (1) the nature of its constituent elements, (2)
the actual number of atoms of each present, and (3) their
combining proportion.
    We are still far from this degree of completeness. Our
 knowledge of bodies from the molecular point of view is very
incomplete, and especially so as regards Mineral Chemistry.
 Not only is the number of compounds, of which the constitu
 tion and structure have been successfully determined, very
limited, but there are a great number, I might even say the
 greater number, to which we are still unable to attribute a
 formula expressing in a satisfactory manner the true size and
 real weight of the molecule. The formulas used in Mineral
 Chemistry are in the majority of cases only the empirical for
 mulae, indicating merely the nature and relative weights of
 the atoms of the elements in the compound, and are wholly
 silent as to the absolute quantity of matter, or the actual
 number of atoms present in the molecule. They do not give
 therefore any idea either of its size, or of its absolute weight,
 or of its internal structure. The properties of compounds do
 not depend on chance ; they depend chiefly no doubt on the
 nature of the elements constituting the molecule, but they are
 also conditioned by the internal structure of the latter, and by
 its size and weight.
     It is to Berzelius that we owe the idea of isomerism, without
 which a rational study of the innumerable compounds of
  carbon would be absolutely unattainable. However it may
 be, each of these three great factors in the diversity of com
  pound bodies exercises a special and preponderating influence
  on certain classes of properties. If, on the one hand, the
  chemical activity of a given compound depends especially on
  the essential nature of the atoms constituting the molecule,
  and on the constitution of the latter, on the other, an increase
  in its weight powerfully affects the physical and mechanical
  properties.
     Whatever may be the specialization of this dependence, the
  properties of a body, considered individually or relatively, the
  one in relation to the other, their analogies and their differ
  ences, can only be well understood when we know the size of
  the molecule.
      Just as the adoption of rational and true formulae for the
  various compounds may render great service in a systematic
   study, so in the same degree will the adoption of imperfect
   formulae, artificial and false, or even incomplete and expressing
   only simple relations, lead to results which are untrue. Such
   formulae mislead by obscuring, or even by totally concealing,

                       of tlie Metallic Oxides.                 83
the real relations of bodies. They create imaginary relation
ships, removing apart those bodies which ought to be brought
together, and bringing those together which ought to be kept
apart. Our formulae should be like glasses of a perfect trans
parency, through which the bodies should be seen as they are,
and not like screens to hide, or disguises to disfigure.
    Most formulae now in use refer to the perfect gaseous state.
These formulae are undoubtedly excellent for bodies of which
the normal state is gaseous ; but their exclusive use is insuf
ficient, and creates a void to be regretted in the comparative
study of bodies, both from the individual and general point of
view. The number of bodies naturally gaseous is in fact very
limited ; and if the number of those capable of becoming so
is very considerable, still there are many which are not, and
 with an absolute or relative fixity resist the highest tempera
 tures, or are decomposed.
     Our usual molecular formulae are therefore necessarily
 insufficient, being inapplicable to numerous compounds, and
 to the various states which the same body is capable of
 assuming. These formulae, referring to the perfect gaseous
 state, do not tell us anything of the molecular nature of these
 same bodies when in the ordinary condition. Thus it is, to
 appeal to classical examples, with the formula? of sulphur, and
 of the fatty acids, or at least with the first terms of the latter
series.
    It is in all respects desirable that the molecular formulae of
 bodies should refer to their natural state, and that the several
 formulae should be determined for the various physical states
 which the bodies can either naturally or artificially assume.
 That is the only way to avoid misconceptions, artificial
 difficulties, false analogies between unlike bodies, and to
 retain for various compounds their own physiognomy.
    There is no teacher of Chemistry who has not frequently
 noticed, both in mineral and in organic chemistry, differences
 in the properties of bodies, which are often most profound,
 and totally beyond theoretical prevision, notwithstanding that
 the bodies are apparently related as regards their formulae
 and the analogy of their composition. It is easy to say that
 there are exceptions and anomalies. But in spite of these
 words, the difficulties still exist in all their entirety, embar
 rassing the mind of both teacher and taught. The greatest
 caution should be used in qualifying exceptional and anoma
 lous facts; otherwise confusion is created in the mind, and
 place is given to chance in the occurrence of natural facts :
 it is the ruin of law and general principles. It is well to
 remember the old adage, applicable in the physical as well as

84          Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
in the natural world, that exceptions prove the rule. True
exceptions, true anomalies, have no real existence ; these
apparent deviations in the effects of a general known cause
are due to the influence of other causes, acting simultaneously,
 the existence of which remains momentarily hidden from view.
    Among the difficulties which are met with in the compara
 tive study of bodies, there are some which are peculiarly
 embarrassing, and which it would be chimerical to try to
 solve under present circumstances. But there are others,
and I believe a very considerable number, which are purely
artificial, without real foundation ; difficulties which would
 vanish of themselves if we only had a less imperfect know
ledge of the bodies with which they occur—if, in fact, the
chemical signification of these bodies molecularly in relation
to others were only clearly and surely defined.
   This point of view, from which bodies should be studied, is
not absolutely new. Sulphur and the fatty acids, especially
acetic acid, are well-known examples of substances which
have been clearly distinguished in their various physical
states. Moreover, the determination of the relative molecules
of bodies in their various states also touches on a question of
still greater interest, viz. that of the chemical relationships of
the various physical states in which they occur.
   The molecular formulae at present in use refer to the gaseous
state, and the principal method of determining them depends
on the vapour-density. This process, simple and expeditious,
is undoubtedly excellent in all cases in which it is applicable.
Others, however, are necessary for the determination of mole
cules in a state other than that of a perfect gas. It is in the
complete study of bodies in their various conditions that we
should find indications sufficient for information as to their
molecular nature. The several circumstances which charac
terize the chemical molecule, both chemically and physically,
are in intimate connection, and to determine this molecule we
can appeal to all connected therewith, either in its past, pre
sent, or future : in its past, to examine its mode of formation
and the various circumstances bearing on its chemical origin ;
in its present, to carefully investigate the whole of its pro
perties—physical, mechanical, and chemical ; in itsfuture, to
study the reactions in which it may take part, the products of
its decomposition, its metamorphoses, &c.
   This complete study of bodies, from both the statical and
dynamical point of view, always gives, though it may be
imperfect, valuable information for solving our present pro
blem. It is, however, necessary to say, that when I speak of
actual molecules and of actual molecular formula?, I do not

                        of the Metallic Oxides.                     85
forget that these molecules, as well as the formulae which
express them, are really only relative. We do not know, and
we shall never know, that which is truly and absolutely a
molecule, for we cannot and never shall be able to obtain one
singly and alone. We possess, and we shall always possess,
only groups of molecules. The character of reality which we
wish to give to our molecules and to our formula? is essentially,
then, a relative one. What we have to determine are real
relationships between real bodies. These relationships of
analogy and difference remain practically the same if, in the
impossibility of verifying them between the bodies them
selves, we seek for them between the same bodies in a modified
condition ; modified simultaneously, however, and in a similar
manner. It results from these considerations that it is of
great importance to examine chemical phenomena from the
molecular point of view. To establish real molecular formulas
for bodies (t. e. formulas truly and universally comparable) is
therefore an object eminently worthy of attention. It is this
idea which has induced me to undertake a lengthened series
of theoretical and experimental studies on compounds in both
mineral and organic chemistry, and more particularly as
regards the metallic oxides.
           The Peculiar Character of the Metallic Oxides.
    A comparative examination of the oxides and chlorides
leads to a general fact. Chlorides are fusible compounds,
and, with few exceptions, volatile. It has been long observed
that chlorine gives wings to the metals, as one may say.
Volatility is especially noticeable in the chlorides of the fixed
elements, and particularly of the metals. The corresponding
oxides, on the contrary, are distinguished by their fixity and
infusibility, either absolutely or relatively. The following
table shows that this difference is general :—

    As already stated, this difference in properties is observed
especially in the oxides and chlorides of positive elements, and
in general in elements having a metallic brightness. It may
be noted by the way that it appears to be the greater the higher
the atomicity of the metal.
    Whatever may be its meaning, this physical difference is,
bv its generality, one of the most remarkable facts in statical
chemistry, strange and, at first sight, quite exceptional.
    The properties of compound bodies do not appear by chance;
they are only the final result of the properties of the consti
tuent elements—a result more or less modified in consequence
of the physical phenomena of combination. Chemical com
pounds are therefore really mixtures of a special kind. It
cannot be denied that the properties of compounds are closely
related to those of their principal constituents. The differences
between certain elements occur again with greater or less
fidelity in their corresponding and comparable compounds.
That being so, the behaviour of the metallic oxides is especially

88             Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
surprising when compared with the chlorides of the same
elements.
    The difference between the volatility of oxygen and chlorine
is enormous. The former, until recently, was considered as a
permanent gas ; the other, on the contrary, is easily condensed,
and only becomes gaseous at — 33°*6 (Regnault). An atom
of oxygen weighs 16, and that of chlorine 35*5. The mole
cular weights of the chlorides are consequently much greater
than those of the corresponding oxides. Now, of mechanical
 or physical properties, there is not one which is more directly
 dependent on the molecular weight than fusibility and vola
 tility.
     Bearing these facts in mind, we are justified in formulating
 apriori the following propositions :— (1) Oxygen and chlorine
 are both of them elements which are endowed with great vola
 tility as compared with other elements. The oxides and the
 chlorides ought, therefore, to be volatile compounds. (2)
 Volatility exists to a greater degree in oxygen than in chlorine.
 The oxides ought, therefore, to be more volatile than the cor
 responding chlorides. The oxides ought frequently to be very
 volatile, or even gaseous, at the ordinary temperature.
     These theoretical deductions are, in fact, realized in a good
 number of oxygenated and chlorinated compounds, particularly
 in the case of elements or radicals which are negative or
metalloidal, e. g. As, Os, Ru, &c.

   Relationships of a similar kind, as regards volatility, are
observed between the oxides and the chlorides of the bivalent

   Let us now attempt, by the aid of this general idea, to
determine, a priori, what ought to be the properties of certain
particularly interesting oxides.
   To COj, which is gaseous at the ordinary temperature and
boils at —78°, corresponds CC14, which is a liquid boiling
at +76°. The difference in volatility between the two
bodies is 154°. SiCJ4, TiCl4, and Sn014 boil respectively at
58°, 136°, and 115°. It might therefore be reasonably sup
posed that the corresponding oxides should be eminently
volatile. SiOs ought certainly to be gaseous at the ordinary
temperature, or at least as gaseous as SOa, to which it is
analogous, and the molecular weight of which is but little
different.

   BC13, with molecular weight 117*5, is a liquid boiling at
 18°; B2Os, with molecular weight 70, ought therefore to be a
gas at the ordinary temperature.
   A12C16 is a solid, which volatilizes about 100°, and ought
therefore to have a corresponding oxide A1203, if not gaseous,
at least very volatile, and the same should hold good as regards
Fe,Os.
    HgClg (boiling-point 295°) should have a corresponding
oxide, HgO (containing a so-called permanent gas in combi
 nation with a volatile metal), which, if not gaseous, should at
least be much more volatile than HgCls, or metallic mercury.

90          Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
   The chromates are analogous to the sulphates both in their
general composition and crystallographical properties. One
would expect, therefore, that the difference between CrO20
and CrOjCl, would be similar to that between S020 and
S02C12. Now SO„ boils at 46° and S02C12 at 77°, whilst
Cr02Cl2 is a liquid boiling at 118°; and from analog)' we
should expect CrOs to be also a liquid still more volatile, and
boiling even below 100°, whereas CrOs is a solid, fusible
only at about 300°. The oxides, in fact, instead of being
gaseous at the ordinary temperature, or at least very volatile
liquids, as analogy would have led us to expect, are generally
solid, and frequently almost infusible. What is the expla
nation of this fact, so strange in its nature and so important
from its generality ? I regard no fact, however strange, as
abnormal or exceptional. In my opinion anomalies and ex
ceptions have no real existence. They depend most probably,
as already stated, on our ignorance of the consequences, under
certain conditions, of a general known cause.
  The Oxides are not Molecularly Comparable to the Chlorides.
   Polymerization of the Oxides.—The chlorides and oxides are
almost universally indicated by formula? which represent these
bodies as molecularly comparable. But are the oxides really
comparable with the chlorides of the same elements ? Is there
a real analogy between them, or is this analogy merely arti
ficial, and dependent solely on the notation employed ? These
are questions which require examination. The chlorides being
compounds which are frequently volatile without decomposi
tion, the formulae assigned to them have usually been deduced
from the determination of their vapour-density; so that these
formulae really represent, both in weight and size, the molecules
of these bodies, at least in the gaseous state. This is not the
case, however, with the metallic oxides. Being fixed, or
volatile only at the very highest temperatures, or else decom
 posing under the action of heat, their vapour-densities are
unknown, and cannot be determined. The formulas univer
sally attributed to the metallic oxides depend solely on ana
lytical determinations. These formula? are therefore simply
empirical, and merely represent the relations between the
weights of the constituent elements, but are perfectly silent
 as regards the absolute quantities.
    The formula? of the oxides have thus their origin, and rest
on an entirely different basis from the formula? of the chlorides.
There is no authority for attributing to both the same value
 and signification. The relation between the oxides and chlo
 rides, as represented by the usual formula?, is purely artificial.

The true oxides RO,, which are really comparable with the
known chlorides RCl^, are for the most part quite unknown.
We only have the polymeric oxides w(ROx), in which n is a
large number. To make this clear, we may take an example
from organic chemistry in illustration, viz. the chlorides of
ethylene and ethylidene:—

   This interpretation of oxides being admitted, it is no longer
a hypothesis, but a fact, that the physical state and thermal
properties, notably the fusibility and volatility, are a direct
function of the molecular weight, and every abnormal relation,
from the physical point of view, between the chlorides and
oxides ceases immediately. The infusibility and fixity of the
latter, so strange at first sight, return into the natural order
of things.
   We have, therefore, to prove the following proposition :—
   The known oxides, and notably the metallic oxides, are
polymers n(RO,) of the true oxides ROi, corresponding to the
chlorides RC^.
           Proofs of the Polymerization of the Oxides.
   Their Additive Power.—There are no compounds which
are more ready to enter into combination than the oxides.
In fact, it would not be far from the truth to say that there is
no class of compounds with which they are incapable of enter
ing into combination. In mineral chemistry they combine
by addition, and often with considerable energy, not only with
oxides of a contrary sign — acid oxides with basic oxides,—
but with all chemical compounds indiscriminately, whatever
may be their special function.

 92         Prof. Louis Henry on tfie Polymerization
    Let us limit ourselves more especially to metallic oxides.
 They combine not only with the oxides of negative radicals,
 but also with the most diverse binary compounds—chlorides,
 bromides, iodides, sulphides, selenides, &c; with oxysalts in
general—hydrates, sulphates, nitrates, carbonates, &c, forming
the large series of basic salts of the polyvalent metals. These
additive compounds are formed in the most varied proportions ;
so that the series of basic salts is illimitable. Many of them are
marked by a definite composition and by a regular crystalline
character; some even occur naturally in the mineral kingdom.
   This additive power is observed also, though in a less degree,
with the oxides of organic radicals, and notably in the case of
the glycollic oxides, C»H 2nO, which are so similar in other
respects to the metallic oxides RO. The oxide of ethylene
combines with its hydrate, glycol C2H4(OH)2, with acetic
anhydride, with acetyl chloride, with the halogen hydracids, &c.
The aldehydes C„Hjn+] . CHO behave in a similar manner.
    But let us return to the metallic oxides. Metallic oxides
enter into combinations with other metallic oxides which differ
in composition, both in the nature of the metal and in the
quantity of oxygen. Thus, MgO combines with A1203 to form
spinelle, MgO . A1203. Still more remarkable is the combi
nation of two oxides of the same metal, as in magnetic oxide of
iron, FeO . Fe303; red lead, 2PbO . Pb02 ; hausmannite,
MnO . Mns03; SnO . Sn02; &c.
    Organic chemistry also furnishes examples of this, which
are still more curious in so far as we have cases where two
oxides, equally oxygenated, combine, as in the case of the
double oxide of ethylene and ethylidene discovered by Wiirtz
                                     (CH2\       CHOx

                                      CH2/       CH3 /
have polymerization properly so called.
   In the absence of foreign molecular systems on which they can
exercise their additive power, oxides, both organic and inorganic,
combine with themselves ; and in this combination of a body
with itself lies the gist of polymerization in its largest sense.
This fact may be illustrated by examples from organic chemistry.

Wiirtz (Compt. Rend, lxxxiii. p. 1141), is formed sponta
neously as a white solid crystalline mass, melting-point 56°,
and volatile with difficulty.
    In connection with this question there is no body more
interesting than methylene oxide, CH2 : 0. The corresponding
chloride, CH2C12, is a liquid, boiling-point 40°. The oxide itself
should be naturally a gas, but only assumes this state under
the action of heat ; so soon as the heat is withdrawn, it poly
merizes, and is converted into a white solid mass which is
insoluble in water, and sublimes at 100°, again changing at
higher temperatures into the gaseous CH20, as indicated by
its vapour-density. The aldehydes C»H,. CHO are especially
characterized by their tendency to polymerization, giving rise
to products differing from the original aldehyde in all their
physical properties—fusibility, volatility, solubility, &c. Acet-
aldehyde may be taken as a type of this class. Under ordinary
circumstances it is a liquid, boiling-point 21°. There are two
distinct polymers known:—
    (a) Paraldehyde is a liquid, boiling-point 124°, and in the
state of gas is represented by (C2H40)j, as proved by its vapour-
density.
    (b) Metaldehyde, (C2H40)B, is a solid, crystallizing in
beautiful needles, which sublime at 100°, and volatilize without
melting at 112-115°, being transformed again into ordinary
aldehyde as indicated by its vapour-density.
    Trichloraldehyde, or chloral, CC18 . CHO, polymerizes still
 more easily. When recently distilled, it is a liquid, boiling
at 94-95°; after remaining at rest for some time, it is spon
taneously, and sometimes rapidly, converted into what is
called insoluble chloral, which is a white, opaque, porcellaneous,
hard mass, and, when heated to 180 , re-forms ordinary
chloral.
    The aldol, CH, . CH(OH) . CH3 . CHO, of Wiirtz also poly
merizes readily, forming paraldol, which is a beautiful crystal
line solid, melting at 90 (Comptes Rendus, lxxxiii. p. 255).
Some aldehydes are only known in the polymeric state, as
oxalic aldehyde or glyoxal*, CHO . CHO.
    From analogy, this body ought to be gaseous, or at least
a very volatile liquid at the ordinary temperature :—

   In reality, however, glyoxal is only known as a non
volatile viscous mass. It is unnecessary to extend these
examples, for the same facts are illustrated in various degrees
by all the members of this group (see Bruylants, ' On the
Polymerization of the Aldehydes,' Inaug. Diss., Louvain,
1875). The self-additive power of methylene oxide, which is
so evident in its mono-derivatives, the aldehydes, is less marked
in its di-derivatives, the acetones. Though true polymers
of acetone itself are unknown, yet those of some of its chloro-
derivatives have been obtained by Grabowsky (Ber. viii.
p. 1438).
   If we compare the boiling-points of the glycollic, aldehydic,
and acetonic chlorides with those of the corresponding oxides,
 thus:—
   CHj,.CH3.0 ... b.-p. 13            CH2C1 . CHjCl        b.-p. 84

and if we further bear in mind the general fact that in the
isomeric substituted derivatives of the paraffins, the volatility
is the greater when the substitution has taken place in a chain
or chains which are least hydrogenated, then we must con
clude that the aldehydes and acetones are only known to us
in the state of polymers, which depolymerize completely at
the boiling-point. Thus, acetic aldehyde should be gaseous
and more volatile than the oxide of ethylene; propionic alde
hyde more volatile than oxide of propylene; and acetone more
volatile than the corresponding aldehyde C8H60. The real
 relations are, however, the reverse of these.
         Actual Polymerization of the Oxides themselves.
   The actual polymerization of the oxides is readily indicated
by all those characters which have been long observed in the
case of the special variety of oxides called by Chevreul " oxydes
cuits." Certain anhydrous and pulverulent metallic oxides,

                     of the Metallic Oxides.                 95
obtained by dehydration of their hydroxides at as low a tem
perature as possible, suddenly enter into vivid incandescence
when exposed to a higher temperature, verging on redness.
Their properties are thus modified both physically and che
mically; they become denser, harder, and, when coloured,
their colour is intensified. They show a greater resistance to
the action of chemical agents than in their former condition,
some even entirely resisting the action of acid3 and alkalies.
Fe203, Cr203, Zr02, &c., are examples. The fact of this vivid
incandescence, which is not accompanied by any alteration in
the composition of the product, is the manifest proof of an
energetic combination of the oxide with itself. When hydro
carbons, such as amylene, terebenthene, &c, are polymerized
under the action of certain agents, such as sulphuric acid,
and especially boron fluoride, a development of heat takes
place which is frequently considerable. Finally, arsenic tri-
oxide is a direct proof of accumulation in a single molecule,
even in the gaseous state, of several normal molecules corre
sponding to the chloride. Arsenic trichloride being AsCl3,
the corresponding oxide ought to be As203. This is in fact
the arsenical oxygenated compound which is present in the
arsenites of methyl and ethyl {Bull. Soc. Chim. xiv. p. 101),
 compounds which are volatile without decomposition, and
 whose formulae, as deduced from vapour-density determina
tions, are (CH3)3As03 and (C2Hs)3AsOs. The molecule of
 arsenious oxide in the gaseous state corresponds not to Asj03,
 but to (As203)2 or As406, as proved by its vapour-density. It
 volatilizes at about 200° without fusion ; and there can be no
 doubt that its molecule in the solid state is some multiple of
 its gaseous molecule As4Os. There is thus established between
 the methylenic compounds and the arsenious ethers a complete
 parallel. To this we shall refer again.
            Various Methods of Producing the Oxides.
    By Dehydration of the Hydroxides.—The various methods of
 obtaining the oxides from other compounds containing them
 as radicals also tend to show that they are polymers. Among
 these methods, one of the most important, on account of its
 generality, and also the most interesting from our particular
 point of view, is the dehydration of hydroxides. Under the
 action of heat the hydroxides, with but few exceptions, lose
 water, either wholly or partially. But, however this may be,
 the dehydration is the more complete the higher the tem
 perature. This temperature varies according to the nature
 of the hydroxide. Some of the latter have only an ephemeral
 existence at the ordinary temperature, and are therefore more

  96           Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
  usually represented by their anhydrides. In addition to these
  general facts, it is important to observe not only the nature of
 the anhydrides thus obtained, but also the connection which
  underlies the two distinct chemical phenomena, viz. dehy
 dration and molecular condensation. Wiirtz developed this
 principle in one of his lectures before the Chemical Society of
 Paris in 1863. The elimination of water usually depends not
 on one but on several molecules of the hydroxide, the residues
 of which become soldered together, as it were, by the atoms of
 oxygen ; we therefore get an accumulation of the radicals of
 these hydroxides in the products formed—a veritable molecular
 condensation proportional to this accumulation. This principle
 applies to all hydroxides indiscriminately, not only to the
 normal hydroxides R*(OH)„ but to the oxyhydroxides or
 incomplete anhydrides R*0B(OrI),_2„. It therefore follows
 that the compounds formed under these conditions become
 more and more complex, in proportion as this dehydration
 itself is more or less complete.
    These general facta apply to all hydroxides, both organic
 and mineral. The following are illustrations from organic
 chemistry:—
    The acid alcohols are the most interesting in this connection.
 The most simple, and therefore the most conclusive cases are
 furnished by the glycollic and lactic acids. When heated,
 these compounds lose successively a half and then a whole
 molecule of water, forming finally glycollide and lactide. I
 have shown {Bull. Acad. Belg. xxvii. p. 409) that lactide in
 the state of vapour ought to be represented by the formula
 [(C3H40)0]„ and not by the usual formula fC3H40)0. The
 same thing applies also to glycollide, which is nonvolatile.
 If we represent the radicals glycollyl (CaHsO) and lactyl
 (C3H40) respectively by Gl and La, the action of heat on
 glycollic and lactic acids will be expressed thus*:—
                 .OH           ^Gl-OH                  GL
             GI<OH' . °<Gl-OH'                      °<G1>°'
                 .OH          n/La—OH
             L<OH'            °<La-OH'             °<La>0-
   • The following considerations prove that glycollide cannot be CjH,0„
but is really a polymer (C2Hj02)n. The minimum molecule of glycollic
acid is represented by CH2OH . COOH, and contains therefore the tetra-
valent radical (= C . CH2—). The corresponding chloride CC1, . CH.C1 is
a liquid, b.-p. 102°. Consequently the oxide, or glycoll, 0=C . CH2 . 0,
ought to be still more volatile, just as the oxide of methylene is gaseous,
whilst the chloride CH2C12 is a liquid, b.-p. 40°. In reality, however, this
is not the case, for glycollide is a fixed solid.

                     of the Metallic Oxides.                 97
   Ethylenic hydroxide, CH3 . C(OH)3 (or acetic acid,
C2H402 + H20), when distilled, is dehydrated, and forms the
corresponding oxyhydroxide (t. e. the common acetic acid),
which is represented in the state of vapour, not by the formula
C^Oa or CH3 . CO . OH, but by (C2H402)2 or
                 CH3.C(OH).O.C(OH).CH3.
                        '       o-i
   Again, the transformation on prolonged distillation at the
ordinary pressure of certain polyatomic hydroxides, notably
glycerol, C3H6(OH)3,and itsmonochlorhydrines,C3H6(OH)2Cl,
into condensation-products by dehydration are further examples
of this fact.
   Returning now to the dehydration of mineral hydroxides,
we have examples in the case of the acid hydroxides.
   1. Phosphoric Acid, H3P04 or (H03)PO, when heated to
200°, is converted into pyrophosphoric acid, H4P207 or
(HO)2PO\ 0 . P0(0H)2. Note also, in passing, the various
modifications of condensed metaphosphoric acid, discovered by
Fleitmann and Henneberg.
   2. Boric Acid, when dry and crystalline, is represented by
H3B03. On heating, it dehydrates progressively as follows:—
      Dried at ordinary temperature . H3B03.
                100°                        HB02 or H2B204.

At higher temperatures there is total dehydration and for
mation of fused anhydride (B203)„.
   3. Silicic Acid.—Normal silicic acid, H4Si04, is scarcely
known as such. It no doubt forms the gelatinous silica when
freshly precipitated. When heated, it exhibits progressive
dehydration:—
      Dried at ordinary temperature . H2Si03 or H4Si208.
          „     20°-256                    H2Si205.

 98           Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
     It is well to state here that I do not attach an absolute
 value to the formula? attributed to a good number of these
 incomplete hydrates of mineral acids. It would be difficult
 to regard all of them as definite compounds. The fact which
 is in evidence, and with which alone we are at present con
 cerned, is that with rise of temperature the dehydration
 goes on, and the molecular composition becomes more and
 more complicated by the accumulation of radicals in the oxy-
 hydroxyl residue. Though these hydrates themselves may
 not always have the character of well-defined compounds,
 they are often represented by corresponding derivatives
 having all the characteristics of true chemical substances.
     It is sufficient to mention Troost and Hautefeuille's oxy-
 chlorides of silicon, the numerous polysilicates, so varied in
composition and often so well defined, the condensed meta-
 phosphates, the molybdates, &c. Certain anhydrides, which
are totally wanting in oxyhydroxides, are represented by well-
defined salts, as in the case of chromic acid, of which the bi-
and tri-chromates, RiCr201 and BsCr3Oio, are well known.
 Metallic hydroxides also behave like the acid hydroxides,
thus :—
    1. Normal Plumboas Hydroxide should be Pb(OH)2, but
as ordinarily produced it is already partially dehydrated.
Dried at a low temperature, it has the formula H2Pb203
 (Tunnermann, Schaffner, &c.) or H3Pb304, in the form of
minute crystalline grains (Payen). At 100° it loses all its
water.
    2. Hydrates of Copper.—Cupric hydrate, Cu(OH)2, is the
bluish precipitate obtained on adding very dilute alkalies to
solutions of cupric- salts. Heated in water, this hydroxide
dehydrates partially and becomes black. It then has tho
following composition :—
        Dried over sulphuric acid . . H2Cu304 (Harms).
          „ at 100°                      H2Cu607 (Rose).
   Normal cuprous hydrate would have the minimum formula
Cu2(OH)s.         On partial dehydration it gives H2(Cu2)809
(Millon and Commaille), and H2(Cu2)406 (Mitscherlich) .
    '6. Hydrates of Thorium.—One of the known hydrates,
dried at 100°, corresponds to H4Th04; another, obtained by a
different method, and dried at the same temperature, cor
responds to H2Th408 (Clere).
   4. Manganic Hydrates.—Several hydroxides, formed under
various conditions, correspond to the peroxide Mn02, and are
as follows:— HjMn03, H2Mn204, H2Mn307, H2Mn409, and
H4Mn3Os. All these dehydrate, when heated, forming Mn02.

                       of the Metallic Oxides.                 99
    5. Ferric Hydrates.—The following hydrates of ferric
oxide, Fe203, are known:—
 Normal hydrate, H6(Fe2)06             Limonite, Fe203 . 3H20.
                    H,(Fe2)05                     Fe203 . 2H20.
                    H2(Fe2)04 .        Gothite,   Fe203. H20.
       »     »      H6(Fe2)209 .       Limonite, 2Fe203 . 3H20.
       „     „      H2(Fe2)207 .       Turgite, 2Fe203. H20.
       »     »      H10(Fe2)3Ou.                 3Fe203 . 5H20.
 On heating, they are all dehydrated to Fe203.
    The brown ocbreous precipitate obtained on adding an
alkali to ferric chloride is undoubtedly Fe2(OH)6, but when
dried in a vacuum it has the composition (Fe2)2H609, or
2Fe203.3H20. Heated to ebullition, it dehydrates and
becomes Fe2H204 or Fe203 . HsO. By prolonged ebullition
 it can be totally dehydrated.
    6. Aluminium Hydrates.—Aluminium solutions, on addition
of ammonia in excess, give the normal hydrate A12(0H)6 in
the form of a white gelatinous precipitate. On prolonged
ebullition this is partially dehydrated, like the corresponding
ferric hydrate, and becomes insoluble in acids and in alkalies,
like calcined alumina (Pean de St. Gilles). This new hy
droxide corresponds to the formula (HO)2Als . 0 . Al2(OH)2,
which is analogous to pyrophosphoric acid. Besides the
normal hydrate Al2(OH)e, hydrargillite, there is also the
mineral diaspore, Al202(OH)2 or A1203 . HaO, to which we
shall refer hereafter.
    All these oxyhydroxides, both natural and artificial, which
are products of the condensation of the normal l^drates, are
completely dehydrated under the action of heat, at a tempe
rature above that at which they are formed.
    Since the same causes produce the same effects, it is natural
to conclude that the last phase of the dehydration is accom
panied, as in those which precede it, by an analogous molecular
condensation. The elimination of water having determined
the accumulation of the radicals in the products to which
they give rise, it would be unreasonable and illogical to
suppose that an entirely different phenomenon occurred at
the moment of elimination of the last molecule of water,
resulting in the dislocation of these residues of condensation
previously soldered together by the intermediatory oxygen.
    Dehydration and condensation are intimately connected.
We must conclude, therefore, that at the moment the last
molecule of water is given off, not only docs the previous
condensation of the oxyhydroxide remain, but that, con
formably to the general rule, it becomes still more accentuated.
                                 H2

100          Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
Thus, when crystalline plumbous hydrate, 3PbO . H20, loses
 its last molecule of water under the action of heat, it is not
 PbO which is formed, but at least (3PbO)2. When HsSi8017
 becomes the anhydride, we do not get Si02, but at least
 (Si80i6)2. For a similar reason metaphosphoric acid cannot
 be HP03, bui i« at least (HP03)2, since it is formed by de
hydration of H,P207.
    The structure of these oxyhydroxides leads to the con
 clusion that they are, in effect, fragments of the normal
 hydroxides, R*(OH)„ linked together by atoms of oxygen,
thus : —
       H3P04 .     .  PO(OH),       H2Pb02 .    .  Pb(OH)2
       H4P207 .    .  PO(OH)2       H2Pb30< .   .  Pb(OH)

                                                   b
                                                   Pb(OH)
    The fact of the polymerization of an oxide at the moment
of dehydration of the corresponding hydroxide, is also con
firmed experimentally in certain cases, thus : —The methylic
and ethylic arsenites (CH3)3AsOj and (U2H8)3As03 are decom
posed by water, and give, not arsenious acid, H3AsOs, but the
solid anhydride, which is, even in the state of vapour, a
polymer represented by As406.
    The same thing also holds good with methylene oxide. Its
chloracetate, CH2C1 . OAc (Henry, Bull. Acad. Belg. xxxv.
p. 717), its diacetate, CH2(OAc)2, and the compounds ob
tained by Friedel (Compt. Rend, lxxxv. p. 2471) are also
decomposed by water, yielding, not the hydroxide CH2(OH)s,
but the solid polymerized oxide (CH2 : 0)„.
    The metallic oxides can be obtained from their different
salts by various reactions. These general methods furnish a
number of facts which tend to prove the polymeric nature of
these compounds. We will examine successively in this con
nection the various classes of salts, such as carbonates, sul
phates, &c.
    Carbonates.—As a general rule most carbonates are de
composed by heat, leaving an oxide. For this reason these
salts are perfectly assimilable to the hydroxides, and we may
therefore confirm by their help the results previously arrived
at. The chief difference is the degree of heat required.
    It is important, from our point of view, to show that de

                      of the Metallic Oxides.                 101
carbonation, like dehydration, does not occur all at once, but
is continuous and progressive according to the temperature.
The course of this decomposition is clearly shown in parti
cular cases, notably in the decomposition of certain insoluble
carbonates in the presence of water, and at a slightly elevated
temperature, and often at the moment of precipitation. The
decomposition results in the formation of basic carbonates,
anhydrides or hydrates, oxy- or hydroxy-carbonates, of a com
position more or less complex, and in the smallest molecule
of which are accumulated several molecules of metallic oxide or
hydroxide. A large number of metals, e. g. Mg, Zn, Pb, Cu,
Bi, Hg, Al, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, &c, furnish remarkable examples
of this general fact. These insoluble basic carbonates are
usually obtained by precipitation with soluble carbonates,
either from hot or cold metallic solutions. The composition
of these precipitates for the same metal, frequently varies
between more or less wide limits, depending on the special
circumstances under which the precipitation nas taken place.
It is evident that these various compounds cannot all be con
sidered as well defined. There are some however, the che
mical individuality of which has been well established, and a
number of these, either natural or artificial, are capable of
assuming the crystalline state. The following are examples :—
   a. HLg .    .  .  3C02.4MgO + 4H20.
                     4COs . 5MgO + 5H,0. Magnesia alba.
   b. Zn. Composition very varied.

   c. Pb. The following, according to H. Rose, represent the
composition of the hydrocarbonates of lead formed under
definite conditions :—

   As a general rule these precipitates become more and more
basic as the temperature of precipitation is higher, and, like
the corresponding hydrates, they become decarbonated and
dehydrated under a more or less intense heat. The cause
which determines the molecular complexity of these com
pounds, the accumulation of the metallic radicals in the same
product, leads as a final result to a true oxide. The produc
tion of a simple monometallic oxide ROx by the action of
heat, would consequently compel us to assume, that at a given
moment an effect was produced quite contrary to all that had
preceded it.
   Nitrates, Sulphates, and Chlorides.— The following phe
nomena are quite analogous to that which we have just
examined. We have seen that certain carbonates, formed
in the presence of water, are partially decomposed by the
latter, with the formation of a hydroxide, and the final
production of a basic hvdrocarbonate, the radical C03
being replaced by HO. The nitrates, sulphates, and chlo
rides of certain metals, notably those whoso oxides are
feeble bases, undergo a similar change in the presence of
water. A salt originally neutral in composition is first con
verted into a basic salt, and finally, under the action of heat,
in the presence of a large quantity of water (either alone or
slightly alkaline), into a true oxide. Thus :—
    Mercuric Nitrate Hg(NOs)s, under the action of cold water,
gives a basic trimercuric nitrate Hg(N08)s . 2HgO, which

                      of the Metallic Oxides.                103
is a yellow salt, known as turbith nitreux. By prolonged
treatment with water this salt becomes more and more basic.
Kane has described a salt having the composition Hg(N03)2 .
5HgO. Finally it gives mercuric oxide. Nitrate of bismuth
behaves in a similar manner. A large quantity of water, hot
or cold, converts mercuric sulphate, HgS04, into trimercuric
sulphate, HgS04 . 2HgO, which, in the presence of an alka
line solution, finally becomes mercuric oxide. The solution
of oxide of antimony in fuming sulphuric acid yields, accord
 ing to Peligot, the crystalline salt Sb203 . 2S03. The latter
in the presence of water gives the basic salt H2S04 . 2Sb203,
which completely decomposes in the presence of a large
 quantity of water into oxide of antimony. Antimony trichlo
 ride, SbCl3, gives, when treated with water, white precipitates
 of oxychlorides, which are finally converted into the oxide.
 One of these compounds is crystalline, and has the formula
 5Sb203 . 2SbCl3. It is well known with what facility oxide
 and chloride of mercury combine to form oxychlorides
 (HgO)x. (HgCl2)r These can be obtained in different ways,
 and are of very varied composition. Several of them are
 crystalline, one of the latter being 6HgO . HgCl2. They are
 all converted into mercuric oxide in alkaline solution.
    It is only natural to suppose that, when these various basic
 compounds are converted, either by the action of water alone,
 or in the presence of an alkali, into the oxide, with the total
 elimination of the acid radical and its replacement by oxy
 gen, the bonds, which hold together the several radicals or
 atoms of the metal in one and the same molecule, remain
throughout. The action of the water having originally de
 termined them, it would be illogical to suppose that at a
particular moment they cease to act.
    Acid Anhydrides.—The same reasoning may be applied to
anhydro-compounds produced by the action of strong acids
on their salts, and especially on their acid anhydrides, as in
the case of the chromates.
    Chromic anhydride, Cr03, forms three series of salts : —
           Monochromates . K2Cr04 or K20 . Cr03.
           Dichromates . . K2Cr207 or K20 . 2Cr03.
           Trichromates . . K2Cr3Oio or K20 . 3Cr03.
    Under the action of an acid, such as sulphuric, the mono-
  chromate is converted successively into the di- and tri-chro-
 mates, and finally into the anhydride. The latter ought,
 therefore, to be represented by some multiple of Cr03.
    Finally, we find a direct proof of this polymerization in the
  decomposition of the arsenites by acids. Among those 6alts

104          Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
there are some which contain several molecules of As,Oj in
their molecule, such as :—
                        KsO . (A8sOj)3 . H,0.
                        K„0 . (AssOj),.
                       2K,0 . (A8i03)3 . 3H,0.
    All these salts, under the action of acids, give arsonious
anhydride, which, even in the state of vapour, is represented
by (As,08)s- Here we have a proof of the accumulation of
radicals, which exists in the primitive salt, remaining in the
expelled oxide.
                 Comparative Density of Oxides.
    A comparison of the specific gravities of the metallic oxides
 with those of other compounds, containing the same radical,
 furnishes a new argument for the polymerization of the
oxides.
    The specific gravity of a solid body doubtless depends in
a great measure on the state of aggregation, and is also ulti
 mately connected with the composition of the body and the
 size of the molecular weight. This connection becomes
 evident in the case of isomorphous solid bodies, which differ
 by elements of which the atomic weights are very far apart
 as to their numeric value.
    The density, then, is to a certain degree a function of the
 molecular weight. If the oxides corresponding to the normal
 hydrates, less water, be represented by
                      R'(OH),= R'0--fH10,
 it follows that, having a smaller molecular weight than the
 hydroxides, their density in the solid state should also be less
 than that of the latter. This is in fact the relation which is
 observed between the glycols and their anhydrides, which
  latter are the oxides of the radicals C.H^,,, thus :—

     A difference of an exactly inverse order exists between the

metallic hydrates and their anhydrides, the latter having
generally a greater density. The density gradually and suc
cessively increases as the hydrate loses its water, until it
attains its maximum in the anhydrides or oxides themselves.

    The great difference observed between tho density of certain
oxides and that of their basic anhydrous salts is equally
worthy of note, thus :—

A study of the oxides, from both a physical and chemical
point of view, leads, therefore, to the general conclusion, that
for the most part the oxides cannot be compared with the
chlorides ; that the true oxides which are really comparable with
the chlorides are unknown ; and that we possess only polymers
 thereof (RO,)„.
            Value of the Coefficient of Polymerization.
    What, now, is the true value of the coefficient n of polyme
 rization ? What is the real molecular formula of these
 polymeric oxides? These questions are doubtless of great
 interest, but it should be stated at once that it is absolutely
 impossible to give an exact answer. I do not know of any
 fact which would allow us to assign an absolute value to the
 coefficient n of polymerization, for we are in exactty the same
  position in respect to the metallic oxides as we are in the case
  of the solid polymeric ones of organic chemistry, e. g.
  methylene oxide, metaldehyde, &c. So far as facts will per
  mit of a conclusion, we may affirm that in most cases this
  number is very high, although different for different oxides. The
  molecular weight of most oxides should therefore be consider
  able. This conclusion results from a consideration of certain
  facts previously referred to, and to which it will be necossary
 to return for a moment.

108         Prof. Louis Henry on the Polymerization
   Oxygen is an element endowed in reality, in spite of appear
ances to the contrary, with great power of volatilization. It
forms oxides which are gaseous, or at least very volatile, with
elements which are relatively but little volatile, as sulphur ;
or which are even entirely fixed, as carbon and osmium. To
these normal oxides, which are regular at least in their physical
properties, there correspond chlorides which are notably less
volatile, as in the case of those of carbon :—
                     C02 gaseous, b.-p. — 78.
                     CC14 liquid, b.-p. + 76.
That being so, it may be affirmed that many of the regular
metallic oxides which correspond to the chlorides should be
gaseous at the ordinary temperature, or at least very volatile.
This should be especially true of Si02, A1203, &c.; for SiCl4 is
a liquid boiling at 58°, and A12C16 a solid volatile below 100°.
In reality, however, these oxides, which I regard as polymers,
(Si02)» and (A1203)B, are fixed solids. Organic chemistry
furnishes examples of the relationships which exist in poly
mers between the volatility and molecular weight, thus :—
                                 Molec. wt.       B.-p. Difference.
Ethylene oxide       C2H40      . 44     liquid    13°'5") AA0 ,
Ethylene dioxide    (C2H40)2    . 88     liquid 102 / 00 0
Aldehyde             C2H40     . 44      liquid 21 \inoo
Paraldehyde         (C2H40)3    . 132    liquid 124 f W6
We thus see what is the difference in volatility between
bodies of which the molecular weight in the state of gas is
simple, double, or treble.
   Now between a body which ought to be gaseous or very
volatile, such as Si02, and a fixed body, such as silica really
is, there is a difference which cannot be compared to that
 which separates (as regards volatility) ethylene oxide and
aldehyde from their polymers. If silica is, as I believe, a
polymer (Si02)„, then the value of n should be considerable,
and the molecular weight therefore very high. We come to
the same conclusion if we consider the examples which are
 furnished by the relative densities of the chlorides and oxides of
the radicals C„H2„ and those of their polymers. As already
 remarked above, the density of the chlorides is higher than that
 of the corresponding oxides, whereas the densities of the poly
 mers of the latter rise, approaching those of the chlorides, and
 even going beyond. The densities of tho metallic oxides are
 often considerably greater than those of the chlorides. If wo

                        of the Metallic Oxides.                109
bear in mind the small difference which exists between the den
sity of the oxides C»H2B0 and that of their polymers (CBHSnO)2
or (CaHSltO)3, we are led to conclude that the coefficient n of
polymerization of the metallic oxides must be very high, in
order to raise the density of an oxide to nearly double that of
tho corresponding chloride, as is frequently the case.
    Doubtless the molecular condensation is different with
different metallic oxides. A priori we should expect it to be
so. This is proved by tho fact that the difference between tho
 fusibility, volatility, density, &c. of the oxides and the corre
sponding chlorides is very different in the several cases.
    This condensation appears to attain its maximum in certain
fixed and very infusible oxides, such as silica and alumina
&c, the corresponding chlorides being eminently volatile.
This enormous condensation of their molecules may possibly
be the cause of the greater resistance which they offer to tho
action of chemical agents, more especially to simple chemical
agents such as H, 0, CI, S, &c.
   Origin and Mechanism of the Polymerization of Oie Oxides.
   What is the origin, or, rather, what is the mechanism, of this
molecular condensation which is so general in tho oxides, and
yet so absent in the chlorides ? The diverse chemical nature
 of the two elements accounts for the different molecular
 behaviour of their compounds.
    Chlorine is essentially a monovalent clement, whilst oxygon
 is divalent. The result of this quality in oxygen is the pos
 sibility of its uniting by its two affinities with two polyvalent
 radicals.
     From the atomic and molecular point of view, polymeri
 zation consists essentially in a simple change in which each
 atom of oxygen becomes united to two different atoms of tho
 radical belonging to different molecules, and maintains them
 jiermanently together as a whole. Tho conversion of acetic
 aldehyde into its triple polymer, paraldehyde, is an interesting
 example of this atomic migration : —

    Similar facts occur, and in a similar manner, in the case of
 the metallic oxides, thus :—

   There is thus formed a kind of closed chain of polyvalent
radicals alternating with n atoms of oxygen. It is thus seen
that the number of atoms of the radical R accumulated in
such a complex molecule may be considerable, and is theo
retically illimitable. Similar groupings cannot occur in the
case of the chlorides, on account of the nature of chlorine,
which is a monovalent element, and consequently incapable
of uniting directly with two other distinct atoms. All mole
cular condensation thus disappears, when in a polymeric
oxide the oxygen is replaced by chlorine, as in the case of
 (Ass03)2, which, under the action of chlorine, is converted
into As(JI3. Also, as in the case of the polymers {C„H3H0)X)
 more especially those of aldehydes, which are converted by
 PC15 into the chlorides C„HSnCl2, identical with those fur
nished by the oxides (CnHJnO) themselves.
                Heat of Formation of the Oxides.
    The combination of a body with itself, or the act of poly
 merization, is accompanied by the development of heat, as

                      of the Metallic Oxides.                Ill
with every combination of heterogeneous bodies ; and this dis
engagement of heat may sometimes be considerable, as in the
case of the internal combustion (spontaneous in the com
plete sense of the word), which certain metallic oxides
undergo on heating (oxydes cuits of Chevreul).
   The quantity of heat disengaged on the formation of an
oxide RO, in the direct way has a double origin, viz. the heat
of combination of the elements and the heat of polymeriza
tion ; so that the direct formation of a chloride is not at all
comparable with that of an oxide. A comparison, therefore,
of the phenomena of combination, from the physical point of
view, shows that the heat evolved is an absolute measure of
the difference of the affinities between the elements of the
compound. That being so, we should conclude that the dif
ference between the affinity of oxygen and chlorine for the
metals is in reality greater than the thermal phenomena, as
determined directly, would lead us to assume.
      Action of Heat on the Oxides—their Classification.
   The oxides may be divided into various groups, according
to the changes which they undergo on heating.
   A. Normal or Regular Oxides, which correspond molecu-
larly to the chlorides. These oxides are few in number, e. a.
SOs, COs, NO, NjO, CO, &c.
   B. Polymerized Oxides, the molecules of which are made
up of n molecules of the normal oxide united together. This
group includes most oxides, and may be divided into several
classes according te the action of heat thereon ; viz. :—
   (1) Volatile oxides, which are totally depolymerized on heat
ing, and in the state of vapour are converted into the normal
oxide. The number of these oxides is limited, and they are of
two kinds :—
   (a) Oxides which are completely depolymerized on volatiliza
        tion, yielding a vapour of normal density, e. g. S03,
        Os04, and probably Ru04 ; also various organic oxides,
        such as methylene oxide (CH20)„, metaldehyde
        (CH8 . CHO)B, and aldehydes and acetones in general.
        On condensation the original polymeric oxides are
        re-formed.
   (b) Oxides which are depolymerized very imperfectly at the
        moment of volatilization, and only completed progres
        sively as the temperature rises. The vapour-density of
        these bodies, therefore, gradually diminishes with in
        crease in temperature up to a certain point, beyond
        which it becomes constant, and corresponds to that of
        the normal oxide, e. g. N904, fatty acids, and paral

112            Prof. Louis Heury on the Polymerization
          dehyde. The vapour-density of the last corresponds to
           (C2H40)3 at low temperatures, and at higher tempera
           tures to (C2H40), t. e. the normal aldehyde.
     (2) Volatile oxides, which are only depolymerized imper
fectly, at leant at tlie temperatures to which they have been sub
jected ; e. g. (As203)», the gaseous molecule of which is
 (AsA),*-
    Lactide, or the dioxide of the radical C3H4i» (orCH8 . CH.C=),
                                                                 I
 is perfectly analogous to arsenious oxide, its molecule in the
 state of vapour corresponding to (C3H402)2. Ethylene dioxide
 (C2H40)„ probably belongs to this class, as in the state of
 vapour its molecule = (C2H40)2.
     (3) Oxides which are not capable of depolytnerization. Most
 inorganic oxides belong to this group ; also the oxides of
 certain organic radicals.
     They are of two kinds :—
     (a) Oxides which are absolutely indepolymerizable and fixed,
           as in the case of many metallic oxides which are not
           decomposed by heat ; e. g. Si02, B203. Sn02, ZnO,
           MgO, Fe20„ Cr203, A1203, PbO, CuO, Cu20, Ac.
     (b) Oxides which are indepolymerizable, because on heating
           they are decomposed either into their elements or into new
          compounds, as in the case of several metallic oxides ;
          e. g. HgO, Ag20, Hg20, Cr03, Mn02, &c, and also of
          certain organic oxides, as glycollide (C2H202)n, which
          carbonizes on heating.
     The above classification is conveniently represented in the
 following table (p. 113).
     It follows from all these facts and considerations that there
are large and important lacunas in the series of oxygenated
 compounds of Mineral Chemistry. Shall we ever be able to
obtain the whole series of normal oxides, of which we have at
present so few examples ? I know not. But to produce them
 we should doubtless have to work under conditions totally
different from those which are usually employed. Our actual
 methods of preparation arc precisely those under which these
unknown bodies polymerize, and thus escape us. If it be
 rash to hope to obtain these bodies in the near future, it would
 be still more so to say that their discovery was impossible.
 This word is profoundly repugnant to our tendencies and scien
 tific habits. When we measure the progress of science since the
 commencement of the century in a domain so vast as Che
 mistry, there are many reasons for not being discouraged.
    • Arsenious oxide volatilizes, as is well known, at about 200° without
 melting. This temperature is not the boiling-point properly bo called,
 but is really the temperature of depolymeriiation of the molecule (As/),),
into (As,0,)j.

        Dehydration and Condensation of the Hydroxides
                               by Heat.
   It has been already stated that the hydroxides, under the
action of a gradually increasing temperature, undergo a pro
gressive dehydration, whilst at the same time their molecules
become more and more condensed by the accumulation of the
residual oxyhydroxides of the radical of the primitive compound.
What is the cause of this general fact ? This phenomenon is
analogous, both in appearance and result, to that of direct
etherification, i. e. to the action of an acid on an alcohol. In
fact, etherification is an example of the production of an
anhydrous oxide from its hydroxide. The most simple case
is that in which we can follow step by step the work of
dehydration, as with ordinary lactic acid.
    Lactic acid, C3H603, is the dihydroxide of the radical
lactyl, (J3H40, which we may represent by La. On heating,
lactic acid gives successively two anhydrides, the so-called
lactic anhydride,
             2C8H603 - H,0 = HO . La . 0 . La . OH,
 and lactide,
                  2C3H603-2H20 = La . 0 . La . 0.
                                        I          I
    The dehydration thus takes place in two steps, and requires
 at least two molecules of acid—a fact which is easily under
 stood from the usual formula of lactic acid,
                        CH3.CH(OH).COOH.
 The two hydroxyl groups are not equivalent ; the one is acid
 and the other alcoholic ; so that the action of heat on lactic
 acid is really the action of an acid on an alcohol, which
 mutually and successively undergo etherification, giving the
 so-called lactic anhydride, which is at the same time an acid,
 an alcohol, and an ether,

 which is only but doubly an ether. If the radical lactyl were
  known only en bloc, the reason of this difference in the nature

    The molecule of lactide, which in the state of vapour is
 (C3H402)2, ought in its natural state to be still more complex.
 The boiling-point of this substance is really the temperature
 at which the grouping (C3H402)2» becomes (C3H402)2. This
 is the logical conclusion from the molecular constitution of
 carboxylated acids. The molecule of acetic acid must be at
 least

 The formula CH3 . COOH, commonly attributed to this acid,
 only represents the product of the simplification of its mole
 cule under the action of a high temperature. That being so,
the molecule of lactic acid should be at least
                               CH,

    In the formation of dilactic acid and of lactide, two of such
molecules act on one another, and consequently the molecule
of lactide ought to be at least [(C3H402)2]2,i. e. the double of its
molecule in the state of vapour. However that may be, the
hydroxides of the polyvalent radicals of mineral chemistry are
assimilable to the above organic hydroxides; and we may
therefore reasonably conclude that the bydroxyls which they
contain are of different value. This question may be answered
affirmatively and with certainty in some cases, notably that of
phosphoric acid. Thomsen, Berthelot, and Longuinine have
shown what is the real nature of this compound.
    Orthophosphoric acid, PO(OH)3, is a tribasic acid, but of
quite a different kind from citric acid, in so far as in the latter
the three hydroxyls are perfectly equivalent, as shown by the
identity of their heats of neutralization. Citric acid, as shown
by its formula, is equivalent to three molecules of carbonic
acid rolled into one.

116        On the Polymerization of the Metallic Oxides.
    Phosphoric acid, on the contrary, is equivalent to three
different acids, the heats of neutralization of the three basicities
of the acid by the same metal being unequal.
                 H,PO< + NaHO = 14-68 cals.
                         + 2NaHO= 26-33 „
                         + 3NaHO = 3359 „
    The substitution of hydrogen by sodium thus causes suc
cessively the evolution of 14-68, 11-65, and 7-26 cals. As
regards two of its hydroxyls, orthophosphoric acid is strongly
acid, though unequally, the one having an acidity similar to
that of hydrochloric or nitric acid, and the other to carbonic
acid ; whilst the third hydroxyl is more like that of an alcohol
or phenol.
    The action of heat on phosphoric acid is really the action of
 heat on an acid-alcohol, and ought therefore to exhibit phe
 nomena similar to those observed in the case of lactic acid.
 These phenomena ought even to be more complicated, because
 for one molecule of PO(OH)s acting as an alcohol there is
 another molecule acting as an acid, and can function by one
 or other of its hydroxyls, which are not only acid, but un
 equally acid.
    The formation of pyrophosphoric acid seems to be perfectly
 analogous to that of phosphoglyceric acid, thus :—
     (HO),PO . 0 . PO(OH),         (HO),. C3H5 . 0 . PO(OH)
 Two isomers, however, appear possible. Besides the three
 hydroxyls of phosphoric acid having a different chemical
 value, it follows that the products of the phosphoric etherifi-
 cation, from tho partial dehydration of H3P04, ought to be
 very numerous and complicated. Our present knowledge of
 the action of heat on this acid is therefore very superficial.
     Can wo refer the condensation of the metallic polyhydroxyls
  under the action of heat to the same cause—i. e. to a difference
 in the nature and value of the several hydroxyls ? It seems
  natural and logical to do so, but it is difficult to find sufficient
  authority.
     Phosphoryl being a multiple radical, formed of hetero
  geneous atoms, one can rigorously account for the fact that
  the three hydroxyls, which are grouped around it, are un
  equally placed as regards these elements, and can therefore
  have different values. But to conclude that the different
  hydroxyls attached to the same polyvalent atom, such as Si,
   Sn, &c, have not the same value, it would be necessary to
  assume that the polyvalent atoms are not identical at all

             On the Thermoelectric Position of Carbon.            117
  points, or at least that the various units of chemical action are
  not equivalent, and are therefore of unequal energy. Here
  we introduce one of the higher problems of chemical meta
  physics. I abstain, however, from dealing with it at present.
     If the condensation which certain hydroxides undergo on
 heating is explicable in certain cases, there are others much
  more numerous, which still remain without plausible expla
 nation, and notably is this the case with the hydroxides of the
 elements.
                On the Oxide of Methylene, CHS : 0.
    There is no compound more interesting than this, from the
 point of view of the polymerization of the metallic oxides. There
 is a perfect parallel between the reactions by which it may be
 obtained from its ethers and those by which certain oxides
 are prepared from their salts. Just as the arsenious ethers
 under the action of water give arsenious anhydride, so do the
 methylenic ethers, when treated with water, give methylene
oxide, i. e. its solid polymer.
    These reactions may also be compared with those which
give certain metallic oxides, as Sb203, Bis03, HgO, &c, by
 the decomposition of their salts with an excess of water, or by
 weak alkaline leys. Methylene (CHj) acts in all respects
 like a metal, and its oxide is strictly comparable to a metallic
 oxide, with this difference, that when heated it is completely
 depolymerized on volatilization, whereas certain oxides, as
(AssOs)„ are only imperfectly depolymerized, whilst others,
such as HgO, Bi203, &c., are fixed.

chlorides of the dicarbon radicals Cj", CsHaiT, CaH4".
         XIV. On the Thermoelectric Position of Carbon.
                       By John Buchanan *.
                             [Plate VIII.]
IN the very interesting paper read by Dr. J. A. Fleming
       before this Society on March 14, 1885, whilst discussing
the question of the life of incandescent lamps, the author re
marks that quite a large proportion of the carbon filaments
are found to break at the negative end, that is, near the point
where the current passes from carbon to platinum. It seemed
to me not improbable that the negative end of the carbon
might be subjected to a heating action due to the operation

118                   Mr. J. Buchanan on the
of the " Peltier effect." The local excess of temperature thus
produced might possibly account for the observed result. In
any case the determination of the position of the carbon line
on the thermoelectric diagram was of interest. I am not
aware that this has been done before.
   Result.—For the specimen of carbon I have tried, the
Thomson effect is of the same sign as in copper, and about
twice the value for that metal given by Prof. Tait, as quoted
in Everett's " Units and Physical Constants," § 186. The
thermoelectric power of carbon is given by my experiments,
                !•,.= -390- 1-87<C.G.S. units,      .  .   .   (1)
where t denotes, as usual, the mean temperature of the junc
tions. The neutral point of carbon with lead is therefore
about - 209° C.
   Thermo-couple of Platinum-Carbon.—As I have mentioned,
the series of experiments described below were undertaken
with the object of finding the magnitude of the Peltier effect
in incandescent lamps. I therefore examined specially the
behaviour of a thermoelectric couple of platinum-carbon.
The platinum was a piece of ordinary commercial wire pro
cured from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey. The carbon was
in the form of rods 12 millim. diam., such as are made for use
in arc lamps. The direction of the current in such a couple
is from platinum to carbon across the hot joint. The thermo
electric power at the mean temperature t is
                ept-c= + 566 + 3-94< C.G.S. units.       .   .  (2)
    Due, therefore, to the " Peltier effect," heat will be gene
 rated at the negative end of the carbon filament of an incan
 descent lamp when the current is passing. We can now
 calculate what proportion the heat thus generated locally
 bears to the whole quantity of heat generated in the filament.
    If T denote the neutral point of a thermo-couple, then the
 Peltier effect for the absolute temperature 8 at one joint is
 given by
                 v=(Kl-Ki)(T-8)ei                               (3)
 where K, and K3 are the numbers that express for each
 material the ratio that the Thomson effect bears to the abso
 lute temperature. (See Tait's ' Heat/ §415.)
    Hence for a platinum-carbon couple,
                 w=3-94 (144 + 0)0                              (4)
    As a specific example, take ihe case of a 100- volt lamp,

               Thermoelectric Position of Carbon.          119
with the filament at a temperature of 2400° C. We got the
ratio
     Heat due to Peltier effect 3-94 x 2673(144 + 2400)
      Whole heat in filament ~~          100 x 108       '
                                  2-7 xlO7
                »              - 10lu '
                „              =-0027.
   The local heating at the negative end of the filament is
therefore only about one quarter per cent, of the whole heat.
This is too small to have any appreciable influence on the
life of the lamp. It does not appear therefore that the Peltier
effect accounts for the giving way of the carbon-filament at
one end rather than at the other. In the course of these
experiments one phenomenon was forced on my attention,
the details of which are given below. It seems that con
tinuous heating alters the thermoelectric properties of carbon.
This alteration must be the result of molecular change in the
 material. That this has any bearing on the destruction of
 the filament that ensues, by keeping it for a long time at a
high temperature, my experiments are not extended enough
to decide.
                     Experimental Details.
    The E.M.F. at various temperatures was determined by the
null method known as Poggendorffs.
    The primary circuit contained a constant cell A, a gradu
ated wire BC, and a box of resistance-coils R.
    On the graduated wire were placed sliding pieces e and /,
which served as the terminals of the secondary circuit. In
the secondary circuit were a galvanometer G, and the therino
couple T whose E.M.F. was to be measured, and a key K.
                              l\r. 1.
                     T
    The arrangement of the apparatus used in the platinum-
carbon experiments has now to be described.

120                 Mr. J. Buchanan on the
   Three rods of carbon of 1*2 centim. diameter, such as are
manufactured for use in arc-lamps, were taken. One of these
was thinned down into a conical form at the end destined to
go into the hot bath. This end, and that of another rod
intended to go into the cold bath, were electroplated with a
thin shell of copper. To this copper shell were soldered the
platinum wires, whose behaviour with the carbon I wished
to examine. These two rods were then placed vertically and
clamped in position with coppered ends dipping into their
respective baths. The upper ends of these carbon rods were
cut off square and the third rod laid horizontally, so as to
form with the vertical rods the third side of a vertical rect
angle.
   To ensure good contact one end of this third rod was bound
by a number of turns of clean iron wire to the upper end of
the rod whose lower end dipped into the cold bath. The
other end of this third rod rested on the top of the rod the
lower end of which dipped into the hot bath. The surfaces
of contact were here scraped flat and kept pressed together
by a weight of 3 or 4 pounds.
   The platinum wires that formed the other element of the
thermo-couple were of ordinary commercial material, as was
mentioned above.
   The galvanometer used in the secondary circuit is a very
delicate mirror instrument of about { ohm resistance.
   The cell used in the primary circuit as a standard was a
Daniell. The graduated wire (BC in fig. 1) was of German
silver.
   The baths, both hot and cold, were oil-baths.
   The ends of the platinum wires of the thermo-couple that
were exterior to the baths were joined by binding-screws to
copper wires. These joints were insulated from one another
by several layers of calico, and then tightly wrapped up to
gether. Thus in the secondary circuit the only exposed con
tacts of dissimilar conductors were those of the copper wires
joined up with the brass binding-screws of the key, of the
galvanometer, and of the sliding piece on the graduated wire.
During the experiment, care was taken to screen these exposed
contacts as much as possible from external radiation. More
over, all the apparatus was set up the night before, so that on
the days of the experiments no metal joints whatever in the
secondary circuit were touched by hand.
   Some preliminary experiments I had made showed the
necessity for adopting the arrangements just described. The
results of these preliminary trials exhibited very curious
irregularities, not altogether got rid of even by those latest

                Thermoelectric Position of Carbon.            121
arrangements. By using the precautions detailed above, I
ensured, however, that the place of any disturbances that
might come into play should be located with certainty in the
thermo-joints under examination.
    The proper amount of resistance to be inserted in the
primary circuit having been determined beforehand, the
primary circuit was closed. The current was allowed to
flow during the whole time the experiment lasted. The
temperature of the hot bath was raised very slowly up to the
highest point reached; then as slowly lowered again. Fre
quent readings of the thermometers in the hot and cold baths
 were taken. Simultaneously were noted the positions of the
 movable sliders on the graduated wire, for which no deflec
tion was shown by the galvanometer on depressing the key in
 the secondary circuit.
    When a temperature reading was intended to be taken,
 the temperature was kept as steady as possible for ^ to ^ a
minute, accompanied with constant stirring of the hot bath.
 In this way a series of corresponding readings of temperature
 and of distances on the graduated wire were obtained. The
 results were plotted out, taking centimetres of the graduated
wire as ordinates, and temperatures of the hot bath as ab
 scissae. A regular curve was then drawn amongst the points
thus obtained, so as to give as nearly as could be judged the
 mean of the observations. The curves A, B, C (Plate VIII.)
were obtained in this way. The scales for these curves are
not quite the same. Details are given below. The curves A
and B were obtained on successive days.
    The want of regularity in the individual readings, after all
 the precautions taken, I considered could only be due to the
 properties of the carbon. Partly to satisfy myself that no
 essential precaution had been overlooked, however, and partly
 to test an idea I formed as to the cause of the irregularities,
 the apparatus was set up again about a month later. Curve
 C gives the results of the observations. The heating of the
 hot joint gave the curve to the left hand ; the subsequent
 cooling gave the right-hand curve. These curves have not a
 point of intersection at their upper ends shown in the diagram
 (Plate VIII.), because the temperature was intentionally raised
 to a point higher than that for which a reading on the graduated
 wire could be obtained, before cooling down was begun.
    Now, as 4£ hours were given to the observations, the heat
 ing and cooling took place very slowly indeed. And as a
 stirrer was kept almost continuously in operation in the hot
 bath, the lagging of the thermometer behind the thermo-
joint must have been very small. I believe that the dif

122                 Mr. J. Buchanan on the
ference between the curves obtained by heating and by
cooling is partly due to change taking place in the properties
of the carbon as the temperature changes. Bearing on this
there is an observation I made. Having calculated the neutral
point of a carbon-iron couple as about +208° C, a glyce
rine bath was used to verify this result. Having raised the
temperature to about 290° C. and cooled again to 220° C.
several times, I found the E.M.F. of the carbon-iron couple
rose gradually, until at the time of stopping the experiment
the maximum E.M.F. had increased by more than 50 per
cent. As is well known, a thermo-couple reaches a maximum
E.M.F. when the temperature of one joint is that of the
" neutral point." It was this maximum that was found to
increase with the time during which heat was applied.
    The conclusion is, that the thermoelectric properties of
carbon alter with temperature. Principally for this reason I
did not deem it of utility to begin a new series of observa
tions, and by " loading " the hot joint with metal try to
decrease the irregularities in the readings like those in curves
A and B. Moreover, the results calculated from these curves
agree as well as could be expected. Here are the details:—
                            Curve A.
    Assuming the equation to the curve as
                   ,=K(*-«)(T-^),
I find that       T= _147o C ) K = 0-00470
satisfy best the observations as represented by tho curve A.
                  x= temperature of hot bath,
                  a=         „        cold bath,
                  T= neutral point.
    The agreement of calculated and observed values of y is
exhibited by Table I.; these values, it will be recollected,
 represent centimetres of the bridge-wire. To calculate the
E.M.F. of a carbon-platinum thermo-couple as given by
curve A, we have the following data : —
  Resistance of primary circuit                  =303*6 ohms.
  Observed E.M.F. of Daniell used . . . . =103 volt.
  Resistance of 1 centim. of the graduated wire =00246 ohm.
     Denoting the E.M.F. required by EA, we get
        EA= -00470 x 1-03 x W^^x-a^tf +
    .-. EA=3-P2(.r-ff)(l47+^           C.U.S. units.

of the current would be from Pt to C across the hot joint.

   Taking an equation to the curve of the same form as that
just used, T=- 140° C. and K= -00406 best satisfy obser
vation.

THE extensive use now being made of strong currents of
        electricity for purposes of illumination necessitates the
employment of instruments for measuring current-strength
and electromotive force of high values. The employment of
electricity for telegraphic purposes, and especially in sub
marine telegraphy, compelled attention to a common accuracy
in measurement of resistance and capacity; but for these
purposes the measurements of electromotive force and currents
are not of such importance as they are in the recent develop
ments. This requirement has drawn the attention of electro-
mechanicians to the subject, and led to the introduction of
numerous forms of electromotive force and current- indicators,
variously called potential galvanometers, voltmeters, pres
sure-gauges, ampere- or am-meters.
    Considering first the voltmeters, they may be classified,
according to Sir W. Thomson's nomenclature, into two classes
—idiostatic and heterostatic. In the second class the magnetic
force at a point in the neighbourhood of a conductor con
veying a current is compared with another magnetic field
either of the earth or of a permanent magnet, and the differ
ence of potential at the ends of the conductor deduced there
from. In the first class no magnetic field is made use of other
than that created by the current itself.
    In the case of heterostatic instruments the readings require
to be controlled by a special determination of the value of the
auxiliary field; and in the case of an ordinary tangent- or sine-
galvanometer, the determination of the earth's horizontal
magnetic force is a task requiring great care and considerable
precautions. In the idiostatic instruments, in many cases,
springs are used to obtain a force with which to compare the
magnetic force in the neighbourhood of a conductor. The
elasticity of these springs is not necessarily permanent, and is
liable to change by temperature as well as time. Accordingly
 in these instruments also, the constant must from time to
 time be determined. Pending the appearance of the new
 instruments promised by Sir W. Thomson, in which no
 springs nor permanent magnets are used, it is necessary to
 fall back upon galvanic cells to establish a standard of elec-

     DanielVs Cell as a Standard of Electromotive Force.     127
tromotive force, and the present paper is a brief collection
of facts concerning the use of Daniell's cell for this purpose,
and its application in the measurement of currents of
various strengths. In all the experiments and methods cited
below the cell has been used only to create a difference of
potential, and not allowed to send any but a very small
current, the means employed for comparisons being a slight
modification of Clark's potentiometer, as shown in fig. 1
 (Plate V.) . On a stout mahogany board are fastened down
two boxwood scales, each 5 feet long, divided into inches and
 tenths; these scales are fixed about | inch apart and parallel,
 so as to form a groove between them. On these scales are
 stretched two fine uniform German-silver wires A B, A' B',
 about '013 inch in diameter, and having a resistance of about
 1 ohm to the foot-run: one end of both wires is soldered to
 a thick copper junction-piece J, and the other ends respec
 tively to copper pieces connected to terminals M, M'. The
 wire thus forms one length of about 10 feet stretched over
 two scales. This forms the potentiometer wire ; its length
 is divided by the scale into 1200 parts, and each tenth of
 an inch can be divided by the eye into 10, making a pos
 sible division of 12,000. To the terminals M, M' are con
  nected five or six large-gravity Daniell cells, and the poles of
  this battery are short-circuited by an Edison 16-candle lamp
  of 240 ohms cold resistance. This enables the battery to keep
  a more constant difference of potential between the terminals
  M, M'.
     A very constant E.M.F. can be obtained by using small
  accumulator-cells in series : the poles being joined by a
  carbon-filament lamp, and the leads to the terminals M, M'
  taken off from the opposite sides of the lamp.
     It is easy to calculate what number of cells are required to
  maintain a given difference of potential, say 2 volts, at the
  extremities of the potentiometer-wire. For let n be the
  number of cells, e the E.M.F. of each, and r the internal re
  sistance, and let R be the resistance of the lamp and poten
  tiometer-wire combined, and v the required difference of
  potential desired at the terminals M, M'; then
                                _ neR
  which determines n. If r is not known, it can be determined
  by a second experiment, in which v is observed in the case of
  a given number of cells.
     The current along this German-silver wire makes a fall in
  potential at about the rate of 1 volt in 5 feet. On one side of

128        Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Use ofDanielVs Cell
the board is fastened a broad copper strap b b, having six ter
minals fastened upon it. Between the last of these terminals
and the end of the scale-wire A' is inserted a reflecting-galva-
nometer of 5000 ohm9 resistance, and an additional resistance
of 50,000 ohms R.
   To the other terminals s, s on this copper strip are con
nected one pole (like to the polo of the battery B connected
to M') of each of the cells c, d to be compared ; and the
other poles of these cells are connected with sliders S, S'
travelling over the wires. These sliders are blocks of wood
sliding in the groove between the scales, and overhanging
the wires. On them are German-silver spring-strips as shown
in the figure, and which, when pressed down, make contact
with the wire. The strips are backed with leather to avoid the
production of thermoelectric currents. By using two or more
of these sliders, it is easily seen that several cells may be
balanced at once on the potentiometer; and in particular two
cells c and d can be compared in respect of electromotive
force very accurately, even although the E.M.F. of the main
battery is not quite constant. The introduction of the resist
ance R prevents any but the very smallest currents passing
in the cells when the place of balance is being found on the
potentiometer. The German-silver strips g, g on the sliders
make contact only when pressed down; so that in the normal
condition the cells c, & are insulated. With the galvanometer
in a sensitive condition it is very easy to read a difference of
toJoo °f a v0^ on *ne wire> anc» to^jo can ^e read with great
accuracy.
   Electromotive forces are read off directly as lengths, since
the E.M.F. of the cells c, c* is directly as the distance of the
constant points of their respective sliders from the end A' of
the wire. Great care has to be taken in the first instance to
stretch the wire uniformly, and to calibrate it if it presents
any want of uniformity of resistance. Provided with this
convenient means of directly comparing electromotive forces,
attention was next directed to a modification of DanielPs cell
suitable for the experiments required. In Dr. Alder Wright's
extensive researches on the subject*, the form of cell employed
was that sometimes called Raoult's form, in which two small
beakers contain the two solutions, and are connected by an
inverted Y-tube, the ends of which are tied over with thin

              os a Standard of Electromotive Force.          Iff-
bladder. This form of cell is undoubtedly convenient for
some purposes, but not for others, as when the cell has to bo
heated or cooled for comparison at different temperatures.
Moreover, the siphon becomes filled in a very short time with
a mixture of solutions by diffusion ; and if the levels of the
liquids are not exactly equal, a siphoning action is added to
that of diffusion iu carrying liquid over from one side to the
other. After some numerous trials of all existing forms which
have been proposed for Daniell's cell, the following was de
vised, which, though more bulky than others, has yet given
great satisfaction, and has the great recommendation of always
standing ready for use.
    A large U-tube, about J inch diameter and 8 inches long in
the limb, has four side tubes (see PI. V. fig. 2). The two top
ones, A and B, lead to two reservoirs Z and 0, and the bottom
ones Cand D are drainage-tubes. These side tubes are closed
by glass taps. The whole is mounted on a vertical board, with a
pair of test-tubes between the limbs. Suppose, now, a Daniell's
cell is to be formed with solutions of zinc sulphate and copper
sulphate, and that the zinc-sulphate solution is the denser.
The left-hand reservoir S Z is filled with the zinc solution,
and the right-hand reservoir SO with the copper solution.
The electrodes are zinc and copper rods, Zn and Cu, passed
through vulcanized-rubber corks, P and Q, fitting air-tight
into the ends of the U-tube.
    The operation of filling is as follows:—Open the tap A and
fill the whole U-tube with the denser zinc-sulphate solution ;
then insert the zinc rod and fit it tightly by the rubber cork P.
Now, on opening the tap C the level of the liquid will begin to
fall in the right-hand limb but be retained in the closed one.
As the level commences to sink in the right-hand limb, by
opening the tap B copper-sulphate solution can be allowed
 to flow in gently to replace it ; and this operation can be so
conducted that the level of demarcation of the two liquids
remains quite sharp, and gradually sinks to the level of the
tap C. When this is the case, all taps are closed and the
 copper rod inserted in the right-hand limb.
    Now it is impossible to stop diffusion from gradually
mixing the liquids at the surface of contact ; but whenever
the surface of contact ceases to be sharply defined, the mixed
 liquid at the level of the tap C can be drawn off, and fresh
 solutions supplied from the reservoirs above.
    In this way it is possible to maintain the solution pure and
unmixed round the two electrodes with very little trouble; and
the electrodes, when not in use, can be kept in the idle cells or
test-tubes L and M, each in its own solution. In making

 130       Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Use ofDanielVs Cell
 experiments concerning temperature, the whole U-tube can
 be immersed in a vessel of water or ice up to nearly the top
 of the reservoirs, and the temperature in the solutions taken
 by means of a thermometer passing through the rubber-cork.
 Each of the electrodes can be removed for examination or
 change without in the least disturbing the surface of contact
 of the solutions. If experiments are being made in which
 the sulphate-of-copper solution is the denser, the position of
 the solutions is interchanged. The bottle R serves to collect
 the waste solutions.
    The electrodes are made of rods of the purest zinc and
 copper, about 4 inches long and ^ inch diameter. The zinc
 found most suitable is made from zinc twice distilled and cast
 into rods ; the copper prepared by electro-depositing on a
 very fine copper wire, until a cylinder of the required thick
 ness is obtained.
    With these appliances to hand, all the facts recorded by
 previous experimenters have been carefully repeated and con
 firmed, and the influence of each variable upon the electro
 motive force examined. The results are collected as follows.
 For the sake of brevity, a Daniell's cell in which zinc, sulphate
 of zinc, sulphate of copper, and copper are the elements will
 be called a normal Daniell ; and the statements here below
refer to the variations in the difference of potential between
the poles -of the normal Daniell, when sending either no
current or only an infinitesimal one, caused by variations in
the physical state of the four elements. In each set of
experiments the greatest care was taken to keep all the
elements constant, except the one which was purposely being
varied in order to detect the influence of it on the whole
electromotive force.
      1. Tlie Effect of Variation in the Copper Surface and
                                  Condition.
    In these experiments the copper- and zinc-sulphate solu
tions were sometimes of the same specific gravity, sometimes
different ; and in some cases the zinc electrode was a rod of
the purest cast zinc amalgamated with pure mercury, some
times a rod of commercial zinc wire cleaned but not amalga
mated. Some scores of observations were made with identical
zinc plate and solutions, but various kinds of copper plates*;
   * All the following; values are given in real volts, taking Lord Rayleigh's
value for the mean B.A. unit of resistance as equal to "0867 earth-quadrant
per second.
   The determinations have boon made against a Chirk cell, kindly com
pared by Lord Rayleigh with his No. 1 cell, whose value is given in his

                 as a Standard of Electromotive Force.                  131
and all observations have confirmed the conclusions of Dr.
Alder Wright that the most uniform results are obtained from
copper plates freshly electrotyped over with a new clean
pinkish surface of virgin copper, when the plate is taken
straight out of the electrotyping bath and put into the cell
 without any delay or touching except a slight rinse with
 distilled water. The result of comparing a freshly electrotyped
 rod with a rod scraped and glass-papered, was to show that
the scraped copper rod gave a higher electromotive force by
about 4 parts in 629, or 6 parts in 1000. When both rods
 were freshly electrotyped in the same bath, and inserted in
the same cell, there was absolutely no difference between
them. Cells were compared with solutions of equal density
 1*2 at 15° C. and amalgamated pure cast zinc, but different
 copper rods, as follows :—
                                                       E.M.F.

              Scraped copper rod         . . . 1*1 11 „
    The exact amount of difference varied slightly in other
 experiments ; but with equally clean surfaces, the electrotyped
fresh surface has a lower electromotive force than the scraped.
The effect of amalgamating the copper rod is, like electro-
typing, to lower its value below that of the clean scraped, but
it is not so uniform. The following are values obtained from
equal copper rods in the same cell, one having an electro
plated surface and the other being slightly amalgamated with
pure mercury :—

                       1-106                      1-105
The mean of the values of the electro-deposited copper
exceeds by about 1 in 1000 the mean of the amalgamated
copper ; but if the amalgamation is done thickly it causes
paper in the Phil. Trans, part ii. (1884) as 1 -435 true volt at 15° C. My
standard, called hereafter F20, is greater than this by 3 parts in 4940, or
is 1*436 volt at 15° C. ; and experiments have shown that its variation-
coefficient is nearly that found by Lord Rayleigh, viz. -0»^ per cent, per
degree diminution of E.M.F.
   Accordingly, the value of this standard Clark cell F..0 has been taken
as equal to
                       1-486(1—-00082 <°) volt at t° C,
and all values given in the text are in terms of this.

132      Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Use of DanielVs Cell
more serious deviations, and though more convenient is not
quite so reliable as electroplating the rod with fresh copper,
but is preferable to employing simply a scraped or glass-
papered surface of rolled copper. A large series of determi
nations were next made on the effect of oxidation of the copper
surface. If a copper rod, newly electroplated, is left in the
copper-sulphate solution, it gradually gets oxidized and
covered with brown patches of oxide, and if amalgamated,
the mercury sinks in and the surface gets brown and patchy.
When this is the case the electromotive force rises, and by
uncertain amounts, depending on the degree of oxidation. It
 is very remarkable how small a trace of brownish oxidation on
 the surface raises the electromotive force several parts in
 1000, amounting in some cases to nearly 1 per cent. The
 following is one set out of many experiments on this point:—
    Two solutions of zinc and copper sulphate were prepared of
 the pure crystals. The specific gravity of the zinc sulphate
 was 1*4, and that of the copper sulphate was 1*1. A rod of
 pure unamalgamated zinc and one of electrotyped copper was
 also taken. Keeping all other conditions constant, the rod of
 copper was first cleanly and carefully electrotyped over with
 a new fresh surface of copper, and exhibited no trace of oxi
 dation; and the E.M.F. of this cell was then taken against a
 carefully tested standard Clark cell of known value ; and the
 rod was then suffered to oxidize on the surface by successive
 exposure to the air, the E.M.F. of the cell being taken at
 each stage.

          „     cleaned, replated with fresh
                   pinkish electro-surface . . 1 072 „
  Many other experiments of this sort showed the same thing.
  A Raoult cell was formed by taking two beakers, one con
  taining zinc sulphate of specific gravity 1*2, and the other
  copper sulphate of the same specific gravity, and using amal
 gamated cast zinc and electro-deposited copper rods. The
 beakers were connected, when required, by a piece of clean
  cotton-wick dipped in water, and connecting both solutions by
 dipping into each. The copper pole was first freshly electro
 plated, and the following values obtained for the E.M.F. of
 the cell as it gradually oxidized :—

              as a Standard of Electromotive Force.             133

    Re-electroplated surface                        1*105 „
   Hence these and many similar experiments all teach that
oxidization, even the slightest trace, of the copper raises the
E.M.F.; and that, in order to get the real value proper to the
combination, the copper must be electrotyped over with a thin
pure film of copper, and exhibit no trace of brown spots of
oxide, and be used at once.
2. The Effect of Variation in the Zinc Surface and Condition.
   Numerous experiments have been made to investigate
whether there is any certain difference between zinc amal
gamated or unamalgamated or cast or rolled. There is very
little, if any, certain difference between perfectly pure cast
zinc unamalgamated and the same amalgamated with pure
mercury. There are greater differences if the zinc is not
pure, and variations are introduced if impure mercury is used
for amalgamation, all of them uncertain in amount.
   The effect of oxidation of the zinc is to lower the electro
motive force. If the bright surface of the zinc becomes
tarnished, it always shows a slightly lower E.M.F. The
smallest deposit of copper upon the zinc, due to diffusion of
the copper salt into the zinc, is indicated by a marked depres
sion, amounting to 2 or 3 per cent. On the whole, the only
consistent values are obtained from chemically pure zinc with
a bright fresh untarnished surface, whether amalgamated or
not ; and the best results are given with pure zinc amalgamated
with pure mercury. In Dr. Alder Wright's memoir the
above conclusions are enforced by tabulated results of most
extensive experiments.
   On the question of amalgamation of the zinc we may quote
a note on the subject by M. G. Lippmann in the Journal de
Physique. There is an opinion expressed by some authors
that amalgamated zinc has a higher E.M.F. than unamal
gamated, even if pure. If a plate of each of the two substances
be immersed in sulphate-of-zinc solution, a couple is formed in
which amalgamated zinc forms the negative pole, inasmuch as
it is the more readily acted upon by oxygen. Such, at least,
is the result obtained if ordinary commercial zinc is used and
ordinary sulphate-of-zinc solution. In a recent work, M. W.
liobb shows that if care be taken to use electro-deposited zinc,

1 34      Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Use of Daniell's Cell
and also zinc-sulphate solutions deprived of free acid, the ele
ment zinc, zinc sulphate, and amalgamated zinc will not manifest
any appreciable E.M.F. The superiority of amalgamated zinc
over ordinary zinc is easily explained ; but when pure zinc is
used, deprived of any oxide on the surface by slight rinsing in
dilute sulphuric acid before placing it in the sulphate of zinc,
there is little or no certain difference, to the extent of 1 part
in 1000 in tho case of the normal Daniell, between the pure
zinc amalgamated or unamalgamated.
       3. The Influence of Density of the Solutions on the
                           Electromotive Force.
    The chief reason for the differences in the values assigned
 by various observers to the E.M.F. of the normal Daniell is
 duo to the great influence that the specific gravity of the two
exciting solutions exerts on the resultant E.M.F. of the com
 bination ; and the general law of the effect is this—If a
 Daniell cell be formed of amalgamated pure zinc, freshly-
 electrotyped copper, and solutions of pure zinc sulphate and
copper sulphate of equal specific gravity, then, taking this
 cell as a standard of reference, increasing the density of the
 zinc sulphate lowers the electromotive force, and increasing
 the density of the copper sulphate raises the electromotive
 force, within, at any rate, the limits of density from 1*01 as an
 inferior, up to saturation as a superior limit. Zinc sulphate
 saturated at 15° C. has a density of a little above 1*4, and
 copper sulphate similarly saturated 1*2 ; and Dr. Alder Wright
 shows by experiments that the increment and decrement of
 E.M.F. for identical increment or decrement of density of
 both solutions are so nearly equal that for equally dense
 solutions, within limits, the E.M.F. is independent of the
 absolute density of both. This fact has been confirmed by
 many other observers. Amongst other careful experiments
 may be noticed those of Carhart *, whose experiments were
 specially directed towards ascertaining the influence which
 variation in the density of the zinc sulphate exerts on tho
 resultant E.M.F.
    In using a Daniell cell as a laboratory standard it is neces
 sary, therefore, to prepare and standardize the solutions of
zinc and copper sulphates with the same care as if they were
to be used for volumetric analysis. It is a good plan to pre
pare two large stock bottles of solutions, and having carefully
determined the density to adjust them to known specific

 of Science, Sept. 5, 1884. .See 'Telegraphic Journal and Electrical
 Review,' vol. xv. p. 250.

fravity by the aid of the specific-gravity bottle or hydrometer,
  'or general use two standard solutions of each salt are speci
ally useful. First, a solution of sulphate of copper very nearly
saturated at 15° C. and having a specific gravity of 1-200, and
a solution of sulphate of zinc of equal density. Secondly, a
solution of sulphate of copper of density TlOO at 15°, and a
solution of sulphate of zinc of 1*4. These last values are
chosen because they were employed by Sir W. Thomson in
his standard gravity-cell ; and they can be used in either his
form of gravity-cell, or in the U-tube form above, or in Raoult's
form of separate vessels and siphon *. .
    A very large number of comparisons have been made of the
E.M.F. of cells set up with these solutions and the E.M.F.
of Clark's cells, whose value has been compared directly with
cells standardized in absolute measure.
    If a Daniell cell is carefully made up, either in the Raoult
form or U-tube form, of solutions of pure zinc and copper
 sulphate not sensibly interdiffused at the level of contact, and

 rected Clark cell at 15° C. is very nearly -768 to unity f;

 useful densities.

  4. Influence of Temperature on tlie Electromotive Force of the
                            Normal Daniell Cell.
    The researches of experimenters who have studied the Clark
cell have established the fact that its E.M.F. diminishes with
 rise of temperature. The exact value of the coefficient of
 variation seems to depend on the mode in which the cell is
made up ; and very careful examination has been made of the
 Daniell cell as above described, to see if its real E.M.F. is
 affected by temperature. Some writers have asserted that it
 is ; but it is obvious that the variation of internal resistance
 must be eliminated entirely by the use of a null method of
 observation of the E.M.F. The condenser method is not a
 sufficiently accurate one to apply, and the potentiometer
 method is the most trustworthy.
    Two U-tube cells were prepared with 1*4 sp. gr. zinc sul
phate and 1*1 sp. gr. copper sulphate ; and these cells were
respectively immersed, the one in a water-bath at 20° C. and
the other in melting ice at 0°. A pair of zinc and copper
poles was likewise prepared ; and when the solutions in the
U-tubes had acquired the temperature of the baths, the E.M.F.
of each cell was taken with the pair of zinc and copper plates,
first in one and then in the other, with the following resu Its :—
  Plates in the warm cell at 20° C.         Plates in the cold cell at 0° C.
            E.M.F. of cell.                          E.M.F. of cell.

                  1-078                                  1-083
    The experiments showed a very small but decided fall of
 E.M.F. as the cell is warmed, and at the rate of about 3 parts
 in 1000 for 20° C. This is only about ^ of the variation of
 a Clark cell for the same range ; and, practically, we may say
 that the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell is independent of tempera
ture for such range as occurs in the natural temperature of
 the air in our climate *. This quality of the normal Daniell
    * The same result bas been obtained by Mr. Preece in his experiments
 on the effects of temperature on the electromotive force and resistance of
 batteries, see ' Electrician,' March 3, 1883, vol. x. page 367. He gives a
 table showing the E.M.F. at various temperatures, obtained by the con
denser method, and shows that there is no perceptible change in E.M.F.
of a normal Daniell between 0° and 17°, and a slight fall subsequently of
about 0 parts in 1000 between 17° and 28°, but a rise, however, after
reaching 633.

              as a Standard of Electromotive Force.           137
is very important, and goes very far towards helping it to
sustain its position as a standard cell against its rival the
Clark cell.
   The various coefficients of temperature-change which have
been found for Clark cells indicate that it is unsafe to rely
upon any cell taken at random, whose history is unknown,
having a coefficient of variation accurately the same as that
of the cells whose coefficients have been actually determined.
   It would be a great advantage if instrument-makers would
construct these cells in the form suggested by Lord Rayleigh
— enclosed in a test-tube and having gutta-percha-covered
leading-in wires passing through a rubber stopper. The co
efficients of variation would then be easily obtained for any
cell, just as those of standard resistance-coils are ascertained
and marked on each cell with the range of temperature over
which it is applicable.
   As a check on the foregoing experiments on the Daniell, the
coefficient of variation of the standard Clark cell used was
obtained. Two cells were taken, exactly equal at 18° C, and
one of them was immersed for 48 hours in melting ice. The
difference on the potentiometer-wire was then obtained between
this cold cell and its fellow kept in water at 18° C. The
potentiometer-readings were as follows :—
                              i.            ii.           iii
   B, cell at 0° C.    .     961           971           974-4
   A, cell at 18° C. .       947           957           960
                               14            14            14-4
   From the experiment 1 the reading for the warm cell
would have been 947 + ^ = 949* at 15° C. And hence the
coefficient of variation is \^ in 94S'£, or "0819 per cent, in
the neighbourhood of 15° C.         Lord Rayleigh gives "082
as the value for his cells. It is obvious that Clark's cells
cannot be used for standardizing galvanometers without a
careful determination of their coefficients of variation.
   The normal Daniell cell has a certain advantage in that when
null methods for determining electromotive force are employed,
its value is independent of temperature throughout a consi
derable range.
   By the employment of the above two instruments— a poten
tiometer as described and a standard normal Daniell carefully
constructed with all the precautions named—it is very easy to
make very accurato measurements of strengths of currents of
large magnitude. If a resistance is formed of such character
that the current to be measured can bo passed through it

138      Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Use of Danieli'* Cell
without much affecting its temperature, and the potential
measured at the extremities of this resistance by means of a
comparison on the potentiometer between- it and that of the
Danieli, this gives at once the current.
   In order to construct a resistance whose value at the in
stant of passing the current can be accurately measured, the
following device is adopted :—On a board are mounted a
series of copper blocks a, a, b, b, like the connection-pieces on a
resistance-box (see PI. V. fig. 3). These can be connected by
plugs p, p. At opposite sides and ends are main terminals as
M' ; and the blocks a, b are connected by brass or Grerman-
silvor wires wound in a spiral; similar coils of equal resistance
connect each pair of opposite blocks. The number of coils
must bo an odd number.
   If the plugs 1, 11,3, 9, 5, 7 are put in, it is obvious all the
coils Ri, Rs . . . R7 are a series, and their resistance can be
measured: call it r. If, then, the other pegs are inserted, the
coils are now in multiple arc or parallel, and if there are n
                         T
coils the resistance is —     By this arrangement the resistance
in parallel can bo inferred from the resistance in series ; and
although each coil has a very small resistance, yet by using a
large number, not only is a very easily measurable resistance
obtained when the coils are in series, but a resistance of large
current-carrying capacity when they are put in parallel.
   The mode of using it is as follows :—The pegs are all put
in, and the current to be measured is sent through the coils in
parallel. By means of the potentiometer and standard-cell,
the difference of potential is found between the terminals M
and M' when the current is passing. The alternate pegs are
then removed, the current stopped, and the resistance taken
of the coils in series, and the time noted which has elapsed
between the measurement of potential and of the resistance.
A few observations are taken of the resistance at intervals of
time,by which to construct a curve of cooling; and by projecting
back the curve, it is easy to ascertain very nearly the resistance
at the time when the potential was measured. If small currents
only are employed, it is not necessary to change the resistance;
the current can bo sent through it in series, and its resistance
also measured in series. The writer has had constructed a
large resistance of this kind at the Victoria Electric Lighting
Station, for the measurement of dynamo currents up to 500
amperes. In this case the resistance consists of 36 wires of
brass, No. 14 B.W.G., arranged in parallel, and of equal
resistance. One of the wires can be disconnected and arranged
instantly on a bridge to measure its resistance ; and in this

                as a Standard of Electromotive Force.               139
 way, after measuring the potential at' the ends of the 36 wires
 in parallel, with the current passing through them, one wire is
disconnected, and its resistance taken immediately; from which
observations it is possible to approximate very accurately to
the resistance of the whole wires in parallel. In order to
afford data for constructing such resistances, experiments were
made of passing various currents through coiled spirals of
naked wires of different sizes and materials.
   A large number of wires were prepared, of copper, brass,
iron, German-silver, each 25 feet long, and of six sizes re
spectively, Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, B.W.G., the diameters
being given below. These wires were coiled into spirals
round wooden rods about one inch diameter, and the turns of
the wire well separated, so that each coil or spiral was about
18 inches long. Measured steady currents were sent through
these for some hours, and so adjusted that after the tempera
ture had become steady the wires were all at a temperature
just about bearable by the hand, that is near 60° C. The
currents respectively carried were as follows :—
                          No. 10      12      14      16   18    20

   These currents passed through the above-described naked
spirals bring the respective wires to about a temperature of
60° C, when equilibrium is established; and for the purposes
of measuring currents not more than one third of the above
currents should be used with wires of the size appended.
Thus for 300 amperes, about 50 No. 10 B.W.G. wires will
carry it without much sensible elevation of temperature;
and by arranging 50 wires so that their resistance can be
quickly measured in series, a resistance can be made suitable
for measuring the potential at the ends of a known resistance.
   By the use of this method it is easy to standardize any cur
rent or potential-galvanometer at any part of the scale, and
obtain the absolute or corrected value of the deflections ; and

 140    Daniell's Cell as a Standard of Electromotive Force.
 these methods have been employed with success for some time
 in standardizing the working galvanometers used in the lamp
 factory of the Edison and Swan United Electric Light
 Company.
    In conclusion may be given other results, collected from
various authors, respecting the electromotive force of the
 Daniell-cell.
    Wiedemann (Galvanismus, vol. i. cap. iv., Bestimmung der
Electromotorischen Kraft, p. 341) gives a description of
 Raoult's cell (see Raoult, Ann. de Chim. et Phys. [4] t. ii.
 p. 345, 1864), and states that Eaoult finds that copper-foil bas
higher electromotive force than electro-deposited copper by
about         and attributes it to the oxides of copper contained
in it. He also confirms the invariability of E.M.F. with tem
perature at least between 10° and 50°; and states that with
pure amalgamated zinc and electro-deposited copper, solution
of saturated sulphate of copper and solution of sulphate of
zinc, containing 1 part of crystals to 1 part of water=l*35 sp.
gr. at 20°, the electromotive force is 1-124 electromagnetic
units. This, corrected by the Cambridge value of the B.A.
unit, is 1*109 volt.
    Sir W. Thomson (p. 245 of ' Papers on Electricity and
Magnetism ') finds the electrostatic measurements of a
Daniell's cell to be "00374. The nature of the solutions and
electrodes are not given. Taking the value of v as 3 x 10'°, we
have the E.M.F. as 1*12 B.A. volt, which, reduced to true
volts, gives 1*105 volt.
    Lord Bayleigh gives the ratio of a Daniell set up with
amalgamated pure zinc, electro-deposited copper, and solu
tions of sulphate of zinc and copper, each of sp. gr. 1*1.
Five observations of the ratio of this cell to that of a known
Latimer-Clark cell at 16° C, taken as unity, gave "7702,
•7710, -7705, -7698, -7702, mean -7703 ; and since the Clark
is 1*435 volt, this gives the Daniell as 1*105 volt.
   Latimer Clark (Journ. Soc. Tel. Eng., January 1873) gives
it as 1*11, which, reduced to true volts, is 1*095; and Dr. Alder
Wright (Proc. Phys. Soc. London, vol. vi. p. 292) gives the
value of a normal Daniell set up with solutions of the same
molecular strength, preferably of strength m M S04 100 OH2,
where m is near 2—that is with copper sulphate nearly satu
rated, and zinc sulphate of equivalent molecular strength, and
pure amalgamated zinc plates and electro-deposited copper—
as 1*114 B.A. unit, or 1*099 true volt.
   None of these are very far from the value assigned to the
standard cell described above, viz. 1*102 volt, with equidense
solutions and metals as described.

XVI. On Molecular Shadows in Incandescence Lamps. By
   J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc. (Land.), Fellow of St. John's
   College, Cambridge, Professor of Electrical Technology in
   University College, London*.
SINCE presenting a short note on the above subject in 1883
      many further opportunities have occurred for observing
the conditions under which molecular shadows are formed in
incandescence carbon-filament lamps, and of correcting one or
                                              LIhe or
                                           " "m deposit
two statements then made. It has been observed in an immense
number of cases, that not only do incandescence lamps become
coated on the interior of the glass with a deposit of carbon,
but that the envelope may have deposited upon it a metallic
film, derived from the leading-in wires to which the carbon
 filament is clamped. In the Edison lamp the platinum wire
 only just passes through the glass, and is connected with
 copper wires broadened out into a clamp ; the filament is
 gripped in these clamps and then electro-plated over with
 copper to effect a good junction. In the Swan lamp the
 platinum wires are joined directly on to the carbon. It occa
 sionally happens that there is an unusual amount of resis
 tance at the clamps, or that by excessive electromotive force
more current is forced through the lamp and more heat gene-

 142       Dr. J. A. Fleming on Molecular Shadows
rated everywhere. In this case the tendency will always be
to increase and go on increasing the resistance, and, therefore,
the temperature at the point of highest resistance. Suppose
this occurs on the clamp or on the leading-in wire, then ex
perience shows that the metal is volatilized and deposited as a
film on the glass. This metallic deposit is not uniform ; it is
thickest nearest the base of the lamp and gradually thins away
up to the crown, and at a certain height is thin enough to
transmit light. It is not very uncommon to obtain Edison
lamps with this copper deposit. The colour of transparent
copper is a fine sage green inclining to blue ; compared with
the colour of gold leaf seen by transmitted light, it very
closely resembles it. On one occasion the writer obtained a
lamp with a silvery metallic film deposited over it on the
inside of the glass. From the outside it had a mirror-like
lustre; on breaking the lamp this film was seen to be brownish
and not brushed off by the finger, but it could be removed by
scratching. It was not removed by holding in the oxidizing
flame of a Bunsen burner: therefore it was not carbon. It
was not removed by nitric acid; but on boiling a fragment of
the glass, covered with this metallic deposit, in nitro-hydro-
chloric acid the film disappeared. It was therefore probably
platinum. The film was transparent, permitting objects to be
seen through it, and transmitted brownish light.
   Now, under certain circumstances, a line of no deposit is
formed on the surface in the plane of the filament, which is,
as it were, the shadow of one side of the loop This indicates
that the process of molecular scattering, which is going on at
some spot on one or other clamp, is not a mere evaporation or
volatilization of the metal, but a projection of molecules in
straight lines in every direction. The trajectory of the mole
cules will be interfered with in some directions by the carbon
filament; and hence result lines and places of no deposit which
are molecular shadows of the loop. On every other part of
the glass the molecules will inpinge and adhere, forming a
metallic coating. From the facts that the free paths of the
molecules differ in length, and that the clamp is much nearer
to the neck of the lamp than to the crown, it follows that a
much larger proportion of the scattered molecules strike the
glass near the neck, and the thickness of the deposit is there
fore a measure of the proportion of molecules which have a
free path, equal to the distance of that part of the envelope
from the scattering point. Curiously enough the line of no
deposit, or shadow of the loop, is not always seen in copper-
deposited lamps. This may be because the scattering is*
going on from both clamps, and therefore the shadow on one

                     in Incandescence Lamps.                   US
side is covered up by the shower from the clamp on that side.
It has been noticed in one or two cases that small tufts of
carbon are seen on one clamp, and that when a well-defined
shadow exists on that side, this seems to indicate that the
shower of copper molecules has been partly stopped by the
opposite clamp, which has therefore acted like a target and
become encrusted with a proportion of the molecules shot
at it.
   With respect, next, to carbon deposits. Every one knows
the appearance of a lamp after it has been burning for some
time or overburnt: it is clouded with smoke-like deposit. In
nearly all cases of copper deposit the molecular shadow exists,
but it is not nearly so often seen in the case of carbon deposits.
After many observations it was found that the molecular
shadow of the filament, or line of no deposit, could be formed
by suddenly raising the filament to a very high temperature,
as for instance by placing a 50-volt lamp for an instant on a
100-volt circuit ; whereas when the deposit of carbon takes
place slowly, and as it were in the natural way, the lamp
exhibits only a general sinokiness but no line. Again, it has
been found that when a carbon filament is cut sharply through
at one point, caused by excessive temperature at one spot,
there is very frequently a sharply marked line of shadow
of the loop on the side of the envelope farthest removed from
the fracture. These facts seem to indicate that in normal use,
when the lamp is not being pressed beyond the electromotive
force at which it was intended to be used, there is a general
evaporation of carbon going on from all parts of the loop, and
these molecules, being projected with no abnormal velocity,
probably collide with molecules of residual air a large number
of times before they reach the walls of the envelope, and thus
get their trajectories very much changed in direction. In
this case the result would be to cause an irregular deposit
of molecules of carbon on the glass envelope.              But if
we suppose a sudden or very excessive temperature to be
given to part or the whole of the filament, this may cause a
very violent projection of molecules of carbon from the fila
ment; and these would pass outwards in straight lines, and a
far larger proportion would reach the envelope in the direction
in which they were first projected. This would then cause a
deposit on all parts except those shielded by the loop ; and in
the case when such violent projection went on from all parts
of the loop, as when a lamp is overheated, it is easily seen that
parts of the envelope not lying exactly in the plane of the
filament would receive twice as much deposit as those exactly
in the plane. In most cases of carbon deposits the lamps

which give the best shadows are those made with single loop,
bat it has also been observed on Swan lamps with double
twist. By making lamps with clamps of various metals, it
might be possible to obtain metallic films of various kinds.
Interesting magneto-optic phenomena might perhaps present
themselves in the case of transparent iron films, if they could
be obtained.

rpHE Presidential Address of Dr. Archibald Geikie, Di-
          rector-General of the Geological Survey of Great
Britain, before the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh in
1883 f, reviews the subject of the origin of coral-reefs and
islands. In the course of the discussion, the author sustains
and enforces the objections which have been presented by
others, and concludes that " the existence of such reefs is no
 more necessarily dependent on subsidence than on elevation."'
 The existing state of doubt on the question has led the writer
 to reconsider the earlier and later facts, and in the following
 pages he gives his results |. That both sides may be fairly
 before the reader, the views of Darwin and the evidences in
 favour of his theory are first considered, and afterwards the
arguments that have been urged against it. Part of the
objections are based on misunderstandings of the facts, and
 hence a general presentation of the subject has been thought
necessary.
       Part I.— The Darwinian Tlieory and its Evidences.
    1. According to the Darwinian theory, islands with fringing
 reefs have been often changed through a slow subsidence of
 the region into islands with barrier reefs; and, as the last
summit of the sinking land disappeared, the latter have be
come atolls, that is, barrier reefs enclosing simply a piece of
the ocean (or a lagoon). Darwin added to this conclusion, a

relations to other islands: that the subsidence indicated in
volved the whole central Pacific, besides other large areas.
He also expressed the opinion that a Pacific continent had
disappeared through the subsidence. The proofs of the first
and the second conclusions are partly different and should
not be confounded. The third is no necessary part of the
   neral theory, was not adopted in my Report, and need not
    further considered.
   2. Darwin did not hold that atolls were necessarily evi
dence of a subsidence now in progress, but allowed that in
some regions they may have reached a state of rest, and may
perhaps have undergone an elevation since the cessation of
 the subsidence; and also that subsidence and elevation may
 have alternated.
    3. Darwin found what he believed to be almost certain proof
 of subsidence in the features of the large barrier-islands and
atolls. He perceived in the rocky islets that dot the great
 interior lagoon-like waters of the Grambier group, Hogoleu,
 and other similar barrier-islands of the Pacific, and the
 general resemblance of such islands to atolls, strong evidence,
 " leaving scarcely any doubt on the mind," that the islets
 were the emerged points of sunken lands ; that such barrier-
 islands were no less lagoon islands than Keeling atoll (the
 atoll which he investigated); and, if evidence of subsidence,
 the atoll was proof of further subsidence, that is, one that had
 continued to the disappearance of the sinking peaks.
    The evidence which had satisfied him was satisfactory to
 me when I first learned of his views in Australia (in 1839),
 after a cruise amongst the Paumotu atolls and the Tahitian
 and Samoan reef-regions; and more decidedly so later, when
 I had been among the Friendly, Feejee, and other Pacific
 islands.
    That the argument may be appreciated I here intro
 duce a map of the eastern half of the Feejee Archipelago *.
 Several of the great barrier-reefs in this map, 10 to 20 miles
 in length, have but one or two peaks of the sunken land re
 maining; Nanuku has but one little point, near its south
 eastern angle, a mile of peak within a barrier island 200
 square miles in area; Bacon's Isles are the last two little
 peaks of a still larger lagoon; and besides these and other
 examples of disappearing lands, a dozen of the easternmost
 islands are actual atolls—the last peak gone.
    4. To this, the chief of Darwin's arguments in his own view,

                      Coral Reefs and Islands.                  147
another of like importance is added in my Report—tlie exist
ence ofdeepfiord-like indentations in tlie rocky coasts of islands,
both of those inside of barriers and those not bordered by reefs.
   When making the ascent of Mount Aorai, one of the two
high summits of Tahiti (September 1839), where high narrow
ridges, almost like a knife-edge along their tops, alterna
ting with gorge-like valleys 1000 to 3000 feet deep, radiate
from the central peaks but die out in a broad even plain at
the shores, I was made to appreciate the consequence to such
an eroded land of a partial submergence. At any level above
500 feet, its erosion-made valleys would produce deep bays,
and above 1000 feet fiord-like bays, with the ridges spreading
out in the water like spider's legs. Observing on the maps
of the Marquesas Islands precisely this condition, it was a
natural inference that the lands had undergone great subsi
dence, and perhaps were still subsiding.
    With this criterion of subsidence in view, the evidence
from the Gambier and Hogoleu Islands is doubled in force ;
and that for the sinking of Raiatea of the Tahiti group, re-
Sesented in fig. 3 of the plate of maps in Darwin s ' Ooral-
   eefs,' is as strong from each of the two enclosed islands as
it is from the great breadth of the reef-grounds; and the same
is true for Bolabola, another Tahitian island on the plate.
    So it is also in the Feejees. The demonstration as to sub
sidence in the large barrier-island called the Exploring Isles,
for example, is made complete by the form of the ridge of
land along one side of the great barrier, and the positions of
adjoining islets.
    5. The general parallelism between the trends of coral-
islands and the courses of the groups of which they are part,
and the courses also of the groups of high islands not far
distant, were regarded by Darwin as confirming his view
 that the coral-islands were once high islands with bordering
 reefs.
    6. Darwin uses also the argument that the large coral-
islands have the diversity of form found in the barrier-reefs
 of high islands; and also that they often have such groupings
 as would come from the sinking of a large island of ridges
 and peaks with encircling reefs. He describes the Maldives
 as one example of the latter, and the two loops of MenchikofF
 island in the Caroline Archipelago as another.
    7. The depth of lagoons, and of the channels inside of large
 barrier-reefs, afforded him further evidence of subsidence, it
being in many cases two to three times greater than the
 limiting depth (120 feet) of living reef-making corals.

148             Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
   8. The great depth of the ocean in near vicinity to the
atolls is another source of evidence added.
   9. He urged also, in supporting his views, the non-existence
in the ocean now, and the extreme improbability of existence
at any time, of submarine volcanoes or chains of mountains
having their numerous summits within a hundred feet of the
surface.
   10. Darwin speaks of smallness of size in coral-islands as
a result of continued subsidence. In my Report I base an
argument for subsidence on smallness in the proportion of dry
land, and on smallness of size, when there is gradation to
ward either condition, and the seas beyond are free of islands.
The facts bear on the general conclusion with regard to a
Central-Pacific area of subsidence as well as on the funda
mental point in the theory.
   If an atoll-reef is not undergoing subsidence, the coral and
shell material produced that is not lost by currents serves,
(1) to widen the reef ; (2) to steepen, as a consequence of
the wideniug, the upper part of the submarine slopes ; (3) to
accumulate, on the reef, material for beaches and dry land;
and (4) to fill the lagoon.
   But if, while subsidence is in progress, the contributions
from corals and shells exceed not greatly or feebly the loss
by subsidence and current-waste, the atoll-reef, unable to
supply sufficient debris to raise the reef above tide-level by
making beaches and dry-land accumulations, would—(1) re
main mostly a bare tide-washed reef ; (2) lose in diameter or
size, because the debris that is not used to keep the reef at
tide-level is carried over the narrow reef to the lagoon by the
waves whose throw on all sides is shoreward ; (3) lose in
irregularity of outline, and thus approximate toward an an
nular form; (4) lose the channels through the reef into the
lagoon by the growth of corals and by consolidating debris ;
and (5) become at last a small bank of reef-rock with a half-
obliterated lagoon-basin.
   The Pacific contains reefs of the three kinds:—(1) atolls
with much of the reef under trees and shrubbery; (2) others,
of large and small size, with the reefs mostlj- or wholly tide-
washed; (3) others only two or three square miles in area,
without lagoons. Further, the kinds are generally grouped
separately and gradationally. (I) The islands of the Pau-
motu and Gilbert Archipelagos have usually half or more of
the reef dry and green; (2) the northern Carolines and the
northern Marshall Islands, and the eastern Feejees, although
in part of large size, are mostly bare reefs ; while (3) the
islands of the Phoenix Group, of the Equatorial Pacific east

                       •Coral Reefs and Islands.                        149
of the line of 180°, are, with one exception (Canton or Mary),
not over four miles long. The three more southern of the
Phoenix Islands (see Map, Plate I.), Gardner's, Hull's, and
Sydney, between 4° 25' S. and 4° 35' S., are two to four
miles long, and have lagoons; five, including Phoenix, Birnie's,
and Kean's, between 3s 10' S. and 3° 30' S., and Howland and
Baker's, north of the equator, are a mile and a half and less
in length, and have depressions at centre, but no lagoons.
The depressions contain guano, and one of them, Kean s, has
much gypsum mixed with the guano *; Kean's and Phoenix
have a foot or two of water at high tide, the tide rising 6 feet.
Another of the number, Enderbury's, is three miles long and
lias a half-dried lagoon, which is very shallow and has no
growing corals t. To the north of these islands for fifteen
degrees of latitude the sea is an open one j and in the next ten
degrees, to the line of the Hawaian Chain, the only islets not
marked doubtful are " Coral-Reef, A wash " and Johnston
Island.
   A similar gradation in size takes place in the Ellice,
Batack, and many other groups of the ocean. Smallness of
size, and dried lagoon-basins, with occasionally a deposit of
gypsum from evaporated sea- water, are just the result that
should have come, by the Darwinian theory, from subsidence;
and gradation in size from gradation in the amount of subsi
dence. The positions of the Union, Gilbert, Ratack, and
Ralick groups with reference to the Phoenix group are shown
on the Map, Plate I. All of the islands on the map are coral-
islands, and nearly all atolls; and the part of the encircling
reef marked by fine dots is under water at high tide.
   Adopting this view of the origin of these smallest of coral-
made islands, I readily accepted Darwin's second conclusion as
to a great central oceanic area of subsidence. The further
inference, also, was deduced, for reasons stated in my Report,
that the greatest amount of subsidence took place along
a belt stretching south-eastward from the southern half of
  * J. D. Hague, Amer. Journ. Sci. (II.) xxxiv. p. 242. Mr. Hague, in
his valuable paper on the Guano Islands of the Central Pacific, mentions
the existence of a bed of gypsum two feet thick under the guano of Jarvis
Island, another small equatorial island, eleven degrees east of the Phoenix
group.
  t Baker's Island has a height of 22 feet, according to Mr. Hague,
showing, he says, some evidence of elevation ; and Enderbury's I
found to be 18 feet in height, from which I inferred some elevation. But
Howland's, Birnie's, McKean's, Phoenix, Gardner's, Hull's, and Sydney
are not higher than ordinary atolls would be in a sea of 6-foot tide.
  The facts with regard to the " Reef " on the map, in long. 175° W.
and lat. 2° 40' S., I have been unable to learn.

150                Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
Japan and passing south of the Marquesas group toward
Easter Island, and a line was drawn on a map among its
illustrations representing the course of " the axial line of
greatest depression " *.
    These deductions have been apparently sustained by the
soundings of the 'Tuscarora' and 'Challenger' in 1874,
1875, and 1876. The soundings of the 'Tuscarora ' through
the Phoenix group in 1875, on its route from the Sandwich
Islands to the Feejees (under the command of J. N. Miller,
 U. S. N., by the order of the U. S. Hydrographic Bureau),
are shown on the map of the central Pacific herewith pub
lished (Plate I.).
    The soundings about these islands prove (1) that the
islands are situated within the deep 3000-4000-fathom area
 of the ocean ; and appear to indicate .also (2) that along lines
 transverse to the trend of the islands (or to the direction of
 trend in other groups to the west), mean submarine slopes
 of 1 : 1'5 to 1 : 7 exist ; while in the direction of the trend,
 the slopes are much less. The slope of 1 : 1*5, or that of the
 angle 33° 41', is nearly the maximum slope of the sides of
 Cotopaxi, Mt. Shasta, and several other volcanic summits of
 Western America.
     The facts are these:—
     Halfway between Sydney and Birnie's Islands, 60 English
 miles apart, a depth of 3000 fathoms (18,000 feet) was
 found. Off Enderbury's Island (40 miles north-east of
 Birnie's), (1) a depth of 2835 fathoms was obtained 20 miles to
 the south-west; (2) of 880 fathoms 2£ miles to the south-west;
  (3) of 1991 fathoms 3 miles to the north-east ; and (4) of
 2370 fathoms, 11 miles to the north-east. The mean slopes
 to the south-west, calculated from the soundings 1 and 2, are
  1:6 and 1:3; and to the north-east, from 3 and 4, 1 : 1*5 and
  1:4; 14 miles south-ea«< of Hull's Island, at right angles
  to the above direction, a depth of 935 fathoms was found,
 which gives the slope 1: 13.
     Further evidence as to the submarine slopes about equa
 torial coral-reef islands is afforded by soundings, made under
  the direction of the British Admiralty, near the very small
  Swain's Island, at the south end of the Union group (see
  map); and others, by the 'Tuscarora' under Commander
  Miller, in 1876, near the Panger Islands, about five degrees
  east of Swain's. Off Swain's Island, two soundings, one

   south of it and the other east (the two directions at right
   angles to one another and the latter not diverging far from
   the trend of the other islands of the Union group), give the
   slopes 1: 7 and 1:13. Off Danger Island, as Commander
   Miller's Report states *, the depth of 660 fathoms was obtained
   half a mile (nautical) off the south-west corner of the reef
   near south-east island, and 985 fathoms one mile east of the
   reef—corresponding to slopes 1:1 and l:0-75. 1:1 is a
   steeper slope than occurs even in small dry-made cinder-
   cones ; and 1 : 0*75 (53° 8') is steeper still.
      The above facts are sufficient to authorize the drawing of
   the bathymetric lines for 1000, 2000, and 3000 fathoms
  quite closely about the islands of the Phoenix group, and
  to give the areas a northwest-southeast elongation, corre
  sponding with that of the neighbouring Pacific islands to the
  west, as on the accompanying map, Plate I.f
      It follows from the above-mentioned facts that the deep-
  water areas adjoining the Phoenix group, named provision
  ally by Petermann % the " Hilgard depths " and the " Miller
  depths," are parts of one large area 1200 miles broad. The

     % Geogr. MittheU. 1877, page 125 and plate 7. The deep areas along
 the lines of soundings were named bj Petermann on his very valuable
 bathymetric map of the Pacific simply to facilitate reference.
    The bathymetric lines about the islands on the accompanying Map
 (Plate I.) have an unreasonable degree of regularity. But with no facts
 to indicate the actual irregularities, none could be reasonably introduced.
 The trends given them are the same as on Fetermann's map. The actual
 steepness of slope is probably not exaggerated for either of the islands.
 If similar slopes exist about the smaller islands in other parts of the
 ocean, the final bathymetric map of the Pacific will have a very different
 aspect from that presented by the maps hitherto published, and the
 Central Pacific a much greater mean                About Wakes Island, a
small atoll in latitude 19° 11', standing alone in the ocean six degrees
north of the Ralick Chain, the width of the area enclosed by the 2000-
fathom line, as drawn on Petermann's bathymetric map, is nearly 100
nautical miles, while, in view of facts at the Phoenix group, the actual
width is probably not over 10 or 15 miles.
    With Dut four lines of soundings for the part of the great Pacific
Ocean, within 35 degrees of the equator, the author of a bathymetric map
has to rely chiefly on his judgment or conjecture for the larger part of
the surface. There are many great problems in physical, geological, and
biological science that would be elucidated by the facts which a thorough
bathymetric survey of the ocean would afford ; and the work is large
and important enough to call for aid from each of the great nations of the
world. Thus far, for the Pacific Ocean, the United States is first in the
amount of work done.

152                   Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
greatest depth obtained in the part of the area south-west of
the group (400 miles broad) is 3305 fathoms, and in the part
north-east 3448 fathoms.
    Again, the soundings of the ' Tuscarora ' of 1875 here cited,
taken in connection with those of the same vessel in 1874,
under Commander George F. Belknap, along a line from the
Sandwich Islands westward to Japan (mostly between the
parallels of 20° and 25°), suggest the further conclusion, that
the deep-sea area of the central equatorial Pacific, in which
the Phoenix Islands stand, extends north-westward toward
Japan, and that it was crossed by the ' Tuscarora ' between
 171° E. and 150° E., where were found depths from 3009
 to 3273 fathoms (with some alternations of smaller depths
 that isolated areas may account for). It is also probable
 that the soundings of the 'Challenger' east of Japan be
 tween 153° E. and 143° E., and just north-west of those
 of the ' Tuscarora/ were within the same deep-sea area. If
 this be so, a long deep-water area or trough extends from
 Japan south-eastward through the Central Pacific, conform
 ing well to the suggestion of the Darwinian theory; and
 corresponding in direction approximately to the " axial line
 of greatest depression " referred to above—the line AA on
 the accompanying map.
     As regards the rest of the Central Pacific between the
 above defined 3000-4000-fathom belt and the Hawaian chain,
 the depths sounded by the ' Tuscarora ' are, with few exceptions,
 over 2400 fathoms; two thirds of them are over 2750 fathoms;
 and a fifth (out of the fifty-five in this area) over 3000 *.
    * The same two Hues of soundings by the ' Tuscarora ' suggest the
 existence of a second long deep-sea belt or trough in the Central Pacific
 just south of the Hawaian chain. This supposed trough was crossed by
 this vessel in 1875 between the parallels of 13° N. and 18° N. (" Belknap
 depths "), and in 1874 between the meridians of 172£° W. and 177^° W.
 (the " Ammen depths ") ; the greatest depth found on the former line is
 3125 fathoms, and on the latter 3100 fathoms. Should the existence of
 these two troughs be sustained, the region between them would be a
 Central-Pacific plateau ; having in it, along the 1875 line of soundings,
 depths of 2072 to 1325 fathoms, and along that of 1874, depths of 2836 to
 1108 fathoms ; the shallower portion is near the middle of each line of
 soundings, has a great descent (6000 to 9000 feet) on either side, sug
 gesting the idea of a central ridge. Over this plateau-area there are,
  south of the Hawaian chain, two or three small coral-islands ; and
  further eastward, the Palmyra, Kingman, Washington, Fanning, and
  Christmas reefs and islands, which, although coral structures, make the
  idea of a central ridge in this part for 600 miles almost a manifest fact.
  Further east, the Marquesas Islands are in the same range. The deep belt
 lying on the south side of the plateau diminishes in depth to the east
  ward, the ' Challenger ' soundings from the Sandwich Islands to Tahiti
 rinding no depth in the course of this belt greater than 2750 fathoms; but

                       Coral Reefs and Islands.                       153
   11. Since a fringing reef is, by the theory of Darwin, the
first stage in the origin of an atoll, it was naturally regarded
by him as, in general, evidence of little or no subsidence, and
even, at times, of elevation. But since (1) bold shores are
an occasion for narrow reefs and for their absence, (2) sub
marine volcanic disturbances and eruptions about volcanic
lands would destroy living reefs or retard their progress
where begun, (3) islands of active volcanoes have small or
no reefs, and (4) abrupt subsidences of only 120 feet would
put reef-corals below a surviving depth and so lead to the
beginning of a new reef, I was led to regard the evidence
from a fringing reef for no, or little, change of level as of
very doubtful value. But the doubts, while making such
evidence generally useless, do not affect the value of the pre
ceding arguments for subsidence. Darwin used the evidence
from fringing reefs only to mark off the limits of the area of
 Central-Pacific subsidence to which his coral-island theory
had led him ; and the same limits essentially are reached not
 withstanding the doubt. Instead of concluding that the
 region along these limits was one of recent elevation or at
 least of no subsidence, I was led to speak of it as one either
 of no subsidence or of less subsidence than over the central
area referred to. The difference between us is small.
    12. The true value of fringing-reefs as evidence in the
question of change of level should be appreciated in this dis
cussion, as is apparent from the objections to Darwin's theory
which have been urged; and I mention a few facts from tho
Pacific islands in its elucidation.
    On Darwin's map, the Marquesas group is left unooloured,
which means, doubtful as to subsidence or not. The Tahitian
group (Society Islands) is coloured blue; that is, it is included
within the area of coral-reef subsidence. The Navigator or
Samoan Islands are coloured red, or placed in the area of
elevation ; the Feejees blue ; the Sandwich Islands red. The
 facts are these.
    The Marquesas Islands are an example of absence of reefs
to a large extent, with only small reefs where any. But the
shores are mostly too bold for reefs ; and hence their small-
ness bears no testimony as to elevation. Along the bold
the belt on its north side may continue eastward of the ' Challenger '
route. Many more lines of soundings are needed to substitute sure con
clusions for the above suggestions.
   The existence in the ocean of parallel belts of deeper and shallower
waters, such as are here inferred to exist, and such as are actually in
dicated by the parallel lines of high islands and atolls, is in accordance
with the facts over the continents.

  154              Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
 shores there are deep indentations and fiord -like bays, separated
 in some cases by narrow ridges, sometimes in spider-leg
 style ; so that the proof of subsidence is positive, as explained
 in § 4.
     Tahiti presents none of the Marquesan evidence of subsi
 dence. Its erosion-made valleys, as already explained, die
 out at the broad shore-plain, and the island is comparatively
 even in outline. I found over it, like Darwin before me, no
 evidence of elevation beyond one or two feet at the most. It
 has broad reefs ; and the channel inside the barriers between
 Papieti and Toanoa (2 miles) has a depth of 3 to 25 fathoms.
 From the width of the reef, and the slope (6 to 8 degrees) of
 the land, and of the lava-streams outcropping in the sides of
 the valleys, supposing this slope to be continued under water,
 I made the probable subsidence 250 or 300 feet. A slope of
 6 degrees, and a width of reef of half a mile, gives 240 feet
 for the depth of the reef at the outer edge.
     The Samoan (or Navigator group) includes (beginning at
 the east) Rose Island (an atoll), Manua, Tutuila, Upolu, and
 Savaii.
     Manua has bold shores, a height of 2500 feet, and a narrow
 reef where any *. Tutuila is of the Marquesan type in its bold
 indented sides, and this suggests a probable subsidence. Pan-
 gopango Bay, in which we anchored in 174 feet of water, has
 •a length of three miles. The coral-reefs are of the fringing
 kind where any occur. Upolu, a few miles west, has bold
shores and small or no reefs for fifteen miles of its north
 shore, east of its middle ; but elsewhere there are broad reefs
 (mostly 5000 to 8000 feet in width) and a very gentle
slope (three to six degrees) in the land above, which is about
 the slope of its underlying lava-streams. The great width of
the reef seemed to be evidence of subsidence. But the ab
 sence on the north side of the island of a channel in the reef
deep enough for any craft larger than canoes made it essenti
ally a great fringing reef. A calculation from the width and
 land-slope gave about 260 feet for subsidence; but I add (on-
page 332 of my Report) my doubt as to any subsidence. The
 tacts known are against any elevation.
    • With regard to Manua, Mr. J. P. Couthouy, of the Wilkes Exploring
Expedition for two thirds of its cruise, in his paper on " Coral Forma
tions" (p. 50 of Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist, Jan. 1842) reported the
occurrence of fragments of corals at a height of 80 feet " on a steep hill
side rising half a mile inland from a low sandy plain." I was not on
Manua. I found on Upolu fragments of coral-limestoue and shells in the
tufa of a tufa-cone at a height of 200 feet, which had evidently been
carried up by the erupting action of a slightly submerged vent. (' Report,'
ji. 328.) The facts on Manua need further study.

                     Coral Reefs and Islands.                 155
   Savaii, the largest island of the group, is a gently sloping
volcanic mountain, much like its namesake, Hawaii, in its
features, with lavas looking as if not long out of the fire. It
has a broad reef for only 6 or 7 miles of its east shore; else
where, on the east and north-east sides, the reefs are fringing
or wanting ; and on the southern and western sides mostly
absent. No evidence of elevation, and nothing certain as to
subsidence, has been reported from the island.
   The large Feejee group bears abundant evidence of subsi
dence in its very broad reef-grounds, barrier islands, and atolls.
Fringing-reefs, or barriers with very narrow channels, occur
about some of the islands of the group; but in view of the
facts that have been stated, these are useless as evidence
either way.
   Thus the conclusions as to the changes of level about these
large Pacific groups south of the equator are not far from
Darwin's, although fringing-reefs and the volcanic character
of the island are thrown out of consideration, and other con
ditions exist of varied interpretation.
   But cases of actual elevation occur in the Central Pacific
about several smaller islands, as proved by elevated coral-reefs.
These occur in the Austral and Hervey Islands south and
 south-east of Tahiti, and in the Tonga or Friendly Islands.
 In none of these, however, thus far reported is the elevation
over 300 feet : and the amount varies greatly in adjoining
islands of the same group, some affording proof of no elevation.
 Hence only local changes of level, not a general elevation, can
be inferred.
   To the north of the equator, at the Sandwich Islands some
elevated reefs occur; but the amount of elevation is small, and
is not general in the group. Moreover, the reefs are small,
 where any occur; and the largest island of the chain, volcanic
 Hawaii, the easternmost, is mostly without reefs, as well as
the larger of the westernmost islands, Kauai, which has partly
bold and indented shores.
   13. To give a more adequate view of the changes of level,
 or the evidences bearing on the subject, along the " limits " of
 the central area of subsidence, I mention some additional facts.
    Tahiti is the large eastern island of the Tahitian group.
 To the westward, the islands (1) decrease in size; (2) increase
 greatly in relative breadth of reef-grounds; (3) become deeplv
 indented in shores, as explained; and (4) include an atoll,
 Tubuai, as one of the last two of the chain. While the reef
 of Tahiti proves comparatively little subsidence at that end of
 the group, and its reefs and channels are extensive enough to
 make the proof good, the other islands indicate, on the Dar

156                Dr. J. D. Dona on the Origin of
winian theory, that the subsidence increases much in amount
westward. The western end of the chain is about a degree
nearer the equator than the eastern.
    In the Samoan Islands, the largest island, Savaii, is the
westernmost; and from there the islands decrease in size east-
toard, and end in an atoll, Rose Island. The group is like Tahiti
in gradation as to increase of subsidence, but the direction is
the reverse ; and this fact points apparently to a much deeper
area between them *. Moreover, although such broad barrier-
reefs as those of Eaiatea and Bolabola do not occur in the
Samoan group, bold shores do in Tutuila and Manua, and
indicate the participation of these islands in the subsidence,
notwithstanding their contracted reefs. Further, the reef of
Upolu is broad enough to be proof of little change in the
region of that island; and there was little, probably, at Savaii,
the larger island west of it. The evidence of increased sub
sidence to the eastward is strong, and narrowness of reef is no
objection to it.
   At the Sandwich Islands the case is similar and yet dif
ferent; similar in the fact that the largest island of the chain,
Hawaii, makes one of its extremities, the eastern, and a series
of coral-islands the other—the whole length being 2000 miles;
but different in that no great reef exists about the shores of
either of the eastern islands to prove that the subsidence there
was small or none. The elevated reefs are only a local phe
nomenon, and do not prove the absence of subsidence during
the era preceding the elevation.
    But we have other evidence of importance, derived from
soundings about the group by the ' Challenger ' in 1875 and the
'Tuscarora' in 1874, 1875. These soundings show that the
deep-sea area of 3000 to 4000 fathoms comes up quite closely
to the eastern end of the chain. It was found within 300
miles of north-eastern Hawaii and 250 of south-western, and
within 80 miles of north-eastern Oahu ; and a sounding but
125 fathoms less than 3000 was obtained by the '"Challenger '
within 40 miles of eastern Hawaii (or half its diameter). To
the westward, along the north side of the chain, the deep-sea
area appears to be two or three times more distant, according
to the ' Challenger ' results ; the condition on the south side is
uncertain. It would seem from the great depth near Hawaii,
that the region of this great island, although it is now actively
volcanic and has little growing coral about it, had undergone
more subsidence than the coral-reef end of the chain, and
   * The distance between the remote extremities of these two groups is
nearly 2000 miles, nud the interval between the nearer over 800 miles.

                        Coral Reefs and Islands.                        157
that its height and steepness of submarine slopes are due to
the fact that its outflows of lava have kept ahead of the sub
sidence, and also built up nearly 14,000 feet above the sea.
    This height is large, but the mean pitch of the sides of the
volcanic mountains of the island is between 5° and 7° 45' ; and
hence it is only the height which successive outflows should
have produced over a vent at the sea- level; and it may be
that the accumulation above tide-level has been made since
the supposed subsidence ceased. The depth of 2875 fathoms
found by the ' Challenger' 40 miles east of Hawaii shows a
mean submarine slope to that point of 4° 30', as if here also
was a slope made by flowing lava. But more soundings aro
 needed to prove that the slope is a gradual one.
    14. The facts reviewed show the uncertainty of evidence as
to little or no subsidence, or as to recent elevation, from (1)
narrow reefs, or from (2) the volcanic character of islands, and
leave untouched the evidence of actual subsidence from the
 features of barrier- and atoll-reefs and from deeply indented
coasts.
    15. After the above considerations, it is clear that the
theory of subsidence meets well the facts as to the varying
extent of reef among reef-bordered high islands. According
to it, (1) steepness of submarine slope may characterize the
side of a barrier-reef (as well as of an atoll) fronting east or
west, north or south, as is true of high islands ; but it is least
 likely to occur in the direction of the trend of the island or
group, or that of current drift. (2) Fringing-reefs, or no
 reefs, may characterize one side, that of bold bluff's, and wide
 barriers the opposite. (3) The barrier-reef may be made on'
 the submarine slopes of the land, or on a broad plateau or
 lowland area between ranges of elevations, one or both of
 which have disappeared in the subsidence. (4) By continued
 subsidence, the side having a fringing-reef or no reef, may,
 later in the subsidence, be that of a very broad barrier-reef,
 because of the form of the surface of the subsiding land ; and
 vice versd.
    The third of these propositions is well illustrated by the
 facts from the Maldives, as reported by Darwin. On account
 of its importance I add an illustration from the Feejees.
    The great reef-grounds along the north-west sides of the
 two large Feejee islands, Vanua Lebu and Viti Lebu, do not
 indicate a subsidence proportional to their width.
    Each of these islands is over ninety miles long, and to
 gether the trend is north-eastward*. The north-western
   * A map of the Feejee group is contained in my ' Corals and Coral
 Islands,' and of larger size in Wilkes's ' Narrative of the Expedition.'

 158            Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
reef-grounds are 10 to 25 miles wide ; while on much of
the south-east side of each island there is (according to the
Wilkes chart) only a fringing-reef. The true explanation of
the great width is found, not in the amount of the subsidence
alone, but largely in the existence there of a broad area of
submerged land at relatively small depths. This inference is
sustained by the fact that the outer barrier-reef, after being
simply a barrier-reef for 125 miles with but two rocky islets
in its course, becomes in the same line westward for seventy
miles, a range of high narrow reef-bordered islands (called the
Asaua Range), and then bends around southward through
other rocky islands to meet the west end of Viti Lebu. The
reof-grounds have thus a chain of islands as their boundary
for a length of 100 miles, and simply a barrier-reef with two
rocky islets for the rest of the line (125 miles).
   The following figure illustrates in a general way the above
condition. It is a section across the reef-grounds, t k, and
the outer barrier-reef i, with a fringing reef at I ; and sup
posing it to have a rocky island at i, it represents a section
(further to the south-west) across the reef-grounds and the
outer range of islands. The reason for the existence of only
fringing-reefs for much of the south-east side has not been
particularly investigated.
   16. Local elevations within the sinking area are not evi
dence against the Darwinian theory of subsidence. Local
disturbances and faults, as both theory and the rocks of the
continents show, are almost necessary concomitants of a
slowly progressing change of level. Besides this, igneous
conditions beneath a region are a common source of local
displacements. Such displacements are therefore to be looked
for in the tropical oceans, since the various high islands are
volcanic, and the coral-islands probably have a volcanic base
ment ; and, moreover, the islands are not unfrequently shaken
by earthquakes. The causes of local displacement by either
method would not necessarily interfere with any secular
change of level in progress.
   17. The shore-platform of an atoll, or the "flat," as called
by Darwin, situated just above low-tide level, consists usually

                          Coral Reefs and Islands.                         159
of the true reef-rock, or the rock made by under-water con
solidation ; and its height is determined chiefly by the height
of wave-action, its general surface being produced by the
chiseling-effect of the in-flowing waters. When found above
its normal level, it is probable evidence of an elevation ; and
on this kind of evidence the conclusion rests in several of the
cases of supposed elevation which 1 mention in my Report.
The width of the platform and its evenness of surface vary
with the height of the tides. When the tides are 5 to 6 feet,
the platform is narrow, more cut up by channels and less
even in surface.
 amount, the surface of the platform becomea restored finally
 for a large part of its surface to its normal level, and gentle
slopes may connect the newer and older portions. But if
the rise of an atoll is 10 feet, great degradation takes place
along the lifted edge of the reef, which may end in reducing
the elevated coral-barrier to a wall with numerous channels
and broad spaces opening through to the lagoon, as observed
by the writer (from ship-board) on the south side of Dean's
Island*.
     18. The differences in the kinds of coral-rocks should be
 understood (as the recent discussions of Darwin's theory
have shown) in order to appreciate the structural facts that
bear on changes of level. The beach-made rock is of above-
water consolidation (through calcareous deposition about the
grains as evaporation takes place), and is porous, often oolitic;
and if a conglomerate, it consists mostly of worn masses.
The rock made of drifted sands is similar. But the true
    * Our cruise took us from the Paumotu atolls to Australia, and there,
the sandstone blufl's making the capes of Port Jackson gave me my first
understanding of the atoll's " shore-platform." This bluffhas its " shore-
platform," 50 to 150 yards wide, hare at low tide ; it was the lower
layer of the sandstone, a regularly jointed rock, lying like a loosely laid
pavement. It seemed strange that it was able to keep its place in the
face of the breakers. But the first waters of the in-coming tide swelled
quietly over it, and served to shield it from the plunging waters of the
 latter part of the flow ; the waves, therefore, found nothing to batter
 against short of the base of the bluff.
   A view of Deans Island from the south is given in Wilkes's Narrative,
i. p. 342 ; it fails only in not giving a nearly even top line to the columns.
The view on p. 334 looks as if representing another example of similar
erosion. But, as the text implies, the group of masses of coral-rock was
made by the artist by bringing into a single view the blocks that had
been observed in an isolated way over the platforms of atolls. The size
and shapes of the blocks are exaggerated. But, although isolated, such
blocks are often so united to the coral-platform that they appear to be a
constituent part of it (my ' Report,' p. 61 ) and suggest the question
whether they may not be remnants of an overlying layer elsewhere
removed.

1G0                Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
coral-reef rock is of under-water consolidation, and is usually
very compact, like an ordinary limestone ; and if a conglo
merate, it is commonly a breccia, and sometimes a very coarse
breccia. Some masses of it lying on the shore-platform of
Paumatu atolls (thrown up by storm or earthquake-waves) ,
100 to 2000 cubic feet in contents, consisted of single pieces
of massive corals—Astraas, Porites, &c. ; and others were
an agglomeration of fragments of corals. The fine-grained
or impalpable kind made from coral-mud may have few or
no fossils, and be a magnesian limestone.
    Another variety of the coral-reef rock, made in lagoons and
sheltered channels, has the corals in the position of growth ;
and when formed of branching corals, the spaces among the
branches are often but partly failed. It is a weak rock ; and
the islets thus made in lagoons and inner channels are some
times overturned by the heaviest of waves ; and rising banks
 (as the experience of the Wilkes Expedition proves) may be
crushed beneath the keel of a passing vessel.
    Owing to the different modes of origin of the beach-made
rock and the true coral-reef rock, the occurrence of the former
underneath the latter would be evidence of subsidence.
    Deep borings in atolls with circular drills that would give
 a 6-inch core would supply evidence as to the existence or
 not of beach-made coral-rocks at levels below the surface.
 They would also determine the depth to which true modern
 coral-reef rock extends and the nature of the underlying beds,
 whether calcareous, volcanic, or of any other kind. This is
 hence a sure method for obtaining a final decision of the
 coral-island question, and should be tried *.
    • The Wilkes Expedition carried out apparatus for boring. It was put
 into inexperienced hands, as Commodore Wilkes states in his 'Narrative'
 (iv. pp. 267, 268), and at a trial with it on Aratica (Carlshoft' Island) in
 the Pauinotus, it became broken and useless at a depth of 21 feet.
 Moreover, the granulated material brought up afforded no satisfactory
 evidence as to the kind of coral-rock encountered. The statement in the
 'Narrative' that "the low coral-islands, as far as they have been inves
 tigated, both by boring and sounding, have shown a foundation of sand,
 or what becomes so on being broken up," has been quoted and made
 more of than the facts warrant. The "soundings'' reached only the
 sands of the sea-bottom; and the '"boring," if it found sand at bottom,
 proved only that the beach-mnde rock may exist at the 21 -foot level, in
 which case a small subsidence would be indicated.
    Commodore Wilkes says on p. 209 of the same volume : —" The elevated
 coral-islands which we have examined exhibit a formation of conglome
 rate composed of compact cornl and dead shells, interspersed with various
 kinds of corals, which have evidently been deposited after life has become
 extinct. A particular instance of this was seen at the island of Metia,
 and the same formation was also observed at Onhu.'' As the corals of a

                         Coral Reefs and Islands.                        161
    19. Elevated coral-reefs afford an opportunity to search for
layers of beach-made rock underlying true reef-rock ; and
also, if over 120 feet in height, to ascertain directly the cha
racter of the rocks below this level.
   The elevated atoll, Metia, 75 miles north-oast of Tahiti,
whose maximum height (according to the measurement
of officers of the Wilkes Expedition) is 250 feet, I have
described as consisting of the true coral-reef rock. My ex
aminations were made on the west side, where it presents a
vertical front to the water. The white compact limestone
was, in some parts, almost destitute of fossils, or had only an
occasional mould of a shell or fragment of coral* ; and in
others it was a fine or coarse coral-breccia. My notes written
out at the island include the statement that K large masses of
corals make some lower layers." This observation, though
not as complete as I now see that it should have been, favours
the conclusion that the thickness of the reef rock is at least
twice as great as the depth to which reef-corals grow, in
which case the elevated reef is proof of a subsidence of 120 feet
or more.
   The island is so near the route to Tahiti that the doubt
which remains could be readily removed.
   20. The subsidence indicated, according to the Darwinian
theory, by atolls and barrier-reefs was actual, not apparent
subsidence attributable to change of water-level. The diffe
rence in its amount between the Central-Pacific area of sub
sidence and its limits (§§ 10, 11, above), the gradation or
variation in amount of subsidence along chains of islands
(§§ 10, 12, 13), and the local character of elevations, like those
of Metia, Mangaia, and many others, are proofs on this point.
   The preceding explanations have prepared the way for the
consideration of the arguments urged against the Darwinian
theory, to which I now pass.
                            [To be continued.]
conglomerate, whether consisting of rounded masses or angular, are
" deposited after life has become extinct," no inference as to the parti
cular kind of coral-rock intended can be drawn from tho remark. From
my knowledge of the island I presume he meant the ordinary breccia
conglomerate of the reef-rock, which is one of tho kinds of coral-rock of
the elevated island. Commodore Wilkes himself made no examination
of the rock or special study of coral-islands, as might be inferred from
his theoretical views on p. 270 of volume iv. His ' Narrative' was to a
considerable extent made up from the journals of his various officers.
   * It was this compact rock, white, flint-like in fracture, clinking under
the hammer, that was found on analysis by B. Silliman to contain 38 07
per cent, of magnesium carbonate.

XVIII. On the Specific Refraction and Dispersion of Light by
       the Alums. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.*
IN the Comptes Rendus of November 17, 1884, there appears
        a paper by M. Charles Soret, in which he gives the
refractive indices of a largo number of crystallized alums.
They were determined by the method of total reflection,
and are measured for the lines of the solar spectrum a, B,
C, D, E, b, F, and G. As at the same time M. Soret gives
the specific gravity of the specimens examined, it is easy to
calculate out the specific refraction and dispersion of these
crystals, and it occurred to me that the observations might
serve three purposes. They might test the truth of certain
physical laws ; they might arbitrate between myself and
 Kanonnikoff as to the refraction-equivalent of certain metals ;
and they would give values for indium and gallium, which
 have not hitherto been obtained. Through the kindness of
 M. Soret 1 have received his full paperf, with some further
 information, and observations on three additional alums not
 yet published, viz. the Rubidium Gallium, Rubidium Indium,
 and Caesium Chromium alums.
     In order to bring M. Soret's figures into comparison with
 my own, which are always based on the line A of the spec
 trum, it was necessary to reduce his figures accordingly. This
 was easily done, as the line A falls short of a by almost exactly
 the same amount as that one falls short of B. The following
 table gives the specific gravity of the selected crystals ; the
 refractive indices (fi) for A calculated to the fourth place of
 decimals, and also those for G ; the specific refraction for A,
 t. e. the index —1 divided by the density,                          the sI>e-
 cific dispersion A to G, i. e. the difference between the specific
 refraction of these two lines, 1**° ^              > ana the refraction-
 equivalent for A, i. e. the specific refraction multiplied by the
 atomic weight,                      The general formula of the alums
 is R2, Als, 4S04, 24H20; the aluminium being replaceable
 by indium, gallium, chromium, and iron.

  These numbers are as close as two different specimens of the
  same salt, oven if they were in the same condition, are likely
  to be. It did not seem worth while to obtain additional proof
  of a law which has already been established by many cases ;
  not only by my previous observations, but also by those of
  Topsoe, Bedson, and Kanonnikoff.
       Do these figures confirm the law that the refraction-
  equivalent of a compound body is the sum of the refraction-
  equivalents of its components?
      The alums may be regarded as a compound of the sulphates
  of two metals of different kinds with 24 molecules of water.
  Now water in the uncombined state has the refraction-equi
 valent of 5'926 ; and in regard to the sulphates we have the
 following data : —
      Ammonium sulphate, (NH4)2S04, 39-3. Tho mean of five
 determinations made by myself gives 39*35 * : Kanonnikoff
 gives 39-27 1-
      Sodium sulphate, Na2S04, 26*6. Kanonnikoff gives 26-02.
      Methylamine sulphate, (NCHB)2S04, 54*5; i.e. ammonium
 sulphate with tho addition of 2 CH2, or 15-2.
      Potassium sulphate, K2804, 32-4. The mean of five deter
 minations gave me 32-(5 : Kanonnikoff gives 32 22. It may
 bo estimated at 32-3 from Topsoe and Christiansen's determi
 nations of the crystallized salt.
      Rubidium sulphate, Eb2S04, 41-3. This is Kanonnikoff's
 determination, which I prefer to my own made in 1869.
     Caesium sulphate, Cs2S04, 55-3. Also Kanonnikoff's.
     Being not content with my old observations on the sul
phates of the trivalent metals, I have recently determined
them afresh, with the following results :—
     Aluminium sulphate, A12(S04)3, 7()"5.
     Chromium sulphate, Cr2(S04)3, 82-5 ; the result of old and
new observations.
     Ferric sulphate, Fe2(S04)3, 89*1 ; the mean of old and new
observations.

   The agreement between the results calculated and found is
as near as might be expected, except in the case of caesium.
It confirms the general law, as the variations only in one
instance amount to as much as 1 per cent., and arc some
times plus and sometimes minus. There is little doubt that
the caesium, in one set of observations or the other, was im
pure : an old determination of mine, from the chloride, would
give figures lower than Soret's.
    Do these data afford us the means of determining the
refraction-equivalents of the elements with more exactness
than heretofore ? It is evident that in the series of aluminium
alums the metal having the smallest refraction-equivalent is
sodium, and that the rest follow in the order—potassium,
ammonium, rubidium, methylamine, caesium, and thallium ;
the same order is preserved in the chromium and iron alums
as far as they extend. This agrees with the order previously
determined both by myself and Kanonnikoff ; but when we
look more closely into the matter it is evident that the figures
are not very exact. Thus, in the aluminium series the differ
ence between 2NH4 and 2K is 5"42 ; but in the chromium
series it is only 4-72, and in the iron series 4-12, or 7*19 ac
cording to Topsoe. The values of potassium deduced from
this would vary considerably : assuming the value of NH4 to
be 1 1-1, it might be either 8'4, 8-7, 9-0, or 7'5 ; which are
wider differences than between my old estimation, 8*1, and
Kanonnikoff's recent independent determination, 7 75. This
will not be wondered at when it is remembered that all expe

166       Dr. J. H. Gladstone on the Specific Refraction
rimental errors are accumulated on these residual numbers.
The optical determinations of Soret are so uniform and exact
as to inspire the greatest confidence ; but he is not satisfied
with the specific gravities. Errors may also arise from im
purity of the salt, or want of homogeneity in the crystal. An
aqueous solution is probably a more uniform substance than a
hydrated crystal, and better fitted for the purpose of deter
mining optical equivalents.
    On this account any determination of the refraction of
indium and gallium made from these alums must be open to
considerable question : the rubidium compounds of these
metals, however, are believed by Soret to be fairly pure salts,
and we can compare them with three other alums of rubidium .
It would appear from the first table that indium has the
value of aluminium + 8*0, or of chromium + 1*5, or of iron
— 1*8 ; and, similarly, that gallium has the value of aluminium
 4- 5*4, or of chromium — l'l, or of iron — 4*4. Now alumi
nium sulphate has already been estimated at 70'5, chromium
sulphate at 82-5, and ferric sulphate at 89*1, while the value
of S04 is held both by Kanonnikoff and myself to be 17*0. We
may therefore deduce the following refraction-equivalents :—
                  Aluminium . ... 9-7

 derived :—

                               698         2120         148
    These numbers can only be looked upon as approximate.
     Turning to the matter of dispersion.—It has already been
 shown that the refraction-equivalent of an alum is the sum of
 the refraction-equivalents of its constituents for the line A.
 If this law holds good equally for the more-refrangible part

               and Dispersion ofLight by the Alums.                       167
 of the spectrum, it follows that the dispersion-equivalent
 (P          - P^-^, or, which is the same thing, P ^~^)
 of an alum is the sum of the dispersion-equivalents of its
 constituents. The data by which this can be tested are not
 so numerous or so trustworthy as in the former case, but the
 following may be accepted.

   Though these figures are tolerably accordant, it will be seen
 that those in the first column are decidedly higher than those
deduced from Soret's measurements. The differences are about
5 and 8 per cent, respectively ; but there are known sources
of error in experiment which may affect the first place of
 decimals.
   The dispersion-equivalents of the different alums may be
thus tabulated :—

   It is evident at once :—
   First. That the differences due to the replacement of one
metal by another are very considerable ; more considerable in
proportion than the differences in the case of the refraction-
equivalents.
   Secondly. That the different compounds of the alkalis pre

 168              Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Bleaching of
 serve the same order, and nearly the same proportion, in the
 aluminium, chromium, and iron series : the order is thallium
 far the highest, methylamine, caesium, ammonium, rubidium,
 potassium, and sodium lowest. This is the same order which
 may be deduced from old observations on sulphates, nitrates,
 chlorides, and acetates.
    Thirdly. That the order of the other metals is iron far the
 highest, chromium, indium, gallium, and aluminium lowest.
 This is also in accordance with observations on the simple
 sulphates of those previously examined.
    Our knowledge on this part of the subject is not yet suffi
ciently advanced to determine the dispersion-equivalents of the
 separate elements.
 XIX. On the Bleaching of Iodide of Starch by means of Heat.
                    By Charles Tomlinson, F.R.S.*
THE bleaching of iodide of starch by means of heat forms
         a pretty experiment. An aqueous solution of iodine and
one of starch may be mingled together in a test-tube, when
the well-known densely blue colour is produced. If the tube
be held over the flame of a spirit-lamp, the blue gradually
becomes paler and paler, and disappears long before the liquid
has reached the boiling-point. If the hot tube be now plunged
into cold water, the blue colour immediately reappears,
starting up from the bottom of the tube, where the reduced
temperature is first felt, and quickly spreading through the
liquid up to the surface. The colour returns, but of course
 more slowly, if the tube be left to cool in the air.
    Thenard, in noticing this experiment upwards of half a
century ago, remarked that it is, "sans contredit, la plus
remarquable de toutes les proprietes de l'iodure " f.
    It is surprising what a large number of papers have been
written on this apparently simple experiment. Gmelin (Hand
book, Cavendish Society's Translation, xv. p. 99) has collected
most of them down to 1862 ; and they exhibit various contra
dictions. For example, some writers maintain that the iodine
and the starch form a definite chemical compound, others
describe it as a mechanical mixture ; some maintain that iodic
and hydriodic acids are generated on heating the compound,
others deny that this is the case ; some say that the blue liquid
may be heated many times in a sealed tube and yet recover
its colour on cooling ; this also is denied. Such statements
as these led Professor Miller, in the ' Text-book on Inorganic
Chemistry ' that he wrote shortly before his death, to remark
   * Communicated by the Author.
   t My copy of Thenard's Traite de Chimie is a Brussels reprint, dated
1P3<> (vol. li. p. 157).

                Iodide of Starch by means of Heat.              169
(1871, p. 136) that " the cause of this change of colour is not
known."
   Some writers, as quoted by Gmelin, maintain that if the
iodine which evaporates in boiling be expelled by blowing air
into the vessel, the iodide of starch remains colourless after
cooling, but if it can reabsorb the iodine-vapours on cooling
the colour is restored. A sufficient answer to this is that the
colour begins to reappear at the bottom of the tube long before
the vapours at the upper part can possibly be reabsorbed. The
vapours may even be blown away and yet the colour reappear.
   The usual mode of accounting for the discoloration is that
given in Watts's ' Dictionary of Chemistry,' under Starch,
v. 1868, p. 410:—"The liquid may be decolorized by ebulli
tion, whereby the iodine is volatilized ; if, however, the boiling
be not continued for a sufficient time to volatilize the whole of
the iodine, the blue colour reappears as the liquid cools."
   This statement is but partially true ; for the colour disappears
long before the boiling-point is reached, and it does not account
for the fact that when the liquid is apparently permanently
bleached and allowed to get cold, the addition of a few drops
of solution of chlorine will restore the blue colour.
   In examining this subject experimentally, the difficulty
seemed to lie in the multitude of explanations rather than in
any inherent difficulty belonging to it. My first care was to
determine the temperature at which the bleaching takes place.
For this purpose, fifteen grains of iodine were treated with
half-a-pint of distilled water, and five grains of each of four
varieties of starch were rubbed up and then boiled with about
an ounce of distilled water.
   1. One ounce of solution of starch crisp from maize was
mixed with one ounce of the iodine solution in a small globular
flask and heated over the flame of a spirit-lamp. The colour
entirely disappeared at from 150° to 160° Fahr. (65° to 71° C).
Left to cool in the air of the room the colour began to return
at 120° F. (49° C), and the full colour was restored at 70° F.
(21° C). The flask was heated u second and a third time, with
nearly similar results.
   2. A solution with rice-starch became paler at 105°, much
paler at 115°, pale at 120°, and the colour entirely disappeared
at from 135° to 140°. The flask was plunged into cold water,
when the solution became reddish at 135°, purple at 100°,
violet at 80°, and blue-violet at 70°.
   3. With sago-starch the colour became lighter at 110°, pale
blue at 120°, pale at 140°, and was bleached at 150°. In cold
water the colour returned at 130°, at 85° it was full blue, and
at 80° quite opaque, like ink.
   4. The mixture with potato-starch was of a blue-black

  170          Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Bleaching of
  colour. At 105° it became pale, at 125° of a light red, and at
  140° entirely bleached. In cold water it became reddish a
  little below 140°; at 120° a purplish tinge came over the red;
 at 90° the colour was purplish, at 80° violet, at 78° reddish
 violet by transmitted and blue by reflected light.
     A fifth variety of starch, namely that used for domestic
 purposes in mv house, was taken ; but this was soon recognized
 as potato-starch by the method of Gobley (Journ. de Pharm.
 for April 1844), in which various specimens of starch, in
 watch-glasses, are arranged on a plate around a central watch-
 glass containing iodine, the whole being covered with a bell-
 glass. I found that some of the specimens, namely such as
 were slightly moist, became coloured by the iodine vapour in
 the course of a few minutes ; others in an hour or so, according
 as they absorbed moisture, there being no action with dry sam
 ples. If known samples are first acted on, the colours assumed
 by them may serve to determine other unknown specimens.
     The four varieties of starch above referred to were made up
 into thin and thick solutions, the thin containing five and the
 thick ten grains of starch in about half-an-ounce of water.
 Equal quantities of the starch solutions were severally mixed
 with equal quantities of the iodine solution, thereby producing
 very dark blue or blue-bkck compounds. Each variety was
heated in a test-tube over a spirit-lamp flame and boiled during
two minutes, and then cooled by plunging the tube into cold
 water. The colour was not in any case reproduced during the
 cooling ; but on the addition of a few drops of an aqueous
solution of chlorine the colour was restored in each case, but
with very different degrees of intensity ; for while in the case
 of potato- and rice-starch the blue was almost as intense as
 before the boiling, it was faint in the case of maize or absent
in that of sago, or exhibited but a mere trace in several trials.
A specimen of arrowroot also behaved like the sago. Hence
it seems that different kinds of starch act on iodine with
different degrees of intensity, in character not like a chemical
compound so much as, according to Liebig and others, a pre
cipitation of the finely divided iodine on the surface of the
granules of the starch.
     M. Personne (Cotnptes Rendus for 1872, p. 617, in answer
to M. Duchaux, p. 533 of the same volume) refers to a state
ment of his in the Cotnptes Rendus for 1861, in which he
regards iodide of starch, not as a chemical compound, but pro
duced by the fixation of iodine on starch in the same manner
as a colouring-matter is fixed on a tissue. The blue compound,
he says, must be regarded as a dye, not a true lake*.
    • Puchot (Cotnptes Rendus, 1883, p. 225) has noticed that albumen
poured on iodide of starch suspended in water causes the colour to
disappear. Whey {jicdt-lait) has a similar effect. Here, again, I found

                  Iodide of Starch by means of Heat.                   171
   It is evident from the preceding details that, during the
heating of the tube containing the so-called iodide of starch,
the solvent power of the liquid for iodine increases with the
temperature, and if the tube be watched at the moment when
the last trace of colour disappears, the tint of iodine in solution
becomes apparent ; but this aspect soon disappears, not only
on account of the small quantity of iodine present and the
rapidly increasing solvent power of the liquid as the tem
perature rises, but also from the loss of iodine in the steam
which escapes from the mouth of the tube. This view of tho
case is supported by the fact that if boiling solutions of starch
and iodine be mingled no colour is produced ; for at this high
temperature the starch and the iodine seem to be dissociated
and incapable of mutual action. This appears to be what is
meant by Briicke (as stated in the Chemical Society's Ab
stracts for 1884, p. 576), who makes the bleaching to depend
on the affinity of warm water for iodine being greater than
that of cold water.
   Thus far the reasoning seems to be justified by the facts ;
but the restoration of the colour on the addition of chlorine,
apparently after all colour had been destroyed, remains to be
accounted for. In such case the small quantity of iodine that
remains after the boiling seems to be disguised under the form
of hydriodic acid, formed partly, as Thdnard suggested, at the
expense of the starch ; and the action of the chlorine is to set
 free a minute quantity of iodine, sufficient, however, for tho
starch to restore the blue colour. The fact just given, that
 boiling solutions of the starch and iodine may be mingled
 without the production of colour further supports the above
view ; nor does the colour appear when the tube has become
 cold ; but the addition of a few drops of chlorine solution
 immediately starts the colour, or if to any of the tubes con
 taining the cold bleached solution a few drops of nitrate-of-
 silver solution be added, a faint indication of the presence of
 hydriodic acid is obtained.
    The conclusions arrived at seem to be:—
    1. That the blue colour disappears in consequence of tho
 dissociation of the iodine and the starch under the action of
 a high temperature.
    2. That when the liquid is apparently permanently bleached,
 and yet the colour is restored by the action of chlorine, a
 minute quantity of iodine is present under the form of
 hydriodic acid.
 the effects to vary with different kinds of starch, the blue colour dis
 appearing more quickly in the case of rice- than with potato-starch.
 Casein (cheese, for example) causes a precipitation of the blue compound
 upon itself, leaving the liquid clear above. Milk also bleaches, apparently
 from the presence of casein.

  XX. The Production of Monochromatic Light, or a Mixture
     of Colours, on the Screen. By Capt. W. de W. Abney,
     R.E., F.R.SS
  FOR some time past I have been making experiments on
         the illuminating power of various sources of light, and
  it became necessary in some investigations to produce fair-
 sized patches of different monochromatic, and combinations of
 monochromatic lights, upon a screen, all other colours being
 absent. To obtain this result I had recourse to a modification
 of Clerk-Maxwell's arrangement, as used for colour-mixing.
  By his plan slits were inserted at different parts of the
 spectrum as formed by an ordinary spectroscope. These slits
  were then illuminated by light reflected from a white screen,
 and the prism was viewed through the slit of what is ordi
 narily the collimator. The prism was then seen to bo coloured
 with light from those rays which would
 have fallen on those slits had the spec
 troscope beon used in the ordinary man
 ner. In this arrangement only one
 observer could bo utilized at one time,
 and my object was to allow several ob
 servers simultaneously to view the colour.
 In order to effect this the following appa
 ratus was employed:—A collimator 0,
 the aperture of the lens Ls of which
 was 1£ inches, and the focal length
 about 12 inches, was employed. On
 the slit Si was cast an image of the
source of light A by means of the con
 densing lens L,. This was of such an
aperture as entirely to fill the colli-
mating lens L2 with the rays entering
through the slit.
    Two prisms, Pi and Pj, of 2^ inches by
lj inch side, and of angles of 62°, gave
tho necessary dispersion to the parallel
beam, from the collimator. The rays
were brought to a focus by means of tho
lens L3, of about 14 inches focal length,

            On the Production, of Monochromatic Light.        173
on to the screen belonging to a camera, B. This screen was
placed at an angle with the axis of the lens L3 as shown, so that
a fair focus of every visible ray was obtained upon it. (It may
 be worth mentioning that a hair placed across the slit or a
little particle of dust is a good means of obtaining a focus
when Fraunhofer or bright lines are not observable. The
 black streak produced by it should be sharp along the whole
of the spectrum.) A card, D D, with a slit S3 or slits cut in
it, replaced the ordinary dark slide, and, by moving it along
the spectrum, any colour or colours can be allowed to pass.
Before using the apparatus the whole of the spectrum was caused
to fall on a convex lens, L4, of about 24 inches focal length and
about 5 inches diameter. This collected the dispersed beam of
light, giving an enlarged image, F, of one surface of one of
the prisms on a screen, E. By placing this lens at an angle
with the axis of the lens L3, the blue and red fringes can be
made to disappear almost entirely, and a practically white
patch of light is seen on the screen E.
    I may say that the lenses used are white flint of medium
density and almost colourless, even in great thickness.
   When the adjustments are complete, as the slit is moved
along the spectrum every patch of colour or colours will suc
cessively occupy the same position on the screen and have
the same area very nearly. We thus can have patches of
monochromatic light of any colour or combinations of any
colours, all other colour being absent.
    I have also obtained the same results by substituting mir
rors for all the lenses and a reflecting-grating for the prisms;
but I do not see any particular advantage in this plan, as the
white light is more tinged (with the colour of the metal)
than when prisms and lenses of white glass are employed.
   When the source of light is the arc light, if an image of tho
crater of the positive pole be thrown on the slit S, of the
collimator, the intensity of the light is such (when the slit
is fairly open) that the patch of nearly pure light may be
made 1 foot square, and yet be sufficiently brilliant to be seen
by a fairly large audience, and for an ordinary lecture-room
it is very effective. The mixture of colours to imitate any
colour in the spectrum may be shown by placing a narrow
slit in a small card in the colour required to be imitated,
and fixing in front of it and in contact with it a portion
of a cylindrical lens, the axis of the cylinder being of course
parallel to the slit. This throws the image of the particular
colour to be observed at one side of the image that would be
obtained were the cylindrical lens absent, and any amount of
deviation can be given the patch by using the different parts

174          On the Production of Monochromatic Light.
of the Ions. Thus the greater the deviation required the nearer
to the margin of the lens the part of it employed should be.
In other words, the cylindrical lens acts as a series of prisms
of varying angles. To obtain mixtures of colours to corre
spond to the deviated patch, movable slits, and capable of being
narrowed or widened, are placed on each side of the fixed slit.
By this plan two patches of light of equal size and equal inten
sity can be readily produced. When measurements are to be
obtained, scales are attached to the various slits, by which any
part of the spectrum can be identified ; and the widths of the
slits are measured by a gauge.
    Since this apparatus was described I have referred to a
paper by Helmholtz, which appeared in Poggendorff's An-
nalen in 1855, in which one of the methods he used for the
combination of coloured light to produce white light is de
scribed. The general principle he adopted is the same as that
described above ; but in several important details the latter
 differs considerably from Helmholtz's apparatus. For instance,
the apparatus now described is suitable for the comparison of
 colour-mixtures with monochromatic light of any colour and
 for their exhibition on the screen for lecture-purposes, and an
 illumination \b secured which is very largely in excess of that
 usually obtained. In a paper read before the Physical Society
 (Phil. Mag. June 1885) Lord Rayleigh shows how a mono
 chromatic image of an external object may be seen by placing
 a concave lens immediately behind the slit of the spectroscope
 of such a power as to throw an image of that object on the
 prism. I have found that by altering the distances apart of
 the collimating lenses and viewing lens, a monochromatic
 image of the sun may be thrown on the screen. If such an
 image be coloured with the light of the blue or violet hydrogen
 lines, it should be possible to photograph the solar prominences
 en bloc. I may mention that the apparatus as described was
 employed in two Cantor Lectures at the Society of Arts in the
 beginning of April, but without describing it in detail.
    I am at present engaged in using this apparatus for inves
 tigating some phenomena existing in colour-blindness, and
 obtaining curves of illumination of different lights, and also
 in some photographic researches. These results are not yet
 ripe for publication ; but I have thought it might be well to
 publish the method employed, as it is one of great conve
 nience, and very easily carried out by any one who has a
 spectroscope and a photographic camera.

 XXI. Mechanical Integration of the Product of two Functions.
           By William Sutherland, M.A., B.Sc*
    N a communication to the Royal Society (February 3,
I 1876), "On an Instrument for Calculating ^ tj>(x)y}r(x)dx,
the integral of the product of two Functions," Prof. Sir
William Thomson has shown how, by the use of Prof. James
Thomson's disk, globe, and cylinder integrating machine, the
integral of the product of two functions can be found. The
operations involved consist, first, in plotting the curve y=>/r(.r),
then in making the instrument, by a rather difficult attach
ment, yield a trace of the curve            ty{x)dx, then in plot
ting the curve                : these two latter curves have to be
wrapped round one or two cylinders. When the cylinders arc
caused to revolve, a pointer capable of moving parallel to the
axis of y has to be kept on each curve, the motions of the two
pointers being communicated to the disk and globe respectively
of the integrator : the amount of the angular movement of
the cylinder gives the integral.
    In view of the very important part that the analysis of an
arbitrary function into its harmonic constituents is destined
to play in extracting law out of the immense mass of physical
ana chemical measurements that are being accumulated, it
seemed to be worth while to look for a simpler method of
obtaining ^<f>[x)^fr(x)dx than the above. The following may
be found to be such, and seems likely to be capable of more
immediate application ; for the disk, globe, and cylinder
integrator, despite its kinematical elegance, has not yet come
into general use.
    The following method is merely a mechanical realization of
the operations which Fourier so carefully describes in his
' Analytical Theory of Heat,' art. 220, chap. iii. sect, vi., in
order to give as concrete an idea as possible of the meaning of
the coefficients in his expansion. " We see by this that the
coefficients a, b, c, d, e,f which enter into the equation
       ^7r^)(a;)=asin^ + isin 2# + csin 3x + dsm4x+ &c,
and which we found formerly by successive eliminations are
the values of the definite integrals expressed by the general
term Jsinu^>(.z)<&r, t being the number of the term whose
coefficient is required. This remark is important, because it
shows how even entirely arbitrary functions may be developed
 in series of sines of multiple arcs. In fact, if the function
 <f>(x) be represented by the variable ordinate of any curve
                      • Communicated by the Author.

 176      Mr. W. Sutherland on tlte Mechanical hxiegration
 whatever, whose abscissa extends from x=0 to x = ir, and if
 in the same part of the axis the known trigonometrical curve
 whose ordinate is y = sin x be constructed, it is easy to repre
 sent the value of any coefficient. We must suppose that for
 each abscissa x to which corresponds one value of <f>(x) and
 one value of sinx, we multiply the latter value by the first,
 and at the same point of the axis raise an ordinate equal to the
product $(,r)sin#. By this continuous operation a third
 curve is formed, whose ordinates are those of the trigono
 metrical curve reduced in proportion to the ordinates of the
arbitrary curve which represents <j)(x). This done, the area
of the reduced curve taken from #=0 to#=7r gives the exact
value of the coefficient of sinx."
   To take the more general case, let it be required to find
   ¦«
     <f>(0)y^{0)d0. Plot the two curves whose polar equations
are r=<j>(0), r=yjr(0), using the same pole and the same initial
line for angular measurement in both cases. Let Sx and S2 be
the points on the two curves corresponding to any value of 0
(see figure) ; then
       1r(0)<}>(0) = OSj . OS2.
Describe a circle of radius R
passing through Si and S3 ;
through 0 draw the tangent 0 T
to this circle, then
           OT^OSx.OS,.
Now if the arm OSiS3 is turned
into any other position, cutting
the curves in two fresh points S'i
and S'jj, and if the circle of con
stant radius R is again brought
into position so as to pass through
these points, the new length of
the tangent OT is always such
that OT'2 = OS\ . 0S'2: therefore
generally OT' = yfr(0)<l>(0).
    In OSiS, mark off OS3 = OT;
then if, as OS^ is revolved
from the initial to the final position, or from that given by
6=al to that by 0=a-2, the motion of T is by any mechanical
device communicated to S3 unaltered, the locus of Ss is a curve
such that always OSl = ^(0)f{0) ;

 = twice the area of the figure enclosed by the third curve
traced out by S3, aud by the lines 0 = *\, 0=*3.
   The arrangements for describing the third curve mechani
cally are obvious. An arm, OSjSg, capable of turning freely
in the plane of the paper round an axis through 0, bears two
collars, S! and Sj, free to move along OSiS2; and to these,
two equal arms, SiC, S2C, are freely jointed, being at the same
time each free to turn in the plane of the paper round an axis
through C ; the two collars bear pointers with which to follow
the two curves. A second long arm, OT, can turn round the
axis through 0 ; at T is a collar free to move along OT, and
to it is rigidly attached an arm, CT, equal to OS! and CS2,
and always at right angles to OT : this arm bears the axis
through C. Then as Si and S2 are guided along the corre
sponding curves, the two arms OT and CT move in such a
manner that T is always the point in which a circle of radius
CSa, CS2, or CT is touched by OT; thus always OP = OSj . OS*
   As regards the transmission of the motion of T to a point
S3 on the axis OS^j different methods are possible, perhaps
the simplest being that represented by the dotted lines in the
figure. ATBS3 is a rhombus with hinges at the four angular
points ; the hinges at T and S3 are attached to the collars
there, while the hinges at A and B bear two collars free to
move along an arm OBA, which in its turn is free to move
round the axis through 0, obviously always OS3 = OT. A
pencil attached to the collar S3 traces the required curve.
   All that is necessary, then, for finding the integral
                         ("tf)(0)yjr(0)d0
                        */ BE,
is to join the two ends of this curve by straight lines to 0 and
take the area of the resulting figure by means of any planimeter.
   But a very simple attachment to the above mechanism
makes a planimeter of it. Suppose the area of any figure to
be required. Fix the collar Sx at a certain suitable distance b
from O, so that when the arm OSjSj moves, Si must describe
a circle of known radius b. Guide S3 along the outline of the
figure, then S2 moves always in such a way that
             JOS&0=j,OS1.OSfd0=&jOS1tf0j
but this last integral is the length of the path travelled by S2.
Thus all that is necessary is to attach at S2 a wheel which will
record the length of the path traversed by S2.

XXII. On the Sensitiveness of Selenium to Light, and the
    Development of a similar Property in Sulphur. By Shel-
    ford Bidwell, M.A., LL.B*
THE remarkable property apparently possessed by crystal
         line selenium of having its electrical resistance varied
by the action of light, a property which was first announced
by Mr. Willoughby Smith in 1873, has been the subject of
many investigationst. Of these the best known, and by far
the most exhaustive, are the researches of Prof. W. G, Adams
and Mr. R. E. Day, an account of which is published in the
 Phil. Trans, of 1877. As the result of numerous experiments,
 these gentlemen were led to form the opinion, that "the
electrical conductivity of selenium is electrolytic "f. The
 principal reasons given for this conclusion are: —(1) that the
resistance of the selenium-bars used appeared to depend upon

the electromotive force of the battery employed, being gene
rally diminished as the battery-power was increased ; (2) that
the resistance of a bar AB was generally not the same for
current in the direction AB as for a current in the direction
BA ; (3) that the passage of a battery-current was always
followed, when the battery had been disconnected, by a
secondary or polarization-current in the opposite direction, it
being clearly proved that this secondary current was not due
to any thermoelectric action, either in the selenium itself or
in any other part, of the circuit.
   The authors do not, however, appear to have considered
that the observed behaviour of selenium was to be explained
by actual electrolysis, but rather that the molecular structure
or crystalline condition of the substance was altered or modi
fied by the action of a current of electricity in such a manner
as to produce effects analogous to those which would have
occurred if the selenium were an electrolyte and actually de
composed bv the current. As to the possible influence of
light, the following are their words *: —" Light, as we know,
in the case of some bodies, tends to promote crystallization,
and when it falls on the surface of such a stick of selenium,
tends to promote crystallization in the exterior layers, and
therefore to produce a flow of energy from within outwards,
which, under certain circumstances, appear* in the case of
selenium to produce an electric current. The crystallization
produced in selenium by light may also account for the dimi
nution in the resistance of the selenium when a current from
a battery is passing through it, for, in changing to the
crystalline state, selenium becomes a better conductor of
electricity."
   Attention has lately been again directed to the subject of
selenium, and its behaviour under the influence of light, by
the publication, by Mr. C. E. Fritts of New York, of a new
and extremely ingenious method of constructing selenium
cellsf- He melts a thin film of selenium upon "a plate of
metal with which it will form a sort of chemical combina
tion         During the process of melting and crystallizing,
the selenium is compressed between the metal plate upon
which it is melted and another plate of steel or other substance
with which it will not combine           The non-adherent plate
being removed after the cell has become cool, [he] then covers
that surface with a transparent conductor of electricity, which
may be a thin film of gold-leaf. .... The whole surface of

the selenium is therefore covered with a good electrical con
ductor, yet is practically bare to the light, which passes through
the conductor to the selenium underneath." The sensitive
ness to light of cells constructed in this manner seems to be
far in excess of anything that has been previously obtained ;
and the " photoelectric currents which (like the selenium
bars of Messrs. Adams and Day) they are capable of origina
ting, are said to be strong enough to be actually useful in
practical work.
    It is impossible to read Mr. Fritts's paper without being
impressed by the resemblance of some of the phenomena
which he describes to those of electrolysis. The mere arrange
ment of the apparatus—two metallic plates with a third sub
stance between them—is in itself strongly suggestive ; while
the unequal resistance offered by the two surfaces, and the
generation of an independent electromotive force, in conjunc
tion with the polarization-effects above referred to*, make it
hard to believe that the conduction of selenium (in the form
used in experiments) is not truly and literally electrolytic.
    The only considerable difficulty in the way of this hypothesis
arises from the fact that selenium is not an electrolyte. Ever
since its discovery in 1817, selenium has been regarded as an
element, and very strong evidence indeed would be necessary
to deprive it of its elementary character ; this is perhaps the
reason why the electrolytic theory has not previously been
proposed. But there is a possible way out of the difficulty,
which was suggested to me by the first words in the above
quotation from Mr. Kritts's paper. He spreads the selenium
upon a plate of metal with which it will form a chemical
combination. Now selenium will, I believe, combine more
or less easily with all metals, forming selenides ; and in ex
periments upon the conductivity of selenium, it has been
usual to submit the substance to prolonged heating in contact
with metallic electrodes. This prolonged heating (generally
followed by slow cooling) has hitherto been called " annealing;"
and the undoubted fact that it diminishes the specific resist
ance of the selenium and increases its sensitiveness to light,
has been explained by supposing that the process is favourable
to perfect crystallization.
    I venture to suggest, as the true explanation of the effect,
that heating is favourable to a chemical combination between
the selenium and the metal forming the electrodes, that a
selenide is thus formed which completely surrounds the elec-

trodes, and is perhaps diffused to some extent throughout the
mass of the selenium* ; and that the apparently improved
conductivity of the selenium, together with the electrolytic
phenomena which it exhibits, are to be accounted for by the
existence of this selenide.
   I have sometimes been tempted to think it possible that the
apparent conductivity of selenium may in fact be entirely due
to the impurities which it contains, and that perfectly pure
selenium would be as good an insulator when in the crystal
line form as it is in the vitreous condition. Vitreous selenium
might contain a large percentage of conducting particles
without sensible increase of its conductivity, but that this
would not be the case with crystalline selenium, is rendered
more than probable by the results of some experiments which
I have described in a former communication!. If a conduct
ing powder, such as graphite, is mixed with melted sulphur,
even in small proportions, the mixture when cold is found to
conduct electricity ; while if a very large proportion of the
same powder is incorporated with melted shellac, the shellac
when cold remains sensibly as perfect a nonconductor as if
it were pure. The explanation which I have given of these
facts, and in support of which a number of experiments are
quoted, is as follows :—The first mixture does not consist of a
uniform structureless mass of sulphur, having particles of
carbon imbedded in and completely surrounded oy it: it is in
fact an aggregation of little crystals of sulphur with carbon
packed between them like mortar between bricks. The con
duction thus takes place entirely through the carbon particles,
which may be considered as extending in a series of chains
from end to end of the mass. In the case of the shellac
mixture, though the proportion of carbon may be larger than
in the sulphur experiments, the resistance is still sensibly
infinite, because the structureless shellac penetrates between
and completely surrounds the carbon particles. Just in the
same manner, selenium, when in the vitreous condition, would
completely surround any particles of conducting selenides
which it might contain; while, when the selenium was
crystallized, the conducting particles would arrange them
selves in the form of a network, capable of conveying a current
of electricity.

an article of commerce. An analysis of samples collected by
Professor Graham Bell from different parts of the world

182              Mr. S. Bidwell on the Sensitive/test
disclosed the presence of the metals iron, lead, and arsenic*,
all of which would form conducting selenides. Nevertheless
I thought it would be worth while to ascertain roughly the
specific resistance of a piece of selenium which, since it has
come into my possession, has never been in contact with metal.
The selenium (which was supplied by Messrs. Hopkin and
Williams) was melted in a mould built up of slips of glass,
crystallized and " annealed " in the usual way ; but, contrary
to the general practice, it was not fitted with metallic electrodes
before annealing. A plate of crystalline selenium was thus
formed, having a thickness of about 2 millim. and a superficial
area of 1 square centim. The two opposite surfaces were
rendered smooth and clean by rubbing them upon a flat board
covered with fine glass-paper, and the plate was placed between
two layers of thick tinfoil which were pressed into good con
tact with it by a weight of 500 grammes. When this arrange
ment was connected in circuit with 6 Leclanche cells and a
reflecting galvanometer, a deflection was produced indicating
a current of about 6\j micro-ampere. Assuming the electro
motive force of the battery to have been 10 volts, the resistance
of the plate would be 500 megohms; and therefore the resistance
of a cubic centimetre of the selenium between opposite faces
(t*. e. its specific resistance) would be 2500 megohms. From
the dimensions and resistance of a good selenium cell with
copper electrodes, which I have in my possession, I calculated
 that the specific resistance of the selenium contained in it was
about -9 megohm. Thus, so far as the result of a single rough
 experiment can be trusted, it appears that the conductivity of
 selenium which has been annealed in contact with copper is
 nearly 3000 times greater than that of selenium which has
 undergone similar treatment without the presence of a metal.
 Whether selenium, when perfectly pure, is altogether a non
 conductor, would be an interesting question for an expert
 chemist to determine f. It is sufficient for the theory which
 I am at present advocating that its specific resistance should
 be very high.
     By assuming the admixture with the selenium of metallic
 selenides, an explanation is aflbrded of the following facts :—
     (1) The diminished resistance produced by annealing.
     (2) The fact, first pointed out by Graham Bell, that the
 resistance of selenium appears to depend greatly upon the
 nature of the metals of which the electrodes are formed. For
 obtaining low resistance he recommends the use of brass in
    * Paper read before the National Academy of Sciences, April 21, 1881.

 preference to platinum, and expresses his belief that the che
 mical action between the brass and selenium contributes to
 the low resistance of his cells, " by forming an intimate bond
 of union between the selenium and brass." *
     (3) The fact observed by Adams and Day that there is
 generally a " diminution of resistance in the selenium as the
 battery-power is increased." The same phenomenon occurs
 in the mixtures of sulphur and carbon before referred to. It
 points to the existence of imperfect contact between conducting
particles, the conduction partaking of the nature of disruptive
discharge, and is consistent with the supposition that particles
 of conducting selenide are imbedded in the selenium t-
     (4) The apparent production by a current through a piece
 of selenium of a " set of the molecules which facilitates the
subsequent, passage of a current in the opposite, but obstructs
 one in the same direction "f. This would be accounted for
by the electrolytic deposition of selenium (from the selenide)
upon the anode.
     (5) The polarization-effects, which would also proceed from
electrolysis.
     (6) " A slight increase of temperature of a piece of annealed
selenium is accompanied by a large increase of electrical re
sistance'^. This also occurs in the mixture of sulphur and
carbon, and is explained by supposing that the heat-expansion
of the medium draws apart the conducting particles contained
in it, causing them to have fewer points of contact with each
other, and thus increasing the resistance of the whole ||. A
more considerable rise of temperature so greatly diminishes the
specific resistance of the selenide (and perhaps of the selenium)
as to more than counterbalance this effect; and thus it happens
(as I have shown in a former communication If) that selenium
cells have a " temperature of maximum resistance," which is
generally a few degrees above the average temperature of the
air.
     (7) The resistance of prepared selenium is generally greatly
diminished by the action of time. Prof. Adams found that
the average resistance of a number of pieces of selenium was

184             Mr. S. Bidwell on the Sensitiveness
reduced to less than one fortieth in the course of a year*.
During this period the selenium had been in contact with the
metallic electrodes; and it seems possible that a larger quan
tity of selenide than was produced in the first instance by the
process of annealing was slowly formed. This would espe
cially occur at the " marked end," or anode, where there
would naturally be a quantity of free selenium.
    In the above argument it has been assumed that selenium
will combine directly with any metal with which it is brought
into contact, the combination being facilitated by the appli
cation of heat. In the case of such metals as copper, brass,
and silver this is undoubtedly the fact. Indeed, an attempt
to make a selenium cell with silver wires was attended with
 failure in consequence of the complete destruction of the
metal after contact with the melted selenium for only two or
three minutes. It is, however, questionable whether platinum
 (which was the metal used by Adams and Day) is, in any
 sensible degree, attacked by selenium either at the ordinary
 temperature or at that reached in the process of annealing.
 With sufficient heat the two substances will undoubtedly
 unite; and I have found that the surface of platinum-foil upon
 which melted selenium has been kept for an hour or two at a
 temperature probably of about 250° C. acquires a bluish-grey
 colour which may be due to selenide. But whether any ap
 preciable quantity of selenide is formed in the ordinary pre
 paration of crystalline selenium is a question only to be settled
 by the aid of refined chemical operations which I am incom
 petent to undertake, and in the meantime the suggested theory
 is left without direct confirmation.
     But certain indirect evidence in support of my views has
 been forthcoming. Selenium is an element which, in its
  properties, closely resembles sulphur, and attempts have from
  time to time been made, hitherto without success, to develope
  in sulphur that peculiar sensitiveness to light which is such a
  remarkable characteristic of seleninm. It occurred to me
  that if this property of selenium were really due to the acci
  dental existence of metallic selenides, then the admixture
  with sulphur of metallic sulphides might be expected to lead
  to similar effects. It is not possible to "anneal" a stick of
  sulphur or a sulphur " cell " previously furnished with metallic
  electrodes, because sulphur does not, like selenium, solidify
  and crystallize at a higher temperature than that of its first
  melting-point. But if it is true that the virtue of annealing
  really lies in the fact that a chemical union of the two olements
  is promoted by the action of heat, it is clearly immaterial

whether the substances are heated together before or after the
formation of the cell. Sulphur containing sufficient metallic
sulphide to render it a conductor of electricity might be used
in the construction of a cell which might be expected to be
sensitive to light without any preliminary annealing. This
turned out to be actually the case.
    Silver was the metal chosen for the experiments on account
of the facility with which it combines with sulphur.
     Cell No. 1.—Five parts of sublimed sulphur and one part
of precipitated silver were heated together in a porcelain cru
cible for about two hours. The mixture was from time to
time stirred with a glass rod and was finally allowed to settle,
 so that the bulk of the sulphide and any free silver which might
 remain fell to the bottom of the crucible. When the tem
 perature was slightly above the melting-point the liquid
 sulphur, which was perfectly mobile, though black with
 minute suspended particles of sulphide, was poured off for
 use. Two wires of fine silver* were then coiled side b}r side
 around a strip of mica 50 millim. long and 27 millim. wide ; the
 wires were about 1 millim. apart, and care was taken that they
 did not touch each other at any point. Some of the melted
 sulphur was spread evenly over one surface of 'the mica, the
 two wires being thus connected with each other through half
  their entire length by a thin laj'er of the prepared sulphur.
  When cold, this cell was connected in circuit with a battery
  and a galvanometer. It was found to conduct electricity,
  but its resistance was very high, being probably between
  20 and 30 megohms. With the object of partially bridging
  over the intervals between the wires, the sulphur was melted
  by laying the cell upon a hot plate, and a piece of very thin
  silver-foil, measuring 25 millim. by 10 millim., was laid upon
  its surface: this was probably entirely converted into sulphide
  before the cell was again cold. The cell was now found by
  a bridge-measurement to have a resistance of 900,000 ohms f.
  Once more it was connected with a Leclanche' cell and a
  suitably shunted galvanometer; the deflection was noted,
  and a piece of magnesium wire was burnt at a short distance
  from the sulphur. The deflection was immediately more than
  doubled; and when the magnesium was extinguished, the spot
  of light at once returned to very nearly its original position.
   The effect was almost as great when a glass trough containing
   a saturated solution of alum was interposed between the
   sulphur and the burning magnesium }.

      t This resistance was afterwards found to be very variable, and it was
   never the same with a direct and a reverse current.

   Society on May 23rd, and at the SoirtSe of the Royal Society on June 10.

186             Mr. S. Bidwell on the Sensitiveness
   Now it is well known that the resistance of sulphide of
silver is greatly diminished by heat *, and it was therefore
important to ascertain whether the effect just described was
due to light or to heat. To speak more accurately—Is it an
effect of radiation or of temperature? Exposure to radiation,
whether visible or invisible, is of course always accompanied
by a certain rise of temperature, and confusion has sometimes
arisen, especially in discussing the properties of selenium, from
failure to distinguish between the direct effects of radiation,
and the indirect effects which are primarily due merely to a
rise of temperature f- In the photographic processes it is
radiation per se that produces the observed results: in the best
known processes, the effective rays happen to be those which
correspond to the most-refrangible part of the visible spec
trum together with the invisible rays beyond it. But by
more recently discovered methods the " obscure heat-rays,"
as they are sometimes called, have been made available for
photographic purposes } ; and these do not act by virtue of
any rise of temperature which they may cause, but exert
direct chemical action upon the sensitized plate. Again, if a
thermo-pile is exposed to radiation, an electromotive force is
generated. Here, however, the effect of radiation is indirect ;
it acts only through the medium of the heat which it pro
duces'; and if an equal and similarly distributed amount of
heat were communicated to the thermo-pile by any other
means (as by conduction), exactly the same effect would
follow. In an ordinary selenium cell radiation acts both
directly and indirectly, tending to produce opposite effects.
The direct effect of the radiation, whether it be visible or
infra-red or ultra-violet, is a diminution of the resistance of
the cell; at the same time the radiation slightly raises the
temperature of the cell, and so indirectly tends to increase its
resistance. If a selenium cell in circuit with a battery and
a galvanometer is suddenly exposed, by withdrawing a screen,
to the radiation of a black-hot poker, a momentary swing of
the galvanometer-magnet will at first indicate a fall in the
resistance; but this will be almost immediately followed by
a rise which will increase up to a certain limit as the tempe
rature of the cell becomes higher. The same kind of thing
occurs when the cell is exposed to the infra-red or red por
tions of the spectrum; but in the latter ease the temperature-
effect merely diminishes, instead of overpowering, that directly
duo to radiation. If the bridge method is used for measuring

the resistance, it may easily happen that the effect of gradu
ally rising temperature escapes notice, a balance not being
obtained until the temperature has become constant ; and thus,
probably, is to be explained the fact that different observers
have attributed the most powerful action upon selenium to
different parts of the spectrum, ranging from infra-red to
greenish yellow.
    The resistance of the sulphur cell which has been de
scribed, unlike that of most selenium cells, was diminished
by a rise of temperature*. When in circuit with a Le-
clanch6 cell and a galvanometer, the effect of holding a nearly
red-hot brass rod at a distance of 3 centim. from its surface,
was a gradual fall of resistance, which in 15 seconds was
indicated by 23 scale-divisions. When the rod was removed,
the spot of light slowly returned to its original position,
occupying several seconds in doing so. It is certain that the
temperature of the sulphur must in this experiment have
been much higher than when it was exposed to burning
magnesium, with a solution of alum interposed, yet the effect
was very much smaller; moreover, it was gradual instead of
 instantaneous.
    Another experiment seems to prove conclusively that the
 resistance of the cell is diminished by the direct action of
 radiation, quite apart from any effect which may be produced
by an incidental rise of temperature. On a cloudy day the
 cell, with the alum trough before it, was placed at a distance of
 16 feet from a small window, all the other windows in the
 room being darkened. With the same battery and galva
 nometer as before, it was found that closing the window-shutter
 caused an instantaneous swing of the spot of light through 1)0
 scale-divisions in the direction indicating increased resistance;
 and when the shutter was again opened, there was immediately
 an equal swing in the opposite direction. A delicate thermo
 pile of 54 pairs, connected with an astatic refleoting-galva-
 nometer of low resistance, was then put in the place of the
 sulphur cell, and the alum trough placed before the open end
 of the conical reflector attached to it. On opening the window-
 shutter, a deflection occurred indicating a current which was
 found by trial to be equal to that produced by the radiation
 of the human body at a distance of 10 ft, 6 in. It is needless
 to say that such a minute change of temperature as this
 implies was without sensible effect upon the resistance of the
 sulphur cell. There can then be no doubt whatever that the
 whole of the observed effect of the light upon the sulphur
    * This was not so with all the cells subsequently made. See descrip
 tion of cell no. 3 below.

188           Mr. S. Bidwell on tfie Sensitiveness
was due to the action of radiation as such, any change of
resistance resulting from the incidental rise of temperature
being quite inappreciable.
   Cell No. 2.—This was constructed in a somewhat different
manner. A piece of silver-foil was laid upon the surface of
the mica before the two wires were wound round it, and
instead of having prepared sulphur spread upon one face, the
whole was immersed in pure melted sulphur for a few minutes,
and then carefully drained. Before this treatment the silver
wires were of course short-circuited by the foil, but the liquid
sulphur penetrated between them, forming a film of sulphide;
and when cold, the resistance of the cell was about 100,000
ohms. Though this cell turned out to be somewhat less sen
sitive than the other, it seemed likely that, on account of its
comparatively low resistance, it might be successfully used
for a photophonic experiment. It was therefore connected in
circuit with a battery of ten Leclanche cells and a telephone,
and exposed to a rapidly interrupted beam of light. The
telephone at once gave out a musical note, which was nearly
us loud as that produced by a good selenium cell under
similar circumstances.
   The behaviour of this cell under changes of temperature
was the same as that of the other.
   Cell No. 3.— A mixture, consisting of equal parts of sub
limed sulphur and precipitated sulphide of silver, was melted
and spread on one surface of a slip of mica, around which two
silver wires had been wound as before. No foil was used in
this case. The resistance of this cell was diminished by radia
tion, but increased in a very marked manner by rise of tempe
rature. A paraffin lamp, at a distance of 18 inches, produced
a steady diminution of the resistance. When the lamp was
placed at a distance of 10 inches, the galvanometer-needle first
moved in a direction indicating a further fall of resistance ;
but after a few seconds, when the temperature began to rise,
it turned in the opposite direction. On moving the lamp
6 inches nearer, there was at once a large deflection in the
direction of increased resistance, the temperature-effect com
pletely predominating over that of radiation.
   Cell No. 4.—A strip of silver-leaf was attached to a glass
plate by means of gold size, and the middle part of it was
exposed to the vapour of boiling sulphur until both surfaces
were completely blackened. The resistance of this cell was
high, but for a few days it was extraordinarily sensitive, a
reflected beam of sunlight instantly effecting a diminution of
80 per cent, in its resistance. About a fortnight after it was
made, its sensitiveness had greatly fallen off.

   All these cells resemble selenium in giving polarization-
currents after being detached from the battery.
   Supposing it to be true, then, that it is not in the selenium
or sulphur itself, but in certain metallic selenides or sulphides,
that the sensitiveness to light is resident, does it become easier
to explain the phenomenon, or, rather, to deprive it of the
unique -position which it has hitherto appeared to hold, and
assign to it a place among a class of analogous effects?
   I believe that, at all events in the case of the sulphur-silver
cell, it is principally at the surface of the electrodes that the
effecis of radiation are to be looked for.
   If a current of electricity is passed through a mass of
sulphide of silver having silver electrodes, silver will be
deposited upon the cathode and sulphur upon the anode. The
accumulation of silver upon the cathode will clearly produce
no appreciable effect upon the conductivity of the arrange
ment, and need not be considered. But sulphur has an enor
mously high resistance, and the deposition of a mere film of
free sulphur upon the anode would be sufficient to stop the
current altogether. The current is not in fact stopped, because
the deposited sulphur at once combines with the silver of the
anode, merely adding a new layer to the electrolyte. Thus
the metal of the anode gradually combines with the sulphur
of the electrolyte ; and the conductivity of the arrangement
will depend to a great extent upon the facility with which this
combination is effected, the quantity of electricity which can
pass in a given time being limited by the quantity of sulphur
 which is capable of uniting with the electrode in the same
 time.
    Sulphur combines with silver far more readily than with
iron. If, therefore, my views are correct, we should expect
a cell with an iron anode to offer a much greater resistance
than one which had an anode of silver, the material of the
cathode, so long as it was a good elementary conductor of
 electricity, being of comparatively little importance. To test
this idea, a cell was made consisting of electrodes of iron and
 silver imbedded in a mixture of sulphide of silver and sulphur.
The cell being connected with a battery and a galvanometer,
the deflection was 115 divisions when the current passed from
 the silver to the iron through the electrolyte, and only 4 divi
 sions when the direction of the current was from iron to silver*.
 The resistance was therefore nearly 30 times as great with an

with a coil of 20 ohms. The resistance of the Leclanchd cell was about
6 ohms.

 190     Sensitiveness of Selenium and Sulphur to Light.
 iron anode as with a silver anode. It is clear that this was
 not the result of bad contact between the iron and the elec
 trolyte (such as was supposed by Graham Bell in the analogous
 case of selenium to account for the high resistance of a cell
 with platinum electrodes as compared with one in which the
 electrodes were made of brass), because such an effect would
 be independent of the direction of the current. Bather it
 seems that the resistances of the two anodes afford data for
 measuring the relative facilities with which sulphur combines
 with silver and with iron.
    Assuming it to be thus experimental ly proved that the re
 sistance of a sulphur-silver cell depends largely upon the
 readiness with which sulphur unites with the anode, it follows
that any cause which would assist this union would at the same
 time diminish the resistance. Now it is well known that certain
 chemical combinations are accelerated by the action of radia
tion—the explosive union of chlorine with hydrogen under the
 influence of sunlight being a familiar example. The question
 then suggests itself, Does sulphur combine with silver more
 readily when exposed to radiation than it otherwise would ?
 There is, I believe, direct evidence that it does.
   A glass plate, covered with silver leaf, was placed, with the
silvered side downwards, over a crucible of boiling sulphur.
 One half of the plate was covered with a piece of black cloth,
and the arrangement was exposed to bright sunshine. In a
short time the visible portion of the silver was darkened,
owing to its partial conversion into sulphide ; the cloth was
then removed, and the silver beneath it was found to be
scarcely discoloured. There was a distinct line of demarcation
between the two halves. The experiment was repeated with
the same result.
   Since this effect might possibly have been due to other
causes than the action of light (such as the unequal conden
sation of sulphur vapour upon the covered and uncovered
portions of the plate), the experiment was made in another
form. A piece of silver leaf attached to glass was brushed
over with a solution of sulphur in bisulphide of carbon ; and
in order to keep the temperature low and uniform, the silvered
glass plate was immersed in a basin containing cold water,
which was placed in the sunshine. A board was laid across the
top of the basin so as to shade one half of the plate, the other
half being exposed to the direct rays of the sun. In a quarter of
an hour the exposed portion of the silver had acquired a dark
brown colour, while that which had been protected was of a
pale yellow tint, the outline of the shadow of the board being
sharply defined. I think we have here the strongest evidence

                     On the Law of Density-Numbers.                       191
that the combination of sulphur with silver is assisted by
radiation.
    But it is not perhaps necessary to assume that the effective
action of light is confined entirely to the surface of one of the
electrodes. If, as is commonly believed, electrolytic conduc
tion involves a series of decompositions and recompositions
throughout the electrolyte, any cause which assists either the
separation or recomposition (or both) of the components of
the electrolyte might be expected to increase its conduc
tivity ; and it seems reasonable to suppose that the same
influence which would assist the union of two substances when
they have a tendency to unite would also be favourable to
their separation when they have a tendency to separate. It
is not impossible, therefore, that radiation, acting upon the
surface of a thin layer of sulphide of silver through which an
electric current is passing, might, by facilitating the mole
cular rearrangement of the atoms of sulphur and silver, exert
a material influence upon the conductivity of the sulphide*.
     So far as regards the explanation of the effect of light upon
 the resistance of selenium, I am aware that this paper contains
 little more than speculative suggestions, which are at present
 almost entirely unsupported by experimental evidencet- It
 is, however, noteworthy that these speculations led to the con
 struction of a cell which, without containing a particle of
 selenium, behaved almost exactly as if it were composed of
 that substance. How far this may be considered to prove
 anything with regard to selenium I do not know ; but in any
 case the discovery of another substance possessing the same
 remarkable property seems in itself to be a matter of some

     names Law of Avogadro and Law of Dulong and Petit. By
     J. A. GROSHANSt.
                             [Concluded from p. 30.]
 IT may be said that, as yet, the study of the causes which
         influence the value of x has to be commenced, and that
 all that pertains to this constant is still uncertain. Still I
     * There are some experimental reasons, into which I am not at present
  prepared to enter, for believing that the admixture with the sulphide of a
  certain amount of free sulphur is necessary for the development of sensi
  tiveness to radiation.
     t It is especially desirable to ascertain experimentally whether the com
  bination of selenium with the metals used as electrodes in selenium cells
  is assisted by light.

192                    M. J. A. Groshans on the
may be permitted to embody in the following pages the prin
cipal observations that I have been able to make on this
subject ; and as in doing so I shall have frequently to refer
to glycerine, it is perhaps as well to make a few remarks on
its boiling-point.
    There is but little agreement to be found among the figures
given by various experimenters who have attempted to deter
mine the boiling-point of this compound, C3 H8 03. The older
experiments point to 9 as the value for x, the more recent
to 9-5.
                 «>/9 = 275-l and aS 9-5 = 290-1*.
    In this connection I may add that Wurtz's butylic glycol,
C4H10O2, boils at 183°-184°, that of Kekule at 201°-204° :
                   s^&5 = 182-9, «v/9=196°-2.
In the following table I have adopted 9 as the value of x for
glycerine.
    Glycerine exhibits a peculiar property with regard to x—
it is this :—In glycerine, O3H6(0H)3 one, two, or three of
the hydrogens in hydroxyl groups may be replaced by ethyl,
 CjH6, to form ethylines. The original glycerine and its three
 derivatives form a species of homologous series the members
 of which have the common difference CSH4, and yet the
 increase of molecular weight is attended by a lowering of the
 boiling-point, exactly the opposite of what is observed in the
 case of other homologous series : this anomalous behaviour I
 attribute to the " constancy of x." In fact glycerine and its
 derivatives have all the same constant Tn/a, and consequently
 the same value of x —i. e. 9. The theoretical value of Tn/a,
 when x = 9, is 83-41, as will be seen from the table. Other
 derivatives similar to the ethylic ones also possess the same
 constants.

    Methyl glycerine, CH(OH)3, is not known, nor is methyl
erythrite (methylphycite), C(OH)4. But there are two com
pounds which have the composition of the ethylines of these
two unknown bodies, and a third, which is the allyline of the
former :—
                  (1) C7 Ha80,=CH(OC,H,)„
                  (2) C„ H*A=C(OCsHs)4j
                  (3) C10H16O3=CH(OC3H5)3.
And these have all the same value of Tn/a, x = 7. This pro
perty (the constancy of x) is to be met with in very many
other cases. I ought, however, to observe that in reality this
constancy of x is but a special case. When substitution -
products are formed each has a particular value of x, which
may be the same as that of the body from which it was formed,
or may be greater or less than that by one or more units,
according to circumstances.
    In instances where the value of x for the original substance
cannot be determined, it is frequently found that the products
of substitution, or some of them, have the same x. This is
the case with urea, CO(NHs)2. According to Table L, the
value of B is 12, Table XVI. contains four substituted ureas;
a:=16 in three cases, but in the fourth = 11; or a difference
of ft—a number which we shall find later on is a very frequent
difference in the value of x for analogous bodies. In the
following table I have, instead of the constant TB/a, inserted
the value of x, =1(27,8)2 x (TB/a)2, which is the same thing,
but in this instance more convenient. The boiling-points are
the mean of those given in Fehling's dictionary.

     In ammonia, NH3, x=9 ; and thus we find that in the
 three series of bodies of which the three following are types
 there is a steady increase of x apparently without limits: —
             Ammonia, NH3,                         x=9,

the difference NC2H5 therefore corresponds to x=5, or in the
atomic weight =43, in density numbers =10, numbers com
parable with those observed in the case of the elements (see
above).
    It is also possible to use the property of the constancy of x
in substitution-products to determine the value of some
density-numbers, especially that of chlorine. It is found
that, in general, x does not change when I, 2, 3, or more
atoms of chlorine are substituted for 1, 2, 3, or more atoms
of hydrogen in a body of the formula CpH9Or. Table XIX.

shows this clearly in the case of the four chlorine deri
vatives of toluol, C7H8; for when the density-number of
chlorine is taken as 4, the value of the constant Tn/a is all
through 62-2, and x is equal to 5. In the case of benzol,
C6H„ x=i, nnd so also for C6H,C1, C,H4C12, and C8H,C1,;
while x=4-5 for C^CI, and C6HC15. But =5 for C6CI„.

clearly this constancy of x in chlorine substitution-products.

On the Temperatures T (273°+ S°) considered as proportional
    to the Molecular Volumes of Substances in the Gaseous State
    at the Boiling-point S°.
    We are accustomed to regard the absolute boiling-points
as quantities expressing degrees of heat, and this no doubt
they are ; but they are at the same time proportional to the
molecular volumes of the vapours, analogous to those of the
liquids at the boiling-point (v, = a/d,). When the vapour-
density D, is expressed in terms of the volume of a gram of
water at 4° C, the absolute boiling-point T (affected by a

                      Law of Density-Number*.                 197
constant coefficient) expresses the volume in cubic centimetres
of the molecular weight in grams.
   In explaining this I may be permitted to restate a few
well-known facts.
   Two grams of hydrogen at 760 millim., and at 0° C,
occupy 22327 cubic centim.
   a grams of any substance in the state of gas under the same
conditions of temperature and pressure also occupy 22327
cubic centim., both by convention and in accordance with
Avogadro's law.
   This constant volume 22327 cubic centim. is multiplied at
the boiling-point S° by the fraction T/273 ; and consequently
the volume (molecular) of a substance in vapour at its boiling-
point is
            t>,= 22327 T/273=81-8 T cubic centim.,
and the vapour-density is
                        B=a/v=a/SlST.
As the coefficient 81 "8 is the same for all bodies, it may be
omitted if it be thought fit to do so.
  Relation between the Gaseous Molecular volume V, and the
                    Liquid Molecular volume v».
   When we take equal volumes [e.g. cubic centims.) of dif
ferent liquids at S° and convert them into vapour by heating,
we obtain a certain number of cubic centim. of vapour at
760 millim. and at S°; this number is for any substance what
ever.
                     81-8 T/i>, (cubic centim.).
   In this connection I wish to draw attention to a special
case which appears of particular interest : it is as follows :—
   We find that in certain groups of analogous substances
                         81-8 T/u,= constant.
This phenomenon is independent of the new law, and may be
expressed as follows :—
                       V tjt = constant = vr.
   (The constant 81 "8 is omitted here.)
   I shall call the constant vr the " reduced volume " of the
substances in question.
   When a cubic centimetre at s° of the liquids (which have
the same tv) is volatilized, one obtains a definite volume of
vapour which is the same for all these substances, and is
                vol. const. = 22327/?-, cubic centim.

198                    M- J. A. Groshans on the

substances, ana also the volumes (constant) of vapour.

    It is clear that the phenomenon of the constancy of vr
points to equality at the same time of the constants Tn/a and
v,n/a ; whence it follows that
                                        T
   Here is another consequence of the above :—¦
    Since it has been shown that the law of density numbers is
applicable to the volumes of vapour T and T' of compounds,
it must also bo applicable to the liquid volumes v, and t/,.
  Application of the New Laic to Volumes of Liquids at tlteir
                              Boiling-points.
   The properties of the liquid volumes are different from those
of the gaseous volumes. These last, when of isomeric bodies,
can differ greatly; the former, on the other hand, are equal,
or almost exactly so. But it seems to me a little premature
to make any extended remarks on the subject of liquid
volumes in general.
   If d, be the density of any liquid whatever at the boiling-
point S°, the volume v, = -j- ; and in applying the law to
these volumes we obtain the constants v,n/a analogous to
Tn/a (this constant v,n/a or r,B/« is the same as n/d, or
B/rf,). Instead of writing v,nja, I shall write k,, which is

200                 M. J. A. Groshans 07i the
            On the Variability of Physical Properties.
   I have given the above name to the following phenomena:—
    One frequently finds differences (according to Kopp reaching
sometimes as much as 2 per cent.) in the density of the same
substance at the same temperature. Similar differences are
to be observed in the fusing- and boiling-points. Such dif
ferences present themselves when these physical properties
have been determined by different persons or by the same
observer at different times.
    Space does not permit me to cite more than a very few
instances.
    I shall begin with crotonic acid, C4H80g; a=86, n = 12.
According to the law of density-numbers, and in consonance
with analogy (which I need not further refer to), this acid
should have the value of Tn/a corresponding to x=b, that is,
the same constant as that of water.
    There are three known isomers of this substance, which
 differ in chemical properties, with which I need not trouble
my readers. One of these isomers, /S, or isocrotonic or
quartenylic acid, has the following physical properties ; it is
 a liquid, not solidifying even at —15° C, and boiling at 171°-
173°; from S°V5 is calculated 1 720,5. There is thus complete
concordance between the calculated and observed boiling-
point.
    With regard to the other isomers, their physical properties,
 as given in Fehling, are as follows :—
    (1) a. acid—solid crotonic acid, tetracrylic acid : melting-
 point 71°-72°, boiling-point 187° (corr.).
    (2) Metacrylic acid : melting-point + 16°, boiling-point
160°'5.
    We have seen above that the j3 or iso-acid has x=b. For
 its two isomers we find respectively a:=5-330 and x=4"734;
 the mean value is #=503, which is essentially the same as
*=5.
    The particular fact that suggested to me the idea of the
mean value for x in various isomers was as follows :—
    " The liquid acid, which does not solidify even at — 15°, is
changed, by heating to 180° in a sealed tube, into the solid
 modification melting at 710,5 and boiling at 187°"*.
    We may infer from this that the physical properties depend,
among other things, on the treatment to which the compound
has been subjected.

                     Laic of Density-Numbers.                 201
   In this connection I shall take some other case from the
paper by Thorpe on the molecular volumes of liquids, Chem.
Soc. Journ. 1880.
          Properties of the Compounds Br2 and IC1.
   The molecular weights of the above substances are respec
tively 160, 162-5, being very nearly equal, and both have
B = 18. We would expect to find their densities (at the boil
ing-points) equal, but they differ by 0*1, or about 3"5 per
cent. With regard to their densities at 0°C, S0, these are
practically equal, notwithstanding the fact that their boiling-
points differ by 42°. The following are the data relating to
the above :—
                    o.     B.      8°.     x.    d0.      d..
   Br,           160       18     59-3    181  3-1883   2 9822
    IC1           162-5     18   101-5    2-22 3 1822   2-8812
   The values of x differ from the whole number 2 : the one is
smaller, the other greater, the mean being ;r=2*01. Where
x = 2 for each body the respective boiling-points would be
 76c,5 and 810-9, which lie close together ; and the two densi
ties d. and d'* would have been equal. I have calculated from
the dilatations observed by Thorpe, what the densities would
be at the calculated boiling-points : fhev are respectively
2-9244 and 2-9404.
   It appears, then, that there exist in the case of ihese sub
stances certain unknown causes which affect the boiling-
points, raising the one 190,4 and lowering the other 17°-5.
   The existence of such an influence in very many cases will
be strange to no one, for it has been suspected by many. It
is the new Law, however, that points most clearly to it.
   This also explains why the values of x, calculated from
observed boiling-points, do not always present themselves as
whole numbers, but are often affected by fractions, for
instance :—
   I have for valid reasons assumed that #=3 in the case of
the four following bodies (see above) :—
      C2H$S    .  .    a:=3-28.      CSHSS3 .  .   x=312.
      CsH6Se .    .    x= 3-05.      C2H,Te .  .   x=3-27.
   The experiments of Thorpe (loe. cit.) furnish yet another
example.

202                    M. J. A. Groshans on thi
         Properties of the Substances S2C12 and SOjClj.
   These two bodies have the same molecular weight, the
density-number is the same,= 12. The data are as follows:—
                    a.     B.     8°ob«.     xob«      d0.    d,.
   8,01,          135      12      1381      173    17094   1-4920
   SO,aa           135     12       69-9      120    17081  1-5602
                        Mean    .    .   x=l'i6.
   The boiling-points differ by 680-2, but the almost perfect
equality of the two densities d0 points to the equality of x;
and we may admit that the true mean value is x=l'5, which
gives 110°1 as the common boiling-point.
   In the two sets of cases that we nave examined above, it
appears that the disturbing cause does not operate till above
0°C, the values of d0 are the same in each pair. But this is
not always the case: for instance, in two isomers examined by
Thorpe (loc. cit.),
                     a.    B.     S°obs.    xobs.      d0.    d,.

   C,H4C),           99     14     59 9      2-86    1-2309 1 1092
               Mean      .   . a:=3-07.      «\/3 = 67-5.
   Such a disturbing influence on the boiling-points and
densities of liquids is of a nature to hinder the progress of
the study of the physical properties of substances.
        Compounds Liquid at the Ordinary Temperature.
   The best method of applying the law of density-numbers
to liquids is perhaps that based, as above, on the comparison
of the volumes at the boiling-points ; but the data necessary
for this comparison are but seldom available. When this is the
case, we are still able in very many cases to verify the density-
numbers simply by comparing together the values of d0 or dt
(t being the ordinary temperature 15° — 20°C.) of analogous
bodies, when the values of kt will exhibit an agreement more
or less complete.
   In Table XXIII. an example is given of the above. The
substances are arranged in the order of their boiling-points.
By thus employing corresponding temperatures (slightly
raised), it is possible to obtain satisfactory concordance in the
values of k. When t = 0 the constants kt arrange them

   I have thought it interesting to compare with the above six
compounds another, the formula of which resembles those of
the bodies in the table: this is ((CsH8)8Sn)2. Its properties
are as follows :—

A most complete agreement.
   The value of kt for liquids appears to depend on the value
of p and q in the general formula CpH8Or, for, as seen
above, the atoms of O, S, and of metals, appear to exercise no
influence. With regard to CI, Br, I, they play the part of so
many atoms of hydrogen: for instance, the three following
metallic ethers should be considered to contain 16 atoms of
hydrogen and not 15, for the constants kt are a little higher
than those of the compounds of As,-P, &c, given above.

These are the experiments of Cahours.
   I regret that space does not allow of my treating of cor
responding temperatures and of the relative expansion of
liquids, or of the application of this new Law to solutions.

               XXIV. Notices respecting New Books.
  Diary of a Magnetic Survey of a Portion of the Dominion of Canada,
     chiefly in the Nortli-western Territories, executed in the years
     1842-44. By Lieutenant LefboT, R.A., now General Sir J. H.
    LEFnor, C.B., K.C.M.O., F.B.S., $c.
 TTHE late Sir J. Herschel, in an article on " Terrestrial Magne-
        tism," which appeared in the ' Quarterly Review,' June 1840,
 strongly advocated the carrying out of Magnetic Surveys of the
 Colonies. The late Gen. Sir E. Sabine, then Major E.E., in
 November 1840 addressed a letter to Sir J. Herschel, as Chairman
 of the Committee of Physics of the Royal Society, referring to the
 ' Quarterly Review ' article, and containing proposals for a Mag
 netic Survey of the British Possessions in North America. The
 Committee laid this, and other letters on the subject, before the
 Council, with a strong recommendation that Government should be
 urged to have the proposed Survey executed. The Lords of the
 Treasury acceded to the proposal, and on July 20, 1842, Lieutenant,
 now General, Sir J. H. Lefroy, left England to take charge of
 the Observatory at Toronto, with the duty of carrying out the
 Magnetic Survey annexed.
    This duty was completed by the close of 1844, and the general
 results only having been embodied in Sabine's memoir "Contri
 butions to Terrestrial Magnetism " (Nos. 7 and 11, Phil. Trans. 1846,
 1872;, Sir J. H. Lefroy has been led by the renewed attention
 directed to the Distribution and Periodical Changes of the Earth's
Magnetism, to present the observations of his Survey with fuller
explanation and in a form more convenient for reference.
    A Preface of pp. xxii gives the correspondence, out of which the
 Survey originated, as well as other particulars ; concluding with some
remarks on the subject of local anomalies in Magnetic Elements,
reference being made, among other publications, to the recent
Report of the U.S. Coast Survey for 1881.
    Part L, pp. 58, is devoted to an account of the Instruments
employed, and a general description of the observations made with
them, followed by a discussion of the probable errors involved and
other connected matters. To this succeeds the Diary of "a
journey which was specially laid out for scientific work and almost
excluded sport or excitement of any kind," containing the records
of observations made from day to day between May 1843 and
November 1844. Starting from Montreal the observers' route was
up the Ottawa and down the French River to Lake Huron, along
the N. shore of Lake Superior to Fort William, by way of Lake of
the Woods, Lake Winnipeg, and Hill River to York Factory on
Hudson's Bay, thence by Lake Athabasca to Fort Chipewyan
(September 23), where the author "was warmly received by the late
Mr. Colin Campbell, and resided with him until March 4, 1844.
The arrival created a sensation in the small community, for it was
twelve years Bince any traveller had arrived by ranoe from the

                           Geological Society.                   205
south ; and the self-importance of his voyageurs, who had thus
happily completed a journey of 3600 miles, was conspicuous in
their gala attire and gay chansons as the landing was approached."
On the approach
Great Slave Lake to Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie River. At
daybreak on March 28 the temperature sank as low as — 41° F.,
and from the next day to May 25 Lieut. Lefroy remained at the
Fort, awaiting the break-up of the ice, when the boats started for
Fort Good Hope, lat. 66° 16' N., long. 128° 31' W. The return to
Lake Athabasca (30th June) was by the same route, but from
thence a de'tour was made up the Peace River to Fort Dunvegan, and
by the Lesser Slave Lake, to Edmonton, from which point the River
Saskatchewan was descended to Cumberland Harbour, reached on
August 29. Useful Tables, Charts, and an Index complete the
volume.
  These records of field-work patiently and perseveringly carried
out (a kind of work comparable in the labour involved with that of
the Geodesic or Geological Surveyor in a new country) are not, of
course, light reading, but are sufficiently interspersed with entries
of difficulties encountered and overcome, risks run, physical and
other features of the route observed, to impart much general
interest to the narrative. The name of the author will now be
inseparably associated with the few who have devoted themselves
to build up the existing store of knowledge on the subject which
has been secured for Science ; while " Mount Lefroy," round the
N.W. slopes of which the Canadian Pacific Railway will wind,
when completed, will worthily perpetuate that name on the scene
of those labours : "^Eternumque locus . . . nomen habebit"

rPHE following communications were read :—
     1. " On the so-called Diorite of Little Knott (Cumberland), with
further Remarks on the Occurrence of Picrites in Wales." By Prof.
T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., Pres. G.S.
   The Little Knott rock and its microscopic structure were briefly
described by the late Mr. Clifton Ward, who named it a diorite, but
called attention to its abnormal character. The author gave some
additional particulars, and showed that although the rock varies in
different parts of the same outcrop, and is not one of the most
typical representatives of the picrite group, its relations on the
whole are with this rather than with the true diorites. He also
called attention to the extraordinary number of boulders which have
been furnished by this comparatively small outcrop, and discussed
the relation of their distribution to the former extension and effects

2013                    Geological Society :—
of ioe in the Lake District. He briefly noticed the occurrence of
additional boulders of picrite in Anglesey, and described specimens
from two localities (Caemawr and Pengorphwysfa) where a similar
rock has been discovered in situ by Professor Hughes. Hence it is
probable that the Anglesey boulders are derived from localities in
that island, and not from Cumberland. From a re-examination of
specimens collected by the late Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Tawney,
preserved in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge, the author
showed that the rock must occur in situ in two localities in the Lleyn
peninsula, in the neighbourhood of Clynnog and of Aberdaron.
Lastly, he described a very remarkable picrite boulder, discovered
by Dr. Hicks, which rests on " Dimetian " rock at Porthlisky near
St. Davids.
   2. " Sketches of South-African Geology.—No. 2. A Sketch of the
Gold-Fields of the Transvaal, South Africa." By W. H. Penning,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The Gold- Fields of the Transvaal have been defined as covering
nearly all the eastern and northern districts of the State, though but
a small portion of the area is productive. In this paper the author
described only the Lydenburg and Do Kaap gold-fields, leaving those
of Pretoria and Marabastadt for a future communication. The
auriferous region is known to extend 350 miles to the northward
beyond the Limpopo river, so that the gold-bearing rocks are found
throughout at least 1\ degrees of latitude and 3 of longitude.
   The area of the two gold-fields mentioned, comprising together
about 3000 square miles, was defined; and the Author, after noticing
some old gold-workings, proceeded to give an account of the physical
features of the country. He especially called attention to the cir
cumstance that most of the rivers rise to the west of the highest
range, and flow eastward through it.
   The oldest gold-bearing rocks consist of unfossiliferous schists,
shales, cherts, and quartzites, classed by the author as Silurian.
Amongst these a great mass of coarse granitic rock is intruded, con
sisting of qnartz and felspar, with but little, if any, mica. This
granite, in the De Eaap valley, forms an ellipse 17 miles long by
10 broad, with a narrow northerly prolongation. Both the granite
and the stratified rock are traversed by intrusive dykes, chiefly of
diorite.
   These beds have been much disturbed, and then cut down, pro
bably by marine denudation, to a level plain 1700 or 1800 feet above
the sea. Upon them rest unconformably a great sequenco of con
glomerates, sandstones, and shales, the " Megaliesberg beds " of a
former paper, but now provisionally classed as Devonian. These
rocks also are traversed by dykes of diorite and other kinds of trap.
The " High Veldt beds " overlie the " Devonian " with some uncon
formity.
   Several sections and observations illustrative of these facta were
described, and details were given of the different gold-mines in each
of the great systems noticed, and also in alluvial deposit*. It was

        On some Erratics in the Boulder-clay of Cheshire.          207
shown that much gold was derived originally from veins in the older
or Silurian rocks, and that some of that met with in the newer
system occurred in conglomerates or other detrital beds. But there
are also gold-bearing quartz-veins intersecting the latter.
   3. " On some Erratics in the Boulder-clay of Cheshire &c, and
the Conditions of Climate they denote." By Charles Eicketts, M.D.,
F.G.S.
   The Author stated that the glacial phenomena of the valley of
the Mersey indicate that the country has been entirely covered with
ice and snow, resulting solely from the snowfall on its water-slopes
and those of the tributary valleys. The glacial striae coincide in
direction with that of the respective valleys, or are in direct con
nection with the contour of the ground. The bottoms of the valleys
are usually filled to some extent with irregularly stratified sands
and gravels, containing erratic pebbles from which all striae have
been removed, probably by currents of water holding sand in sus
pension. Above these there is a boulder-clay containing a larger
proportion of sand and gravel than the boulder-clay proper. The
flanks of the valleys are covered with unstratified sand or fragments
of sandstone derived from the Trias, probably left by glaciers as
submarine moraines. The whole is overlain by the true boulder-
clay, an unstratified reddish-brown clay containing erratios derived
from different and distant localities. This clay originated in the
grinding-action of the glaciers upon the neighbouring rocks, and was
carried out in the form of mud by subglacial streams of water. The
contained pebbles, many of which are smoothed, flattened, scratched,
and striated, were carried by and dropped from icebergB and floating
ice ; they are so abundant as to indicate that the bay of Liverpool
was densely packed with ice.
   The Author noticed the occurrence in these beds of masses of
contemporaneous sands, gravels, &c. caused by changes in the exten
sion of the glaciers, and described a large series of erratics derived
from granitic, volcanic, Silurian, Carboniferous, and other rocks
covered with striae and other glaoial markings, and also affording
evidence of subsequent exposure to weathering before they were
floated away and dropped into the clay. In connection with this
weathering of the boulders, the Author remarked that in the case of
the granitic and volcanic rocks the process differed greatly in degree^
extending in some granites to the separation of each individual
grain throughout the whole mass, and he called attention to the
occurrence in Ireland of fragments of disintegrated granite and trap
imbedded in moraines, eskers, and Boulder-clay, and to that of
Wastdale-Crag granite similarly decomposed in the moraine in the
neighbourhood of Shap, where also rocks of volcanic origin have
become weathered in the same way as some in the Boulder-clay of
Cheshire. Fragments of limestone also show traces of erosion,while
others have been split into two or more pieces since their glaciation,
phenomena also observed in moraine-accumulations in limestone-
districts. Similar phenomena occur in the case of slaty and other

208                      Geological Society :—
stratified rocks. Some limestone pebbles have been perforated by
Mollusca and other marine animals.
   The inference drawn by the Author from the facts recorded in his
paper is that these weathered boulders once formed portions of
moraines on land from which, for a time, the glaciers had receded,
and that, after a succession of seasons sufficient to disintegrate these
blocks more or less, an increased snowfall caused such an extension
of the glaciers that the blocks were carried down to the sea and
conveyed away in icebergs and by floating ice to the spots where
they are now imbedded. As they occur at different horizons there
must have been a repetition of the advance and retreat of the glaciers
such as now occurs in Greenland.

    The following communications were read :—
    1. " Note on the Sternal Apparatus in Iguanodon." By J. W.
Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    2. " The Lower Palaeozoic Bocks of the Neighbourhood of Haver
fordwest." By J. E. Marr, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., and T. Boberts,
Esq., B.A., F.G.8.
    The authors in this communication described the sequence of the
 Lower Palaeozoic rocks lying to the north of Haverfordwest and
 Narberth. Their work is founded on that published by the Geolo
 gical Surveyors in their maps, sections, and memoirs.
    To the north of the ridge of rock running eastward from Bock
 Castle, claimed as Archaean by Dr. Hicks, they have discovered
 Lingula Flags, with Olenus spinulosis, Wahl, and Agnostus pisi-
fortnis, Linn. These beds are seen underlain by conglomerate,
 resting upon older rocks, near Trefgarn Bridge.
    South of Dr. Hicks's Archasan ridge, a great fault brings beds of
 Bala age in juxtaposition with the rocks of the ridge ; hence, in the
 tract described, no rocks of Tremadoc and true Arenig age have been
 met with. In the area south of the ridge the rocks are thrown
 into a complex synclinal, with a complex anticlinal to the south-east,
 near the town of Narberth.
    The succession which the authors attempted to establish in this
 area is as follows (in ascending sequence) :—
    i. Didymograptus shales, with Munhisoni-lona Graptolites.
    ii. Llandeilo limestone, with Asaphus tgrannus, Murch. &c.
    iii. Dicranograptus shales, with Dicranograptus, Climaeograptus
 bicornis, Diplograptus foliaceus, &c, having a zone at the summit
 marked by the abundance of Orihis argentea, His.
    iv. Bobeston Wathen Limestone, with many corals and Brachio-
pods, and few Trilobites.
    v. Trinucleus-seticornis beds, characterized by abundance of
 Trinucleus seticomis, His., and ite variety T. Bucklandi. These are
subdivided into three stages, viz. :—(a) Sholeshook limestone, with
Cvstideans and an abundant Trilobite fauna, including Agnostus

             Lower Palaeozoic Rocks of Haverfordwest.               209
trinodus, Salt, Trinucleus seticornis, His., Styyina latifrons, Portl.,
Phillipsia parahola, Barr., Cheirurus parvus, Salt., Enci inurus sex-
eostatus, Salt., Phaeops Bronyniarti, Portl., &c
   (6) Eedhill beds, blue-grey shales, generally poor in fossils, but
containing here and there a fair abundance, especially of Phaeops
Bronyniarti, Portl., and Trinucleus Bucklandi, Barr., and many
Lamellibranchs and Gasteropods.
   (c) Slade beds, consisting of gritty green shales with calcareous
bands crowded with fossils. Glauconome disticha, Phyllopora Hisin*
geri, McCoy, Phaeops Bronyniarti, Portl., Trinucleus seticornis, His.,
Calymene trinucleiiux, Linn., Orthis testudinaria, Dalm., are abundant.
 Climacograptus, sp., also occurs.
   vi. Conglomerate, containing many quartz pebbles, succeeds the
beds of the Slade stage in many localities, and does not seem to
mark a great discordance, as the authors havo nowhere found it
resting on lower beds.
   vii. Lower Llandovery beds. Green gritty shales, with grit and
very fossiliferous calcareous bands, characterized especially by Nidu-
lites favus, Petraia subduplicata, var. crenulata, Stricklandinia
lirata, &c, and containing Phaeops elegans, Boeck and Sars, Phaeops
mucronatus, Ang., and Deiphon Forbesi, Barr.
   The authors attempted a correlation of the Haverfordwest rocks
with those of other areas :—
   Conglomerate and grit of Trefgarn        = Harlech ?
   Lingula Flags of Trefgarn &c.            =Dolgelly beds.
   Didymograptus shales                     =Llanvirn.
   Llandeilo Limestono                      = Lower Bala.
    Dicranograptus shales                    = Lower and Middle Bala.
   Bobeston Wathen Limestone                =Bala Limestone.
   Trinucleus-seticornis beds               = Upper Bala.
   Fossiliferous Lower Llandovery beds } — •'-l0wer ¦^¦aJr
   In conclusion the authors notice two points which require further
elucidation. The first is the separation of the Bobeston Wathen
and Sholeshook limestone. This is made on palseontological and
lithological grounds, as the whole thickness of the two limestones
had nowhere been met with in the same section. The second is the
relationship of the conglomerate to the fossiliferous Lower Llandovery
beds. In the only place where the two appear in juxtaposition the
conglomerate series appears to underlie the fossiliferous Llandovery
beds ; this the authors explained by a faulted overfold. These dif
ficulties do not, however, prevont the authors from hoping that the
sequence they have established will be of use in assisting to deter
mine the character of the very remarkable folds by which the district
has been affected.
   3. " On certain Fossiliferous Nodules and Fragments of Haematite
(sometimes Magnetite) from the (so-called) Permian Breccias of Lei
cestershire and South Derbyshire." By W. 8. Greslcy, Esq., F.G.S.
   In this paper tho author described certain pebbles of haematite

 and magnetite which occur in the so-called Permian breccias on the
western margin of the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Coalfield. These pebbles,
which are largely collected for sale and used as " burnishers," vary
in size from a diameter of A inch to the size of a man's fist. They
present many varieties of form, have sometimes an agate-like struc
ture, and occasionally exhibit well-marked magnetic polarity.
Sometimes they show grooving and striation resembling those pro
duced by ice-action, while at other times they seem to have been
crushed and recemented. Many of these pebbles contain fossils of
various kinds, chiefly plant- and insect-remains, but with a few of
Annelids, Mollusca and Fish. All the fossils are of Carboniferous
age.
   From the consideration of all the facts detailed in the paper, the
author concluded that these nodules were originally composed of
clay ironstone, and that they were derived from Carboniferous strata.
He considered that tho pseudomorphic action by which they have
acquired their present composition must have taken place in situ
since their inclusion in the breccia.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. "Supplementary Notes on the Deep Boring at Richmond,
Surroy." By Prof. John W. Judd, F.lt.S., Sec.G.S., and Collett
Homersham, Esq., F.G.S.
   Since the author's former communication to the Society on the
subject, this boring, in spite of the strenuous efforts made by the
Richmond Vestry and the contractors, Messrs. Docwra and Co., has
had to be abandoned, after reaching a total depth of 1447 feet from
the surface. This depth is 145 feet greater than that of any other
well in the London Basin, and, reckoning from Ordnance Datum,
reaches a lower level by 312 feet than any other well in the district.
   Before the termination of the work temperature-observations
were obtained, which, generally, confirm those previously arrived at.
   The strata in which the boring terminated consisted of tho red
and variegated sandstones and marls previously described, which
were proved to the depth of 208 feet. Although it was demon
strated that these beds have a dip of about 30°, complicated in
places by much false-bedding, no conclusive evidence could be
obtained concerning their geological age. They may be referred
either to some part of the Poikilitic series, or to the Carboniferous
(for similar strata have been found intercalated in the Carboniferous
series at Gayton, near Northampton), or they may be regarded as
of Old Red Sandstone age.
   Some interesting additional observations have been made since
the reading of the former paper, on the Cretaceous rocks passed
through in this well. Mr. W. Hill, F.G.S., of Hitchin, has found
the oxact analogue of the curious conglomerated chalk met with at
 a depth of 704 feel at Richmond. His observations entirely confirm

         Igneous and Associated fioeks of the Breidden Hills.          211
   the conclusion that we have at this depth the " Melbourne Rock "
   with the zone of Belemnites pUnus in a remanii condition at its
   base. Rome new facts concerning the state of preservation of the
   fossils in the Chalk Marl are also recorded.
       With respect to the conclusions arrived at by the author concern
   ing the distribution of the Jurassic rocks on the south side of the
   London Basin, an important piece of confirmatory evidence has been
   supplied by a deep boring made at the Dockyard-Extension Works
   at Chatham. This section, for the details of which the authors are
   indebted to the officers of the Geological Survey, shows that under
   the Chalk and Gault, with normal characters and thickness, there
   lie 41 feet of sandy strata of Neocomian age, and that these are
   directly underlain by blue clays of Middle Oxfordian age, as is
   proved by the numerous fossils which they have yielded. We have
   now, therefore, direct evidence of the existence and position of strata
   of Lower, Middle, and Upper Oolite age, respectively, beneath the
   Cretaceous rocks of the south-east of England.
      2. " On the Igneous and Associated Rocks of the Breidden Hills
  in East Montgomeryshire and West Shropshire." By W. W. Watts,
  Esq., F.G.S.
      The author, in this paper, described the succession of rocks in the
  small tract near the Breidden Hills situated between Welshpool and
  Shrewsbury. The Cambrian rocks are :—
      (1) Criggion Shales, dark and barren, much penetrated by in
  trusive diabases and about 2700 feet thick.
     (2) Andesitic lavas and ashes, followed by conglomerates of the
  same materials.
     (3) Ashy grits and shales containing Climacograpsus antiquus ?,
  C. bicornis ?, C. Scharenbergi, Cryptograpsus tricomis, Diplograpsun
 foliaceus, Leptograpsus flaccidus ?, Beyrichia complicate, Trinitcleus
 concentricus, Orthis testudinaria, Bdleroplion bilobatus. The rocks
 are thus of Bala age, the fossils indicating that the ashy grits and
 shales are on the horizon of the top of the Glenkiln or bottom of
 the Hartfell series.
     These are followed by Silurian strata.
     (1) Pentamerus-be&s. Soft sandstones and mudstones yielding
 Pentamerut giobosus ?, P. oblongus, P. undatus, Leptcena transver-
 salis, Strophomena rhomboidalis, Petraia subditplicata.
     (2) Purple shales, unfossiliferous.
     (3) Lower Wenlock Shale, with Monograptus vomerinus ?, Crypto
graphs, sp., M. priodon, var. Flemingi. These graduate into : —
    (4) Upper Wenlock Shale, with M. priodon, M. vomerinus ?,
 M. basilicus, M. Nilssoni, M. Rcerneri.
    (5) Lower Ludlow Shale. M. colonus, M. Nilssoni, M. Salweyi,
M. lintwardenensis.
    The paper concluded with microscopical descriptions of the igneous
rocks, of which there are two sets :—
    (1) An older set interbedded with the Cambrian and consisting of
andesites bearing a large percentage of a mineral allied to enstatite,

212                       Geological Society.
together with augite and a small quantity of hornblende and mica.
These are chiefly lavas, but some few are perhaps intrusive rocks
and dykes.
   (2) Intrusive rocks of a diabase type, generally, however, contain
ing a variety of enstatite identical with that in the andesites. These
are intrusive in the Cambrian rocks, and from their relations appear
to be most probably of Post-Silurian age.

   The " Curiosity Shop " is a locality on the River Rakaia in the

numerous fossils found in some calcareous sandstones cut through
by the river. The section exposed consists of
      1. River-gravels.
      2. Loose grey quartz sands.
      3. Soft calcareous sandstone with glauconite, passing downwards
            into tufaceons clay.
      4. Calcareous sandstone without glauconite.
      5. Loose grey or yellowish brown sands.
   By Mr. McKay, of the Geological Survey, No. 2 had been referred
to the Pareora series (Miocene?), No. 3 to the Upper Eocene series,
and Nos. 4 and 5 to the Cretaceo-Tertiary series. The author, who
was inclined to class all these beds in a single series, pointed out
that the only difference between the fossils found in Nos. 3 and 4,
the most important fossiliferous beds, consisted in the presence of a
greater number of forms in No. 3, all found in No. 4 being identical
with those in the overlying bed. He then gave a complete list of
the species of Vertebrata, Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Echinodermata,
Bryozoa, and Ccelenterata, from the locality, 48 in all, and compared
them with those from the Weka-pass stone, 26 in number, and the
Ototara fossils from Oamaru, to show that a large proportion were
identical. He gave reasons for not agreeing with the views of Dr.
Hestor and Mr. McKay, who held that unconformity exists between
the beds referred by them at the Curiosity Shop, in the Weka-pass
district, and north of Otago, to the Upper Eocene and Cretaceo-
Tertiary series respectively, and showed both from palseontological
and stratigraphical data that all these rocks must be included in
one system, the Oamaru system of Dr. von Haast and himself.

                   ON HYGROMETRY. BY M. JAMIN.
TVT MASCABT publishes every year, in the Annates du Bureau
         meteorologique de France, observations made in nearly one
hundred stations all over Prance, and the same is the case in all
European States. I have taken from them the pressure of the air
at the base and on the summit of the Fuy de Dome, and I now
desire to make a general remark on hygrometry.
   On looking at the tables of relative moisture, it is surprising to
see them so uniform. The means are almost the same in each
moment and at all stations. Thus we find at Clermont Ferrand,
at midday in the year 1880,
         February.     Judo.      August. September. October.
            693         599         570      569        622
   It is, however, clear that there are great differences in the hy-
grometric conditions of the months of February and August, and
that if these are not brought out in the tables it is, probably, that
the system adopted in reducing the observations is erroneous.
   This system consists in expressing the ratio ^ of the elastic
force observed / to the maximum force F, which air would have
at the same temperature if the air were saturated ; this is what is
called the relative moisture. But for any given air of constant
                               /      •
composition the quotient p varies : 1st, with the proportion of
vapour ; 2nd, with the height and the barometric pressure, since / is
proportional to this pressure ; 3rd, and more particularly, with the
temperature which changes the value of F ; it is then a function
of three independent variables ; and we may hope that it brings
out the variations in the quantity of vapour. We must for this
eliminate the disturbing influences of pressure, of height, and of
temperature, but that can easily be done.
   When chemists analyze air, they determine the quantities of
oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid ; to complete the analysis, it
would be logical to add the proportion of aqueous vapour. As
this vapour is a gas subject to the same laws of compression and
expansion as other gases, there is no reason to measure it other
wise.
   Let / be the tension of vapour, H the total pressure of the
atmosphere, H—/that of the dry air, we have
                    ¦ , .            „ t<l-293X0-622y

                Weight of dry air P' = "™^.

214            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
p- is accordingly the ratio of the weight of vapour to that of dry-
air ; it is independent of pressure and temperature, for/ and H—/
follow the same laws ; it expresses the hygrometric richness in
weight, and jj^yf measures its volume.
    It may be remarked that the observations do not directly give
the ratio ordinarily used, p.  f      In fact, the condensing hygro
meter measures /, which is a function of the pressure and there-
                                                      F-f
fore of the height ; the psychrometer determines            ; in order
to pass from the measurement made to the function p, a calcula
tion is made which serves no further purpose. By introducing
the denominator V, we just introduce iuto the tables disturbances
arising from the temperature which mask the influence of the
vapour and complicate the result. It is no more difficult to
calculate     f , and keep the result, than to calculate and retain
 f      . R~-f
j,; this would be replacing a complicated function, from which
nothing can be deduced by an exact gravimetrical or volumetrical
measurement of the hygrometric composition of the air.
   I propose therefore to suppress the relative moisture p in me
teorological tables, and to replace it by the hygrometric richness
   f       In order to justify this substitution, I may show the
effect by an example. I take the determinations made by
M. Alluard at Clermont Ferrand in 1880, and published in

    It will be at once seen from the last Table—
    (1) That the hygrometric richness increases from the morning
towards midday, or 3 o'clock, and then diminishes as the sun sinks
and during the night ; this arises from two causes, evaporation
during the day and the expansion of the air.
    (2) That the richness increases from January to July and
 August, and then decreases ; that it varies from 0*005 to O'OIS,
 that is to say, it is three or four times as much in summer as in
winter. We find in like manner that it increases in hot countries,
that it is greater even at Laghouat than in Marseilles; and we

must conclude therefore, with Dove, that there is less dry air in
summer than in winter in the northern hemisphere.
   (3) The hygrometric capacity of the air, that is the maximum
                                                    F
vapour which it can contain, is expressed by g_y • But accord
ing as we ascend, the temperature and F diminish, while on the
other hand H becomes less also. There are two inverse causes
of variation ; experiment proves that the capacity decreases but
very slowly. In like manner the richness is always a little less on
the summit than at the base of the Puy de Dome.
   (4) The last column of the table measures the total capacity
during the night when the temperature is lowest. It is in general
greater than the richness at 6 a.m. ; but it is sometimes smaller,
from which it may be inferred that the air is saturated at any
height when its temperature is a minimum. This explains all the
condensations of steam which generally take place in the night.
   In fine, the values of ji only tell us the relative degree of dry
ness or moisture ; they do not measure the quantity of vapour.
On the other hand, the ratio jj~^r gives the hygrometric compo
sition of the air ; it shows the changes which take place at day
and night, in summer and winter, at various altitudes and in
different latitudes.—Journal de Physique, vol. iii. p. 469.
  ON THE DEFORMATION OF THE LUMINOUS WAVE-SURFACE IN
            THE MAGNETIC FIELD. BY E. VON FLEISCHL.
    The results of this investigation are summed up by the author as
 follows :—
    1. That the wave-surface in the magnetic field has undoubtedly
 in general the form described by me of two surfaces of rotation
which intersect one another.
    2. That the form of these two surfaces differs to an extremely
 small extent from the spherical form ; but that notwithstanding
    3. The spherical form of both parts of the double surface which
 results from Verdet's law of the cosine, and which with this law is
 implicitly assumed in all previous inquiries, is only a faint approxi
 mation to the true form. And
    4. That the form of the wave-surface in the magnetic field is a
 double surface made up of two ellipsoids of rotation, which are so
 displaced in the direction of their greatest axes that they nearly
 coincide with each other.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 6, 1885.

ON A NEW METHOD FOB DETERMINING THE MECHANICAL EQUI
              VALENT OF HEAT. BY A. Q. WEBSTER.
   In 1867 Joule published the results of his experiments for deter
mining the mechanical equivalent of heat;, by means of observations
on the thermal effect of an electric current. In his experiments a
calorimeter was used holding over a gallon of water, the tempera
ture of which was taken by a thermometer. The method about to
be described differs from Joule's in that the temperature is measured
by the change of resistance of a wiro, which is heated by a current,
and no water is employed. The idea of the method was suggested
by Professor John Trowbridge. Accuracy is uot claimed for the
results which follow, as the experiments were undertaken only with
the view of ascertaining the practicability of the method.
   The method of conducting the experiments was as follows :—A
thin ribbon of steel, about 45 cm. in length and 1 mm. in breadth,
and weighing -23 gr., was included in one side of a Wheatstone's
bridge, by which its resistance was measured. It was then thrown
into another circuit, and a transient current from twelve large
Bunsen cells was passed through it. The quantity of electricity
transmitted was measured by a ballistic galvanometer, and the
difference of potential of the ends of the steel strip was compared
with the electromotive force of a Daniell's cell by means of a
quadrant-electrometer. The rise in temperature of the steel was
found by immediately measuring its resistance again. It had been
previously found, by a series of experiments made between the
temperatures of 90° and 10° C, that the resistance of the steel
used was represented by the equation
                         E = a (1 + -00503 0),
6 being the temperature.
   If then E0 be the initial resistance of the strip, and   the resist
ance after the passage of the current,
                           Ro=«(l-r/3 0o),

and the rise in temperature is

where a is the first swing of the needle of the ballistic galvanometer,
G the galvanometer constant, T the period of a single vibration of
the needle, and H the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
force. G was determined by comparison of the deflections on the
scale of the ballistic galvanometer with the readings of a tangent-
 galvanometer whose constant was calculated, included in the same
circuit. In the experiments, 2 sin? was considered as proportional
to S, the deflection on the scale, and the value of G for 2 = 1 cm.
was found to be 769*4. A shunt was used with the galvanometer,
so that the value of Q above given is to be multiplied by              1
r being the resistance of the galvanometer, and S that of the shunt.
   The arrangement of the apparatus was as follows :—
   B. The steel strip enclosed in a glass tube to protect it from
         draughts of air.
   W. Wheatetone's bridge.
   G,. Thompson astatic galvanometer.

   K,. Key in auxiliary circuit with commutator C, and a second
        coil of galvanometer Ga, for bringing the needle quickly to
        rest without heating strip E.
   The two galvanometers were arranged to throw their spots of
light on the same scale. The key K, was first depressed, E being
then in the bridge circuit, and the spot of G, was brought to zero
by adjusting the resistance c. a was always 1000 ohms, and b
one ohm. On K, being raised, a sufficient extra resistance was
inserted in c, so that when Ka was momentarily depressed, and K,
 was immediately afterwards again depressed, the spot G, did not
move. The hand soon became accustomed to pressing Ka just
long enough to accomplish this result. In the experiments, e had
to be increased from 1167 ohms by the amount of 50 ohms, and the

the resistance was measured almost simultaneously with the passage
of the current, the rise in temperature could be very exactly
known, and the effect of radiation could be very easily determined.
E, as measured by the electrometer, was about one volt, = 10"

galvanometer, was 3296 ohms ; 8„ the shunt, was 1025 ohms ; T,

resistance of the strip at 0°, was 1-072 ohm ; /3 was 00503, the

in resistance of the strip was "05 ohm, and 2, from 20 experiments,

   In Joule's experiments, the process of heating was continued for
nearly an hour, whereas here it lasts for less than a second. In
the former method, it was necessary that the current should remain
sensibly constant throughout the experiment, and the calorimeter
was radiating heat throughout that time. In the short time
required by the latter method, the radiation must be very small,
and the error from the inconstancy of the curent is avoided. I

        NEW FORM OF HYGROMETER. BY M. BOURBOUZE.
    When vapour begins to condense on a glass plate interposed
between the observer and the source of light, concentric rings begin
to appear at this point. They are like those seen round the cloud
 in foggy weather.
   The apparatus we have constructed to produce these rings con
sists of a small rectangular tube, with small holes on opposite faces
closed by very thin glass plates. A very delicate thermometer is
placed so as to dip in only a small quantity of the liquid. When
a current of air is produced in the liquid either by blowing or by
aspirating, a deposit of dew rapidly forms on the glass. If the
apparatus is placed between the eye and a point of light, concentric
rings are seen about this point, red outside and violet within. The
appearance of the rings as well as the reading of the thermometer
may be made from a distance by a telescope.— Comptes Bendus,

   The solution of the dry colloid is made up of two processes :—
1^1) hydration, which is attended with disengagement of heat;
and (2) solution, which is attended with absorption of heat.—

        ON A MERCURY-GALVANOMETER. BY G. LIPPMANN.
   A mercury-manometer is placed between the poles of a fixed
magnet, which lie right and left of its horizontal arm. The current
traverses the latter in a vertical direction parallel to the axis of the
tube, by which the mercury rises in one limb.
   If i is the strength of the current, H the strength of the mag
netic field, I the length of a small rectangular parallelopipedon in
the direction of the current, e its thickness in the direction of the
lines of force, the force which displaces the parallelopipedon is Hft,
and the pressure p=-1- = —
                         te    e
    Hence the sensitiveness increases with the strength of the mag
netic field and the thinness of the column of mercury. Accordingly
the lower bend of the manometer is replaced by a chamber filled
with mercury at right angles to the current, and only -Aj millim. in
thickness. —Comptes Bendiis, 1884, pp. 1256-57 ; Beibldtter der

  XXVII. Problems on the Distribution of Electric Current* in
    Networks of Conductors treated by the Method of Maxwell.
    By J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc. (Lond.), Fellow of St.
    John's College, Cambridge, Professor of Electrical Tech
    nology in University College, London*.
                         [Plates VL & VLL]
 §1. TF any number of points in a plane be joined together
        J- by linear conductors such as metallic wires, we
 have an arrangement of conductors which is called a Network.
 If at any point in the network a current of electricity be
 allowed to flow in and is drained off at some other point by
 conductors, called respectively the anode and kathode con
 ductor, then, after a short period, depending on the self and
 mutual induction coefficients of the various conductors, the
 total quantity of electricity arriving by the anode will distri
 bute itself throughout the network and settle down into a
steady flow. When this is the case there is a certain definite
difference of potential between the anode or source-point and
the kathode or sink-point, and there is also a certain definite
and constant strength of current in the anode conductor and
in every mesh or branch of the network. Call a and 7 the
potentials of these source- and sink-points, and x the strength
of the current in the anode lead, that is the whole quantity
of electricity flowing per second through the network, then
(y—a)/x measures the resistance of the network. We can
imagine the network replaced by a single linear conductor or
wire of such sort that if the anode and kathode conductors

are applied to its ends, the difference of potentials at the ends
of this simple conductor and the strength of the carrent flow
ing through it have the same numerical values 7, a, and x.
The resistance of this single conductor is then the same as
that of the complex network.
   The resistance of the network is obviously some function
of the resistances of the separate conductors or wires which
compose it, and is capable of being calculated from them.
Experimentally, the resistance of a complicated network would
best be determined by the measurement of the current-
strength in the anode lead and the difference of potential
between the source and the sink. Theoretically, it is in
teresting to examine the law of distribution of currents in a
network, and to reduce to a function of the separate resist
ances the total resistance of the whole network between any
two points.
    § 2. In his larger Treatise on Electricity, Glerk Maxwell
has treated the general case to determine the differences of
potentials and the currents in a linear system of n points con
nected together in pairs by ^ n(n— 1) linear conductors*, and
has shown how to form the linear equations, the solution of
which gives the condition of the network when given electro
motive forces acting along some or all of the branches have
established steady currents in them.
    The usual method of obtaining a solution for the distribu
tion of currents is the application of Ohm's law round the
 everal currents of the network, controlled by the condition
of continuity that there is no creation nor destruction of elec
tricity at the junctions.
    Since the publication of the first edition of his Treatise,
Maxwell reduced these two sets of equations to one set by
the simple device of regarding the real currents in the meshes
of the network as the differences of imaginary currents round
each cycle or mesh of the network, all directed in the same
direction, and thus obtained by the application of Ohm's law
a single set of linear equations, the solution of which gives
the required currents in each branch. Maxwell's method is
as follows f :—If we have p points in space and join them
together by lines, the least number of lines which will con-

and § 347.
   t This method was first given hy Clerk Maxwell in his last course of
University lectures. It is alluded to in the second edition of his larger
Treatise and in the Appendix of his smaller Treatise by their respective
editors, Mr. W. D. Niven and Professor Garnett, to whom it was com
municated by the present writer.

           Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.       223
nect all the points together is p — 1. If we add one line more
we make a closed circuit somewhere in the system ; that is
to say, a portion of space is enclosed and forms a cell cycle
or mesh. Every fresh line added then makes a fresh mesh;
and hence if there are I lines altogether joining » points, the
number of cycles or cells will be k = l— (p — 1). Now let
such a system of points and lines represent conducting wires
joining fixed points, and forming a conducting network. Let
a symbol be affixed to each point which represents the elec
trical potential at that point, and also a symbol affixed to
each line representing the electrical resistance of the con
 ductor represented by it. In such a diagram of conductors
the form is a matter of indifference so long as the connections
 are not disturbed and- lines are not made to cross unless the
 conductors they represent are in contact at that point.
     Consider a network, PI. VI. fig. 1, formed by joining nine
 points by thirteen conductors. Then there will be 13 — (9 — 1)
 = 5 cycles or cells. Now let an electromotive force E act in
 one branch B, and give rise to a distribution of currents in the
 network. Let «, /9, 7, 8, &c. represent the potentials at the
 points, and A, B, C, D, &c. the electrical resistances of the
 conductors joining these points, and imagine that round each
 cycle or circuit an imaginary current flows, all such currents
 flowing in the same direction.
     A circuit is considered to be circumnavigated positively
  when you walk or go round it so as to keep the boundary on
 your right hand. Hence, going round an area A in the di
  rection of the arrow is positive as regards the insido if you
  walk inside the boundary-line, and negative as regards ex
  ternal space B if you walk in the same direction round the
  outside. We shall consider a current, then, as positive when
  it flows round a cycle in the opposite direction to the hands
  of a watch. Returning then to the network, we consider that
  round each cycle flows an imaginary current in the positive
  direction. The real currents in the conductors are the
  differences of these in adjacent cycles or meshes, and the
  imaginary currents will necessarily fulfil the condition of con
  tinuity, because any point is merely a place through which
  imaginary currents flow, and at which therefore there can be
  no accumulation nor disappearance of electricity.
      Let x, y, z, &c. denote these imaginary like-directed cur
   rents. Then x—y denotes the real current in the branch I,
   and similarly x—z that in branch H. Then x, y, z, &c. may
  be called the cyclic symbols of these areas. The cyclic symbol
   of external space is taken as zero; hence the real current in
   branch B is simply x.
      Let an electromotor act on the branch B, bringing into
                                  B2

224         Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Distribution of
existence an electromotive force in that branch. Let the
internal resistance of the electromotor be included in the
quantity B, representing the resistance of the branch A. Then
apply Ohm's law to the cycle x formed by the conductors B,
I, H; we have            E-Bx=y-ct.
x is the actual current in this case flowing in the resistance B,
and the potential at the ends of B is equal to the effective
electromotive force acting in it less the product of the resist
ance of the conductor multiplied by the current flowing in it.
For the conductor I we have similarly
                        y—          y)I.
Hence x—y represents the actual current in I : it is the dif
ference of the imaginary currents flowing round the x and y
cycles in the positive direction. And for the conductor H
we have also            /3-a=(x-z)U..
Add together these three equations,
                      E =7 — a + Hx,
                      O=0-y + (x-y)l,
                      O=*-0 + (x-z)H. ;
and we have, as the result of going round the cycle x formed
of conductors B, I, and H,
                  E=x(B + l + R)-yI-zR                         (1)
a, /8, 7 have disappeared in virtue of these opposite signs.
   This equation (1) is called the equation of the x cycle; and
we see that it is formed by writing as coefficient of the cyclic
symbol x the sum of all the resistfinces which bound that cycle,
and subtracting the cyclic symbol of each neighbouring cycle
multiplied respectively by the common bounding resistance
as coefficient, and equating this result to the effective electro
motive force acting in the cycle, written as positive or nega
tive according as it acts with or against the imaginary current
in the cycle. This is Maxwell's rule.
   Since there are k cycles or meshes we can in this way form
k independent equations, and by the solution of these deter
mine the k independent variables, x, y, z, &c. The value of
the current in any branch is then obtained by simply taking
the difference of these variables belonging to the adjacent
meshes, of which the conductor or branch considered is the
 common boundary.
   § 3. Let us now consider the most general case possible, in
which we have a network composed of linear conductors suf
ficiently far apart to have no sensible mutual induction, and
let there be electromotive forces acting in each branch or

          Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.       225
conductor. Let the system be considered to have arrived at
the steady condition. Let x, y, z, &c. be the cyclic symbols
or measure of the imaginary current circulating counter
clockwise round each mesh. Let A, B, C, &c. (fig. 3) be the
resistances, and e\, e2, e3, &c. the electromotive forces acting
in each branch. These are reckoned positive when they tend
to force a current round the mesh counterclockwise, and
negative when they act in the opposite direction. Then the
equation to the x cycle will be
              x(A + J + L) —yj + Oz + Ow + Ow=ei.
The symbols of all the cycles are written down, putting in
those of z, u, and w with zero coefficients, as they are not
adjacent cycles to that of x. We shall have five equations
similar to the above for the other cycles, y, z, w, and u.
   Now it can very simply be shown from the theory of deter
minants, that if there are n linear equations of the type
           aix1 + atxi +                     <*n*n=Pv

 The only difference between the numerator and denominator
 is that the solution for xn is given by writing as numerator the
 determinant of the n equations having the column jd,, ps . . . pn
 substituted for its nth column, and then writing down as

   In this case the evaluation of these determinants is easy : a
simple symmetrical process of taking products, according
to the rule,
         a b c
         d e f        = (aei + bfg + cdh) — (ecg + bdi + afh) .
    § 4. The properties of determinants enable us, however,
 very easily to evaluate a numerical determinant of any order.
 The process consists in the gradual reduction of the determi
 nant in order by such transformations as will render all the
 elements of the first row or column zero except the first. The
 determinant is then reduced to the product of its leading
 elements and the corresponding minor. A repetition of this
 lowers the determinant one degree at each stage ; and finally,
 when it is resolved into a numerical two-row determinant, a
 simple cross multiplication gives its value.
    The process of evaluation of a numerical determinant is
 dependent on four principles :—
    (1) That the value of a determinant is not altered if rows
 are changed into columns.
    (2) The interchange of two rows or two columns reverses
 the sign of the determinant.

          Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.       227
   (3) If every constituent in any row or column be multiplied
by the same factor, then the determinant is multiplied by that
factor.
   (4) A determinant is not altered if we add to each consti
tuent of any row or column the corresponding constituents of
any other row or column multiplied respectively by an iden
tical factor, positive or negative.
   For example, suppose that the solution of a series of network
equations with numerical coefficients of resistance yield the
determinant
                           5 3 16
                           7 8 9 2
                           2 14 3'
                          10 7 5 7
we proceed to operate on this as follows :—Subtract the
second column from the first and write the remainder. As a
new first column we get
                           2 3 16
                         -18 9 2
                           114 3'
                           3 7 5 7
 Subtract the third row from the first and put the remainder
as a new first row. Also add the third row to the second for
a new second row, and we get
                           12-33
                           0 9 13 5

                           3 7 5 7
Again, subtract the first row from the third for a new third,
and subtract three times the first row from the fourth row for
 a new fourth row, and we have
                            12-33
                           0 9 13 5
                            0-170
                           0 1 14-2
 which is equivalent to the third order determinant
                            9 13 5
                          -17 0-

228         Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Distribution of
And a similar series of operations reduces this to
                            76     5
                            21 -2
which is equal to
                   -76x2-5x21 = -257.
   Accordingly a series of simple subtractions and multiplica
tions will effect the evaluation of any numerical determinant,
and enable us to solve a series of linear network equations for
the currents in all the branches when the numerical values of
the resistances of the conductors are given. The equations as
written above give as solutions the values of the cyclic sym
bols or imaginary currents round each mesh. To obtain the
actual current in any branch, we should have to obtain the
 values of the cyclic symbols or imaginary currents, for the
 adjacent meshes of which the given branch is a common
 boundary. Maxwell ingeniously saves labour in this opera
 tion by taking as the symbol for one mesh say x+y, and for
 an adjacent mesh y (fig. 4), and then the real current in the
branch AB is               x+y—y=x.
 And the simple rearrangement and solution of the network
 equation gives at once as value for x the current in the resists
 ance AB, which is the common partition of the two meshes.
    § 5. Returning now to the case when there is only one
 impressed electromotive force in one branch, we see that in
 forming the cycle equations only one will be equated to an
 electromotive force, viz. the equation for the mesh containing
 the impressed electromotive force in one of its branches. All
 the other equations will be equated to zero ; and accordingly
 the equation for the current in any conductor will be of the
 form                          EA„_,
 where A„ is a determinant of the nth order, and kn-\ is a first
 minor of this. Referring to fig. 1, wo see that, by writing
 down the five equations of the cycles x, y, z, u, w, we obtain
 equations by which to calculate the currents in any of the
 thirteen branches, and the current in branch B will be
 where A„ is the determinant formed of the coefficients of the
 five equations, and A„_i is the first minor corresponding to
 the coefficient of x in the equation of the .z-cycle.
    We also saw that if y and a are the potentials at the ends
 of the branch B.        E — B.r=y— «,

          Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.        229
Now consider that part of the network which remains if the
conductor B is removed, and let us imagine that a current n
continues to he forced into it at y and drained out at a ; the
total resistance of that part of the network, not counting B, is
                               y-u
but this is equal to             x
                               I-B.
                               x
Now since the resistance of B maybe anything, let it be zero;
then the total resistance of the network between 7 and a will be
                                    X
but

where the suffix and bracket denote that after the determi
nants are formed from the cycle equations, according to
 Maxwell's rule, then in them B is put equal to zero.
    If we denote the determinant of all the n-cycle equations
 under the condition of B = 0 by (/„, and by d„- , the first minor
 of this or the minor of its leading element corresponding to the
coefficient of x with the resistance of the circuit containing
 the effective electromotive force put equal to zero, we have
 for the total resistance E of the network between the points at
which the current enters and leaves, the expression
                             R= A.
                                 «n-l
    Since, then, as we have seen, the linear equations for the
 cycles can always be solved by evaluating the determinants,
 it follows that in all cases, no matter how complicated, the
 resistance of any network can be calculated by simple arith
 metic processes "from the given resistances of the branches or
 conductors which compose it. We have therefore an interest
 ing extension of Maxwell's method of calculating the currents
 in a network and the potentials at the junctions to a method
 of calculating the combined resistance of a number of con
 ductors forming a network ; which method consists, as seen
 above, in forming a certain determinant whose elements
 are formed of the separate resistances of the branches, and
 dividing this determinant by another of an order next below,
 viz. the first minor of its leading elements ; and we find
 that the resistance between any two points of any network
 of conductors, however complicated, is expressible as the
 quotient of a certain determinant by another formed from it.

230          Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Distribution of
    § 6. We shall proceed to illustrate this method by a few
examples.
    1. Find the resistance between the points 1 and 3 (fig. 5)
of a network consisting of five conductors, whose resistances
are A, B, C, D, E, joining four points, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    Connect 1 and 3 by an imaginary conductor of zero resist
ance, and having an electromotive force, e, supposed to act in
it. Let x, y, z denote the cycles or imaginary like-directed
currents in the three meshes so formed, and write down the
current equations, according to Maxwell, for these three
cycles :—
           (A + B)x       —Ay            —Bz        =e,
              -Ax + (A + E + D)#        -Ez         =0,
              -Bx        -Ey         + (B + C-E>=0.
Then, by what has been shown above, the resistance R be
tween the points 1 and 3 of the network is given by the
expression
                 (A + B),        -A,             -B
                   -A,       (A + E + D),        -E
                   -B,           -E,         (B+C + E)
     R =               -
                        (A + E + D,)     -E
                           -E,       (B + C + E)
    In dealing with numerical cases we need no longer intro
duce any notice of imaginary electromotive forces, but proceed
 according to the following rule.
    To determine the resistance of a network of conductors
 between any two points on the network. Join these two
 points by a line whose resistance is supposed zero, and give
 symbols to the meshes of the network so formed ; calling
 this additional mesh produced by the added zero conductor
 the added mesh. Then write down a determinant whose dexter
 diagonal has for elements the sum of the resistances which
 bound each mesh, beginning with the added mesh ; and for
 the other elements of each row the resistances which separate
 this mesh respectively from adjacent meshes, and having the
 minus sign prefixed, zeros being placed for elements corre
 sponding to nonadjacent meshes.
    More explicitly, if we denote by x, y, z, &c. the meshes,
 x being the added mesh, and by 2R,, 2B,, SB*, &c. the sum
 of the resistances which bound each cycle, then these will be
 the elements along the dexter diagonal of the determinant.

         Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.        231
And if x and y are adjacent meshes, and *R represents the
resistance of the common boundary, then — *R will be the
element in the #th row and vth column, and also in the yth
row and #th column ; but if x and z are nonadjacent meshes,
then 0 will be the element in the xth row and zih column, and
also in the 2th row and xth column. Having formed this
determinant, which we call the network determinant, we
divide it by the first minor of its leading element ; and the
quotient is the resistance of the network between the two
points, joined by the zero-conductor forming the added mesh.
It is seen that, owing to the mode of formation of the network
equations, the network determinant is a symmetrical deter
minant—that is, one half of the determinant is the reflection,
as it were, of the other half in the diagonal considered as a
mirror.
   § 7. As a means of comparing the results of this method
with other known results, let us take the exceedingly simple
case of three conductors joining two points in what is com
monly called multiple arc.
   Let 1, 2, and 3 (fig. 6) be the three conductors joining
two points A and B ; let their respective resistances be
ru ri) rs > then join A, B by a dotted line so as to make one
added mesh, and let the resistance of this added circuit be
zero. Then, without writing down the equations to the cycles,
we see that the network determinant is
                    ri        —ri           0
                   — rx      rx + rt       — r3
                    0          — r,      r3 + rs
The elements r1} r, + r2, r3 + r3 of the dexter diagonal are the
sums of the resistances which bound each mesh, x, y, and z,
taking the added mesh x first.
   The other elements of the first row are the resistances, with
minus sign prefixed, which separate the mesh x from mesh y
and mesh z ; or are common to x and y and x and z, viz. rx
and zero, because x and z are nonadjacent. And, similarly,
if m and n are any two meshes, then the element in the nth
row and mth column is the resistance separating or common
to the two meshes ; and the element in the nth row and mth
column is identical with that in the mth row and nth column :
zero being placed as an element if these meshes, m and n,
have no common boundary or circuit.
   The above determinant is easily evaluated. By adding the
first row to the second for a new second row, and this new
second row to the third for a new third row, we transform the

             Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Distribution of
determinant easily into
                              -r       0
                         0     r9 —r,
                         0     0       r,
which is equal to
   The first minor of the leading term of the network deter
minant is
                      rx + r2   — rt
                       — rt    rs + rt      -dn-\
which is equal to
and hence the resistance of the network between A and B i9
which is a known result. In these simple cases the above
general rule is, of course, a less easy method of finding the
combined resistance than the direct application of Kirchhoff's
corollaries of Ohm's law ; but whereas the general method is
alike applicable to the most complicated as well as to the most
simple cases, the simple direct method requires twice as many
equations, and does not determine the direction as well as
magnitude of the current in each branch.
    §8. As a simple numerical example we may take the case
of a crossed square of wires. Let 12 conductors join 9 points
 (fig. 7) so as to form a square divided into four squares, or a
 four-mesh network of conductors. Let the resistance of each
 branch, as ab, be unity. It is required to find the combined
 resistance between A and B. Number the meshes 1, 2, 3,
 4, 5 ; 1' being the added mesh formed by joining A B by a
 dotted line, making an additional fifth mesh, the resistance of
 this additional ideal conductor being zero. Then the network
 deternunant is
                    4      -1 -2 -1             0
                  -1          4-1         0-1
                  -2       -1      4     -1     0
                  -1          0-1         4    -1
                    0       -1     0     -1      4   =rf-

         Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.          233
   The dexter diagonal has for each element 4, viz. the sum of
the four resistances, each to unity, which form each mesh or
cell. And all the other figures, say, in the nth row, are the
resistances (with minus sign prefixed) separating the nth
mesh from all other meshes, zero being placed in the column
corresponding to any mesh which has no common conductor
or branch with this nth mesh. The order in which the columns
stand and also the rows correspond to the order in which the
meshes are numbered in fig. 7.
    The numerical value of this determinant is easily found to
be 288 = 3 x 96=d«. Now if we take the first minor of its
leading element, we get a determinant formed of the elements
included in the dotted rectangle ; and taking this as a separate
determinant and evaluating it, we have its value
                       (4-1 = 192 = 2x96;
 hence the resistance of the network between the points A
and B is
                       dn     288          .,
                      ^ = 192=1* units.
    § 9. One more simple numerical case may be taken and
 compared with the results of known methods.
    Let a hexagon of conductors be taken (fig. 8) having
 crossed diagonals all meeting in the centre. Let the resistance
 of each side, as ab, be unity, and also let the resistance of each
 semidiagonal, as Oa, be unity. Then required the combined
 resistance of this network of 12 conductors between the points
 A and B diametrically opposite. Join the points A and B by
 a dotted line of zero resistance, making an added mesh 1.
 Mark the other meshes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Then by forming the
 network equations it is easily seen that the network deter

The value of this last is 320.
   Hence the resistance of the network between the points A
and B is
                                ~ 320 ~ 5*
We can easily verify this resnlt in the above symmetrical case,
for the hexagonal framework in fig. 8 is traversed symme
trically by the current flowing through it ; and hence no
disturbance of the distribution of currents will take place by
separating it, as in fig. 9. We break the connection between
the semidiagonal conductors a, b and the mean diagonal A B,
whilst keeping them in contact with each other, the resistance
of each branch still remaining unity. It is then easily seen
that the hexagon so arranged must offer exactly the same
resistance between the points A and B as in its original form.
   Now the combined resistance of a, b, and /, each equal to
unity, between the points C, D is §, and the combined resist
ance of this with e and g in series is 2| ; and hence the total
resistance of the whole network between A and B is equal to
that of three conductors in multiple arc whoso resistances are
respectively 2§, 2, and 2§, which is equal to
                               1      _4
                         2§ T 2 ^ 2$
the same result as obtained above.
    These numerical examples show conclusively that, in cases
 in which the resistance of a network can be obtained by simple
 direct methods, the results coincide, as should be the case,
 with those obtained by the employment of the general method ;
 but at the same time the general method is capable of con
 ducting easily to a solution in the most unsymmetrical cases.
 The general rule will, for instance, just as easily give the
 determinants when the selected points between which the
 resistance is required are not symmetrically placed, but are,

           Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.      235
say, adjacent angles of the hexagon, in which case no such
simple direct method as employed above can be used.
    § 10. The following example will give a good illustration
of Maxwell's method of treating network problems, viz. the
case of Sir W. Thomson's resistance-balance for small resist
ances. In this arrangement (fig. 10) 9 conductors join 6
points and form 4 cells. B is the battery-circuit in which
operates an electromotive force E. Let the four cycle cur
rents be denoted by x+y, y, z, and w. These are the imagi
nary like-directed currents round the circuits, .and the real
currents in the branches are the differences of these.
    The problem is to determine the current in the galvano
meter branch G, and the relation of the resistances when this
current through G is zero. Let P, Q, S, T, R, r, D be respec
tively the resistances of the branches, and G tho resistance of
the galvanometer circuit, and B the resistance of the battery
circuit. Then x+y and y being the imaginary like-directed
 currents in the two adjacent meshes of which the galvanometer
 branch is the common boundary, then x+y—y=x is the
 current through the galvanometer.
    Proceeding to write down the cycle equations, according to
 Maxwell's rule, we have
              ( P + G + Q + njxTy - Qy - Qz - Ru> = 0,
                  {T + r+S + G)y-Gx~+y-Sz-rw=0,
                     (Q+S + DU-S^-Q^+^-Du>=0,
                 ( R + 0 + r + B) w - Ex+y - Oz - ry = E.
 Rearranging these equations and solving for x, we have the
  ollowing value :—
                            -Q + S,       D,   -D
                    E
                           T+S + r,     T + r, -r
                          P + Q + R,    P + Q, -R
 in which A is the determinant of the four equations in x, y,
 z, and w, and whose specific value does not concern us.
     This gives the current in the galvanometer-branch ; and if
 this is zero, then the determinant in the numerator of the equa
 tion giving x must be zero. Hence, when x is zero, we have
                        -Q + S,       D,     0
                        T + S + r, r + T, T      =0,

               Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Distribution of
  this determinant being derived from the one in the equation
  for x by adding the second and third columns for a new third
  column.
     This last determinant equation writes out into
                                            T, S
          (Q + S + D)                +D
                           P, R             P, Q
  Hence the condition that the current in the galvanometer-
 branch shall be zero is that both determinants in this expression
 shall be simultaneously zero, or
              T, r                        T, S
                        =0,      and                 = 0;
              P, R                        P, Q
 that is,                        r     1
                            p    R     Q'
 Hence this condition expresses the relation which must hold
 good between the magnitudes of the resistances T, P, Q, S, r,
 R, in order that the galvanometer-branch Ot may be conjugate
 to the battery-branch B.
    The above example shows well the symmetry of the method
 when dealing with a case of distribution of currents in a net
 work.
    § 11. As a final illustration, let us consider the case of a
circular wire A P B Q, with a diametral wire P Q across it.
    Take any two points A, B, at the extremities of a diameter
not coinciding with P Q, but separated by an angular distance
0 from it, and let us obtain the resistance of the circular wire
so crossed between the points A and B.
    Join the points A, B by a dotted line of zero resistance.
Call the three meshes so formed x, y, and z ; let r be the
radius of the circle ; and let p be the electrical resistance of
the wire per unit of length. Then the
                 Resistance of branch PQ = 2pr,
                                       AF=pr0,
                      „       „        AQ=p>iir-0),
and
           Resistance of branch BQ = resistance of AP,
                                  PB =              AQ.
Then the network determinant d„ is
                prv,        —pr(ir—0),    -0
             -pr{ir— 0),      pr(ir + 2), —pri

and therefore

The value of the minor of the leading element of the network
determinant, viz. <4-i» is
               ry{(7T + 2 )3-4} =rV>V(w+4).
Hence the resistance of the network between A and B, = R, is
                     -=*=rp          7r(7r+4)
                                  27r + 27r0-2^
                                       7T— 4
We can check this in the extreme cases when 0 = 0 or
                                                                25
When 0=0, the network-resistance is simply that of three
conductors whose resistances are 2pr, irpr, and irpr joined in
multiple arc, as in Plate VII. fig. 12, because PQ now coin-
cides with AB ; and this is simply rp^          ^.   It is seen at
once that the above value for R becomes this when 0 is put
equal to zero.    Now, when ^=^> the diameter PQ joins
points at equal potential (fig. 13) , and is not traversed by any
current at all ; and hence its removal will not affect the
resistance between the points A and B.
   Hence the resistance of the network simply reduces to that
of a circle measured at the ends of a diameter, or to two con
ductors of resistance trpr joined in multiple arc, and this is
equal to pr^-.     By putting 0=-^ in the general solution
for R above, we get it reduced to rp       ; and accordingly this

238         Dr. J. A. Fleming on tJie Distribution of
formula agrees, as it should do in these reduced cases, with the
results of the direct method based on first principles. If a
value of 6 be found which will make the expression
                           27T+27T0-202
equal to tt + 4, then for such a position of the diameter AB
relatively to PQ the resistance of the circle and its diagonal
 PQ would be exactly equal to the resistance of half the dia
 metral wire or to its radius, assuming both the circle and
 diagonal to be made of wire of equal conductivity per unit of
 length. To find the value of 6 for which this is the case, we
 have to solve the quadratic
                      2?r+ 271-0-20* = ^ + 4.
.If we put 6=            where x° is the number of degrees equi
 valent to the angle 6, we find, as a solution for this quadratic,
 that the positive root is nearly
                             171°- 804.
 Now 3 radians, or 3 unit-angles in circular measure, are nearly
                              171°-887.
 Hence, for a position of the diagonal PQ as in fig. 14, when
 the arc AP is nearly equal to tt— 3, or to the fractional part
 of tt, the resistance of the circle and diagonal PQ measured
 between the points A, B is very nearly equal to that of half the
 diagonal PQ; or, which is the same thing, the resistance of PQ
 alone is nearly double the combined resistance of the circle and
  diagonal measured between the points A and B at the extremity
  of a diameter removed 171o-804 from PQ.
     § 12. A small practical application of this last example may
 be made in constructing a variable resistance.
     Let PAQB (fig. 15) be a narrow circular canal cut in a slab
  of wood or ebonite and filled with mercury. Let PDQ be a
  bent copper wire balanced on a pivot CD, and having its ends
  P and Q dipping in the trough at opposite extremities of a
  diameter of the circular trough PAQB.
     The total resistance between any two points A and B in the
  trough, which are also diametrically opposite, can be varied
  within limits by changing the position of PQ relatively to AB.
     When PQ is turned so that it is at right angles to the dia
  meter AB, it does not affect the total resistance between A
  and B, and may be removed. The resistance is then just that
  of the circular band of mercury taken at opposite extremities
  of its diameter. When PQ is coincident with AB it reduces
  the resistance, and in intermediate positions the joint resistance

          Electric Currents in Networks of Condtictors.      239
of trough and diagonal wire is intermediate between the greatest
and least when it is in position removed either 90° or 0° from
AB.
   By using a circular glass canal filled with sulphate-of-zinc
solution, and a zino diagonal electrode and amalgamated-zinc
electrodes at A and B, a variable resistance may be constructed
capable of being varied over considerable ranges perfectly
gradually and with no imperfect contacts.
   § 13. Having illustrated, by the foregoing examples, the
methods of calculating both the currents in and resistances of
networks of any complexity, we return for a moment to some
general considerations.
   Consider a function formed of the sum of each separate
resistance in a network multiplied by the square of the current
strength flowing through it. This expresses the heat gene
rated per second in the whole network by that distribution of
current. This is called the Dissipation Function of the net
work. It represents the rate at which energy is being trans
formed into heat or rendered unavailable.
   Write down the dissipation function for the network in
fig. 1. Call it H. Then
    H = Bar2 + lx -tf + Ex^7 + Cy3 + Lz -y1 + A/ + J« -y2
         + K^? + (D + E)wa + (F + G)w2 + Mu^?.
Now the cycle equation for the cycle or mesh y is, by Max
well's rale,
               ( C + 1 + L + J )y - he - Lz - Ju = 0,
which is the same as
                 Cy-~lx—y — Lz —y—Ju —y=0.
And this is at once seen to be identically the same as the first
partial differential of the dissipation function with respect to
the cyclic symbol y, or is the same as
                                2 By
where B represents partial differentiation ; and by writing
down the other cycle equations for each cyclic symbol or
imaginary current, x, y, z, &c, we can show that these cur
rent-equations are respectively
                    ,BH       ,BH       ,3H
                                                   S2

240          Dr. J. A. Fleming on the Distribution of
each equated to the effective electromotive force in that cycle
or mesh.
    Let us assume now that x is constant, but that y, z, u, w, &c.
are independent variables and are arbitrarily changed. This
is equivalent to supposing that a given quantity of electricity
per second is pushed into the network, but that its distribution
is supposed to be varied. We see that the equations which
we write down, according to Maxwell, to determine the real
distribution of currents in the network, according to Ohm's
law, are the same equations as would be written down to find
the values of y, z, u, w, &c., which make the dissipation func
tion a minimum under fixed conditions of total current flow
 ing into the network, viz. equating to zero the first partial
differentials of H with respect to the variables y, z, u, &c.
 The same holds good generally, hence we see that this is
another way of arriving at the theorem of which Maxwell has
 given a proof on page 375, § 284, vol. i. of his large Treatise,
 2nd edition, viz.:—" In any system of conductors in which
 there are no internal electromotive forces the heat generated
 by currents distributed in accordance with Ohm's law is less
than if the currents had been distributed in any other manner
 consistent with the actual conditions of supply and outflow of
the current."
    The exact proof that the partial differentials of the dissipa
 tion function equated to zero gives the condition that the dis
 sipation function shall be a minimum is not complete without
 an examination of Lagrange's conditions. It is obvious that
 the second partial differentials of the dissipation function are
 quantities which are resistances, viz. the coefficients of the
 current symbols in the cycle equations, and that the conditions
 for a minimum are complied with, since                          are posi
 tive ; and the discriminant of the quadratic function of the
 currents or symmetrical determinants formed of these second
 partial differentials is what has been called above the network
 determinant. This and all its successive minors are positive
 quantities*.
     § 14. In the foregoing sections the problems have been
 treated under the limitations that the various meshes of the
 network of conductors have no mutual and no self-induction.

 considerable way the treatment of the problem ; and the dis-

tribution of the currents in, and the resistance of, the network
will be affected by them during the time taken by the cur
rents to become steady.
   In those pages of his Treatise in which Clerk Maxwell
worked out his splendid dynamical theory of electromagnetism,
he starts with the explanation of the methods Lagrange and
Hamilton employed to bring pure dynamics under the power
of analysis, and the results of Lagrange are embodied in the
equation
                          X=-
                               dt fa     da?
in which X is the impressed force tending to increase the
variable x, and T denotes the visible energy of the system of
bodies at that instant.
   This equation establishes a relation between the kinetic
energy of a material system at any instant, the force im
pressed upon it in a certain direction, and a quantity called a
variable, which expresses the state or condition of the system
with respect to that direction. Maxwell, by a process of ex
traordinary ingenuity, extended this reasoning from materio-
motive forces, masses, velocities, and kinetic energies of gross
matter to the electromotive forces, quantities, currents, and
electrokinetic energies of electrical matter, and in so doing
obtained a similar equation of great generality for attacking
electrical problems.
   In the electrical problem the variables are the quantities of
electricity x, y, z, &c. which have from the beginning of the
epoch flowed past any points, and the analogues of the velo
cities are the fluxes of these, x, y, z, &c, or the currents.
   The electrokinetic energy is measured by the quadratic
expression
           T=^L1a?? + iLJa!aa+ . . . M12XiX3 + , &c,
where the coefficients Lj, L2, M12 are functions of the geome
trical variables, but into which the electrical variables do not
enter.
   If now, as before, xly x3 represent the imaginary like-directed
currents round each mesh of a network, in which currents
are beginning to flow, then
                         dT      , dT .

    If E is the impressed electromotive force in the circuit or
mesh arising from some cause, battery, thermopile, dynamo
machine, &c, which would produce a current independently
of magneto-induction, then, if R be the total resistance
round the mesh, and x the cyclic current, Rx> is the electro
motive force required to overcome the resistance of the circuit,
and E - Rr is the electromotive force available for changing
the electric momentum of the circuit.
   Accordingly, by Lagrange's equation,
where T is the electrokinetic energy. As T does not contain x,
that is to say it is a function of currents, not quantities, the
 last term disappears, and we have
                          E — Rr    x
                                   * ax

                            at dx
    The electromotive force is therefore expended in two
things : first, overcoming the resistance R ; and, secondly,
increasing the electromagnetic momentum p. Now if there
 is no electromagnetic momentum, we have seen that the
cyclic equations are of the form
 where H is the dissipation function of the system, and E' is
 the acting electromotive force concerned in overcoming the
 resistance of the circuit.
    If, then, we substitute for Rx in equation         we have
                                                  dx

motive force are known. We shall proceed to apply it to the
solution of some network problems, in which the self and
mutual induction of the branches is taken into account to
determine the distribution of currents and combined resistance
at any instant during the variable state.
   § 15. Consider, first, the case of a galvanometer with a
coefficient of self-induction L and resistance G, and shunted
by a shunt of resistance S, but wound so as to have no co
efficient of self-induction, and let the shunt and galvanometer-
coils be so far removed that there is no coefficient of mutual
induction. This is the ordinary practical case.
   Let a battery be joined up and let the battery and connec
tions have a resistance B and electromotive force E (see fig. 16) .
   We have then a two-mesh network. Call the current in
the galvanometer- and shunt mesh y and the current in the
shunt and battery mesh x+y. Then the current through
the galvonometer is y, the current through the shunt is x, and
the current through the battery is x+y.
   The dissipation function H is
                     BaT+y+S^ + Gy^H,
which may be written
            B + S aT+^ + ff+S y»-2S ^+yy=H;
and the electromagnetic energy is
                            W = T.
Hence, by the general equation,
                       dt dy       dy      '
we have the two cycle equations for the y and x+y cycles,

   § 16. Consider now the combined resistance of the galva
nometer and shunt at any instant.
   The self-induction of the galvanometer acts like a spurious
resistance during the commencement of the current and drags
out or prolongs the rise of current in the galvanometer-coils ;
accordingly, during this period the combined resistance is a
function of the time t from the commencement of the flow.
   To calculate the combined resistance of galvanometer and
shunt at any instant, we proceed as in the cases above exem
plified. Form the cycle equations

determinant by its first minor, viz.

We have now to see what is the meaning of G + L^r as an
operator in a determinant.
   If we consider the formation of a current in a circuit of
resistance R and coefficient of self-induction L by an electro
motive force E, we have the equation for the current i
                          L~ + Rt=E.

under the conditions t = 0, i=0, and <= oo, t = g, is
                              (l-e-l')
                        i=E^_i.
Comparing these two expressions for t together, we have
                      «~        (,-ri.y
Hence we may substitute in the expression for the combined
resistance of galvanometer and shunt for L^+G,
                                G
and we have as a result,

We see that when t=0, R=S, and when t= <x, R=q.+ g-
Hence the result shows that at the first instant of starting a
current through a shunted galvanometer, when the shunt
has no self-induction and the galvanometer a considerable
one, the galvanometer behaves as if it had a high spurious
resistance, which in time dies away, allowing the total current,
after an infinite time, to be divided between the galvanometer
and the shunt in the ratio of r. • a to ar—

   § 17. We may apply the same methods to the examination
of the case when the current sent through the shunted galva
nometer is not generated by a source of constant electromotive
force, but is a discharge from a condenser.
   Let K (fig. 17) be a condenser connected up with a shunted
galvanometer, so that when the key k is pressed a discharge
passes through the galvanometer and shunt. Call the two
cycles x and y. Let Gr be the galvanometer-resistance and S
the shunt, and let Lx and L2 be their respective coefficients of
self-induction ; the coefficient of mutual induction being zero.
    Let q be the quantity of electricity in the condenser at any
instant t. Counting the time from the instant of commencing
the discharge, let C be the capacity of the condenser, and let
qt and q3 be the quantities of electricity which have, since the
beginning of the epoch, flowed respectively through the gal
 vanometer and the shunt.
    If T be the energy function and F the dissipation function,
 we have, as above, the fundamental equations
                   2T=Ly-rL,(tf-y)s,
 and
                  2F=(y + S(*-y)2;

Now the left-hand side of the equation is zero because quan

the sum of these is zero.     Again, 1 (x—y)dt and I ydt re-

or
that is, the total quantity of the discharge is divided between
the two circuits inversely as their resistances. We see there
fore that self-induction does not affect the ratio of division of
a discharge in a divided circuit, provided that no external
work, such as the moving of magnets or circuits conveying
currents, absorbs current energy. Hence, if a ballistic gal
vanometer is shunted and a discharge sent through it, if the
needle has sufficient moment of inertia and the discharge is
sufficiently short, so that the needle has not perceptibly moved
from its position before the discharge is over, then the whole
quantity of electricity is divided between the galvanometer
and the shunt in the inverse ratio of their resistances.
    § 18. To complete the solution we have to calculate the
current flowing through the galvanometer and shunt at any
instant.

  This equation gives us a value of y or the current through

 quantity left in the condenser at that instant. The above

    This linear differential equation is solved when we know
 the roots of the auxiliary biquadratic; and according as they
 are all real or partly imaginary, so will be the nature of the
 solution.
    If the roots are all real the solution is a sum of exponentials,
 whose total value first increases and then dies away as t
 increases, indicating that the discharge produces a wave of
 electricity through the galvanometer always in one direction;
 but if two or all of the roots of the auxiliary biquadratic are
 unreal, it indicates as the form of solution a function of sines
 and cosines which will have periodic values, and points to the
 fact that the discharge is a series of alternations. The general
 case, when both the galvanometer and shunt have coefficients
 of self-induction, when treated to determine the conditions for
 an oscillating discharge, leads to an expression of considerable
 complexity and not much practical use. The reduced case, in
 which the galvanometer is wound to have self-induction and
 the shunt so as to have no coefficient of self-induction, is,
 however, a practical case, and can be treated without much
 difficulty.

 writing in it L4=0, we have

    Join up a and /3 coils in series with a galvanometer, and
join up y and 8 coils in multiple arc with a battery, as shown
in fig. 18.
    Place the coils in position.
    Let S and R be resistances of the primaries 7 and 8 ; let ^
be resistance of the two secondaries and of the galvanometer.
    Let Li, L2, Ni, N2 be the coefficients of self-induction of
the coils, and Mj, M2 the coefficients of mutual induction of
a and 7, /8 and 8. Let T be the coefficient of self-induction
of the galvanometer.
    Call x the cycle current of 7, y that of 8, and z that of the
circuit formed of a, /S, and the galvanometer.
    The kinetic energy T of the system is
        2T= .z^ + «M,+ s2 (Li + L, + T) +fXt + 2y*M2)
and the dissipation function F is
    Then, by the formula
                             E= - — 1 I—

                 *M1+yM,-*(L1 + Ll+r) + 2Q=0.
    Now x—y is the current through the battery; hence if we
put x+y for x in the above, we shall get x as the battery-
current. Hence, making the change, we have
 gave this method of obtaining the equation for the currents in a network
 of conduction. In the last lecture of all he applied the method to cases in
 which self and mutual induction was taken into account, and gave the two
 illustrations in § 19. At the conclusion of this lecture he had ended his
 professorial duties for the term, and a melancholy interest attaches to the
subject which occupied his mind on the last occasion on which, uncon
 sciously to himself or his pupils, he was to perform them. Those who
 enjoyed even for a brief period the privilege of being taught by him, ever
 cherish a vivid remembrance of the intellectual treat afforded by Professor
 Maxwell's lecture-teaching, and the profound suggestiveness and interest
 of it.
    The two examples in § 19 and § 20 are taken from my notes of Prof.
 Maxwell's lectures, with some little alterations to make them clearer.

   § 20. Theorem.—To determine the capacity of a condenser
by means of a Wheatstone's bridge (fig. 19).
   Let a, /3, 7, 8 be the four points of a Wheatstone's bridge;
and let the branch between a and /9 be interrupted at a b, and
a Leyden jar or condenser inserted provided with some rapid
commutator, such as a tuning-fork, so that whilst the outside
of the jar is kept permanently attached to /8, the inside is
alternately joined to a and b.
   If a tuning-fork is used and its prongs have small metal
styles which just come down to the surface of the mercury in
two little cups, when the fork vibrates, as the prongs come
together, the upper point dips in; and as they separate, the
lower one dips in ; hence the shank of the fork is alternately
connected with one and the other cup. The interval between
the time of connection being exactly half the time of a com
plete oscillation of the fork.
   Now let the meshes of the network be called x + z, z, andy;

           Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.          255
 then x is the current through the galvanometer, and y is the
 current through the battery. When the arrangement is made
 as in the diagram, and the fork set vibrating, the vibrating
 fork and the condenser act together like a resistance, and let
 through so much electricity per second.
    Now, as the condenser gets its charge by electricity flowing
 into it, it builds up an opposing electromotive force in the z
 circuit which at any instant is equal to the value ofJf^, where
                                                          K
 K is the capacity of the jar, the integral being integrated from
 the instant when the charging commences up to the instant
 considered. Now, if the fork makes n vibrations a second
when the steady state is set up, the current z which flows into
                                                 Z
the jar has a mean value z; and therefore           is the opposing
 electromotive force in that branch.
   Accordingly, the condenser and associated commutator
 behave like a voltameter inserted in the branch aft, or like a
 resistance with a counter electromotive force in it. Only such
a combined jar and fork differs from an ordinary metallic
resistance in this, that its apparent resistance is not constant,
but depends on two things, the speed of commutation or
charge and recharge, and the capacity of the condenser; whilst
the counter electromotive force depends on the current z, and,
                          Z a
being represented by          is dependent not only on n and K,
but also on the values of all the other resistances in the branches.
In the first place, we require an expression for the electro
motive force charging the condenser. Let the difference of
potential between a and b be called e. Then consider the net
work formed by the five conductors R, S, Q, G, and B with
the electromotive force in the branch B; write down the net
work equations for this z mesh network.
                    (B + R+S)#-S(.* + z) =E,
                    -Sy+(Q + S+G)(* + z)=0.
   Hence
                        E(Q + S + G)
and
                           ES
where 8= the determinant

which is
                 S(Q + G) + (R + B)(Q + S + G).
    Now the difference of potential e between a and b when the
condenser is just beginning to be charged is
          _ ESG ER(Q + S + G)
         e~ S +               8

                             Q + S + G, -S
                     e=E
    Now if the electromotive force e be employed n times in a
 second to charge a jar of capacity K, the average current
flowing into the jar is nKe=z.
    Now to find z we have to consider the distribution of cur
rents when the fork or commutator is in operation, and the
condenser allowing a flow of electricity to take place through it.
    Let P be the resistance which could equivalentlj' replace
the jar and fork—that is, would allow an equal quantity of
electricity to pass per second ; then, since      is the opposing
electromotive force in this branch, we have the following
equation for the three cycles x, x + z, and y:—
              -S* + (R+S + B)y-(R+S)2 = E,
             -G*-Ry+(P + R>=-^,
              (Q + S + G)*- By + (Q + S>=0.
    Now let A stand for the determinant
                -S,         R + S + B, -(R+S)
                -G,         -R,        P+-^+R

   Then the solution of the above equations for z and x are

   Now insert this value for PH—\? in the determinant A
                                    nK
above and calculate its value, and we arrive at the expression
      A {B(Q + S) + Q(R+S)}{G(R + S) + R(Q + S)|
      a                           g
We have now, by substitution of this value of A in the value
obtained above for z, an expression for the value of the average
current through the condenser when the bridge is balanced,
and it is
                       ESi -G,          -R

    Equating this to the other value for z, namely,
                                 -G,        -R I
         «=itKe=nKE             Q + S + G,  -S
                         S(Q + G) + (R+B){Q + S + G}
we have
                 S{S(Q + G) + (R+B)(Q + S + G)}
   nK= { B(Q + S) + Q(R + S) } { G( B + S) + R(Q + S) }'
which gives us a value for nK in terms of
                         B, Q, R, S, G.

258        Electric Currents in Networks of Conductors.
   Now it is interesting to note that we may otherwise write
the above expression for nK,
                                  nK " 8 '
where A is the determinant,

and -rr is of the dimensions of a resistance.
      nK
   The value for nK writes out by a simple transformation into
another form,
nK=                 S{1~(Q + S + GKR + B4S)}
         RQ{1+ Q(R+B + S)} {1 + R(Q + S + G)}
 which is the form in which it is given by Prof. J. J. Thomson
 in bis paper, and quoted by Mr. R. T. Glazebrook in his
 memoir on a Method of Measuring the Capacity of a
 Condenser*.
    The above examples are amply sufficient to exemplify this
 method of treating problems in networks of conductors, and
 show how it enables calculations to be made with considerable
 ease, not only of the distribution of currents and potentials,
 but of the resistances between any points on a network, the
 branches of which consist either of simple resistances or of
 wires having self- and mutual induction with other branches,
 or of electromagnets, or condensers associated with appropriate
 commutators.
   • This method of Maxwell's, of obtaining the capacity of a condenser has
 been practically employed, with most excellent results, by Mr. R. T.
 Glazebrook, F.K.S. ; and the full details of the tests to which he subjected
 the method are given in his paper in the ' Proceedings of the Physical
 Society,' vol. vi. part iii. p. 204 (June 28, 1884). [Phil. Mag. for August

XXVIII. The Periodic Law, as Illustrated by certain Physical
   Properties of Organic Compounds.—Part I. The Alkyl
   Compounds of the Elements. By Thomas Caknelley,
   D.Sc, Professor of Chemistry in University College, Dundee*.
IN a previous communication (Phil. Mag. [5] xviii.p. 1) I
      have shown how the truth of the Periodic Law may be
illustrated by means of the melting- and boiling-points and
heats of formation of the normal halogen compounds of the
elements. I shall now endeavour to show how the same law
is further confirmed in a similar manner by the physical pro
perties of certain compounds of Organic Chemistry. For this
purpose we shall make use of the normal alkyl compounds
(methides, ethides, propides, &c.) of the elements ; and in the
sequel we shall find that exactly the same relations hold good
with these compounds as in the case of the corresponding
chlorides, bromides, and iodides.
   As the melting-points and heats of formation of but very
few of these compounds have been determined, we shall neces
sarily be limited to a consideration of the boiling-points and
specific gravities.
   As pointed out by MendeljefF (Ann. Chem. Pharm. Suppl.
1872, p. 151), elements belonging to even series (except
series 2) do not combine with alcohol radicals to form methides,
ethides, &c, whilst those belonging to odd series generally do
so combine. In what follows, therefore, we shall merely be
able to take into consideration elements belonging to odd
series and to the first even series only.
   Table I. contains the experimental data, with the authorities,
on which our conclusions are based. For the purpose of
avoiding minus signs, all temperatures are reckoned from the
absolute zero ( — 273°). The specific gravities employed were
those corresponding as nearly as possible to 15° C; but it
was not possible to take them all at a uniform temperature
throughout, as in many instances there is only one determi
nation on record, and that was made at different temperatures
in the several cases ; whilst scarcely any of them have been
determined at, or equally distant from, the boiling-point. The
following abbreviations are employed :—Me = methyl, CH8 ;
Et = ethyl, C2HS ; Pr = normal propyl, C3H7 ; Bu = normal
butyl, C4ti, ; Ph = phenyl, C6H5.

   Relation 1. (a) 1/ the elements be arranged in the order
of their atomic weights, then the boiling-points of their alkyl
compounds rise and fall periodically, (b) Under similar con
ditions, the specific gravities diminish up to the middle member
and then increase to the last member of each series. (See Table II.)
   The exceptions to this rule, in the case of the boiling-points,
occur either at or near the maxima or minima (i. e. at the

    262             Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law.
    turning-points) of Meyer's curve of the elements {Mod. Theor.
    der Chem.), in which respect they resemble those correspond
    ing halogen compounds of the elements which are exceptions
    to the same rule.

        propides,         of the elements of the seventh or halogen group and

         differences as regards the specific gravities diminish algebraically
        from methides to butides. (See Table VIII.) Whilst as regards
          (be boiling-points of the second group, the first part of the
          rule (a) seems to hold good, except in so far as a tendency to
         a reversal of the rule appears as we approach the butides and
         higher alkyl compounds ; and this reversal becomes the more
         pronounced the groater the difference in the atomic weights of
         the metal and the halogen. Data are entirely wanting for

   For the reasons stated in my former paper (ibid. p. 10) this
is a very small proportion of exceptions ; and even of these no
less than 14 are due to the boiling-points of TeEtj and SbEt3
being too low, and 8 due to the specific gravity of PbEt4
being too low and those of NBu3 and SiEt4 too high. In the
case of the specific gravities, some of the exceptions are
undoubtedly owing to these data not being all strictly com
parable with one another, since they have neither all been
determined at the same temperature, nor at equal distances
from the boiling-points.
   The above facts show, therefore, that the physical properties
of the alkyl compounds of the elements (so far as they have
been investigated) obey exactly the same rules as those of the
corresponding halogen compounds, and would consequently
allow of general conclusions being drawn and practical appli
cations being made similar to those indicated in my previous
paper (ibid. pp. 11, 14, and 19), in connection with the latter
compounds, and which it will not be necessary to repeat here.
   In my next communication I hope to extend these investi
gations to the halogen compounds of the hydrocarbon radicals,
and subsequently to show how the facts thus obtained may
throw light on the nature and raison d'etre of the Periodic
Law.

              XXIX. Origin of Coral Reefs and Islands.
                     By James D. Dana, LL.D.
                         [Continued from p. 181.] '
                 Part II. — The Objections considered.
   f I^HE objections to the Darwinian theory may be considered
          in the following order :—
      I. Darwin's insufficient knowledge of the facts bearing on
   the subject
      II. Subsidence not ordinarily a fact, because methods of
   producing barrier reefs and atolls have been brought forward
   that do not require its aid.
      III. The occurrence of cases of elevation in regions of atolls
  and barrier-reefs inconsistent with the subsidence-theory.
      IV. No ancient coral-reefs in the geological series have the
  great thickness attributed by the subsidence-theory to modern
  reefs.
     V. Other methods of explanation and their supporting
  evidence.
     The adverse remarks directed against the idea of a sinking
  continent in the Pacific as the initial condition in the coral-reef
  subsidence are outside of the present discussion for the reason
  stated on the first page of this paper. In the following pages
  the objections are first explained, under the above-mentioned
  heads, and then follow, in paragraphs lettered a, b, c, &c, the
  writer's discussions of the several points.
           I. Darwin's Insufficient Knowledge of the Facts.
     In the Address referred to in the opening page of this
 article. Dr. Geikie, speaking of Darwin, observes :—" It
 should be borne in mind that, compared with more recent
 explorers, he did not enjoy large opportunities for investi
 gating coral-reefs." " He appears to have examined one
 atoll, the Keeling Reef, and one barrier-reef, that of Tahiti."
 " By a gradually widening circle of observations a series of
 facts has been established which were either not known, or
only partially known, to Darwin."—The authors appealed to
 for the views that are presented as a substitute for Darwin's
are Prof. Karl Semper, who has examined and described reefs
of the Pelew and Philippine Islands ; Dr. J. J. Rein, who
has published on the physical geography of the Bermudas ;
Prof. Alexander Agassiz, who has written on the Florida
reefs and others in that vicinity; and Mr. John Murray, of
the ' Challenger ' Expedition, whose investigations were made
at Tahiti : all able men in science, whether more learned or

270                Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
not than Darwin on the special subject under discussion.
The facts from " a widening circle of observations " referred
to comprise the physical and biological results of deep-sea
exploration. The writer is mentioned as one of the " com
petent observers " who had given " independent testimony "
in favour of Darwin's views after " at least equal opportunities
of studying the subject," and as he has, in these latter years,
looked into the new facts, he has at least a claim to a hearing.
    As to Darwin's knowledge, it appears to the writer that the
apology offered in the above citations was not needed. In
his detailed investigation of Keeling atoll (a good example
of atolls, and like all the rest in its principal features) and
in his examination of the Tahitian reefs, followed up by a
careful study of other atolls and reefs of the ocean through
the maps and descriptions of former surveying-expeditions,
he had a broad basis for judgment and right conclusions.
 When the second edition of his work was published in 1874,
many of the important facts from deep-sea exploration were
already known ; and later he learned of the more recent
results ; and he did not recant. A letter of his, of October
 2nd, 1879, published by Mr. Semper, while admitting with
characteristic fairness the interest of the facts collected by the
latter, expresses his continued adherence to the opinion "that
the atolls and barrier reefs in the middle of the Pacific and
Indian oceans indicate subsidence."
    The writer, as his expositor, may be excused for adding
here that his own " independent testimony " was based on
 observations among coral reefs and islands in the Pacific
 during parts of three years, 1839, 1840, 1841 ; that, besides
 working among the reefs of Tahiti, the Samoan (or Navi
 gator) Islands, and the Feejees (at this last group staying
 three months) , he was also at the Hawaian Islands ; and in
 addition, he landed on and gathered facts from fifteen coral-
 islands, seven of these in the Paumotu Archipelago, one,
Tongatabu, in the Friendly Group, two, Taputeuea and Apia,
in the Gilbert Group, and five others near the equator east of
the Gilbert Group—Swains, Fakaafo, Oatafu (Duke of York's),
Hull, and Enderbury Island*. The writer may therefore bo
acquitted of presumption if he states his opinion freely on the
various questions that have been brought into the discussion
by other investigators. Sympathizing fully with the senti
ment expressed in the words, " The example of Darwin's own
candour and over-mastering love of truth remains to assure
   * These five islands are on the map of the Central Pacific accompany

us that no one would have welcomed fresh discoveries more
heartily than he, even should they lead to the setting aside of
his work ;" and knowing that we are all for the truth and
right theory, he has reason to believe that those who have
been led to object to Darwin's conclusions will be pleased to
have their objections reviewed by one who has a personal know
ledge of many of the facts.
II. Subsidence not ordinarily a Fact, because Methods of Origin
      have been brougJd forward that do not require its aid.
   It is urged that, while subsidence may have happened in
several cases, it is not at all necessary to the making of
barrier-reefs and atolls ; that " subsidence has been invoked
because no other solution of the problem seemed admissible
that the " solution " by subsidence " is only an inference
resting on no positive proofs " *.
    a. Darwin's usual methods were not such as these words
 imply, and we think that he was true to those methods in his
 treatment of coral-island facts. Darwin can hardly be said to
 have " invoked " subsidence. Subsidence forced itself upon
 his attention. He saw evidence that it was a fact, and the
 theory came ready-made to him. The proof of subsidence from
 the relations in form, structure, and history between atolls
 and the large barrier-islands, like the Gambier Group, Raiatea,
 Bolabola, and Hogoleu, scarcely admitted, he says, of a doubt;
 and other facts were all in harmony with it. This, his chief
 argument, with the enforcing evidence in my Report (see §§
 4 and 10 of Part I. of this paper) is not set aside and not men
 tioned in the Address from which the above sentences are
 cited.
    b. Darwin observes that " from the nature of things it is
 scarcely possible to find direct proof of the subsidence,"
 recognizing the fact that subsidence, unlike elevation, puts
 direct testimony out of sight. But still it has left evidence
 which he perceived and thought convincing ; and this stands,
 whatever virtue there may be in other explanations.
    Moreover, we have now direct testimony for subsidence
 from the facts brought forward (for another purpose) by Mr.
 Murray, as is set forth further on.
 III. The Occurrence of cases of Elevation in Regions of Atolls
                        and Barrier-Reefs.
    The fact that elevated reefs and other evidences of eleva-
                         * Address, page 24.
                                U2

    272               Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
   tion occur at the Pelews, a region of wide barrier-reefs and
   atolls, has been presented by Prof. Karl Semper*, after a
   study of those islands, as an objection to the theory of subsi
   dence ; for we have thereby (in the words of the Address)
   " a cumbrous and entirely hypothetical series of upward and
   downward movements." Prof. Semper reports the existence
   of reefs raised 200 to 250 feet above the sea-level in the
   southern third of the larger of the islands, while the other
   two thirds exhibit evidence of but little, if any, elevation.
      a. Such facts are of the same general character with those
   of other elevated reefs and atolls discussed in §§ 12, 13, 16 of
   Part L and the same explanation covers them. The Pelew
   region is one of comparatively modern volcanic rocks, and this
   renders local displacements a probability.
      b. The occurrence of great numbers of large and small
  masses of coral-rock, in some places crowded together, upon
  the western or leeward reef of the several Pelew Islands, and
  of none on the eastern reef, is mentioned as evidence against
  subsidence and in favour of some elevation; because, Professor
  Semper says, the strongest wind-waves on the western side
  are too feeble to break off and leave on the reef such large
  masses, some of them (as his words imply rather than
  distinctly state) ten feet thick.
      But the difficulty does not exist in fact ; for earthquakes
  may have made the waves. The region just west of the
  Pelews is one of the grandest areas of active volcanoes on the
  globe. It embraces the Philippine Islands, Krakatoa and
  other volcanic islands of the Sooloo sea, Celebes, &c. The
 agents that could do the work were there in force. To the
 eastward, in contrast, lie the harmless islands of the Caroline
 Archipelago, mostly atolls, serving, perhaps, as a breakwater
 to the Pelews.
     The small elevation referred to is therefore not proved by
 the evidence adduced ; and yet it may be a fact without
 affecting the theory of Darwin, as I have fully illustrated f.
     It is important to have in mind that the coral-reef era
 probably covered the whole of the Quaternary and perhaps
 the Pliocene Tertiary also ; and hence the local elevations that
    * First in 1868, Zei/schr. JFissetuch. Zool. xiii. p. 658 ; additions in Die
Philippinen und ihre Iieicohner, Wiirzburg, 1869 ; and still later in his
' Animal Life,' published in Appleton's International Scientific Series in
1881.
    t Mr. Semper's objection to the theory of subsidence based on the co
existence of all kinds of reefs in the Pelews—atoll, fringing, and barrier—
with no reefs about one island, and from the relative steepness of the
submarine slopes on the east and west reefs of an island, have been
sufficiently met in Part I.

                        Coral Reefs and, Inlands.                     273
have taken place in the ocean were not crowded events of a
short period.
    Moreover, these local elevations in coral-seas are spread
over an area of 25,000,000 sqnare miles. As an example of
the long distances, the Paumotu Archipelago, consisting of
more than eighty atolls and two barrier-islands, and covering
about 450,000 sqnare miles, contains only three or four
atolls that are over twelve feet high ; and of these, Metia is
250 feet in height, Elizabeth 80 feet, Dean's, probably where
highest, 15 or 20 feet. Metia is one of the westernmost, near
148° 13' W. and 15° 50' S.; Dean's is 60 miles to the north-
north-east of Metia, and Elizabeth is far to the south-east, in
128° W. and 25° 50' S., or nearly 1450 miles distant from
Metia. Locate these points on a continent, and Pacific
distances and the length of Pacific chains of atolls will be
appreciated.
IV. No Ancient Coral-reefs liave the Thickness attributed by the
               Subsidence- Theory to Modern Reefs.
    An argument against the subsidence-theory is based by
Prof. J. J. Rein* on the alleged fact that the thickness
attributed to modern reefs is far beyond that of any such
reefs in earlier time ; that is, the thickness is unprecedented.
The argument decides nothing. The question is one of
geological fact, not to be settled by a precedent. Whether,
then, there are precedents or not it is not necessary to
consider.
    Besides this, it implies a distinction between coral-made
and shell-made rocks which does not exist. The coral-reef
 rock is largely made of shells, and the process of formation
 for a limestone of shallow-sea origin is essentially the same
 whether shells or corals are predominant or the sole material.
 No thick formation of any kind of rock was ever made, or
 could be made, by shore or shallow-sea operations without a
 slowly continued subsidence or a corresponding change of
 water-level.
     V. Other Methods of Explanation, and their Supporting
                                Evidence.
     A. Mr. John Murray, one of the able naturalists of the
 ' Challenger ' expedition, reports the following important results
    * Dr. Rein's first memoir on Bermuda appeared in the Senckenberg
 Ber. naturforich. OeselUchaft, 1869-70, p. 867, and the later in the
  Verhandlung des I. deuttch. Geographentages, 1881, Berlin, 1882. The
 above argument is from the latter paper, and is given here from the
 citation by Dr. Geikie, the publication not being accessible to the writer.

274                 Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
from soundings off northern Tahiti, made under his super
vision and that of the surveying officers *.
    Along a line outward from the edge of the barrier-reef there
were found :—(1) for about 250 yards, a shallow region
covered partly with growing corals, which deepened seaward
to 40 fathoms ; (2) for 100 yards, between the depths of 40
and 100 fathoms, a steeply but irregularly sloping surface,
which commenced with a precipice of 75 and had a mean
angle exceeding 45° t; then (3) for 150 yards a sloping bottom
30° in angle ; (4) then a continuation of this sloping surface,
diminishing in a mile to 6°, at which distance out the depth
found was 590 fathoms (3540 feet). Over the area (2), or
the 100 yards between 40 and 100 fathoms, the bottom was
proved to be made of large coral-masses, some of them " 20
to 30 feet in length," along with finer debris ; outside of this,
of sand to where the slope was reduced to 6° ; and then of
mud, composed " of volcanic and coral-sand, pteropods, pelagic
 and other foraminifers, coccoliths, &c."
    These observations have great significance. They show (1)
that the feeble currents off this part of Tahiti carry little of
the coral debris in that direction beyond a mile outside of the
 growing reef ; (2) that a region of large masses of coral-rock
and finer material occurs at depths between 240 and 600 feet ;
(3) that, a mile out, the bottom has the slope nearly of the
adjoining land, and in this part is covered with the remains of
 pelagic life.
     From the second of these facts—the great accumulation of
 coral-blocks below a level of 240 feet—Mr. Murray draws the
 conclusion that, in the making of fringing, barrier, and atoll
 reefs, the widening goes forward (a) by making first upon
 the submarine slopes outside of the growing reef a pile of
 coral-debris up to the lower limit of living reef-corals ; and
 then (b) by building outward upon this accumulation as a
 base.
     He also announces,after speaking of other causes influencing
 the growth of corals, the more general conclusion that " it is
 not necessary to call in subsidence to explain any of the
 characteristic features of barrier-reefs and atolls;" and con
 cludes that his views " do away with the great and general
 subsidences " appealed to by Darwin.
      a. The widening-process, in the first conclusion, had
  previously been a part of the Darwinian theory ; for, as
     • Proc. Edinburgh Roy. Soc, Session 1879-80, p. 506.
     t Br. Geikie gives in his paper a section of the soundings, " on a true
  scale, vertical and horizontal, and in it the upper steepest part of this 100
  yards has a slope of about 75°.

                        Coral Reefs and Islands.                 275
stated in § 10 (Part I.), a fringing reef, where no subsidence
is going on, widens above and steepens its seaward-slope, and
it could do this only by the process described : that is, by
building out upon a base of debris, or, more correctly, upon
true coral-reef rock made by the gradual consolidation of the
debris *.
    b. The broader conclusion Mr. Murray does not sustain by
a mention of special facts from the soundings, tending directly
to meet the question of change of level, but by attempting to
show that through the eroding action of currents and other
means (as had been argued by Prof. Semper), in connection
with the process already explained, reefs of all kinds can be
made from submarine banks without aid from subsidence.
    In this place I confine myself to tho question as to the fact
of subsidence. The only direct argument presented against
subsidence is contained in the statement, that the very broad
shore-plain of Tahiti shows that " the island has not in recent
 times undergone subsidence," and may indicate a slight
elevation ; and in this he sustains the earlier statement of my
 report, which says (p. 293) that the broad shore-plain of
 Tahiti probably overlies in some parts the fringing reef ;
 and (p. 300) the shore-plain, if built upon reefs, as I was
 assured, may afford proof of a rise of one or two feet." But
 this admission, as I have explained for other cases of local
 elevation, is in no way opposed to the theory of subsidence.
     c. The kind of submarine slopes to be looked for off reefs
 is illustrated by the soundings, as Dr. Geikie indicates. But
it is interesting to note that the facts, while very important,
 sustain instead of correcting those announced by earlier
 observers. Beechey and Darwin make the mean slope about
 45°, and my report says 40° to 50°. I have assumed for the
 slope of the bottom outside of the reef-limit the same angle as
 for the surface-slope of the island just above the water-level :
 5° to 8° off Tahiti, of which 5° is accepted as most correct,
 and 3° to 5° off Upolut ; and the assumption as regards Tahiti
 is sustained by the ' Challenger ' soundings. My Report states
 (from the Expedition surveys) that off Upolu the bottom
 " loses more and more in the proportion of coral-sand till we
 finally reach a bottom of earth," and introduces this as an
 argument against the indefinite drifting of coral-sands into
 the deep ocean J ; and this argument the Tahiti soundings
 sustain.
     With reference to the occurrence off some shores of precipi-
    * My Expedition Geological Report, pp. 131, 182, where figures are
  given illustrating the effect of widening,

276              Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
tous submarine slopes, the ' Challenger ' soundings give definite
facts as to one case. They leave undisturbed the previously
reported cases of like steepness at greater depths : for
example, the sounding of Captain Fitzroy at Keeling atoll
(while Darwin was there), 2200 yards from the breakers, in
which no bottom was found at a depth of 1200 fathoms, but
the line was partly cut at a depth between 500 and 600 fathoms ;
the sounding by the Wilkes Expedition off Clermont Tonnere
(Paumotu Archipelago), where the lead, brought up an instant
at 350 fathoms and then dropped off" again, descended to 600
fathoms without reaching bottom, and came up bruised, with
small pieces of white and red coral attached ; a sounding by
the same Expedition, a " cable's length " from Ahii, in which
the lead struck a ledge of rock at 150 fathoms and brought
up finally at 300 fathoms *. All the older soundings need to
be repeated ; but there must be enough truth in those quoted
to warrant the remark that the force of Darwin's argument
for subsidence from the steepness of the submarine slopes
about atolls is not weakened by the ' Challenger ' results.
   d. But the chief interest of the ' Challenger soundings con
sists in their affording " direct " proof, " positive " proof, of
much subsidence ; a kind of proof that subsidence sinks out of
sight, and which soundings may yet make available in many
similar cases.
   That belt of coarse debris—including " masses 20 to 30
feet " long—was found over the steeply sloping bottom at
depths between 240 and 600 feet. These depths are far
below the limit of forcible wave-action. They are depths
where the waters, however disturbed above by storms, have
no rending and lifting power, even when the bottom is
gradually shelving ; depths, in this special case, against a
slope which for 100 yards is 75° in its upper part, and in no
part under 45°, the vertical fall being 360 feet in the 100 yards.
 Strokes against the reef-rock thus submerged, and under such
conditions, would be extremely feeble. Waves advancing up a
coast, whether storm-driven waves or earthquake waves, do
little rock-rending below the depth to which they can bare
the bottom for a broadside plunge against the obstacle before
them, although the velocity gives them transporting power
to a greater depth. It is the throw of an immense mass of
water against the front, with the velocity increased by the
tidal flow over a shelving bottom,—the rate sometimes
amounting, according to Stevenson, to 36 miles an hour or
52*8 feet a second,—together with the buoyant action of the
water, that produces the great effects.
                            * Ibid, p. 66.

                      Coral Reefs and Islands.              277
   A vertical surface below the sea-level of 20 feet made bare
for the broadside stroke is probably very rarely exceeded even
in the case of earthquake-waves ; and with storm- waves, or
recorded earthquake-waves, the displacement of the water at
a depth of 240 feet would be at the most only a few inches.
I saw on atoll reefs no upthrown masses of coral-rock over
ten feet in thickness and twenty feet in length or breadth.
It is therefore plainly impossible that such a belt of debris
should have been made at its present level, or even at a depth
of 20 feet ; and hence the debris affords positive proof of a
large subsidence during some part of the reef-making era.
   The existence of the belt of ddbris may be explained as
follows :—If the reef now at a depth of 240 feet were at the
sea-level as the sea-level reef, and subsidence were not in
progress for a period, the very steep front of the reef now
just below the 240-foot level might have resulted from the
widening that would have gone forward. And under such
conditions, the action of the occasional extraordinary waves
might have torn off masses from the front which would have
tumbled down the steeply sloping surface until the belt of
debris had been formed. Then, with a renewal of the slow
subsidence, the thickening of the reef would have been
resumed and gone on to its final limit, and the rendings of
the great waves found lodgment at higher levels. The masses
now on atoll reefs must be from comparatively recent up
throws.
   This direct evidence of subsidence from Tahiti renders it
reasonable to make subsidence in atoll-making a general
truth. It is nevertheless desirable that facts of the kind
should be multiplied. The abrupt descent in the submarine
slopes of reefs detected by Fitzroy at a depth below 3000 feet,
and those reported by the Wilkes Expedition at depths of
2100 and 900 feet, seem to indicate a similar rest at the sea-
level, and consequent reef-widening in the course of a pro
gressing subsidence ; and proof of this may yet be found in
belts of coarse coral-rock debris at the foot of the precipices.
 Such a period of rest would lead to the forming of submarine
precipices in different regions contemporaneously at different
depths according to the rate of subsidence of the part of the
subsiding area.
   B. From facts observed about the Florida reefs, Lieutenant
E. B. Hunt, U.S.N., announced, in 1863 *, the conclusion
that these reefs had received their westward elongation
           * Silliman's American Journal [2] xx.w. p. 107.

278                Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
through the westward " sweep " of an eddy current to the
Gulf Stream. The subject, nearly twenty years afterwards,
was more thoroughly investigated by Mr. Alexander Agassiz,
and the same conclusion reached *. Mr. Agassiz made also
another important observation—that this current is an abundant
carrier of marine life for the feeding of the coral animals, and so
accelerates the coral-growth and accumulation in its direction.
Combining with these effects others hereafter considered, Mr.
Agassiz expresses, like Mr. Murray and Mr. Semper, the
further conclusion, that all kinds of reefs—atoll, fringing, and
barrier—may be made without aid from subsidence.
    a. The facts presented by Lieutenant Hunt, and more
fully by Mr. Agassiz, with regard to the effects of the eddy
current of the Gulf-Stream, show that coral-reefs may bo
elongated, and also that inner channels may be made, by the
drifting of coral-sands. But the action with coral-sands is
essentially the same as with other sands ; and illustrations of
this drifting process occur along the whole eastern coast of
North America from Florida to Long Island. We there
learn that drift-made beaches run in long lines between broad
channels or sounds and the ocean ; that they have nearly the
uniform direction of the drift of the waters, with some irregu
 larities introduced by the forms of the coast and the outflow
 of the inner waters, which are tidal and fluvial and have much
strength during ebb tide. The easy consolidation of coral-
 sands puts in a peculiar feature, but not one that affects the
direction of drift accumulation.
    b. The great barrier-reef off eastern Australia, a thousand
 miles long, has some correspondence in position to the sand-
 reefs off eastern North America. But it is full of irregulari
 ties of direction and of interruptions, and follows in no part
 an even line. In the southern half, it extends out 150 miles
 from the coast and includes a large atoll-formed reef ; in the
 northern half, the barrier, while varying much in course, is
 hardly over 30 miles from the land. There is very little in its

    Professor Louis Agassiz's account of the Florida reefs was published
 in the U. S. Coast Survey Reports of 1851 and 1800, and reproduced in
 vol. vii. of the Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. It gives
  an excellent description of the Florida reefs, and of the action of boring
 animals and other injurious agents on corals, and reaches the conclusion
 that the reef has been raised to its present level and thickness by wave
 and current action, without the aid of elevation or subsidence. The
 argument is based on such observations as could be made over the surface
 of the reefs and the adjoining sea-bottom, and bears on the question of
 the necessity of subsidence, and nnt on the fact of subsidence.

                         Coral Reefs and Islands.                    279
form to suggest similarity of origin to the drift-made barriers
of sand.
    c. In the Pacific Ocean, the trends of many of the coral-
island groups and of the single islands do not correspond
with the direction of the oceanic currents, or with any eddy
currents except such as are local and are determined by them
selves.
    Near longitude 180°, as the map of the Central Pacific (see
Part I.) illustrates, the equator is crossed by the long Gilbert
(or Kingsmill) group, at an angle with the meridian of 25°
to 30°, and not in the direction of the Pacific current, which
is approximately equatorial. This obliquely crossing chain of
atolls is continued northward in the Batack and Ralick Groups
 (or the Marshall Islands), making in all a chain over 1200
miles long ; and, adding the concordant Ellice Islands on the
south, and extending the Eatack line to Gaspar Rico, its
northern outlier, the chain is nearly 2000 miles long. Nothing
in the direction of the long range, excepting local shapings
of some of the points about the atolls, can be attributed to the
Pacific currents. Moreover, the diversified forms of the atolls
 have no sufficient explanation in the drift process.
    d. Further, drifting by currents may make beaches and
inner channels whether subsidence is going on in the region
or not, and are not evidence for} or against| either a move
ment downward or upward. Sandy Hook, the long sandy
 point off the southern cape of New York harbour, has been
 undergoing (as the U. S. Coast Survey has shown) an increase
 in length, or rather variations in length, through the drifting
 of sands by an outside and an inside current ; and this is no
 evidence that Professor G. H. Cook is wrong in his conclusion
 that the New Jersey coast is slowly subsiding.
    e. But even in this region of Florida we have strong evidence
 of a great subsidence during the coral-reef era, and all the
 subsidence that the Darwinian theory demands.
     In a very valuable paper by Mr. Agassiz, published in 1879
 in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology *, the
 author points out that the South American continent, in com
 paratively recent geological times, had connection with the
 West-India Islands through two lines : (1) one along a belt
 from the Mosquito Coast to Jamaica, Porto Rico, and Cuba ;
 and (2) the other through Trinidad to Anguilla, of the Wind
 ward Islands. He sustains the conclusion by a review of the
 soundings made by the steamer ' Blake/ under the command of
    * An abstract of the paper is contained in Silliman's American Journal
 [3] xviii. p. 230 (1880).

  280                Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
 J. R. Bartlett, U.S.N., and a consideration of the facts con
  nected with the distribution of marine and terrestrial species.
  As the soundings show, the former of the two connections
  requires for completeness an elevation of the region amounting
  to 4060 feet over the part south of Jamaica, 4830 feet between
 Jamaica and Hayti, and 5240 feet between Hayti and Cuba.
  The other line of connection requires an elevation of 3450
 feet. An open channel, as he observes, would thus be left
 between Anguilla and the Virgin Islands, where there is now
 a depth of 6400 feet. The close relations in the existing
  fauna of the Gulf to that of the Pacific waters prove that it
 continued to be a salt-water gulf through the era of elevation.
    Mr. Agassiz infers that the connection of the West-India
 Islands with South America existed before the Quaternary
 era. But there are other facts which seem to prove that it
 was continued into, or at least was a fact in, the Quaternary.
    The opinion as to a connection of the Windward Islands
 with South America in the Quaternary was presented by
 Prof. E. D. Cope in 1868, and earlier, as he states, by Pomel,
 on the ground of the discovery in the caves of Anguilla of a
 species of gigantic Rodent related to the Chinchilla, as large
 as the Virginia Deer, and nearly equalling the Quaternary
 Castoroides of Ohio *. Further, De Castro, as cited by Dr. J.
 Leidy in his ' Mammalian Fauna of Dakota and Nebraska,'
 1869, announced, in 1865, a gigantic Sloth of the " Quater
 nary," from Cuba, which he referred to the genus Megalonyx,
 and Dr. Leidy named Megalocnus rodens, proving a Quater
 nary connection between the continent and Cuba.
    The fact of an elevated condition of the region sufficient to
 make Cuba and Anguilla part of the continent during the
earlier Quaternary, if not in the Pliocene also, is thus made
quite certain. This is fully recognized by Wallace t- Such
a condition could hardly have existed without a large elevation
also of Florida, though probably not, as Mr. Agassiz holds, to
the full amount of the depression between it and Cuba (nearly
3000 feet), because Cuba is most closely related in fauna to
South America. The subsidence which brought the region to

the Bovidce and a little smaller than Ohm aries. With them was obtained

the present level was consequently within the coral-reef
period. It is hence hardly to be doubted that the making of
the Florida, Bahama, and other West India coral-reefs was
going on during the progress of a great subsidence. None
of the facts mentioned by observers are opposed to this
view.
    It is of interest to note here that on Cuba and Jamaica
there are elevated coral-reefs, the highest on Cuba 1000 feet
above the sea, according to Mr. Agassiz, and probably at one
point 2000, according to Mr. W. 0. Crosby's observations *,
and on Jamaica 2000 feet, according to Mr. Sawkins ;
indicating that there have been upward movements subsequent
to the downward. Mr. Crosby argues that the great thickness
of the now elevated reefs could have been produced only
" during a progressing subsidence ;" so that " we have
apparently no recourse but to accept Darwin's theory."
    C. It has been urged by Mr. Semper, Dr. J. J. Rein, Mr.
A. Agassiz, Mr. Murray, Dr. Geikie, and others, that since
the growing calcareous deposits of the sea-bottom are slowly
rising toward the surface by successive accumulations of the
shells and other debris of marine species, they may have been
 built up locally in various regions of the deep seas (as they
actually are now about some islands) until they were near
enough to the surface to become next a plantation of corals ;
and that in this way atolls became common within the area
of the tropical oceans. The method is regarded as setting
aside subsidence.
    a. The advocates of this hypothesis have not pointed to
such a mound now approaching the ocean's surface on the
western border of the Gulf-Stream, where the depth over the
remarkably luxuriant region is least ; and none over any part
of the tropical Pacific. It is suggested that the Chagos Bank
may be one example ; but it is not known to be so. Professor
 Semper states that he found evidence of pelagic life, instead
of modern corals, in the lower part of the elevated reefs of the
Pelews. Dr. Geikie cites from letters by Dr. Guppy in
' Nature ' of Nov. 29, Dec. 6, 1883, and Jan. 12, 1884, the
fact that in elevated reefs on the Salomon Islands, 100 and
1200 feet high, the coral-rock forms a comparatively thin
layer over impure earthy limestone abounding in foraminifers
and other pelagic organisms such as Pteropods. Such obser-

282                   Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
vations have great interest, but they only prove that, in coral-
reef seas, corals will grow over any basis of rock that may
offer where the water is right in depth, and do not nullify any
of the evidences of subsidence. This point should be kept
before the mind in all future study of coral-reef regions.
Borings in coral-islands, as recommended on a former page,
are the true means of investigating it.
    b. The old hypothesis that atolls may have been built upon
the summits of submerged mountain-peaks, or volcanic cones
at the right distance under water for growing reef-corals, or,
if not at the right level, brought up to it by other organic
depositions, or down to it by abrasion, is urged by Mr.
Murray.
    This writer observes that " the soundings of the ' Tuscarora '
and ' Challenger ' have made known numerous submarine
elevations ; mountains rising from the general level of the
ocean's bed at a depth of 2500 or 3000 fathoms, up to within
a fete hundred fathoms of the surface." But " a few hundred
 fathoms," if we make few equal 2, means 1200 feet or more,
 which leaves a long interval yet unfilled *.
     It is also urged that some of the " emerged volcanic moun
 tains situated in the ocean-basins " may have been wholly
swept away and left with a few fathoms of water above them.
 But this is claiming more from the agents of erosion than
they could possibly have accomplished, as the existence of an
atoll in the ocean and the examples on coasts of wave and
tidal action prove.
     D. To give completeness to the hj'pothesis which makes
barrier and atoll islands out of submarine banks (whether
 these bnnks have a basis of volcanic or other rocks, or of
 calcareous accumulations), it is necessary to show that the
 waters of the waves and currents can make barrier islands and
 atolls out of such banks without subsidence ; and explanations
 to this effect have been given.
     It is urged, in agreement with Darwin, that the outer por-
    • The actual depths over the elevations in the ' Tuscarora' section between
 the Hawaian Islands and Japan, numbering them from east to west, are
 as follows :—1, 11,500 feet ; 2, 7600 feet ; 3, 8400 feet ; 4, 12,000 feet ;
 5, 9000 feet (this seven miles west of Marcus Island) ; 6, 8600 feet.
 YVhether ridges or peaks the facts do not decide ; probably the former.
 No. 1 has a base of 186 miles, with the mean eastward slope 40 feet per
 mile ( = 1 : 132), and the westward 128 feet per mile. No. 2 has a breadth
 of 396 miles, with the mean eastern slope mostly 37 feet per mile, but 61
 feet toward the top, and the westward, 06 feet per mile (sal : 96). No. 3
 was the narrowest and steepest, it being about 100 miles broad at base,
 and having the mean eastern slope 192 feet per mile and the mean western
 200 feet.

                     Coral Reefs and Islands.                 283
tions of reefs increase faster than the inner, owing to the
purer water about them and the more abundant life for food ;
that tho inner parts are not only at a disadvantage in these
respects, but suffer also from coral debris thrown over them.
They add to these causes of unequal growth mentioned by
Darwin, the solvent and abrading action of the waters.
   It is hence concluded that, under these conditions, the
simple bank of growing corals may have a depression made at
the centre, which, as the process continues, will become a lagoon
basin, and the reef thereby an atoll with a shallow lagoon ;
that the atoll, so begun, may continue to enlarge through the
external widening of the reef and the further action of
current>abrasion and solution within : or, in the case of
fringing reefs, that the change may go on until the reef has
become a barrier-reef, with an inner channel and inner reef's.
It is admitted that subsidence may possibly have helped in
the case of the deepest lagoons.
   Dr. Geikie expresses his opinion on the subject thus :—" As
the atoll increases in size the lagoon becomes proportionally
larger, partly from its waters being less supplied with pelagic
food, and therefore less favourable to the growth of the more
massive kinds of corals, partly from the injurious effects of
calcareous sediment upon coral-growth there, and partly also
from the solvent action of the carbonic acid of the sea-water
upon the dead coral."
   Mr. Semper gives examples of the effects of currents at the
Pelew Islands, stating that, by striking against or flowing by
the living corals, they make the reef grow with steeper sides
and determine its direction, and urging that abrasion and
solution have made, not only the deep lagoon-like channels,
but the deeper channels between the islands. He holds that
in Kriangle, which he describes as a true atoll with no
 channel leading into the lagoon from the sea, the lagoon
 may have been " the result of the action of currents on the
 porous soil during a period of slow upheaval *. He says,
 further, that the large channel in the main island of the group
 " forty fathoms deep and many miles wide," " finds an easy
 explanation on the assumption of an upheaval ;" it became
 " wider in proportion as the enclosed island, consisting of soft
 stone [tufa], was gradually eaten away ; and during slow
 upheaval it would continue to grow deeper in proportion as
 the old porous portions of the reef and the rock in which it
 was forming were more and more worn down by the combined
 action of boring animals and plants, and of the currents

 284                 Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
 produced by the tides and by rain." Mr. Semper refers to
 the dead depressed tops of some masses of Porites near tide-
 level, as the effects of the deposit of sediment over the top of
 the living coral, and of erosion by the waves and exposure to
rains while the sides continued to grow ; and the fact is made
an example on a very small scale of atoll-making. Other
examples of the action of currents, sediments, boring species,
 and the solvent action of carbonic acid in the waters are
mentioned by Mr. Agassiz, in his excellent account of the
 " Tortugas and Florida reefs."
     a. The theory, if satisfactory, accounts not only for the
 origin of an atoll, but for the origin of atolls of all sizes,
shapes, and conditions, and for great numbers of them in
archipelagos and chains ; not only for channels through
fringing reefs, like those that abrasion in other cases makes,
but for all the irregular outlines of barriers, for the great
barriers reaching far away from any land, and for the positions
and indented coasts of the small included lands. Is it a
 sufficient explanation of the facts ?
    b. The currents that influence the structure of reefs are :
(1) the general movement or drift of the ocean, in some parts
varying with seasonal variations in the winds ; (2) the
currents connected with wave-action and the inflowing tide
over a shelving bottom ; (3) the currents during the ebb,
flowing out of channels ; together with (4) counter-currents.
Each region must have its special study in order to mark out
all the local effects that currents occasion. Such effects are
produced whether a secular subsidence is in progress or not,
and hence a particular review of the subject in this place is
unnecessary.
     The shaping of the outside of the reef and the determination
 of the width and level surface of the shore platform are due
 chiefly to the tidal flow and the accompanying action of wind-
waves, as explained in § 17 of Part I.
    * Since the first part of niy paper was published I have observed in an
 article by Mr. A. R. Hunt, in the Scientific Proceedings of the Royal
 Dublin Society, iv. p. 254, January 1885, the remark, referring to a state
ment of the above fact in my' Manual of Geology,' that the " statement,
though strictly in accordance with Mr. Russel's theory, has, so far as I can
ascertain, no foundation in fact," The statement, as I have said (and as
I illustrate in my ' Geology '), was but the statement of a fact observed by
me first in 1839 on the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, without a
thought of any theory ; and part of the explanation is overlooked by Mr.
Hunt. I absented that the first waters of the incoming tide swelled over
the sandstone platform (which was a hundred yards or more wide off the
Port-Jackson Heads), anil became thus a protector of the sandstone
platform from breaker strokes ; and that the lower part of the sandstone
bluff to a height a little above high tide was hollowed out by the strokes

                         Coral Reefs and Islands.                           285
    The current that accompanies the ebb is locally the strongest.
 Owing to the great width of many barrier-reefs and of the
 channels and harbours within them, the tide flows in over
 a wide region. At the turn in the tide the waters escape at
 first freely over the same wide region ; but, with a tide of
 but two or three feet, there is but little fall before the reef—
 which lies at low-tide level and a little above it—retards it by
 friction ; and thus escape by the open entrances is increased
 in amount and in rate of flow. The facts are the same in
 atolls where the lagoons have entrances*.
of the breakers. A similar erosion near high-tide level of the great coral
masses standing on the coral-rock platform of atolls I also observed while
among the Paumotu Islands. Prof. A. E. Verrill informs me that he has
seen examples of the same action on a grand scale about the inland of
Anticosti in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The observations do not appear
to me to be at variance with the principles laid down in Mr. Hunt's
valuable paper ; they require only his recognition of a tidal effect which
he does not fully consider, and which British seas cannot illustrate.
   To produce a platform, (1) the rock-material exposed to the flow of
the tide and the breakers must be firm enough to resist wear during the
early part of the flow, and, at the same time, soft enough to allow the
striking breakers to cut into the base of the bluff, or shear off the projec
ting ledge ; and (2) the region must not be one of very high tides or
stormy seas, for, in such regions of forceful waves and tides, the move
ments are too often of the destructive kind through the whole continuance
of the flow leaving no chance for the protection a platform needs. Loose
sand-deposits are too soft ; they are worn off below the sea-level and
changed in surface by storms ; but some firmer kinds may make a low-
tide flat in a bay where the tides are small. Coral-reef rock, the material
                                                  solubility in carbonated sea-
water of ordinary limestone. The rock of the Port-Jackson Heads is a
friable sandstone. At the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, the platforms
occur in an argillaceous rock, which becomes soft and earthy above by
weathering, but is unaltered and firm below because kept wet (loc. cit.
p. 442). At the Paumotus the tides are two to three feet high, and the
platform usually 100 yards or more wide ; at the Phoenix Group the tides
are five to six feet high and the platform mostly 50 to 70 yards wide ;
at the Port-Jackson Heads, the ordinary tides are six feet high and the
platform 50 to 150 yards wide ; at the Bay of Islands (in the sheltered
waters of the bay), the tides are eight feet high and the platform is under
30 yards wide.
   * The currents of the tropical Pacific Ocean are of very unequal rate in
its different parts, and very feeble in the Paumotu Archipelago and the
Tahitian and Samoan regions. Capt. Wilkes reports that in the cruise of
the Expedition through the Paumotu Archipelago to Tahiti, a distance
of a thousand miles, during a month from August 13 to September 13,
1839, the drift of the vessels was only 17 miles ; and that during fourteen
days in the first half of October, between Tahiti and Upolu of the
Samoan group, nearly 1800 miles, the drift was only 43 miles.

current westerly, but its velocity variable ;'' between the parallel' of 10° S.

286                Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
   c. Examples of massive corals having the top flat or de
pressed and lifeless, while the sides are living, are common in
coral-reef regions, wherever such corals are exposed to the
deposition of sediment, and where they have grown up to the
surface so that the top is bare above low tide. A disk of
Porites, having the top flat and the sides raised (owing to
growth), so as to give it an elevated border, is figured on plate
lv. of my Report on Zoophytes. Many such were found in
the impure waters of a shore-reef at the Feejees. At Tonga-
tabu one flat-topped mass of Porites was twenty-five feet in
diameter ; and both there and in the Feejees, others of
Astrseids and Meandriuas measured twelve to fifteen feet in
diameter.
   Over the dead surfaces, as Mr. Semper observes, the coral
may be eroded by the solvent action of the waters, and espe
cially where depressions occur to receive any deposits, and
boring animals may riddle the coral with holes or tubes. But
generally the erosion is superficial ; the large masses referred
to showed littlo of it. Such dead surfaces in corals are
generally protected by a covering of nullipores and other
incrusting forms of life, and the crusts usually spread over
the surfaces pari passu with the dying of the polyps.
   d. Every stream, says Mr. Semper (when explaining, as
cited on a preceding page, the origin of the deep channel of
the large Pelevv island, whose depth is " 35 to 45 fathoms "),
" has a natural tendency to deepen its bed." But there is a
limit to this action. The eroding or deepening powerof a stream
and 6° N., the direction ¦was westerly with "the average velocity 35
miles per day, the range 17 to 70 miles per day," the maximum occurring
along the parallel of 2° N. Further west, about the Phcenix group, the
equatorial current as described by Mr. Hague (he. cii. p. 237), has " a
general direction of west-south-west and a velocity sometimes exceeding
two miles per hour." At times it changes suddenly and tlows as rapidly
to the eastward. The drifting of the sands about Baker's Island (in
latitude 0° 13' N.r longitude 176° 22' F.)has much interest in connection
with this subject of current-action, and the facts are here cited from Mr.
Hague's paper. The west side of the little island (1 x | m. in area) trends
north-east, and the southern east-by-north, and at the junction a spit of
sand extends out. During the summer the ocean swell, like the wind,
comes from the south-east, and strikes the south tide ; and consequently
the b( ach sands of that side are drifted around the point and heaped up
on the western or leeward side, forming a plateau along the beach two or
three hundred feet wide, and eight or ten feet deep over the shore-plat
form. 'W ith October and November comes the winter swell from the
north-east, which sweeps along the western shore ; and in two or three
months the sands of the plateau are all drifted back to the south side,
which is then the protected side, extending the beach of that Bide two
or three hundred feet. This lasts until February or March, when the
operation is repeated.

through abrasion and transportation is null or nearly so below
the level of its outlet. A basin or channel 45 fathoms (270
feet) deep, with an outlet of much less depth, could not be
deepened by such means or protect itself from shallowing.
The depth of the outlets is not stated, except that they are
said to be ship-channels. Moreover, with a tufa bottom,
solution could not contribute to the removal, since carbonated
 waters, although decomposing the tufa, dissolve very little of
 its ingredients. An elevation in progress would result in
making of the channel a closed lake, and finally dry land.
    For the same reason, the small atoll, Kriangle, having, as
described, a closed lagoon, could have no deepening of the
 lagoon from abrasion by tidal currents or wave-action during
 the progress of an elevation. And if a lagoon have an out
 let, tho rapid current of the ebb would be confined to the
narrow passage-way and a portion of the bottom near it ;
through the larger part of the lagoon, as in any other lake,
the waters would have scarcely perceptible motion, and
therefore slight energy for any kind of work. Hence a
lagoon would lose very little by this means, and shallowing
would go on unless there were great loss through the solvent
action of the waters. An elevation would only hurry the
shallowing and end in emptying the lagoon.
    e. Erosion through solvent action is promoted by the
presence in the waters both of carbonic acid and organic
acids. The material within reach of the tides or waves ex
posed to this action is dead corals and shells, or their debris,
and bare coral rocks, occurring over—(1) the outer region of
living corals and for a mile or so outside ; (2) the shore
plattorm and the reef, bare at low tide, on which there is
comparatively little living coral ; and (3) the lagoon basin.
There is nothing in the material within the lagoon to favour
solution more than in either of the other two regions ; in fact,
the platform and bare reef are most exposed to the action
because of the small amount of living corals over them. The
outside waters take up what they can through the carbonic
acid they contain, and supply thereby the wants of the lime-
secreting polyps, shells, &c, and carry on the process of
solidification in the debris ; the same waters move on over
the atoll reef and take up more lime as far as the acid ingre
dient is present ; and then they pass to the lagoon for work
similar to that outside, with probably a diminished amount of
free carbonic acid, on account of the loss over the reef-ground
previously traversed.
    The lagoon basin is not, therefore, the part of the atoll that
loses most by solution, anv more than bv abrasion and trans

288             Dr. J. D. Dana on the Origin of
portation. The outer reefs suffer the most ; and yet, if the
island is not subsiding at too rapid a rate, they keep extending
and encroaching on the ocean, instead of wasting through
the drifting into the ocean at large of calcium carbonate in
grains and solution ; and the shore-platform also preserves
its unvaried level notwithstanding the daily sweep of the
tidal floods, and the holes that riddle its outer portions.
    The remarks, " It is a common observation in atolls
that the islets on the reefs are situated close to the lagoon
shore f and such " facts point out the removal of matter which
is going on in the lagoons and lagoon channels," * I know
nothing to sustain. The width of the shore-platform on the
seaward side is always greater than that on the lagoon side ;
but the outside shore-platform has its width determined by
tidal and wave action, and this action is powerful on the
ocean side, and feeble on the lagoon side ; it produces a high
coarse beach on the outside as the inner limit of the platform,
and a finer, lower, and much more gently sloping beach on
the inside. The amount of erosion is far greater, as it should
be, on the side of the powerful agencies.
   /. The loss to the lagoon by abrasion and solution is reduced
to a minimum, in the majority of atolls, by the absence of lagoon
entrances, which leaves them with only concealed leakage
passages for slow discharge.
    Nine tenths of atolls under six miles in length (or in longer
diameter), half of those between six and twenty miles, and
the majority of all atolls in the Pacific Ocean, have no en
trances to the lagoon a fathom deep ; and the larger part of
those included in each of these groups have no open entrances
at all.
    For evidence on this subject, I refer to the Wilkes Expedi
tion Hydrographic Atlas. This Atlas contains maps of nearly
 sixty coral-islands from the surveys of its officers, drawn on
a large scale (one or two miles, rarely four, to the inch).
    Out of the number, nine, ranging from 1£ to 3 English
miles in the longer diameter of the reef, have no lagoon, but
only a small depression in its place ; two of these take in
water at high tide, and the rest are dry.
    Of those under six miles in length liaving lagoons, seventeen
 in number, sixteen are represented as having no entrances to
 the lagoon at low tide ; and the one having an entrance is
 5x4 miles in size. The smallest is about a mile in diameter.
    Of those that are six miles or over in length, twenty-nine
 in number, seventeen have channels and twelve have none.

Those having channels are mostly over ten miles in length.
A list of them is here given with their sizes, and also the
proportion of the reef around the lagoon which is under water
above third tide, and bare at low tide, a feature of much
interest in this connection.

   g. The absence of open channels in so large a proportion of
lagoons, and especially in lagoons of the smaller atolls, appears
to be fatal to the abrasion-solution theory. The method of
enlarging atolls through currents and solution can act only
feebly, if at all, where waters have no free outlet ; and this is
eminently so with the smaller atolls which have been assumed
by the theory to be most favourable in purity of water and in
abundant life for progress ; if the small cannot grow, the
large lagoons cannot be made from them by the proposed
method.
   Reverse the method, letting the large precede the small (as
under the subsidence theory), and then we have a consistent
order of events. We have large atoll reefs with several
large entrances (like the great barrier- reef about a high island
in this and other respects) gradually contracting, and the
entrances concurrently narrowing through the growing corals
and the consolidating debris, in spite of the efforts of abrasion
and solution to keep them open and make them deeper ; and,
afterwards, the atoll becoming still smaller until the entrances
close up ; and, finally, the lagoon-basin is reduced to a dry
depression with nothing of the old sea-water remaining except,
perhaps, some of its gypsum.
   h. Instead of small lagoons having the purest waters, the
reverse is most decidedly and manifestly the fact, and this

290              Dr. J. D. Dana on the Ch-igin of
accords with the reversal in the history just suggested. Since
atolls of middle and larger size commonly have one third to
two thirds of the encircling reef covered with the sea at one-
third tide, making the ocean and lagoon for more than half
 the time continuous, the large lagoon in such a case has
as pure water as the ocean, and commonly as good a supply
 of food-life, and sometimes as brilliant a display of living
 corals. But in the smaller atolls, the area of the lagoon has
 little extent compared with the length and area of the encir
 cling reef ; coral-sands and other calcareous material con
 sequently have possession of the larger part of the bottom, and
 the waters, since they are less pure than those outside, contain
fewer and hardier kinds of corals and less life of other kinds.
They are exposed, also, to wider variations of temperature
than the outer, with injury to many species ; and at lowest
tides may become destructively overheated by the midday
sun, as many a plantation of corals with dead tops for a foot
or more bears evidence. In the smallest atolls, the lagoons
are liable also to alternations of excessive saltness from evapo
ration and excessive freshness from rains, and consequently
no corals can grow inside, though still flourishing well in the
shallow sea about the outer reef. The above are the facts,
not the suggestions of theory.
   i. We read :—" So great is the destructive and transporting
influence of the sea under the combined or antagonistic work
ing of tides, currents, and wind-waves that the whole mass of
the reef, as well as the flats and shoals inside, may be said to
be in more or less active movement "*. This description of
the Tortugas reefs is not applicable to the atolls of the Pacific.
Notwithstanding the testimony of Captain Beechey and others
about occasional catastrophes (which are mostly catastrophes
to the islets and banks within the lagoons), I was led to look
upon a coral-island as one of the most stable of structures.
The waves and currents have shaped its reef, shore-platform,
and beaches, fitting it well in all respects for its place by
means of the forces that were to assail it ; and an air of placid
repose, as it lies amid the breakers, is its most impressive
feature. Through the wind-made and tidal movements the
loose sands are drifted along the shores and over the reef ;
edges of the reef are broken off in gales or by earthquake
waves ; and occasionally a mushroom islet in the lagoon,
where growing corals are not compacted by wave-action, is
oveitbrown by the same means ; but beyond this the structure
is singularly defiant of the encroaching waters. Earthquakes
may bring devastation ; and so they may to other lands.

                              VI. Conclusion.
    With the theory of abrasion and solution incompetent, all
 the hypotheses of objectors to Darwin's theory are alike weak ;
 for all have made these processes their chief reliance, whether
appealing to a calcareous, or volcanic, or mountain-peak base
 ment for the structure. The subsidence which the Darwinian
 theory requires has not been opposed by the mention of any
 fact at variance wth it, nor by setting aside Darwin's arguments
 in its favour; and it has found new support in the facts from
 the 'Challenger's' soundings off Tahiti that had been put in
 array against it, and strong corroboration in the facts from
 the West Indies.
     Darwin's theory therefore remains as the theory that
accounts for the origin of coral reefs and islands.
                   VII. Central-Pacific Subsidence.
    Darwin, as has been said, took a step beyond direct obser
vation in his inference that the subsidence attested to by each
atoll extended over the intermediate seas and characterized a
 large central area of the ocean. He may be wrong here (and
 the writer with him), while not wrong in his theory. But,
 considering the distribution of the Pacific atolls in the ocean,
 their relation in this respect to the distribution of other
 Pacific lands, and the facts connected with the history of
 coral reefs and islands, the generalization appears to be well
 sustained. The question is here left without further argu
 ment, to be considered over the best geographical map of the
 ocean to be had, and the best bathymetrical map that can be
 made, only asking that the doubts which physical theory has
 set afloat may not be allowed by the geologist to warp the
judgment or cripple investigation*.
    My own agreement with Darwin as to the area of coral-
reef subsidence was promoted by an early personal study of
the oceanic lands. For more than five years previous to pass
ing my third decade I was ranging over the oceans, receiving
impressions from a survey of the earth's features. I was
   * One point often encountering an A priori doubt is the slowness of the
required subsidence. The subsidence over the Appalachian region which
preceded the making of the Appalachian Mountains amounted, according
to well-ascertained facts (as stated by Hall and Leslie), to at least 30,000
feet. The great trough, nearly a thousand miles long, was in progress
through all of Palaeozoic time. If the Palaeozoic ages covered only
20,000,000 years (a low estimate) the mean annual rate was 0-018 inch,
which is less than half a millimetre per vear. Such a fact is no evidence
as to the rate of the atoll-making suraid"ence; but, whatever the cause to
which the Appalachian subsidence is to be attributed, it is suggestive as
to possibilities and probabilities connected with the earth's movements.

292       Mr. J. Hopkinson on an unnoticed Danger in
made to see a system of arrangement in the Pacific islands,
instead of a " labyrinth      to appreciate the vast length of the
island-chains in the great ocean with their many parallelisms,
and the accordant relations subsisting between them and long
lines of atolls. I was thence led to observe the corresponding
system in the features of the continental lands, and the more
fully so when afterwards it was proved that Geology was not
in America merely the study of strata and fossils, but of the
successive stages in a growing continent. Thus a conception
of the earth as a unit became early implanted, and the idea
also of its development as a unit under movements as compre
hensive as the system in its feature-lines. My faith in any
mountain-making theory hitherto proposed is weak. But
that idea of system in structure and progress stands, and,
however much ignored by students of the earth's stratigraphy,
it must have its explanation in a true theory of the earth's
dynamics.
XXX. On an unnoticed Danger in certain Apparatus for Dis
      tribution of Electricity. By J. Hopkinson, F.R.S.*
MANY plans have been proposed, and several have been
         to a greater or less extent practically used, for combi
ning the advantage of economy arising from a high potential
in the conductors which convey the electric current from the
place where it is generated with the advantages of a low
potential at the various points where the electricity is used.
A low potential is necessary where the electricity is used ;
 partly because the lamps, whether arc or incandescent, each
 require a low potential, and partly because a high potential
 may easily become dangerous to life. Amongst the plans
 which have been tried for locally transforming a supply of
 high potential to a lower and safer, the most promising is by
 the use of secondary generators or induction-coils. It has
 been proved that this method can be used with great economy
 of electric power and with convenience ; under proper con
 struction of the induction-coils it may also be perfectly safe.
 It is, however, easy and very natural so to construct them
 that they shall be good in all other respects but that of safety
 to life—that they shall introduce an unexpected risk to those
 using the supply.
    In a distribution of electricity by secondary generators, an
 alternating current is led in succession through the primary
 coils of a series of induction-coils, one for each group or
 system of lamps. The lamps connect the two terminals of the
                  • Communicated by the Author.

        certain Apparatus for Distribution of Electricity. 293
secondary coil of the induction-coils. It is easy to so con
struct the induction-coils that the difference of potential
between the terminals of the secondary coils may be any
suitable number of volts, such as 50 or 100 ; whilst the
potential of the primary circuit, as measured between the
terminals of the dynamo machine, may be very great, e. g.
2000 or 3000 volts. If the electromagnetic action between
the primary and secondary coils, on which the useful effect of
the arrangement depends, were the only action, the supply
would be perfectly safe to the user so long as apparatus with
which he could not interfere was in proper order. But the
electromagnetic action is not the only one. Theoretically
speaking, every induction-coil is also a condenser, and the
primary coil acts electrostatically as well as electromagneti-
cally upon the secondary coil. This electrostatic action may
easily become dangerous if the secondary generator is so con
structed that its electrostatic capacity, regarded as a condenser,
is other than a very small quantity.

   Let us now consider the actual values likely to occur in
practice. Let the condenser E be a secondary generator ; let
the resistance R be that of some person touching some part of
the secondary circuit, and also making contact to earth with
some other part of the body ; rcmay be anything from 100 to 250,
say 150 ; K will depend on the construction of the secondary
generator—it may be as high as 0'3 microfarad or even more,
bat there would be no difficulty even in large instruments in
keeping it down to one hundredth of this or less. The mean
square of A will depend on the circumstances of other parts
of the circuit ; it might very easily be as great, or very nearly
as great, as the mean difference of potential between the ter
minals of the machine if the primary circuit were to earth
at C. Suppose, however, that the circuit BDC is symme
trical, that E is at one end, and that another person of the
same resistance as the person at E is touching the secondary
circuit of the secondary generator P at the other end of the
circuit. In that case, if 2400 be difference of potential of the
machine, mean square of A will be 1200 ; in which case we

Experiments are still wanting to show what current may be
considered as certain to kill a man, but it is very doubtful
whether anv man could stand 0-3 ampere for a sensible length
of time. It is probable that if the two persons both took firm
hold of the secondary conductors of E and F, both would
be killed. If the person at F be replaced by an accidental
dead earth on the secondary circuit of F, the person at E
 would experience a greater current than 0-3 ampere.
    It follows from the preceding consideration that secondary
 generators of large electrostatic capacity are essentially dan
 gerous, even though the insulation of the primary circuit and
 of the primary coils from the secondary coils is perfect. The
 moral is—for the constructor, Take care that the secondary
generators have not a large electrostatic capacity, say not

XXXI. On Supersaturation of Salt-Solutions. By W. W. J.
    NlCOL, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S., Lecturer on Chemistry, Mason
    College, Birmingham*,
IN my previous paper f on this subject I described experi
       ments which proved that a so-called supersaturated
solution was able to dissolve more of the salt it already con
tained, provided only that the salt was added in the dehydrated
state, and under conditions which precluded the possibility of
access of crystals of the hydrated salt. I also expressed the
opinion that a supersaturated solution is merely a solution of
the anhydrous salt which may, or may not, be saturated; and
that it differs in no way from an ordinaiy solution so long
as no disturbing cause operates to bring about the formation
of a hydrate which exists only in the solid state.
    Until I made the experiments described in the following
paper, I was of the opinion that although a hydrated salt
existed in solution in what may be termed an anhydrous state,
 still, when a dehydrated salt is dissolved in pure water,
 solution always took place in two stages—the first consisting
 of the hydration of the salt to form the solid hydrate, and that
 this was followed by solution accompanied by the decomposi
 tion of the hydrate thus formed ; but the experiments I am
 about to describe are, I think, conclusive, and show clearly
 that solut ion of the dehydrated salt in pure water is unattended
 by the formation of any hydrate, solid or liquid.
     Two similar wide-mouthed bottles, capable of holding some
 60 cubic centim. of water, were taken ; in each were placed
 25 cubic centim. of the same sample of distilled water, and in
 each a glass bulb containing 5 grins, of dehydrated Na2S04.
 One of the bottles (No. 1) was placed at once in the constant-
 temperature bath at 20° C. ; the other (No. 2) was placed in
 a water-bath which was raised to the boiling-point ; it was
 then, after cooling, placed alongside the first bottle. After
                     • Communicated by the Author,
                    t Phil. Mag. June 1885.

296                  Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on
some time the two bottles were taken out and shaken, so as to
break the bulbs and thus bring the dehydrated Na2S04 in
contact with the water. After a few seconds' shaking, the
salt was completely dissolved in bottle No. 2, which had been
heated ; but the salt in bottle No. 1 had caked into hard
masses, which dissolved only very slowly. In this case the
solid hydrate was formed ; while in the other, solution had
taken place without hydration.
   Another experiment with the same quantity of water, but a
larger amount (10 grms. of Na2S04 in both bottles), was
attended with a like result.
   A third experiment, with the same quantities of water and
salt as in the previous case, differed to some extent from it.
In both bottles solution was complete at once ; but the con
tents of the bottle which had not been heated crystallized out
again in a few seconds.
   A fourth experiment gave results identical with the second
experiment. In each of these three last experiments the
solution in bottle No. 2 was distinctly supersaturated, crystal-
   I have made numerous other experiments similar to the
above, and have never failed in obtaining a supersaturated
solution in this way. I noted that when special care was
taken in cleaning the bottles and fresh distilled water was
emploj'ed, it was frequently the case that the solution behaved
as in experiment No. 3 above ; but I shall return to this later.
   A saturated solution at 20° of the hydrated salt contains,
according to Mulder*, 19*5 parts of the anhydrous salt per
hundred parts of water. Thus, the supersaturated solutions I
prepared as above described contained more than twice as
much Na2S04 as a saturated solution prepared in the ordinary
way. It remained to be seen to what extent this supersatu-
ration may be pushed—in other words, to find the amount of
salt in a true saturated solution of Na2S04.
   A bottle containing 25 cubic centim. of water and 15 grms.
of Na2S04 sealed up in a bulb was treated as above, and after
shaking was allowed to remain in the bath at 20° for several
 hours. The stopper was then removed and some of the clear
solution was rapidly poured into a previously weighed platinum
 dish, and in this way the percentage of salt was obtained.
Two trials gave :—
      (1) 35"87 per cent.,~l corresponding to 55"63 parts
      (2) 35-61 per cent., J         per 100 parts of water.

Another experiment at 25° gave
              35'63 per cent. =55*35 per 100.
Another pair at 30° C. gave
               (2)     ^g;} =51-94 per 100;
while another at 33° C. gave
                           51-09 per 100.
   Before proceeding further I wish specially to lay stress on
the approximate nature of the above figures. They are all
necessarily high, for two reasons in particular. One is, that
it is impossible to filter the solution, for the instant it comes
in contact with the air crystallization commences ; thus, as it
is very dense and far from mobile, it is impossible to obtain
the solution perfectly clear. The second cause that raises the
percentage is, that a very considerable evolution of heat ac
companies the solidification, and thus some of the water is
driven off, even -when the dish is covered. In spite of this
the figures show clearly enough a decrease in solubility as the
temperature rises.
   As is well known, the solubility-curve of Na2S04 ascends
rapidly to a point about 33° 0. (Mulder 32a75, Kopp 32a93)
and then descends slowly to 100° C, after which it rises
again*. This change of solubility at 33° C. is usually ascribed
to the dissociation of the decahydrate at that temperature;
but I shall return to this. The most reliable data relating to
the solubility of Na2S04 are those given by Gay-Lussact and
MulderJ. From the results of Gay-Lussac's experiments
Kopp§ constructed the following interpolation-formula?.
    Below 30° C. The quantity dissolved in parts per 100 is
      (I.) Q= 5-02 + 0-30594 1-0-00041 12 + 0-0009977f3.
Above 40°,
   (II.) Q = 58-5-0-27783 1 + 0-00069 1* + 0-0000049802 ts.
And the point of intersection of the two curves Is given by
         -00009927*3 + 0-0011 f -0-58377 1 + 53-48 = 0 ;
whence                        f= 32-93.
   Now the agreement of the figures found by both Gay-Lussac
and Mulder with the values calculated by Kopp's formula? is
very complete, as is shown by the table, where Mulder's results
are compared with Kopp's figures.

    The lower half of the table compares the results I obtained
 as described above, compared with the figures obtained from
 Kopp's second formula extended below 33° C. ; and the con
 cordance here is, I venture to think, thoroughly satisfactory
 when the difficulties attending such determinations are taken
 into account. My results will also be found to agree well
 with those of Loewel*, who determined the solubility at 20°,
 and 25°, and 30° of the anhydrous salt by heating an excess
 of the decahydrate and water abovo 33°, and then allowing
 the solution thus obtained to cool in contact with the separated
anhydrous salt*
    These experiments conclusively prove the truth of my con
 tention, that a so-called supersaturated solution differs in no
way whatever from an ordinary solution. The arguments
advanced in the previous paper on this subject were incom
plete in one point. They left room for the objection that a
 solution of sodium sulphate might, for all we know, have a
different constitution, after heating and cooling, from that
 possessed by~a similar solution that lias not been heated. To
 such a change of constitution has been ascribed the possibility
 of the existence of supersaturated solutions; but now that
supersaturated solutions have been prepared from cold water
and cold dehydrated Na2S04, and have been found pre
cisely similar to those prepared with the aid of heat, this
theory falls to the ground, and there is no reason for regard
ing them as anything but ordinary solutions of the anhvdrous
salt.
   Why, then, do these solutions crystallize when brought in
contact with the air ? or why is it that they cannot be pre-
                  • Ann. de Chim. et Phys. [3] xlix.

                 Supersaturation of Salt-Solutions.           299
pared from water and dehydrated salt without heating these
out of contact with the air ? and what effect has this heating ?
   There is no doubt that one, if not the sole, cause which
brings about crystallization of a supersaturated solution is the
presence of a crystal of the hydrated salt; and it is for this
reason that supersaturated solutions can exist only out of con
tact with the air of the laboratory. This also is the reason
that the water and anhydrous salt must be heated before they
are brought in contact ; for minute crystals of the solid hy
drate may lie hid in the scratches in the neck of the bottle or
in the mass of dehydrated salt, and these must be heated above
 33° before they are decomposed, and so lose their power of
determining the union of the dehydrated salt and the water
with which it is brought in contact. The fact that no hydra
tion of the salt takes place before solution is conclusively
proved, not only by the formation of a supersaturated solution
which cannot exist in the presence of undissolved hydrate,
but also by the fact that the finely powdered dehydrated salt
dissolves at once ; or if excess be present, the portion remain
ing undissolved retains its powdery form, no caking together
or change in appearance taking place.
    Finally, a very considerable rise of temperature, attends the
 solution of the salt quite equal to—so far as it is possible to
judge without quantitative determination of its amount—if not
 actually greater than, that attending the solution of the dehy
 drated salt under ordinary conditions. Now, as shown above,
 there is no hydration, and the question remains—To what is
 this change of temperature due ? This cannot be fully answered
 until our knowledge of the volume and temperature changes
 attending the solution of the dehydrated salt is more complete
 than at present. The probable explanation however is, I ven
 ture to suggest, to be found in the great contraction attending
 the act of solution. According to the most reliable determi
 nations, the density of Na2S04 (solid) is 2-G618 at 20° C.
 This gives the molecular volume 53-35. But, as shown in my
 previous paper, the molecular volume of Na2S04 (dissolved)
 in a solution containing 6-244 molecules of salt (that is, 49"26
 per 100) is 32'79. A saturated solution, as shown above,
 contains not more than 55"6' per 100, and the molecular volume
 in such a solution cannot exceed 33"5. The contraction, then,
 attending the solution of one gramme-molecule of NaaS04 is
 53-4 — 33*5 = 19-9, or nearly 20 cubic centim.,or about 40 per
 cent. ; a quantity possibly sufficient to account for the thermal
 change, exceeding, as it does, the volume-change on solution
 of other anhydrous salts, which dissolve with either a slight
 rise or fall of temperature. For a further extension of this
 argument reference must be made to the papers of Miiller

 Textbook of Practical Physics. By E. T. Glazebeook, M.A., F.R.S.,
    and W. N. Shaw, M.A. Loudon : Longmans, Green, and Co.
    (482 pp.).
 rPHE development of practical work as a necessary part of the
       teaching of science in its various branches is a very healthy
 sign of the times, and promises well for the advantages we may
 expect from the increased study of science which has marked the
 last twenty years. Formerly such things as laboratories for the
 practical study of Biology, Physics, &e. were almost unknown in
 England, except in a few of the more advanced educational insti
 tutions, and Chemistry was apparently the only science thought
 worthy of being studied practically. Now there are numerous
 well-equipped laboratories for the practical study of Physics ; aud it
 is for the use of teachers and students in such that this book is
 intended, and it will be welcomed by all teachers of the subject as
 supplying a much felt want. The Authors, in marking out the
 limits of their work, had to decide between attempting to give
 instructions equally applicable to all the different forms of instru
 ments to be met with in different laboratories, which must of
necessity have been very vague, and adhering to the descriptions of
the precise instruments in use in their own laboratory ; and have
decided, we think very wisely, in adopting the latter course, trust
ing that the necessity for adaptation to corresponding instruments
used elsewhere will not seriously impair the usefulness of the book.
Their general aim has been to place before the reader a description
of a course of experiments which shall not only enable him to
obtain a practical acquaintance with methods of measurement, but
also, as far as possible, illustrate the more important principles of
the various subjects. There are two valuable introductory chap
ters—one on the units employed and their dimensions, the other
on the arithmetic of numbers expressing approximate measure
ments. We may quote, as an example, the application of the
principles of this chapter to find the efEect on the value of a current,
as deduced from observations with the tangent-galvanometer, of an
error of a quarter of a degree in the reading.
   The formula of reduction is
                             C=fctan0.
Suppose an error 2 has been made in the reading of 0, so that the
observed value is
                          C'=fctan(fl + g).
It is shown that when 2 is less than a certain small value, this is

   The different forms of balance, determinations of specific gravity,
and the mechanics of solids, liquids, and gases occupy 110 pages ;
various experiments connected with sound, 16 pages ; the thermo
meter, determinations of expansion, specific and latent heat, and
hygrometry, 58 pages ; experiments with light, 100 pages ; and
the rest of the book (130 pages) is taken up with magnetism, elec
tricity, and electromagnetism. The theories of the balance and
thermometer are given with unusual completeness ; and the chapter
on hygrometry forms a complete elementary treatise upon the sub
ject. But perhaps the most important part of the book is that
which relates to electricity, in which full and clear instructions are
given for the comparison and measurement of currents, resistances,
and electromotive forces, capacities of condensers, and so on. It
should be noticed that the book is well up to date. Thus, for
example, we have, in the description of Carey Foster's method of
employing the B.A. form of Wheatstone bridge, an account of
Dr. Fleming's form of bridge, described in the Proceedings of the
Physical Society, and in this Magazine for May 1884.

           ON THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF ALCOHOL.
                        BY M. G. FOUSSEREAU.
T EXAMINED the specific resistances of alcohol, and its mixture
    with water and with salts, by comparing them with the known
resistance of a pencil-mark drawn on a plate of ebonite. I used
M. Lippmann'e method, and the experimental arrangement which I
employed in several previous researches *. Different specimens of
the absolute alcohol of commerce gave, at the temperature 15°, spe
cific resistances comprised between 2-47 and 3-68 megohms. These
differences may, d priori, be ascribed either to the presence of a

  trace of water, or to the solution of substances from the sides of
  the receiver.
     In order to estimate the degree of influence of these various
  causes, I first added to specimens of the same alcohol increasing
  weights of distilled water, the resistance of which was nearly ten
  times less than that of the alcohol used. I ascertained that the
  resistance of the mixtures thus obtained goes on decreasing, and
  attains a maximum which does not much differ from the resistance
  of water, when there is not more than 3 per cent, of water, and
  then increases up to the resistance of water. But a notable alte
  ration of composition is always necessary to produce a distinct
  change in the resistance of the mixture. The difference between
  the numbers cited above cannot therefore be ascribed to the small
 quantity of water which commercial absolute alcohol might retain.
     If, on the contrary, a trace of a standard solution of chloride of
  sodium is added, an enormous alteration is produced in the resist
  ances. A fall in the ratio of 1 : 0*527 is obtained by the addition
 of a weight of salt representing 2,600,000 *Qa* °f alcohol. We are
 thus led to attribute the variations to the absorption by the alcohol
  of some ten millionths of salts from the vessel which contains it.
     I have, in fact, observed that the conductivity of alcohol increases
 in glass vessels more rapidly than that of water. It may double
 in a few hours. Absolute alcohol prepared with great care and
 kept for two years iu a closed and full glass vessel in the chemical
 laboratory of the Ecolo Normale was ten times as good a conductor
 as commercial absolute alcohol. Burnt upon a platinum plate, this
 alcohol coloured the flame yellow. It contained a trace of soda
 salts from the glass.
     I endeavoured to avoid these alterations by dispensing with the
 use of glass vessels ; and with this view I had absolute alcohol
 collected in porcelain vessels in the manufactory of M. Billault. I
 have observed the resistance to increase, and for the specimens in
 question to 5*14 and 5*44 megohms at 15°. The second specimen,
 contained in biscuit porcelain, retained a remarkable constancy for
 several days.
    M. Delachanal was kind enough to prepare for me, by a series of
 distillations, alcohol at its minimum density like that which is used
for determining the point 100 of the new alcoholometers. Two
specimens of this were sent to me, one in a porcelain and the other
iu a glass vessel.* The former gave at 15° the resistance 7*031
megohms, the greatest I have observed; the other, which was
already altered by the glass, was 2*823 megohms. A fresh specimen,
prepared in the same way six days after the first and kept in a por
celain vessel, gave 6*899 megohms, only differing from the other
by -jJf of the value. Although traces of dissolved salts cannot ap
preciably alter the density of alcohol, it might be desirable to distil
and preserve in porcelain receptacles the alcohol intended for
delicate chemical operations.
    I have also examined the changes which alcohol experiences
when its temperature varies. I found that the resistance dimi
nishes in the mean by 0*0145 of its value, when the temperature is

raised through one degree, near the ordinary temperatures. This
variation is not proportional to that of the coefficient of internal
friction, as is the case with distilled water ; and for salts this latter
quantity varies, in fact, 0'0210 of a degree at the same temperature.
The mechanism of conductivity is therefore more complex for alcohol
than for salts and their aqueous solution.

THE VOLCANIC NATURE OF A PACIFIC ISLAND NOT AN ARGUMENT
        FOR LITTLE OR NO SUBSIDENCE. BY J. D. DANA*.
   In the remarks on this point in § 13 (Part I.) of my paper on
the Origin of Coral Keefs and Islands, I refer to the great depths
found in the ocean by soundings in the vicinity of .Hawaii, and
speak of the facts as favouring the idea of more subsidence about
that south-eastern end of the group than along the north-western,
although the latter is the coral-island end. Another example of
similar character, but more striking, is afforded by the region of
the Ladrones. This north- and-south range of islands has its
largest volcanic islands in the southern part, and dwindles in the
opposite direction to islands which are little more than tufa conest ;
and 200 miles south of Guam, the largest island, the ' Challenger '
found a depth of 4475 fathoms (26,850 feet), one of the deepest
regions of the ocean. It hence may be that Guam, like Hawaii, is
a large island, not because of small subsidence, but because of con
tinued eruptions that made it large in spite of the sinking that was
in progress. The question arises how far the depths in these par
ticular cases are due to the undermining effects of volcanic eruption.
There are coral islands both north-east of the deep region, near
Guam, and also of large size, to the south-west and south-east, not
three degrees off ; the former, those of an extension of the Pelew
range, and the latter, islands of the Caroline archipelago.
  ON THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICAL ELEMENTARY PARTICLES.
                             BY E. BUDDE.
   There exists an attempt by HerwigJ to estimate the magnitude
of electrical elementary particles ; which, however, is open to the
objection of making some very arbitrary assumptions, and more
over of confounding the ideas of "mass" and "quantity" of
particles. I believe that the following simple considerations lead
to a tolerably certain result for the quantity of electrical "atoms."
   In the sphere of ponderable masses Ave find that a definite body,
such as carbon, always enters into combination with a definite
relative weight, twelve. From this and from similar observations
with all other masses we conclude that carbon consists of atoms,
and that each of its atoms has the relative weight twelve. If we

were in a position to deal with separate atoms, experiment would
not only refer to the relative weight of carbon atoms, but we
should see that carbon enters into all combinations with multiples
of a definite absolute weight ; the above conclusions would then
shape themselves more definitely, and experiment would directly
teach us the absolute value of the atomic weight of carbon.
   We propose to ourselves the questions, (1) Are there in nature
discrete elementary particles of electricity ? (2) What is their mag
nitude? According to the analogy of the conclusions just drawn
for carbon, this question may be auswered as follows :—If there are
in nature discrete elementary particles of electricity, it is to be ex
pected that an absolutely definite, very small quantity of electricity
occurs, and plays an important part in a large number of processes.
If experiment shows us such an amount, then that amount of elec
tricity is the probable quantity of the particles of electricity. The
region in which we must investigate, is that of those processes in
which electricity interacts with ponderable atoms, and defines the
action of those ponderable atoms—that is to say, the region of
electrolytical decompositions and combinations.
   Here we meet with Faraday's law, which, referred to individual
atoms, may be expressed as follows :—
   Let KA be an electrolyte, which is separated by the voltaic cur
rent into the parts K and A, of which each has the valency n ; let
q be the quantity of positive electricity which goes with each sepa
rate atom or radical K to the kathode ; q / n is then for all bodies
and for all currents the same absolutely definite magnitude.
   On the basis of the above we may also say : q j n is the absolute
quantity of an elementary particle of electricity with the same pro
bability with which twelve is the relative atomic weight of carbon.
   q I n can be easily calculated. Let h be the magnetic intensity of
that current which in unit time liberates a milligramme of hydrogen,
ch its intensity in mechanical measure, N the number of molecules
of hydrogen in a milligramme ; the milligramme contains then 2N
atoms, and these bring the quantity ch/2 of positive electricity to
the kathode, by which n= 1. Hence the quantity which is attached
to an atom is                         ^
In this we have approximately* in mm.,mg.,sec., c = 3,10",fc=957;
and further, according to the theory of gases, N=14-101'. This
S1™                E= 0-00000051 mg* mmJ sec.-'.
   This value is thus the probable "Atomic quantity of Electricity."
It may be a multiple, but with the same probability with which
C = 12, and not 6, or 3, is E the quantity of electrical elementary
particles. For even if electricity can be split into smaller parts
than E, it is not clear why such a smaller part is never met with
in experiment.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 8, 1885.

                       By F. Stenger*.
                            [Plate IX.]
THE present research has two objects. In the first part,
     the author endeavours to show, partly by use of the
unusually rich literature of the subject, and partly from his
own researches, that there exists no distinction universally
applicable between the arc-discharge and the glow-discharge.
  Upon what factor the appearance of the one or other of the
two forms depends, and under what experimental conditions
the two forms of discharge can pass into each other, will form
the subject of the second part.
                              Pabt I.
   I may be allowed, in the first place, briefly to place together
the essential characters of the arc-discharge as distinguished
from the glow-discharge ; and for this purpose I confine
myself entirely to the normal form of discharge.
   (1) The gas-stratum in the arc-discharge possesses a much
smaller resistance than in the glow-discharge.
   (2) In the arc-light the anode is more strongly heated
than the kathode, whereas in the glow-light the reverse is
the case.
   (3) In the spectrum of the arc-light, the light due to the
substance of the electrodes overpowers that of the stratum of
gas between them ; while, on the other hand, in the glow-dis-

 306                   M. F. Stenger on the Electric
 charge the spectrum shows only the lines of the stratum of
 gas, and the nature of the electrodes is a matter of indifference.
     (4) In the arc both electrodes become disintegrated
 although in different degree, whilst with the glow-discharge
 disintegration takes place only at the kathode.
     § 1. On the Kesvttance of the Stratum of Gas.—With the
 glow-discharge in exhausted gases it is, according to Hittorf*,
 the first two layers of the kathode-light which oppose
 resistance to the passage of the electric current, in comparison
 with which the resistance of the positive brush-discharge is
 very small.
    Since, as the pressure decreases, both layers continually
 expand, the resistance of the kathode-light increases simul
 taneously. When Hittorf passed, on the other hand, to higher
 pressures of gas, the thickness of the glow-light decreased
 and the strength of current increased. With a vacuum-tube
 filled with nitrogen of about 17 millim. pressure, there
 appeared, as with high exhaustion, as soon as the circuit
 was completed, a glow-light of 1 millim. thickness upon the
 kathode of 17 millim. length, which speedily heated the
 wire to bright redness, which increased to a white heat
 sufficient to fuse the thick iridium electrode. If the density
 of the gas was still further increased, the anode also became
 white hot, and at the pressure of 53 millim. the anode was
 even hotter than the kathode. At the same time the strength
 of the current increased continuously up to 2 amperes, a
 current-strength not greatly different from that obtained
 with the arc-light. Certain other observations of Hittorf t
and Goldstein J, however, show very clearly that if the
experimental conditions are favourable, the resistance of the
gas in the glow-light is of the same order as in the Davy
arc-light.
    Hittorf employed as kathode a platinum coil heated by
means of a strong current passed through it, and found that
the resistance remained unaltered as long as the platinum was
only red hot, but that the sudden diminution of resistance
occurred as soon as it became white hot, which continued as
the temperature of the platinum rose. If the experiment was
carried out in the same way with a Carre's carbon-rod, it was
possible to obtain a discharge from 10 small elements with the
electrodes 4 centims. apart. At a distance of 15 centims.,
40 elements gave a constant current of ^0 ampere. When
Hittorf employed as kathodes the carbons of the Davy arc,
the action was much greater. If, on the other hand, the anode
      * Wied. Ann. xxi. p. 97 (1884).   t Ibid. xxi. p. 133 (1884).

was strongly heated, no change in the current-strength could
be recognized.
   Goldstein has obtained exactly similar results. It appears
therefore from these investigations that it is only necessary to
employ suitable experimental conditions, in order to obtain
with the glow-discharge currents of the same order of magni
tude as with the arc-light.
   § 2. Does the temperature of the electrodes in the arc-
discharge depend upon the pressure and nature of the
surrounding gas ?
   Gassiot was the first to make observations on the different
temperature of the electrodes. A few years later Grove *
investigated the behaviour of the arc-light in different gases,
and in a vacuum such as could be obtained at that time. His
results only partially agree with my observations. According
to Grove, the temperature of both electrodes is the same in
hydrogen or in nitrogen, or in a tolerably perfect vacuum,
judging from the colour and rapidity of cooling. But, as he
himself remarks, in an atmosphere of hydrogen he only
succeeded with carbon electrodes in maintaining the arc
constant for any time, so that his result that then the electrodes
show no difference in temperature cannot be considered of
any great weight. I have also endeavoured in vain to obtain
a constant arc-light between metallic electrodes in an atmo
sphere of hydrogen. As Liveing and Dewarf have remarked,
the length of the arc is much less in hydrogen than in air, and
hence a small increase in the distance of the electrodes apart
extinguishes the light. But that the temperature of the
electrodes may be very greatly different, when the current
is closed only for a short time, and when it is maintained
burning, appears clearly from the statement of Moigno, that
after contact between the electrodes has been broken for pro
 duction of the arc, first white light flashes out from the point
 of the negative electrode, and only then does the positive
 begin to glow. With carbon electrodes, on the other hand, I
 have established by a series of experiments that in hydrogen,
 as in nitrogen, the anode always possesses a higher temperature
 than the kathode, although the difference may not be so
 marked as in air. There would appear then to be some
 ground for Grove's suggestion that secondary phenomena play
 a part in gases which contain oxygen. That in observations
 of this kind the arc should be maintained for some minutes,
 before making the comparison of temperatures, appears from
 the fact that both carbons are often seen to cool simultaneously,

308               M. F. Stenger on tlie Electric
when the are has been interrupted immediately after its
establishment. Most of these experiments have been made with
an extremely simple form of apparatus, which permits working
with pure gases in very various pressures, since the movement
of the electrodes can be effected without the use of stoppers,
which are never absolutely air-tight. The apparatus (fig. 1)
consists of a bulb with two tubes blown on to it ; each of the
tubes is further provided with a tube at the side, of which the
one communicated with a Bessel-Hagen air-pump and the other
with the apparatus for evolving the gas. The ends of the
tubes are provided with caps fitted by grinding, carrying the
electrodes, and the electrodes may be brought into contact
and separated again, so to form the arc, by simply turning
these caps.
   This arrangement, however, could not be used for experi
ments with an arc of greater length. In these cases I have
employed another arrangement, represented in fig. 2 in simple
form. A tube (6) 1 centim. wide and 80 centim. long, was
melted on to the centre bulb-shaped part a, and communicated
by means of an india-rubber tube with a second tube V of
similar dimensions. The short side-tube c communicated
with the mercury-pump. At the top a short tube d, also
1 centim. wide but 10 centim. long, was melted on, upon which
a wide tube e was placed, from which lastly a tube/, 80 centims.
long, led downwards and was connected with another (g) by
means of an india-rubber tube. One of the two electrodes (the
apparatus was used only with carbon points) was inserted in
the tube d, so that its end reached to the middle of the bulb-
shaped portion, and was held in position by means of four
copper bars, attached to a copper ring which was clamped
close to the carbon. The wide tube e was then melted
together at the top. The current was conducted to the
upper carbon by means of mercury which filled the system
of tubes /, g and the space between c and d, and surrounded
the four copper wires. The lower carbon floated on mercury
in the tube b, so that the distance between the carbons could
be altered by simply raising or lowering V.
   It appeared to me of importance by means of this apparatus
to control the statement of Grove, that in a vacuum the two car
bons show no difference or very little difference in temperature.
For this purpose air, which had been repeatedly and care
fully dried, was introduced into the apparatus and exhausted by
means of the air-pump to a pressure of less than ^ millim.
As soon as the current of the Gramme machine had established
the arc-light, a considerable increase of pressure took place
in consequence of evolution of gas from the glowing carbons.

                      Conductivity of Gases.                309
The level of mercury in the communicating tubes b b' con
sequently sank, and the distance of the electrodes increased
considerably, often up to 2 centims., without extinguishing the
light. On the contrary, the light was remarkably steady.
The temperature of the carbons was then only a little different,
but the difference could be recognized with certainty, and
upon interruption of the current the kathode ceased to glow
somewhat sooner than the anode. When the arc had been
several times restored, the apparatus being each time exhausted
as much as possible, the evolution of gas gradually decreased ;
and when at last no further increase in pressure could be
perceived, the difference in temperature between the carbons
disappeared at the same moment. But since the slow disin
tegration of the electrodes continually exposes new portions
to ignition, I have not succeeded in obtaining pressures
under 1 to 2 millim., so that it remains undetermined whether
 at still lower pressures the kathode would be more strongly
ignited than the anode.
    In the usual forms of glow-discharge it is always observed
 that the kathode becomes red or even white hot, while the
anode remains dark. That, however, forms of glow-dis
 charge exist in which the temperature of the anode is higher
than that of the kathode appears from the experiments of
 Hittorf described in the first paragraph.
    § 3. The Spectrum of the Arc and of the Carbons.—If we
 observe the spectrum of the arc-light as it is formed in
 atmospheric air of ordinary pressure, it appears continuous,
 except that we occasionally see a few metallic lines appear.
 But at the moment that the current is interrupted, a very
 large number of bright lines blaze up, which have their
 origin in the mineral impurities of the carbon. Spectroscopic
 observations of the carbon-light are made more conveniently
 by producing the arc in vacuo, and with comparatively feeblo
 currents ; we have then at once the advantage that the
  distance between the carbons may be increased to 1 centim.
  without the arc becoming broken, and that consequently the
  spectrum of the kathode, anode, and arc can be easily
  observed separately.     But the main advantage is that the
  extraordinarily intense continuous spectrum of the particles of
  carbon which exist in the arc at a brilliant white heat, does
  not then obliterate the bright lines of the metallic vapours
  present in the arc.
     It has always been supposed that the gaseous atmosphere
 in which the arc-light is produced is without influence upon
  the spectrum of the arc ; Liveing and Dewar * first observed
              • Proc. Hoy. Soc. vol. xxxv. p. 75 (1883).

  310             M. F. Stenger on the Electric
  the lines C and F in the arc produced by the alternating
  current of a De Meritens machine in an atmosphere of
  hydrogen ; but with the continuous current of a Siemens
  machine, on the other hand, only the line 0 was observed at the
  moment of interrupting the current, and the F line not even
 then distinctly. The reason of this behaviour is to be found
  only in the overpowering brilliancy of the spectrum of the
 white-hot particles of carbon ; for in my experiments in vacuo
 the hydrogen lines as well as the metallic lines stood out extra
 ordinarily sharply from the bright background of the arc
 just the same, whether the apparatus had been filled with
 hydrogen or with dry air. If, on the other hand, we observe
 the light emitted by the electrodes themselves, the phenomena
 are essentially different according to circumstances. I will
 endeavour briefly to describe the process. If the carbons
 had been already in use for some time, so that the small
 quantities of gas set free from them by the high temperature
 no longer produced any rapid change in the pressure, the
 image of the arc of light was thrown by an assistant upon
 the slit of the collimator of the telescope by tho aid of an
 achromatic lens, and the light from the upper or under carbon
 was cut off from the slit by means of a suitable screen. If
 the current used was weak, the spectrum of the carbon was
 feeble, and showed at first no bright lines ; after a short time,
 however, the hydrogen lines as well as a number of metallic
 lines became sharply visible, first on the one carbon and then
 on the other. The cause of these sudden changes is to be
sought, no doubt, in the fact that the arc does not burn
uniformly round both carbons, so that the parts of the carbon
points turned towards the collimator at times glow intensely,
at times are only feebly luminous. If the current is strong,
the spectrum of the carbons is a continuous one.
    It results from the observations described that hydrogen
is set free at both carbons ; we thus obtain a confirmation of
the conclusion that the carbons employed for electric lighting
always contain hydrocarbons, which the high temperature of
the arc decomposes, partially at least. The investigations of
Dewar * have shown that it is impossible to free carbon from
hydrogen compounds, even by lengthened heating in a current
of chlorine. We are altogether ignorant what composition
these compounds may have, or what changes they may suffer,
at the high temperature of the arc, except that there is no
doubt of the formation of acetylene in the arc in hydrogen, as
shown by Bcrthelot. But whether in this case we have really
               * Proc. Roy. Soc. xxx. p. 87 (1880).

                      Conductivity of Gases.                  311
to do with a synthesis of carbon and hydrogen to C2H2, or
whether acetylene is not also formed in a vacuum, and con
sequently we have to imagine a partial decomposition of the
hydrocarbons present in the carbons, appears still uncertain.
   § 4. The Disintegration of the Electrodes.—Under the usual
conditions of research the process of disintegration produced
by the glow-discharge is confined to the kathode ; as far as
this extends the glass wall of the vacuum tube is covered with
an extraordinarily thin reflecting deposit, which forms very
quickly when thin platinum wires are used. The surface of
the electrode after some use is found to be eaten away into
fine points and hairs, as is seen most distinctly with the
difficultly volatile aluminium.
    But when Hittorf sent the current of his battery without
interposed resistances through a vacuum-tube filled with
hydrogen or nitrogen at about 50 millim. pressure, both
iridium electrodes became white-hot, and even began to melt ;
at the same time the glow-light disappeared from the kathode,
and with it the metallic deposit. Hence it appears to me
that we must ascribe the metallic mirror formed in normal
 cases, not to a superficial volatilization produced by the high
 temperature of the glow-light, but to some peculiar action of
 the glow-light. An observation of Dewar's would seem to
 show the same thing, that a metallic deposit formed with
 magnesium electrodes disappeared again some time after the
 interruption of the current ; possibly the gaseous molecules,
 whilst conveying the glow-discharge, possess greater affinities,
 and form compounds with the metal of which the kathode
 consists, which under favourable conditions are again gradually
 absorbed by the electrode. Warren De La Rue and H. Miiller
 obtained a similar result with palladium electrodes in hydrogen-
 tubes. Under the experimental conditions, however, where
 both electrodes are heated to intense whito heat and even to
 the melting-point, both emit metallic vapours, as occurs in
 a greater degree in the arc-light between metallic electrodes.
    That with this latter mode of discharge the volatilization
 of the electrodes takes place as well in air as in other cases
 and in vacuo has long been known. The high temperature
 of the electrodes is the chief cause of their wasting away,
 and the loss is only secondarily due to combustion. In air,
 in consequence of this higher temperature the anode is used up
  more rapidly than the kathode ; and, further, the electrodes
  become disintegrated so much the more rapidly the more
 volatile they are.
     The process is somewhat more complicated with the carbon
 light. With very powerful currents (400 to 500 Bunsen

312                 M. F. Stenger on the Electric
elements) according to Despretz *, the carbon of the electrodes
is changed into vapour, and on the surface of the carbon are
seen certain round globules molten together. With feebler
currents, such as are generally employed for electric lighting,
there can be no possibility ofthe volatilization of the electrodes.
As already remarked, all these carbons contain hydrocarbons ;
at the high temperature these become decomposed and leave
the electrode as a porous mass of carbon, which gradually
crumbles away. In my apparatus (fig. 2) accordingly I
found numerous carbon particles imbedded in the fine
deposit on the glass walls, which easily dissolved in nitric
acid, and must therefore have consisted of compounds of
carbon, and not of carbon itself.
    Since, further, in a vacuum no difference of temperature
between the electrodes could be detected, the waste becomes
equal from both, disregarding, of course, differences in the
porosity and composition of the carbons.
    Collecting, then, the results so far obtained, we see that
there exists no certain criterion by which to distinguish a given
discharge as glow-discharge or arc-discliarge, but these very
different typical forms pass insensibly into each other.
    Before passing from this first part to the intimately
connected considerations of the second, I wish to mention in
§ 5 an observation, which appears to me to be not without
interest.
    § 5. On Changes of Pressure in the Arc-light.—According to
Warren De La Rue and H. Miiller t, an increase of pressure
occurs in the arc-light upon completing the circuit, which
disappears immediately upon interrupting the current.
    According to their data the increase of pressure at an initial
pressure of 1£ to 28 millim. amounted to from 25 to 50 per cent.
Nevertheless some doubt remains as to the existence of the
phenomenon, since the experiments J hardly leave it doubtful
that the authors did not work with a normal arc-light. By
accident I made an observation which seems to show in
 fact that the discharge produced a momentary increase iu
 pressure. I had led hydrogen into the apparatus shown in
fig. 4, so that the pressure amounted to about 50 millim. : as
soon as, by raising the mercury, contact between the carbons
had been established and the arc had been formed, the level
 of mercury sank, and with it the lower carbon, until the
length of the arc amounted to 3 centim. Fig. 3 may
represent the appearance of the arc at this length. The

centre is surrounded by a helmet-shaped strongly luminous
envelope, about which again is a less luminous layer. Then
suddenly the lower carbon rose, and came into contact with
the upper one, and the process began anew. This occurred
some 50 times in a minute. Evidently an increase of
pressure occurred which increased the distance between the
carbons, so that the arc was extinguished ; but immediately
the pressure returned to its former magnitude, and the
carbons came into contact again.
   This phenomenon would be very well explained by the
hypothesis of A. Schuster *, according to which the process
of electric discharge in gases is accomplished by the dis
sociation of the molecules, but that as soon as the current is
interrupted the old condition of the gas is restored.
                                Past II.
   The final result of the first part of our investigation was
 that the arc-discharge and glow-discharge cannot be sharply
distinguished, and that in particular the usually enormous
difference in the resistance of the layer of gas does not always
exist. In this second part I shall endeavour to show upon
 what conditions the different magnitude of resistance depends,
 and that the same cause is at work in all cases of gaseous
 discharge in which the resistance of the gas is small. It will
 be the more convenient at once to state my view, and then to
 show that it is correct in particular cases (§ 6-11).
    When in gaseous discharge the resistance of the gas is small,
 hot metallic vapours are present which conduct the current.
    § 6. I would first of all recall certain experiments which
 show that incandescent metallic vapours conduct infinitely
 better than nitrogen, hydrogen, or air.
    De La Rue t employed for this purpose a globe-shaped
 vessel with four tubulatures ; two opposite each other served
 as electrodes of an induction-coil, and the two others for the
 production of the arc ; the pressure of the nitrogen amounted
 to from 2 to 3 millim.
    A galvanometer included in the induction-circuit served to
 measure the current-strength, before the voltaic arc was
 formed. Then the arc-light was produced, and the new
 current-strength read off.
    The result obtained was a great increase in the conducting
 power, when the arc passed between silver and copper elec
 trodes ; the change was less with aluminium electrodes, and
   • Proc. Roy. Soc. xxxvii. p. 317 (1884).
   t Phil. Mag. iv. pp. 29, 563 (1805) ; Comptes Rendu*, be. p. 1002(1865).

314               M. F. Stenger on the Electric
 feeblest with zinc, cadmium, or magnesium poles. The
increase in conductivity was very remarkable with carbon
 poles. On the other hand, iron and platinum electrodes gave
no perceptible difference ; whence it results that the increase
in conductivity in the other cases cannot be brought about
by the high temperature of the nitrogen. The experiment
is, however, so far unfavourable, and allows no conclusion to
be drawn as to the true conductivity of the different metallic
vapours, since, as Hittorfs work sufficiently proves, the chief
resistance of the glow-discharge occurs in the neighbourhood
of the kathode ; and with the great distance between the
electrodes in De La Rue's experiment, the formation of
metallic vapours takes place exclusively in the neighbourhood
of the positive brush-discharge.
    Moreover, it is to be remembered that in an experimental
arrangement of this kind we have to consider, not only what
metallic vapours are present, but without doubt also their
quantity, that a less volatile metal may therefore afford better
conduction than a more volatile one, although the true con
ductivity, in the first case, may be far worse than in the
second.
   As a second proof of the relatively good conducting-power
of two metallic vapours, I may quote certain observations of
Hittorfs * :—" At the temperatures of our flames, at which
the gases of which they consist possess so considerable an
electric resistance, other vapours have a much greater con
ductivity. Of all gases, the vapour of potassium conducts
best. Next comes sodium. The other metals, so far as they
are volatile under these conditions, produce, in the state of
gas, little change in the deflection."
   Hittorf shows in another place that mercury vapour, in the
non-luminous Bunsen flame, conducts much worse than
potassium vapour.
   That most metals in the Bunsen burner produce no percep
tible change in the resistance, is no doubt explained by the
fact that the temperature is too low for a sufficient evolution
of vapour.
   After these preliminary remarks, I will now pass on to con
sider, in the particular cases where a stratum of gas possesses
a relatively small resistance, whether incandescent gaseous
vapours are present, and to show their influence.
   § 7. As far as the arc-light between metallic electrodes is
concerned, it is universally known that the colour of the light
varies essentially with the nature of the metals employed,
                 * Pogg. Ann. cxxxvi. p. 220 (1869).

                      Conductivity of Gases.                315
and that in the spectrum of the arc the corresponding
metallic lines appear sharply.
   According to Casselmann* the light-arc is of different
length with different metals, and is so much the longer the
more volatile these are.
    He arranges the metals in the following order:—Potassium,
sodium, zinc, mercury, iron, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth,
copper, silver, gold, platinum. So that potassium yields the
longest arc, and platinum the shortest.
    As already remarked, there are essentially two factors to be
taken into account—the true conductivity of the vapours, and
the quantity in which they are formed ; since further, the
conductivity depends in a high degree upon the temperature,
it is not to be wondered that HittorPs experiments in the
Bunsen flame, and Casselmann's in the arc-light, have given
different results.
    § 8. It is less easy to understand the conditions which
obtain in the carbon light. That here also metallic vapours,
which are introduced into the arc, increase the conductivity,
is of course obvious from the preceding results, and it is not
even necessary to refer to the data of Casselmann. Hence
we obtain a longer arc between carbons which have been
saturated with metallic salts than between carbons as they
are found in commerce.
    But that metallic compounds are abundantly present also
in the carbons which are now so largely used for electric
 lighting may be easily shown. As is well known, the
 spectrum of the electric arc shows a multitude of bright
 lines, which are particularly distinct at the moment of inter
 rupting the current, when the continuous spectrum of the
 white-hot particles of carbon has faded.
    The sodium-line is especially brilliant ; besides which we
always observe the lines of calcium, iron, and magnesium.
The result is alwavs the same, of whatever manufacture the
carbons may be j and it may perhaps be of interest to compare
 different opinions as to the preparation of good carbons.
According to Carre f, good carbons may be obtained by
compressing an intimate mixture of lampblack and powdered
coal, and strongly igniting after addition of iron, antimony,
 or tin, or by boiling the carbons for a long time in a solution
 of metallic salts. Archereau and Sandain recommend a
similar method. Jacquelain % proceeds in an entirely different
 way, since he endeavours to remove all mineral constituents
              • Pogg. Ann. lxiii. p. 576 (1844).
              t Compter llendus, lxxxiv. p. 346 (1877).

316                  M. F. Stenger on the Electric
from the carbon by ignition in a current of chlorine, or
treatment with molten potash, or by soaking in hydrofluoric
acid. As, however, Liveing and Dewar* have shown, these
methods are not successful in completely removing iron,
magnesium, sodium, and calcium.
    § 9. Whilst electric discharges in air, hydrogen, nitrogen,
or carbon dioxide require a large electromotive force, because
they have to overcome a very high resistance, it is possible
in the presence of good conducting metallic vapours to obtain
the arc-discharge with comparatively few elements. Thus
Hittorf f, with cylinders of retort-carbon, the ends of which at
a distance of 3 to 4 millim. were brought into a Bunsen
flame, in which a bead of potassium-salt was heated, obtained
the arc-light with 80 of his elements, without its being
necessary to first make contact between the carbons. For
this it was of no importance whether both points or only
the kathode was surrounded by potassium vapour, because,
as with the glow-discharge in exhausted gases, the neighbour
hood of the kathode offered a much greater resistance also
in the gases of the flame.
    Further, Gassiot, employing a battery of 400 Grove's ele
ments, observed that upon making contact, the discharge
between balls of carbon or of metal was discontinuous, but
very quickly passed into the continuous arc-discharge,
evidently because metallic vapours had been formed by the
sparks which leapt across, which by their small resistance
permitted the establishment of a constant current of great
intensity.
    Lastly, Herschel's artifice is well known, of producing the
arc, not by contact of the electrodes, but by means of a spark
allowed to pass between them.
    § 10. I have already had occasion to mention observations
of Hittorf %, in which he obtained in nitrogen of 53 millim.
pressure currents of considerable strength by means of his
battery of 1600 elements.
    The considerable decrease in the resistance of the stratum
of gas, as I have already mentioned, was accompanied by
intense white heat of the electrodes, so that here also we may
very well regard the abundant formation of metallic vapours
as the cause of the phenomenon.
    The influence of the white heat of the electrodes is seen still
more distinctly in later researches of Hittorf § and Goldstein ||,
whiob were made with very small pressure of gus. The older

                       Conductivity of Gases.                 317
observations do not show the decrease in resistance so
strikingly, no doubt because, whilst the resistance at the
kathode is greatly diminished by the formation of metallic
vapour, the resistance of the positive light is increased by the
higher pressure of gas.
    But if by suitable means we heat the kathode in exhausted
gas to the point of volatilization, we may obtain powerful
currents even with small electromotive forces. In fact,
Hittorf and Goldstein have observed these phenomena ; I
will only mention of their results, that with a distance between
the electrodes of 6 centim., one small element produced a
constant current with high exhaustion and heating of the
 kathode to white heat.
   § 11. Warren DeLaRue and Miiller*, in a comprehensive re
search, have endeavoured to show that glow-discharge and arc-
discharge pass into each other in consequence only of change
in the density of the gas. I wish here to express again my
doubt (referring also to the criticism of Goldstein t) whether
the authors did in fact have arc-light ; their assumption is
also in direct contradiction with the previously published
observation of Gassiot, on the passage of glow-discharge into
 arc-discharge at unaltered pressure.
    Moreover, in accordance with the preceding consideration,
 the pressure is of small importance ; but everything depends
 upon whether the space between the electrodes is filled with
incandescent metallic vapours or with ordinary gas. I have
 further had opportunity in my experiments to observe the
 passage of an arc-discharge into a glow-discharge, which is
 easily explained on the same principle.
    If with the apparatus figured in fig. 2, at a pressure of
 10 millim. the arc was lengthened until the resistance increased
 to the point of extinction, there appeared immediately in front
 of the anode a stratum of blue glow-light about 1 millim. thick
 and 10 millim. long, which, after a few seconds, disappeared
 with the light between the carbons.
    If, then,the resistance became too great for the arc-discharge
 to continue, the conductivity of the still glowing metallic
 vapours was still sufficient for a short time to permit a much
 feebler current in the form of glow-discharge.
     § 12. In this concluding section, I should like to make
 some remarks on the luminosity of gases and vapours, which
 connect themselves with the experiments, already several
 times mentioned, of Hittorf. If, in electric glow-discharges,
  the electrodes came to an intense white-heat, the blue glow-
                 * Phil. Trans, cbcri. p. 66 (1870).
                 t Goldstein, Fortschr. der Phytik, 1880.

318        Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.
light disappeared each time. It follows from this, as well as
from former observations of Hittorf* and W. Siemens f on
the luminosity of flames, that up to the temperature of
melting iridium, gases possess no perceptible emissive power,
if they are not concerned in chemical changes or in electric
discharges. The cessation of luminosity at the white heat of
the electrodes may perhaps be explained by the hot metallic
vapours taking over the conduction, so that only a small
fraction of the current goes through the hydrogen or
nitrogen, which is not sufficient to bring it to luminosity.
The conditions under which metallic vapours emit light may
be quite different from those which hold good for ordinary
gases. The investigations of Schuster f have shown, at least,
that mercury vapour in a vacuum tube, from which every trace
of other gas has been expelled, presents essentially different
and, in fact, simpler phenomena, so that the electric discharge
takes place without glow-light, dark space, or stratifications.
Whether Schuster's explanation is correct, that the reason is
to be found in the simpler constitution of mercury vapour, or
whether metallic vapours generally do not show this simpler
mode of discharge, seems to be worthy of further investigation.
Since I have myself always seen an unstratified coherent
mass of light filling the space between the electrodes in an
arc of 3 centim. in length, the second possibility appears to
me the more probable.

XXXV. Electromagnets. — IV. Cast Iron, Charcoal Iron, and
   Malleable Cast Iron. By R. H. M. BoSANQUKT, St. Johns
    College, Oxford.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Gentlemen,
THE following measures of permeabilities have been made
        on a number of rings of cast iron, charcoal iron, and
malleable cast iron. The magnetizing forces used varied in all
cases from small forces to forces large enough to raise the
metal to a condition but little removed from saturation. I do
not include at present any comparisons with formulas, as the
facts are perhaps best kept separate in the first instance.
These measures complete all the experiments on rings which
I have contemplated so far.
   It may be convenient to summarize shortly some chief
points of the results of all the experiments on rings.

    The malleable cast-iron rings were supplied to me by
 Messrs. Crowley, of Sheffield. The material cuts exactly like
charcoal iron ; and it seemed probable that its magnetic qua
lities might be similar to those of charcoal iron. In this case
the possibility of casting the material would have been of the
highest importance with reference to dynamo machines.
    The results for ordinary cast iron show that it is wholly
 unfit for use in dynamo machines; the low saturation-point
being particularly objectionable. The malleable cast iron
 would undoubtedly be a great improvement on ordinary cast
 iron ; but still inferior to wrought iron.
     It may bo noted that the variations of temper in the differ
 ent rings of malleable cast iron did not appear to correspond
 to any recognizable differences, either mechanical or magnetic.
     About the time these experiments were drawing to a close
 I became aware, by a notice in ' Nature,' that Dr. Hopkinson
 had communicated to the Royal Society a series of investi
 gations apparently similar to my own. I have not yet been
 able to learn any thing about the contents of the paper in
 question ; but considering the diversity of the properties of
 different specimens, as well as of the methods in use, I still
 hope that my results may not be without usefulness.

  XXXVI. On the Influence of Heat on the Rate of Chemical
        Change. By John J. Hood, DJSc. (LondS)*.
TT^HE accelerating action of heat on the rate at which a
 JL chemical change progresses has been made the subject
of investigation by several chemists. The amount of work
that has been done towards the elucidation of this side of the
great problem of chemical action, expressing the rate as a
function of the temperature, is as yet too insignificant to
allow of any deductions being drawn relative to the probable
mechanical processes that take place in a medium containing
a chemical system undergoing change. Considered in the
light of molecular interdiffusion, it would seem probable that
the relation between the rate of change of different chemical
systems comprising two or more active bodies (active in a
chemical sense) and the temperature should be of the same
type; and the experiments that have been made on this subject
all seem to show this in common, that the rate of the change
increases very rapidly for small increments of temperature.
   Warderf, in his experiments on the speed of saponification
of ethylic acetate, was led to infer that the increase of speed
in this reaction is approximately as the second power of the
temperature.

ploying the rates of formation of ethylic acetate, acetanilide,
and acetamide. His results show that if e and e' represent
the amounts of these bodies that are formed during the interval
of one hour at temperatures 0° and 6° + n", the value of e' — e
passes through a maximum at a definite temperature.

such, for instance, as the action of hydric peroxide on a soluble
iodide in presence of sodic thiosulphate, as worked out by
Harcourt and Esson, says: —" Un fait tres general et tres
digne de remarque est l'extreme accroissement du coefficient
A, c'est-a-dire de la vitesse de decomposition avec la tempe

 d'une multitude d'experiences, parait correlatif de la nature
 meme de ce mouvement interieur qui constitue la temperature
 d'un corps."
    The " multitude d'experiences," however, would seem to
 imply the common observation of the great increase in rapidity
 of a chemical reaction with small increase of temperature.
    In a paper published in this Journal§, in which the oxida
 tion of ferrous sulphate by potassic chlorate was the subject
 of investigation, it was shown that the course of the oxidation
 was represented by the equation
                                                                      (i)

                 on the Rate of Chemical Change.              325
   It was stated that the few experiments that were made to
determine the form of this temperature function seemed to
indicate that f(6)=ffl, or that the rate of change varies as the
square of the temperature.
   This reaction has again been made the subject of investi
gation, with regard to temperature, and the results obtained
are comprised in the following tables.
   The mode of performing the experiments has already been
fully given in several papers in this Journal, so that it will
be sufficient merely to give the strengths of the solutions
employed in the work. Each experimental solution consisted
of "5637 gram iron (Fe") as sulphate, "2057 gram KC10S,
and 3*099 grams free hydric sulphate, made up to a volume
of 260 cubic centims. contained in a glass flask and main
tained at the required temperature in a large water-bath.
The course of the oxidation was observed by withdrawing 10
cubic centims. of the solution, and titrating with perman
ganate at indefinite intervals of time, to determine the equa
tion y(a + t) — b; y being cubic centim. permanganate and t
time in minutes. Two, and in many cases four, experimental
solutions were employed at each temperature, and the values
 for a and b that are given are the means of these. Every
 precaution was taken to keep the temperature of the mea
 suring pipettes, permanganate, &c. the same as that of the
 experimental solution,—the thermometers employed being
 very fine ones, by Negretti and Zambra, divided to tenths,
 on which -02° could be read easily; and in every case where
 an experiment fluctuated by so much as +'1° C, the results
 were rejected.
    Although the experiments tabulated below are only com
 prised between the narrow limits of 10° and 32° C, it was
 found that outside these extremes the results were liable to
 be vitiated by several sources of error. Below 10° C. the
 progress of the oxidation was so slow that during the long
 period that the experiments had to be continued there was
 liability of atmospheric oxidation taking place; besides, a small
 error in the permanganate titration made a comparatively
 large one in the time, whereas above 32° 0. the speed was
 much too rapid to obtain accurate measurements. Between
 these narrow limits of temperature the rate of oxidation
 increases over sevenfold.
    In the figure, the course of a few of the experiments are
 plotted from the experimental numbers, and these curves
 show at a glance the great differences in the rates of oxida

   From this Table it will be seen that n, instead of having a
constant value, gradually diminishes as the temperature in
creases, but that for a few consecutive experiments the dif
ferences are such as might be referred to experimental errors,
and so lead to the erroneous supposition that p <x 0*.
   So far as these experiments go, it would seem probable that,
for this reaction at least, the temperature function is of an
exponential form. Indeed, in many cases of chemical change
it is a common observation that the speed increases very
rapidly with the temperature, being, as Lemoine remarks,
characteristic of an exponential form. In the course of some
experiments on retardation, in which ferrous chloride was the
material employed, instead of sulphate as in the present case,
it has been found that here also, in presence of agents that
retard the oxidation very considerably, the relation between
rate and temperature may be represented in the form p = aa8.
A full account of these experiments, however, will, it is hoped,
be given at a future time.
XXXVII. On the Generation ofElectric Currents by Sulphur
          Cells. By Shelfokd Bidwell, M.A., LL.B*
IN a communication recently made to the Physical Societyt
       I ventured the suggestion that the electric conduction of
selenium, when prepared in such a form as to be sensitive to
light, was, in the literal sense of the term, electrolytic. Sele
nium itself indeed could hardly be supposed to be an electrolyte;
but it was pointed out that when selenium was " annealed "
in contact with metallic electrodes, metallic selenides would,
at least in most cases, be formed in sufficient quantity to
account for the electrolytic phenomena observed ; and that
even if this were not the case when the electrodes consisted
of such a metal as platinum, yet the necessary metallic element

     t Phil. Mag. August 1885.

               Electric Currents by Sulphur Cells.            329
might possibly bo found in the lead, iron, and arsenic which
are contained as impurities in ordinary commercial selenium.
Little direct evidence was offered in support of this view;
but it was shown that sulphur, when mixed with a certain
proportion of sulphide of silver and arranged in the form of a
" cell " with silver electrodes, exhibited many of the pro
perties of crystalline selenium, especially that of having its
electrical resistance temporarily diminished under the influ
ence of light. Analogy therefore tended to confirm the opinion
which I had been led to entertain.
   While observing the secondary or polarization-currents
which are generated by sulphur cells (as by those made with
selenium), after being disconnected from a battery, certain
effects were noticed which seemed to indicate that when the
electrodes consisted of two different metals, a sulphur cell
might be capable of originating and maintaining an indepen
dent or primary current. Experiments were therefore made
with the object of investigating this point ; and the present
paper contains an account of the results obtained. I have
hardly attempted to connect them together by any complete
 theory: of some of them, indeed, I can offer no explanation
 whatever ; others appear to be in direct opposition to what
 might have been expected. But, so far as I have been able
 to ascertain, they are entirely novel, and of sufficient interest
 to be worthy of record.
    (1) A slip of mica was wound with two parallel wires of
silver and copper 1 millim. apart, and melted sulphur con
taining a small quantity of precipitated sulphides of silver and
copper was spread over one surface. It is not known what
proportion of the sulphides was contained in the mixture,
because the bulk of them sank to the bottom of the crucible
in which the sulphur was melted. When cold, the cell was
 connected with a reflecting galvanometer, and was found to
 generate a small but steady current, indicated by a deflection
of about 20 scale-divisions. When the connections of the
 cell were reversed, the current was reversed. It was therefore
 not due to any thermo-effect in the circuit. The direction of
 the current was from silver to copper through sulphur : its
 strength was diminished by exposure to light, and increased
 by rise of temperature. Connecting the free ends of the
 silver and copper wires and heating the junction, it was found
 that the thermo-current thus produced passed (as usual) from
 copper to silver through the junction. The increase of cur
 rent by heat was therefore not to be accounted for by thermo
 electric action, for that would produce the opposite effect.

 330            Mr. S. Bidwell on the Generation of
     The action is almost certainly of the same nature as that
 which occurs in an ordinary voltaic cell.
     (2) It appeared desirable to construct a cell which, though
  unsuitable for experiments with light, would have a much
 smaller resistance than one of the form last described. A
 plate of copper 3 centim. square was heated, and upon it was
 spread a mixture consisting of 5 parts of sulphur and 1 part of
 sulphide of copper. A plate of silver previously heated was
 then laid on the melted mixture and the two plates squeezed
 together, thus forming a sandwich-like cell. The thickness
 of the copper plate was 2*75 millim., of the silver plate *60
 millim., and of the completed cell 3'65 millim.; the thickness
 of the layer of sulphur was therefore "3 millim. When this
 cell (after cooling) was connected with the galvanometer, the
 spot of light was violently deflected off the scale. Dr. Fleming
 was kind enough to make a very accurate measurement of its
 electromotive force by comparison with one of his standard
 Daniell cells. It was found to be *0712 volt, and its internal
 resistance was 6537 ohms. As in the case of the former cell,
 the direction of the current is from silver to copper ; and there
can be no doubt that it is of a voltaic nature. At the time of
writing, the cell has been in existence nearly seven weeks, and
it is now, I believe, quite as powerful as at first.
    (3) It was thought that the internal resistance might be
 further reduced by adding a larger proportion of sulphide to
 the sulphur. Another cell was therefore constructed similar
 in all respects to that last described, except that the sulphur
 and copper sulphide were mixed in equal proportions. Its
internal resistance was enormously lower, being only 13 ohms,
but its E.M.F. was also lower, being '0071 volt.
    (4) A layer of precipitated sulphide of copper was placed
between plates of copper and silver which were squeezed
together in a screw-press. The resistance of this arrange
ment was a small fraction of an ohm ; but when connected
with the galvanometer, it gave no indication whatever of a
current. It seems, therefore, that a certain amount of free
sulphur is necessary for the generation of an electromotive
force by cells containing copper sulphide.
    (5) Two parts of copper sulphide were mixed with one of
sublimed sulphur, and the powder was compressed between
plates of copper and silver. This cell gave a very small
current, indicated by a galvanometer-deflection of 2 or 3 scale-
divisions. The deflection was reversed as often as the con
nections with the binding-screws of the cell were reversed ;
and the existence of a real, though very small, electromotive
force was undoubted. The internal resistance was "088 ohm.

               Electric Currents by Sulphur Cells.            331
   (G) The last-mentioned cell was taken to pieces and remade
after the addition of about an equal part of sublimed sulphur
to the mixture of sulphur and sulphide. Its resistance was
now found to be many megohms, yet it produced a larger
galvanometer-deflection than before.
   (7) Once more the cell was taken to pieces and a little
more sulphide added. When remade, its resistance was at
first about 2700 ohms ; but it varied considerably. It pro
duced a galvanometer-deflection of about 100 divisions, which
in a few minutes increased in a somewhat irregular manner
to 250 divisions. It was then disconnected from the galva
nometer, and, when again connected after an interval of six
hours, it deflected the spot of light offthe scale. Shunting the
galvanometer (the resistance of which was 3483 ohms) with
a coil of 300 ohms, the deflection amounted to 130 divisions;
and on the following day with the same shunt, the deflection
was at first about 250 divisions, rapidly diminishing, however,
when the circuit was closed.
   (8) A cell was made by compressing precipitated silver
sulphide unmixed with any free sulphur between plates of
silver and copper. When connected with the galvanometer,
this cell produced a deflection which, with a shunt of 35 ohms,
exceeded 400 divisions. But in this case the silver was the
negative plate, the direction of the current being from copper
through sulphide to silver. The E.M.F. was less than that of
the cell described in (2).
   (9) Another cell was made in the same manner as that
described in (2); but the sulphur was mixed with sulphide
of silver instead of sulphide of copper. This gave a strong
current in the same direction as that produced when sulphide
of copper was used, and opposite to that generated by the cell
containing silver sulphide without free sulphur.
   (10) Pure sulphur was melted on a clean plate of copper,
and, when just liquid, a warmed plate of silver was laid upon
it and pressed down with a weight until cold. This cell gave
a strong current from silver through sulphur to copper.
 Sulphides were of course formed during the process of
construction.
   (11) A melted mixture of sulphur and silver sulphide was
spread upon a copper plate, and a plate of silver pressed upon
it. When cold, the silver plate was split off with a knife, and a
piece of silver-leaf, sufficiently thin to appear blue by trans
mitted light, was attached (by rubbing) to the exposed surface
of the mixture. As before, there was a comparatively strong
current from the silver to the copper. The silvered surface
was then exposed to the light of burning magnesium wire, and

332            Mr. S. Bidwell on the Generation of
the immediate movement of the spot of light through 50 scale-
divisions indicated a diminution of the current. When the
magnesium was extinguished, the current at once increased
to its original strength. When a nearly red-hot brass rod
was held at a distance of 3 centims. from the silvered surface,
the current slowly increased in strength ; and when the hot
rod was removed, the current was again slowly diminished.
The effects both of light and of heat were verified by many
repetitions of the experiments. These results which, so far as
regards the effect of light, were unexpected, are of the same
character as those described in (1). I have elsewhere* given
strong reasons for believing that the combination of sulphur
 with silver is assisted by the influence of light. If this is so,
it is certainty a remarkable fact that increased corrosion of the
silver electrode should be accompanied by diminution of the
current.
   Two days afterwards the silver-leaf had become much dis
coloured, and was in some parts quite black. When con
nected with the galvanometer the cell gave a current of nearly
the same strength as before; but now it was found to be
slightly increased by light as well as by heat ; and it is pro
bable that the light as such exerted no influence whatever,
the observed effect being really due to the incidental rise of
temperature.
   (12) The silver-leaf was scraped off, and the surface of the
sulphur mixture having been cleaned from all visible traces
of free silver with fine emery-cloth, a piece of thin gold-
leaf was pressed upon it. It was found very difficult to make
it adhere satisfactorily. The cell, when connected with the
galvanometer, gave no indication whatever of a current.
When the cell described in (2) was also inserted in the circuit,
the spot of light was deflected, showing that the first cell was
quite able to conduct electricity, and that its failure to origi
nate a current was not owing to bad contact between the gold-
leaf and the sulphur mixture.
   (13) A cell containing a mixture of sulphur and silver
sulphide between plates of silver and iron was found to have
an E.M.F. of -023 volt, or about one third of that of the silver-
copper cell described in (2). The direction of the current
was the same.
   (14) A cell was made by melting sublimed sulphur upon
a plate of copper and pressing a plate of iron upon the melted
sulphur. On connecting it (when cold) with the galvano
meter, there was no indication of any current. Nevertheless
the cell was found to conduct electricity very well when a

                 Electric Currents by Sulphur Cells.                 333
 battery was also placed in the circuit. Sulphide of copper
  was of course formed by the action of the hot sulphur upon
 the copper.
      (15) A melted mixture of 5 parts of sulphur with 1 part of
  copper sulphide was pressed between plates of silver and iron,
  and cooled. When first made, this cell generated a sufficiently
  strong current to deflect the galvanometer-needle as far as
  the stop would allow; but two hours later, when an attempt
  was made to measure the E.M.F., it was found to have almost
  completely disappeared, being less than a hundredth of that
  of the cell described in (2). The E.M.F. was temporarily
  restored by connecting the iron and silver plates with the
  positive and negative terminals of a battery of ten Leclanche
  cells for a few minutes. The result was of course merely a
  polarization-current.
      (16) Two silver wires A, B were imbedded in a fused mass
  consisting of equal parts of sulphur and copper sulphide.
  When cold, the wire A was connected with the carbon pole
  of a battery of ten Leclanche cells, and the wire B with the
   zinc pole. After the current had passed for about a second,
   the cell was detached from the battery and connected with
   the galvanometer. A current was at once indicated in the
   direction A B, t. e. in the same direction as that of the battery-
   current which had been caused to pass through the cell. This
   experiment was repeated many times and on different days,
   with the same result*. A period of some seconds necessarily
   elapsed between the separation of the cell from the battery
   ana its attachment to the galvanometer. In order to render
   this interval as short as possible, the apparatus was so arranged
   that by depressing a key the transfer could be effected in a
   small fraction of a second. It was then found that the first
    effect of the transfer was a strong momentary current in the
    direction B A, which was immediately followed by the more
    permanent current previously observed in the direction A B.
    With the view of retarding the first effect, a battery of
    two Leclanche^ cells was used, and the connection was made
    for a longer period. After the battery had been connected
    for one minute, the cell was transferred to the galvanometer
    by means of the key, and the swing of the spot of light through
    280 scale-divisions again indicated a current in the direc
    tion B A. Though this was not, as before, a current of only
    momentaryduration, it rapidly decreased in strength, becoming
• zero in almost exactly 30 seconds. After zero was passed, a
    current was at once set up in the opposite direction A B, which
       * The experiments described in the remainder of this paragraph were
    made after the paper was read.

 334           Mr. S. Bidwell on the Generation of
 in 30 seconds produced a deflection of 70 divisions, increasing
 to a maximum of 131 divisions in 10 minutes. The current
 then slowly diminished ; and in 5f hours after the commence
 ment of the experiment the deflection had fallen to 17 scale-
 divisions. At this point the observations were discontinued.
 In the accompanying curve the abscissae represent the time
 in hours, and the ordinates the current in scale-divisions. The
 current of 30 seconds' duration in the direction B A is not
 represented.

                                                          Hour*.
    On another occasion, when the two Leclanche" cells had
been connected for 3 minutes, the secondary current from B
to A decreased still more slowly than in the last-mentioned
experiment, vanishing in 3£ minutes. The current which
 followed in the direction A B attained its maximum, indicated
by 155 divisions, in 6£ minutes, and then steadily decreased
for nearly 4 hours, when it again became zero. The spot of
light did not, however, remain stationary, but moved steadily
on, indicating a second reversal of the current. In one hour
after zero had thus been crossed for the second time, the gal
vanometer-deflection was 12 scale-divisions ; and 4$ hours
later, when the last observation was made, it had increased to
20 divisions. In both these experiments the galvanometer
 (of which the resistance was nearly 3500 ohms) was shunted
with a coil of 100 ohms.
   These alternating currents are probably of the same nature
as those which Faraday found to be generated when copper and
silver, or two pieces of copper, or two pieces of silver, were
immersed in a solution of potassium sulphide*. The wires
are alternately protected from the action of the free sulphur
by an investing coat of sulphide.

                            Summary.
   Plates of silver and copper imbedded in a mixture of sulphur
with sulphides of copper or silver constitute a cell which at
the ordinary temperature is capable of generating and main
taining a constant current, the silver being the positive
element. Such a cell, in which the mixture consisted of 5
parts of sulphur with one of copper sulphide between plates
3 centim. square and "3 millim. apart, had an E.M.F. of '0712
volt and an internal resistance of 6537 ohms.
   If the proportion of copper sulphide to sulphur is increased,
the internal resistance of the cell is diminished ; but its E.M.F.
is also diminished.
   A cell containing copper sulphide unmixed with free sul
phur fails to produce any appreciable current.
   A cell containing silver sulphide only generates a current
in the opposite direction to that produced when the sulphide
is mixed with free sulphur.
   Copper used in conjunction with iron or gold gives no
current whatever at the ordinary temperature.
   The current generated by a silver-copper cell containing
free sulphur mixed with sulphide is diminished by the action
of light and increased by heat. It has not been ascertained
whether the effect is upon the E.M.F. or the internal resist
ance, or both.
   If a battery-current is caused to pass for a short time through
a cell consisting of two silver electrodes imbedded in a mixture
of sulphur and copper sulphide, the cell, after being discon
nected from the battery, will generate a current of very short
duration in the direction opposite to that of the battery-current,
followed by a current which may be maintained for several
 hours in the same direction as the battery-current. A second
reversal has in one case been found to occur after an interval
of four hours.
   The experiments, of which an account is here given, must
 be considered as being merely of a preliminary nature. A
 complete investigation of the phenomena in question would
require more time than I am at present able to devote to the
subject.
                       Addition, August 3rd.
    From (4), (5), and (6) it appears that a cell consisting of
 copper and silver plates is incapable of generating a current
 unless a certain proportion of free sulphur is mixed with the
sulphide. Thinking that the function of the free sulphur

 336            Dr. J. Hopkinson on the Seat of the
 might be merely to form silver sulphide by direct combination
 with the silver, I constructed a cell as follows :—A layer of
 copper sulphide was spread upon a plate of copper ; a polished
 steel plate was laid upon the sulphide, and the whole was
 strongly compressed in a vice. The steel plate was then
removed, and a thin layer of silver sulphide was spread upon
 the smooth surface of the copper sulphide. The cell was
 completed by pressing a silver plate upon the silver sulphide.
 This was found upon trial to give a current which, with an
 external circuit of low resistance, was many times stronger
 than that generated by any of the cells previously made. It
seems to be exactly analogous in its action to a Daniell cell
consisting of plates of zinc and copper in solutions of zinc
sulphate and copper sulphate. The quantity of the copper
sulphide would be gradually diminished, copper being depo
sited on the copper plate, while the quantity of silver sulphide
would continually increase with consumption of the silver.
    In conclusion, it seems probable that, by selecting such
metals as experiment might prove to be better suited for the
purpose than silver and copper, a cell might be constructed
upon the principle of that described in the above paragraph
which would be of practical and commercial value.
XXXVIII. Notes oil the Seat of the Electromotive Forces in a
     Voltaic Cell. By J. Hopkinson, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S*
I^HE following is an expansion of some short remarks I
        made when Dr. Lodge's paper was read at the Society
of Telegraph Engineers.
    I. The controversy between those who hold that the difference
of potential between zinc and copper in contact is what is deduced
by electrostatic methods, and those who hold that it is measured
by the Peltier effect, is one of the relative simplicity of certain
hypotheses and definitions used to represent admitted facts.
   Taking thermoelectric phenomena alone, we are not impera
tively driven to the conclusion that the difference of potential
between zinc and copper is the small quantity which the
Peltier effect would indicate ; but by assuming with Sir W.
Thomson that there is an electric property which may be
expressed as an electric convection of heat, or that electricity
has specific heat, we may make the potential difference as
great as we please without contradiction of any dynamical
principle or known physical fact. Let us start with the
physical facts, and introduce hypothesis as it is wanted.
                   * Communicated by the Author.

               Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.         337
 These are, as far as we want them :—(1) If a circuit consist of
  one metal only, the electromotive force around the circuit is
 nil however the temperature may vary in different parts ; this
  of course neglecting the thermoelectric effects of stress and
 magnetism discovered by Sir W. Thomson. (2) If the
 circuit consist of two metals with the junctions at different
 temperatures tu t3, then the electromotive force round the
 circuit is the difference of a function of t3 and of the same
 function of <j. According to Prof. Tait the function is
 Hti-tjfa-t^y or, as we may write it, A + B^-Cy-
    A + Btx —      | j the series may perhaps extend further, but,
 according to Tait's experiments, the first three terms are all
 that are needed.
    Now, but for the second law of thermodynamics we should
                                     Ct 2
 naturally assume that A + Bts         jr- was the difference of
                                                              Ct 2
 potentials at the junction of temperature t3, and A + B^       ~
at the junctions of temperature tx ; we should further assume
 that what the unit of electricity did was to take energy
            Ct 2
A + Bi3      g- ou* of the region immediately around the hot
junction with disappearance of that amount of heat, and to
                            Ct 2
take energy A + B^            ^- into the region immediately
                              u
surrounding the cold junction, with liberation of that amount
of heat. Now apply the second law of thermodynamics in
the form 2- = 0,and we have
whence it follows that A=0, which may be, and that 0 = 0,
which is contrary to experiment. The current then must do
something else than has been supposed, and the hypotheses
differ in expression at least as to what that something else is.
The fact to be expressed is simply this : when a current
passes in an unequally heated metal, there is a reversible
transference of heat from one part of the metal to another,
whereby heat is withdrawn from or given to an element of
the substance when a current passes through it between
points differing in temperature, and is given to or withdrawn
from that element if the current be reversed. Sir W.
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 20. No. 125. Oct. 1885.        2 B

338             . Dr. J. Hopkinson on the Seat of the
Thomson proved that this follows from the fact of thermo
electric inversions and the second law of thermodynamics,
and verified the inference by experiment, his reasoning being
quite independent of any hypothesis.
    Suppose wires of metals X and Y are joined at their extre
 mities, and the junctions are kept at temperatures f2, tx. The
 observed electromotive force around the circuit is f(h)—/(<i)
 or within limits according to Tait, B(/2— £,) — iC(<22— ^2).
 The work done or dissipated by the current when unit of
 electricity has passed is f(t%)—f\t\)> and this is obtained by
abstraction of heat from certain parts of the circuit and
liberation of heat at other parts by a perfectly reversible
process. Let F(<2) be the amount of heat which disappears
 from the region surrounding the junction f2 when unit of
 electricity has passed from X to Y. Let an element of the
wire X have its ends at temperatures / and t + dt, and let the
quantity of heat abstracted from this element when unit of
electricity passes from t to t + dt be represented by <f>{t)dt,
and let the same for Y bo represented by yfr(t)dt. By the
first law of thermodynamics we have
        f('2) + fV(o*- F(o + f \m=Ah) -Ah), .
and by the second law, since the transference of heat from
part to part is reversible,
        F(fs) /t, -FMAi + f 0(0 ft.dt- \ V(0 /* • dt = °-
                             J*.            Jh
Differentiating we have
                 jF(t)+*(0-*M=/to,
                 I F'(*)A-F(0A2+<M0A-t(0/<=o ;
whence
                  f F(<)=</(0 = B<-C<2,
                 I            =</'(<)=* C*.
    This really contains the whole of thermoelectric theory
without any reference to local differences of potential, but
only to electromotive force round a complete circuit. But
when we come to the question of difference of potential
within the substance at different parts of the circuit, we find
that according as we treat it in one or the other of the
following ways we may leave the difference of potential at the
junctions indeterminate and free to be settled in accordance
with hypotheses which may be found convenient in electro
statics, or we find it determined for us, and must make our
electrostatic hypotheses accord therewith.

                 Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.            339
     The first way is that of Thomson, as I understand it.
  Assume that there is no thermoelectric difference of potential
  between parts of the same metal at different temperatures,
  at all events till electrostatic experiments shall show that there
  is. It follows that we must assume that the passage of
 electricity between two points at different temperatures must
 cause a conveyance of energy to or from the region between
 those points by some other means than by passage from one
  potential to another. Such conveyance of energy may bo
  very properly likened to the convection of heat by fluid in a
  tube, for although convection is in general dissipative, it is
  not necessarily so, e. g. a theoretically perfect regenerator.
  Suppose, then, that in metal X unit of electricity carries with
  it §tf>(t)dt of heat, and in metal Y, §yfr(t)dt, this will account for
 the proved transference of heat in the two metals. When a
 unit of electricity passes across a junction at temperature t
 from X to Y, it must liberate at that junction a quantity of
 heat fy(t)dt—ty(t)dt ; but the actual effect at this junction
 is that heat F(t) disappears ; hence the excess of potential at
 the junction of Y over X must be
              F(t)+fo{t)dt-fr{t)dt or A + B*-£C<2,
 A being a constant introduced in integration. If, then, we
 assume a " specific heat of electricity/' the actual difference
 of potential at a junction may contain a constant term of
 any value that electrostatic experiments indicate.
     But the facts may be expressed without assuming that
 electricity conveys energy in any other way than by passing
 from a point of one potential to a point of different potential.
 This method must be adopted by those who maintain that the
 Peltier effect measures the difference of potential between two
 metals in contact. "Define that if unit-electricity in passing
 from A to B points in a conductor homogeneous or hetero
 geneous does work, whether in heating the conductor, chemical
 changes, or otherwise, the excess of potential of A over B
 shall be measured by the work done by the electricity. This
 is no more than defining what we mean by the potential
 within a conductor, a thing we do not need to do in electro
statics. This definition accepted, all the rest follows. Be
 tween two points differing in temperature dt the rise of
potential is <fs{t)dt in X, ^fr(t)dt in Y ; at the junction the
excess of potential of Y over X is F (<) = Bt — Gt'1.
     The second method of arranging one's ideas on this subject
has the advantage that it dispenses with assuming a new pro
perty of that hypothetical something, electricity ; but there
is nothing confusing in the first method.
                                  2B2

340            Dr. J. Hopkinson on tlie Seat of the
    II. The thermodynamics of the voltaic circuit may be dealt
with on either method of treatment ; in the equations already
used, instead of speaking only of the heat disappearing from
any region, we have to consider the heat disappearing when
the unit electricity passes plus the energy liberated by the
chemical changes which occur. Consider a thermoelectric
combination in which there is chemical action at the junctions
when a current passes.
    If Gt be the function of the temperature which represents
the energy of the chemical reaction which occurs when unit
of electricity passes from X to Y across the junction, we have
F(<8) + G(ts) -F(«,)- G(h)               + £V*)<a=/(<>) -Ah),
F'(t)+G>(t)+4,(t)-W)=f(t),
¥'(t)/t-F(t)/t2 + 4>(t)lt-ylt{t)/t=0;
whence
F(t) = tf(t)-t(¥(t),
    If now we proceed on the hypothesis of specific heat of
electricity, we are able to make the differences of potentials
at the junctions accord with the indications of electrostatic
experiments. We are, then, by no means bound in a voltaic
cell to suppose that there is a great difference of potential
between the electrolyte and the metal because there is a
 reaction there, for we may suppose the energy then libe
rated is taken up by the change that occurs in the specific heat
 of electricity.
     III. Adopting the second method of expressing the facts,
 we may consider further the location of the difference of
 potential in a voltaic cell. In the case of a Daniell's cell
 consisting of Cu | CuS04 | ZnSO,, I Zn, at which junction is
 the great difference of potential ? Dr. Lodge places it at the
junctions of the metals and the electrolytes. For this there
 is really some experimental reason, but without such reason
 it is not apparent why there may not be a great difference of
 potential between CuS04 and ZnS04. In that case, in an
 electrolytic cell with zinc or copper electrodes and ZnSO^ or
 CuS04 as electrolyte there would exist a small difference of
 potential between the metal and the electrolyte. Take the latter
 case, an electrolytic cell of CuSO*, and let us leave out of
 account the irreversible phenomena of electrical resistance and
 diffusion. First, let us assume, as is not the fact, that the only
 change in the state of the electrolytic cell when a current has

              Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.         341
passed is addition of copper to one plate, loss of copper
from the other plate ; what could be inferred ? Imagine a
region enclosing the anode, when a current has passed, what
changes have occurred within the region ? An equivalent of
copper has disappeared from the anode, and that same quan
tity of copper has departed and gone outside the region.
But by our supposition, nothing else has happened barring
increase of volume for liquid by diminished volume of metallic
copper ; there is no more and no less CuS04 in the region,
the same quantity therefore of S04. All the work done in
the region is to tear off a little copper from the surface of the
anode and to remove it elsewhere. If the fact were as as
sumed it would follow that the passage of the current did
little work in the passage from copper to sulphate of copper,
and consequently that the difference of potential between the
 two is small. But the fact is, other things happen in the cell
 than increase of the kathode and diminution of the anode.
 In contact with the anode there is an increase of CuS04, in
 contact with the kathode CuS04 disappears : this is a familiar
 observation to every one. Keconsider the region round the
 anode. Assume as another extreme hypothesis that after
 a current has passed we have in this region the same
 quantity as before of copper, but more CuS04 ; S04 has
 entered the region and has combined with the copper. A
 large amount of energy is therefore brought into the region,
 which can only be accounted for by supposing that the elec
 tricity has passed from a lower potential in the copper to a
 higher potential in the electrolyte. The legitimate conclusion
 is, then, that there is between Cu and CuS04 a difference of
 potential corresponding to the energy of combination ; and the
 basis of the conclusion is the simple observation that the
 copper is dissolved off one plate but remains in its neighbour
 hood, whilst it is precipitated on the other plate, impoverishing
 the solution. In other words, it is the S04 that travels, not
 the Cu.
    Now consider the ordinary Daniell's cell. Is there a sub
 stantial difference of potential at the junction of CuS04 and
 ZnS04 ? Is there, in fact, a difference apart from the
 Peltier difference ? Imagine a region enclosing the junction
 in question ; it might have been that the effect of a current
 passing was to increase the zinc and diminish the copper by an
 equivalent of the electricity which passed, from which we should
 have inferred that the seat of the electromotive force in a
 Daniell's cell was at the junction of the two solutions. But
 it is more nearly the fact that no change whatever occurs in
  the region in question when a current passes, and that all that

342     Seat of the Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.
happens is that a certain quantity of S04 enters the region
and an equal quantity departs from it, from which follows
that there is no potential difference, other than a Peltier
difference, at this junction.
   Neither of the extreme suppositions we have made as to
concentration or impoverishment of the solution is in fact
true, but they serve to show that the position of the steps
in potential depends entirely on the travelling of the ions.
The fact is, that in general both ions travel in proportions
dependent on the condition of the electrolytes ; it is probable
 that the travelling of the S04 depends on some acidity of the
solution. Given the proportion in which the ions travel and
the energy of the reversible chemical reaction which occurs,
and wo can calculate the differences of potential at the
junctions.
   In the preceding reasoning an assumption has been made,
but not stated. It has been assumed that the passage of a
current in an electrolyte is accompanied by a movement of
ions only, and not by a movement of molecules of the salt;
that is, when unit of electricity passes through a solution of
 Cn804, .tCu travels in one direction and (1— «)S04 in the
opposite direction, but that C11SO4 does not travel without
exchanges of Cu and of S04 between the molecules of CuSCv
 In the supposed case when there is no concentration around
the anode, my assumption is that Cuis dissolved off the anode,
and that an equal quantity of Cu leaves the region around the
anode as Cu by exchanges between the molecules of CuSO*.
But it is competent to some one else to assume that in this
case S04 as SO^ enters the region by exchanges between the
molecules of CUSO4, and that at the same time a molecule of
CuS04 leaves the region without undergoing any change.
Such a one would truly say that there was no inconsistency
in his assumption; and that if it be admitted, it follows that the
difference of potential at the junction CuS04 | Cu is that repre
sented by the energy of the reaction. I prefer the assumption
I have made, because it adds nothing to the ordinary chemical
theory of electrolysis; but it is easy to imagine that facte may be
discovered more easily expressed by supposing that an electric
current causes a migration of molecules of the salt, as well as
a migration of the components of the salt.

XXXIX. A Comparison ofthe Standard Resistance-coils ofthe
   British Association with Mercury Standards constructed by
   M. J. R. Benoit of Paris and Herr Strecker of Wurzburg.
   By E. T. Glazebkook, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow and Assistant
   Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge*.
IN accordance with the resolution of the Electrical Congress
     held in Paris in 1884, the Electrical-Standards Committee
of the British Association decided to have made a series of
resistance-coils in terms of the Legal Ohm ; and the work of
testing and comparing these coils was entrusted to me. In
Paris, at the request of the Minister for the Post Office and
Telegraphs, M. J. B. Benoit undertook the same task. An
account of his experiments is published in the Journal de
Physique for January 1885.
   M. Benoit started ab initio, and constructed a series of
glass tubes,'the electrical resistance of which, when filled with
mercury, can be calculated from their dimensions. Four of
these were made, each having a resistance of about 1 ohm.
   The plan adopted by the Committee was different. The
specific resistance of mercury in terms of the British-Associa
tion unit has been carefully determined by Lord Rayleigh
and others.
   For the purpose of constructing Legal Ohms, it was decided
to adopt a number for this quantity founded on their experi
ments, and then work from the British-Association standards.
To adopt the other course would only have been to repeat at
some trouble the experiments of Lord Rayleigh, M. Mascart,
Herr Strecker, and others.
   M. Benoit made a number of copies of his mercury-standards,
and after reading his paper, I wrote and asked him to send
me one or more of these, that I might compare them directly
with the coils which had by that time been constructed for
me by Messrs. Elliott Bros. M. Benoit replied most cour
teously, and sent me, about Easter, three of his copies. The
object of the present paper is to give an account of the com
parison of these with the standards belonging to the British
Association.
    M. Benoit's copies were mercury-standards. Each con
sisted of a glass tube bent several times, A A, fig. 1. The
ends of this tube are ground flat and pass into two glass cups,
 B, B, which for most of their length are considerably wider
 than the tube, but taper down at their lower ends. The tubes
 are connected to the cups by short bits of india-rubber tubing,
     • Communicated by the Physical Society : read May 23, 1886.

344           Mr. R. T. Glazebrook's Comparison of
C, 0, which fit tightly over the narrow ends of the cups, and
are secured by wrapping string firmly over the india-rubber.
                               Fig.l.
To make the joint tight the india-rubber and glass were var
nished over with shellac varnish. The cups open at the top,
and can be closed by glass stoppers.
    The standards were accompanied by full directions for use.
 I give a free translation of the greater part of the instructions.
    1. On each of the cups are engraved two marks a a, bb.
The lower mark a a indicates the position which the extremity
 of the tube introduced into the cup ought to occupy. The
 upper mark b b indicates the top of the mercury in the tube
 when filled. These two conditions must be fulfilled approxi
 mately ; an error of "5 centim. in their sum changes the
 resistance either way by about '00018 ohm.
    2. Method of Filling.—The tube may bo filled in air in the
 following manner:—Place it nearly horizontally and pour
 some mercury into one of the cups; then incline it gradually,
 shaking it a little, until the mercury enters the tube. The
 mercury should fill the tube slowly, without leaving a trace of
 air. Add mercury always by the same cup until it reaches
the upper mark b b in both cups. The method is not always
 successful ; it is better to work in a vacuum.

hardly necessary to give the details of the one employed by
M. Benoit.]

       Standard Resistance-coils with Mercury Standards.       345
    3. Method of Using the Standard.—The standard is intro
duced into the circuit by means of contact-pieces dipping into
the mercury in the cups. These pieces should not reach more
than a few millimetres below the surface. Contact-pieces of
amalgamated copper cannot be used, because they render the
mercury impure and alter its resistance rapidly, diminishing
it appreciably in a few hours. Platinum, again, does not
make a constant contact with the mercury; and the uncer
tainty produced by its variability is fatal to its use. To avoid
this double difficulty, M. Benoit employed contact-pieces of a
special form (fig. 2). A glass tube A is               Fig. 2.
drawn out to a point at its lower end ;
through this point a platinum wire B
passes. The wire is held in position by
shellac C ; and a small cup D of thin
glass is attached to its lower end also by
shellac. Thus the two separate glass
portions A and D are in electrical com
munication by means of the platinum
 wire B. The two portions A and D
are filled with mercury in a vacuum.
The mercury is thus brought into good
 contact with the platinum, and the
 mercury-platinum contact remains un
 changed during the observations. Into
 the upper division A one end of a stout
 copper rod E is plunged ; the other end
 of this rod forms the connection with
 the rest of the circuit. The cup D dips
 a few millimetres below the mercury in
 the standard. The mercury which fills
 it remains constantly in contact with the
 platinum wire, and may be kept without
 change almost indefinitely. These contact-pieces introduce
 an appreciable resistance of 2 to 3 thousandths of an ohm into
 the circuit ; but this resistance remains constant, and can be
 eliminated by a method of substitution.
     The standard is supported in a glass vessel, and can be
 reduced in temperature to zero by filling the vessel with finely-
 broken ice. The values of the standards are given at zero.
 The value at any other temperature is given by the formula
               B,= Rp(l + -0008649* + -00000 112u2),
 t being the temperature in degrees Centigrade.
     4. Preparation of the Mercury.—The mercury may be
 purified by the action of nitric acid, and dried by means of
 sulphuric acid and caustic potash.

346           Mr. R. T. Glazebrook's Comparison of
   Experiment showed that mercury from different sources,
even when it had been rendered impure by the admixture of
copper, lead, or zinc, after being treated by this process, gave
the same results. The process, however, does not free the
mercury from silver or from the less oxidizable metals.
   [In my experiments described below the mercury was
freshly distilled by the aid of the admirable piece of apparatus
designed by Weinhold, and introduced into England by Mr.
W. K. Shaw.]
   5. Method of Cleaning the Tubes.—The tubes should be
cleaned by passing through them in succession:—
   1. Distilled water.
   2. Strong nitric acid.
   3. Distilled water.
   4. Ammonia.
   5. Distilled water.
   They must then be dried by a current of dry air.
   To clean the tubes it is best to separate them from the cups.
To effect this, the pieces of india-rubber tubing which connect
them should be cut. To make the glass slip into the india-
rubber tubing, it should be moistened with a drop of benzine.
   In preparing the tubes for my measurements, I endeavoured
to carry out the above instructions as carefully as possible.
The resistance comparisons were made by Carey Foster's
method, using the wire bridge of the British Association as
designed by Dr. Fleming.
   In order to compare the resistance of one of the tubes with
a standard coil, it was necessary either to know accurately or
to eliminate the resistance of the contact-pieces. It was also
important to determine within what limits the resistance of
the contact-pieces remained constant, and whether they could
be repeatedly filled with mercury in such a way as to retain
the same resistance.
   For this purpose they were compared with a short piece
of copper rod. The cups D (fig. 2), one belonging to each
contact-piece, were immersed in the same beaker of mercury,
being placed close together and covered to the same depth
as when actually in use; the other ends of the copper rods
E connected in the usual way to the bridge. The contact-
tubes had been filled by being placed in a large test-tube
which was exhausted, and into which mercury was then
admitted by means of a tap attached to the test-tube. The
resistance of the contact-pieces was thus found in terms of
the divisions of the bridge-wire before and after a set of
comparisons of the mercury -tubes and standard coils.

      Standard Resistance-coils with Mercury Standards.                      347
   It was found that the resistance of the contact pieces re
mained very nearly constant during the time occupied in
making a series of comparisons. The variations in the values
found before and after rarely amounted to more than 1 bridge-
wire division, or about •00005 ohm ; and the mean of the
two values obtained is pretty certainly correct to less than
this.
   At the same time different fillings of the same contact-tubes
led to very different values for their resistances. This was
no doubt due to small irregularities in the contact between
the platinum and the mercury. Thus I found the following
values in terms of a bridge-wire division :—

    March 25                                                 93-4 b.w.d.
                                                             694 „

      „   28 Copper rods being left in since 26th. . .      109-4 „
   The differences between the 69-4 and the 68-2, and, again,
between the 114,5 and 109*4, are due, I believe, to the copper
of the contact-rods being dissolved by the mercury in the tubes.
   On March 28th, the contact-tubes were cleaned and refilled,
and the resistance was found to be 57-2 b.w.d. Throughout
the experiments until April 9, when one of them was broken,
their values did not differ greatly from the above.
   On April 1 1th, new contact-tubes were prepared and used
throughout the rest of the experiments; their value remained
fairly constant at about 58 b.w.d.
   Thus the quantity actually determined by the observations
was the difference between the resistance of the mercury tube
 + the contact pieces and the standard coil. In order to
get the resistance of the mercury tube in terms of the standard
coil, the resistance contact-pieces found as above described
had to be subtracted.
   Another way of eliminating the resistance of the contacts
from the result is to compare first the mercury tube and then
the standard with some other coil, using the same contact-
pieces to connect the mercury tube and the standard to the
bridge. This can be done by removing the contact-tubes
from the mercury tube, and dipping them into two mercury
cups, into which the electrodes of the standard also dip. Since,

348           Mr. R. T. Glazebrook's Comparison of
however, my apparatus allowed me to measure the resistance
of the contact-tubes with all the accuracy I desired, the first
method was the more convenient, as it necessitated fewer obser
vations.
   The comparisons were made both with the original standards
of the British Association—B.A. Units—and also with the
Legal-Ohm Standards of the same, recently constructed for
me by Messrs. Elliott Bros., taking as a basis the value
for the resistance of mercury in terms of the B.A. unit
adopted by the British-Association Committee. According
to this,
                    1 Legal Ohm= 1-0112 B.A.U.
   The three mercury tubes Nos. 37, 38, 39, sent by M. Benoit,
were compared. Between two observations of resistance the
mercury was occasionally drawn through the tubes by con
necting the cups alternately to the air-pump. I hoped in this
manner to displace any very small air-bubble or particle of dust
which might have got lodged in the tube. In the final set of
observations recorded below, it will be seen that no appreciable
 change in the resistance was detected by this precaution. I
 therefore suppose the tubes to have been properly filled.
    In some earlier observations, which will be referred to again
 shortly, variations of considerable amount were produced by
passing the mercury through. In the tables below the values
of the resistances which were found by comparison with the
 B.A.L1., and reduced to Legal Ohms by means of the known
relation between the two, are denoted by an asterisk.

350           Mr. R. T. Giazebrook's Comparison of
   Thus there is a difference of "0005 legal ohm between the
two. My results are based upon the value of the resistance
of mercury in terms of the B.A. unit adopted by the British-
Association Committee. If we denote by M the resistance at
0° C. of a column of mercury 1 metre long, 1 square millim. in
section, then, according to the number adopted by the Com
mittee,                 M.       _ -954Q B.A.U.
                        B.A.U. = 1-04820 M.
   The most recent values actually found for these relations
are given below:—

   M. Benoit has not compared his tubes directly with the
B. A. units. The mean of my comparisons gives for his
mercury tubes,           m.       = -95348 B.A.U.
                          B.A.U. = 1-04878 M.
Thus there is a difference of -0005 ohm between standards
issued by M. Benoit as representing the legal ohm, and those
issued by myself on behalf of the B. A. Committee, M.
Benoit's standards being less than mine by that amount.
   Some other points remain to be noticed. The first time
that I filled Nos. 37 and 39, I obtained results for the resist
ances differing appreciably from those given above. They
were filled each time with equal care, the mercury had been
treated in the same manner, and there seemed no reason,
taking each observation separately, why one should be better
than the other. For No. 37 I found on April 8th the value
1-00044 legal ohms ; I noticed on April 9 that this had gone
up to 1-00071 ; and on passing the mercury through as already
described, it rose further to 1 "00080. These differences are
considerably greater than any possible errors of observation ;

      Standard Resistance-coils with Mercury Standards.         351
and it was clear that there was some small change progressing
in the tube. It was carefully examined, but no trace of an
air-bubble could be seen ; and then it was emptied, cleaned
again, and refilled, with the results given in Table I. Much
the same was observed with coil No. 39. No. 38 was cleaned
and filled twice, butgave perfectly consistent results all through.
This uncertainty seems to me to constitute one serious objec
tion to the general employment of mercury tabes as standards.
   I believe that for the observations recorded in the above
Tables the tubes were properly filled, and that there were no
bubbles of air in them. This, I think, is shown by the agree
ment between the results of different fillings, and I suppose
that the resistance will not seriously alter so long as the same
mercury remains in the tubes ; but it appears that, after fill
ing, electrical experiments are required to make certain that
every bubble of air has been removed, and that the tube
really has its true resistance. I should imagine, too, that the
tubes would require somewhat frequent refilling to make sure
that the mercury may remain pure. My experiments showed
that it was almost impossible to keep the inside of the cups
above the mercury perfectly dry. It was necessary, when
making the comparisons, to remove the glass stopper and
insert the contact-pieces; and this had to be done when the
tube was immersed in the ice-water.
   The cups were open to the air for a short time in making
this change, and that short time was quite sufficient to cause
a deposit of dew to be formed on the inside of the cup. So
long as this slight moisture remained in the cup and did not
reach the tube itself, of course it did not affect the results ;
but it would be difficult to feel certain that after a time the
mercury in the tube was quite dry.
   This difficulty would be avoided by working at the tempe
rature of the room rather than at that of melting ice. The
large temperature-coefficient of mercury, from three to four
times that of platinum-silver alloy, is, however, an objection
to this.
   Another difficulty, caused by the necessity of working
at zero, was that the mercury in the cups was always
slightly warmer, 0o,2 or 0o,3 C, than the ice. This was, no
doubt, caused by the conduction of heat down the copper con
necting-rods, and from the upper portions of the glass of the
cups which were exposed to the air. This, of course, would
necessitate a small correction to the values of the resistances
given in the Tables; but the correction must be exceedingly
small, for the temperature of the mercury in the tube itself,
where it is actually in contact with the ice, must be zero,

352            Mr. B. T. Glazebrook's Comparison of
and it is only the small portions of the tubes which lie within
 the cups which will be at the higher temperature.
   The necessity of using the somewhat complicated con
necting pieces is also a great drawback to the practical use
fulness of the mercury standards. I hope shortly to carry
out some experiments on the permanence of the contact be
tween mercury and amalgamated platinum. Contact-pieces of
platinum with their end amalgamated with mercury would
be easier to work with, and should give consistent results.
   I have also made some observations on the variation of the
resistance of mercury with temperature.
   The formula quoted above from Benoit is given by Mascart,
Nerville, and Benoit as determined from experiments between
0° and 100°.
   It is
               B(=Bo(l + -0008649*+ -000001 12*2).
   According to Strecker,
                B, = Eo(l + -000900* + -00000045*2).
This is derived from observations at 0°, 10° 15°, and 20°.
   Lorenz finds that between 0° and 270,32 his experimental
results agree with the formula
                       B< = B0(1 + -0009013<);
and from 8°-32 to 35°-31 with
                        B*=Bo(l + 0009160-
   While Siemens and Halske give
              B,=Bo(l + -0008523* + -000001356*2).
   I made observations on the two tubes, Nos. 37 and 39,
determining their resistances at temperatures of about 0°, 5°,
10°, and 15°; and the results of the observations show that the
average change for low temperatures is less than that given
by the above formula;. Thus, if we call (B,— B^/Bq* the
average change between temperatures t and 0, the values, as
found from my experiments and as calculated by the formula?
of Siemens and Benoit, are as given below.

    The values given in the last column are the mean of those
 derived from the two tubes ; the greatest difference between
the mean and any one observed value was '000005. Strecker's
values would be above Benoit's.
    Lord Rayleigh found for the average change between 0°
and 12°, -000861.
    Of course the value of this temperature-coefficient depends
somewhat on the glass of the tube; but the differences between
the coefficients of expansion of various kinds of glass are too
small to account for the whole of the differences shown
 above.
    The paper by Herr Strecker on the same subject has been
already referred to, and it will be noticed that the number he
 arrives at as expressing M. in B.A. units differs by '00078
 from that given by Lord Rayleigh ; or, if we take the num
 bers expressing the B.A.U. in terms of M., the difference is
•00086. Now Strecker had compared his mercury tubes
with a B.A.U. tested carefully by myself against the stan
dards, and found to have the value of
                     •99937 B.A.U. at 17-7.
This coil is marked       No. 54.
    On the conclusion of his experiments, Herr Strecker re
turned this coil to me, and kindly sent with it a German-
silver copy of his tubes marked No. 13, and said to have,
according to his determinations, a resistance of
                      1-00189 M. at 10° C,
with a temperature-coefficient of
                       •000247 per degree.
    It was thus in my power to repeat my comparison of 3g , No.
54, with the standards, and to compare the values of M. as found
by Herr Strecker with the B.A.U. The value found for %
54 agreed very closely with that given by Herr Strecker ; the
results of my comparison of Herr Strecker's coil with the
B.A.U. are given below. The comparisons were made as
usual, by Carey-Foster's method; but since the difference be
tween the two resistances was such as to require the use
of a long piece of the bridge-wire, a resistance of 20 B.A. units
was introduced in multiple arc with the standard 1 unit.
This resistance was composed of the two standard ten-unit
coils of the Association.

Strecker's numbers give the result of the comparison of his
tubes directly with No. 54.
   I have not been able to explain the discrepancy. Herr
Strecker suggests in a letter to mo on the subject, that the
resistance of his coil No. 13 has changed somewhat in the
year which has elapsed since his comparisons were made. At
present I am in correspondence with Prof. F. Kohlrausch, of
Wiirzburg, in whose laboratory Strecker's experiments were
conducted, and hope to obtain another copy of Strecker's tubes,
or at any rate to have another comparison made between his
tubes and the I3.A. standards.
 XL. On the Accuracy of Focus necessary for Sensibly Perfect
            Definition. By Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.*
 IN my " Investigations in Optics " t I have examined the
      effect upon definition of small disturbances of the wave-
surfaces from their proper forms. It follows, for instance,
                     * Communicated bv the Author,

             necessary for Sensibly Perfect Definition,        355
that the aberration of a plano-convex lens focusing parallel
rays of homogeneous light is unimportant, so long as the
fourth power of the angular semi-aperture does not exceed
the ratio of the wave-length to the focal distance [a4 < (\//)],
a condition satisfied by a lens of 3 feet focus, provided that the
aperture be less than 2 inches. I propose at present to apply
similar principles to the question of focusing.
   The most convenient point of view is that explained* for
calculating the focal length of lenses. If the lens AB con
verges parallel rays to a focus at F, the retardation of the
central ray E F, due to the substitution of a thickness t of
glass for air, is (fi— l)t ; and this must be equal to the retar
dation of the extreme rays passing the (sharp) edge of the
lens, i. e. AF- CF. Thus, if AC =y, FC =/,
              (M-i)<=y(/4+^)-/=-2 7>                           (1)
approximately, which gives the focal length in terms of tho
semi-aperture and the " thickness " of the lens.
   If we suppose that yx varies,

giving the change of focus required to compensate the chango
of p. Lot us, however, inquire what is the state of things
at the old focus. The secondary rays from the extreme boun
dary of the lens arrive with the same phase as before the
change of index; but the central ray undergoes a relative
retardation amounting to Bfj, . t. This quantity tells us the
discrepancy of phase; and we know that if it is less than
the agreement of phase is still good enough to give nearly
perfect definition. Hence from (2) we see that a displace
ment Bf from t lie true focus will not impair definition, provided
                              ¥<Q                              (3)

356         Lord Rayleigh on the Accuracy of Focus
   It appears that the linear accuracy required is the same
whatever the absolute aperture of the object-glass may be,
provided that the ratio of aperture to focal length be pre
served.
   In some trials that I have made the diameter of the object-
glass was 1£ inch, and the focal length 12 inches. Taking
X=^^inch, we get from (3)
                         6/ < -0115 inch,
a result which corresponded very well with observation. The
instruments employed were the collimator and telescope of a
spectrometer, the object under examination being a slit backed
with a soda-flame. A high-power eve-piece was used, and
the telescope was adjusted until the edge of the slit and the
wire in the eye-piece were seen well defined together. The
instrument was unprovided with an easy focusing motion,
so that it was not possible to try backwards and forwards
conveniently. In this way the setting corresponded more
closely to the suppositions of theory than if it were the result
of comparisons between appearances at equal distances within
and without the point chosen. It will be understood that
 there is no theoretical limit to the accuracy with which a
 focal point may be ultimately determined, if the lenses are
 good, and observations are multiplied with suitable precautions
to avoid asymmetry.
   In ten settings the extreme difference was only "02 inch,
 showing that a displacement of 01 inch from the true focal
 point was just recognizable.
    By using various coloured flames, or by throwing a spec
 trum upon the slit of the apparatus, we may determine the
 focal length for different kinds of light. With proper achro
 matic lenses the differences should be pretty small, the
 minimum focal length corresponding to the yellow-green
 rays. It so happens that my instrument is far from properly
 compensated, and gives a fair primary spectrum, so that the
 difference of focus for yellow and green is very easily recog
 nized. In the case of a single lens this method would give
the dispersive power of the glass with fair accuracy. By
 comparison with the theory of the resolving power of prisms,
 we see that the dispersion is about as favourably determined
 with a lens as with a prism of equal thickness. In either
 case a change of index such that 8ji . t = ^\ leaves the phase
 agreement nearly unaltered at the original points ; but in
 other respects the circumstances are probably rather more
 favourable in the case of the prism.
    It is generally considered that the most accurate way of

              necessary for Sensibly Perfect Definition.    357
  focusing a small telescope is to move the eye across the eye
  piece, altering the adjustment until there seems to be no re
 lative motion of object and cross wires. I have tried this
 plan in an improved form in order to see whether a higher
 degree of accuracy of adjustment was really attainable, al
 though theory seemed to show that no great advance was
 to be looked for. A heavy pendulum, executing complete
 vibrations in about two seconds, was fitted up in front of the
 telescope, and carried with it a screen perforated by a slit.
 The width of the slit was about a quarter of the entire aper
 ture, and the oscillations were at first of such amplitude as
 just to bring the extreme edges of the lens into play. In the
 earlier experiments the slit of the collimator was backed by
 the clouds, a piece of green glass being interposed. This was
 before I had discovered the remarkably unachromatic character
 of the instruments, and I was puzzled to interpret the ap
 pearances presented. On one side of the focus the relative
 motion of the image was (as it should be) in the same direc
 tion as that of the pendulum, and on the other side in the
 opposite direction ; but the transition was not well defined,
 and the image executed evolutions very visible to the ob
 server, who at the same time was not able to describe them
 as swinging in one direction or the other. The effect upon
 the eye was remarkably unpleasant and fatiguing to watch ;
 it disappeared when recourse was had to sodium light, and
 doubtless depended upon the variation of quality in the light.
 It may be noticed that spherical aberration would show itself
 by a swinging of the imago in a period half that of the
 pendulum.
    With the soda-flame the adjustment to focus by getting rid
 of the swinging motion was pretty accurate ; but not much
 advantage was gained in comparison with a setting by simple
 inspection under full aperture.         As before, the extreme
 difference in a set of ten was about "02 inch.
    The substitution of white for monochromatic light was in
structive. In either extreme position of the oscillating slit
the light was seen to be spread into a spectrum of moderate
length, the blue and red being interchanged after each half
period. Under these circumstances the cross wires can be
made to maintain their position in that part of the spectrum
only for which the telescope is focused. If, for example, it
be the green of the spectrum, we may bring the cross wires
to this position when the pendulum is at rest, and then, in
spite of the oscillation, the position will be maintained. If,
without altering the focus, we move the cross wires to another
part of the spectrum, then, when the pendulum oscillates, the

358         Lord Kayleigh on an Improved Apparatus
wires will be seen on a different part of the spectrum after
each half period. In order to fix the new part of the spectrum
upon the cross wires, a change of focus is demanded. This
experiment would hardly succeed with properly compensated
object-glasses, but it could bo imitated with the aid of single
lenses.
XLI. On an Improved Apparatus for Christiansen's Experi
              ment. By Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.*
THE very beautiful experiment in question, described by
       C. Christiansen in Wiedemann's Annalen for November
 1884, consists in immersing glass-powder in a mixture of
benzole and bisulphide of carbon of such proportions that for
one part of the spectrum the indices of the solid and of the
fluid are the same. Being interested in this subject from
having employed the same principle for a direct-vision spec
troscope (Phil. Mag. January 1880, p. 53), I have repeated
Christiansen's experiment in a somewhat improved form,
which it may be worth while briefly to describe, as the matter
is one of great optical interest.
   I must premise that the beauty of the effect depends upon
the correspondence of index being limited to one part of tho
spectrum. Bays lying within a very narrow range of refran-
gibility traverse the mixture freely, but the neighbouring
rays are scattered laterally much as in passing ground glass.
Two complementary colours are therefore exhibited, one by
direct, and the other by oblique, light. In order to see these
to advantage, there should not be much diffused illumination,
otherwise the directly transmitted monochromatic light is
liable to be greatly diluted. The prettiest colours are ob
tained when the undisturbed rays are from the green ; but
the greatest general transparency corresponds to a lower
point in tho spectrum.
   The improvement referred to relates merely to the use of a
flat-sided bottle to contain the preparation. In order to get
a satisfactory result it is necessary that the sides of the con
taining vessel be pretty good optically. This condition may
be satisfied with a built-up cell, but on account of the diffi
culty of finding a suitable cement, it is rarely that such
cells remain in good order for any length of time. It
occurred to me that a bottle might bo made to answer tho
purpose, provided the precaution were taken of using the same
kind of glass for the bottle and for the powder. Tho outer sur-

                  for Christiansen's Experiment.                 359
faces of the glass sides of the bottle can he worked flat, while
the unavoidable irregularities of the inner surfaces are com
pensated by the liquid, which, being adjusted to have the
same index as the powder, will have also the same index as
the glass of the bottle.
    The bottles that I have used* are about 3 inches high,
1A inch wide, and about f inch thick, outside measurement.
The outer surfaces are worked (like plate glass), and not
merely flattened upon a wheel, as is usual with ordinary per
fume bottles. For my earlier trials I was provided with a
piece of flint glass from the same pot as the bottles ; but
although the experiment succeeded well enough as regards
the elimination of the internal irregularities of the walls, the
glass-powder itself did not behave as well as I had seen plate-
glass powder do. It appeared ultimately that the flint was
 not sufficiently homogeneous for the purpose, and another
 specimen of flint was also a partial failure, from the same
cause ; but a sample of optical flint, kindly supplied to me by
Dr. Hopkinson, gave excellent results.
    It is more important that the powder should be homo
 geneous in itself than that it should correspond very accu
 rately with the glass of the bottle. For ordinary purposes
 plate-glass powder (all, of course, from one piece) may be
 used in a bottle of soda-glass, or even of ordinary low flint.
 In preparing the powder great care is required to excludo
 dirt. With respect to the coarser grades there is no great
 difficulty, but the finer powder is apt to bo contaminated with
 the substance of the mortar. I prefer to use one of iron, so
 that a magnet will remove the foreign matter. The elimination
 of fine dust is also facilitated by a blast of wind from bellows.
     In order to get good definition it is necessary not only that
 the powder be homogeneous, but that the temperature bo
 uniform ; for, as Christiansen has shown, the transmitted ray
 rises rapidly in refrangibility with temperature. In order to
 secure homogeneity it is sometimes necessary to shake up the
 preparation, which (to prevent the formation of air-bubbles)
 is best done with a rather gentle motion while the bottle is
 held nearly horizontal. The proportion of liquids necessary
 varies with the temperature and with the kind of glass. Flint
  will require a higher proportion of bisulphide of carbon than
 plate-gla:-s. If the transmitted light is too high in the spec
  trum, add more bisulphide of carbon ; if too low, more
  benzole.
     The experimenter, working in a room lighted in the ordi
  nary manner, will be disposed at first to underrate the degree

of homogeneity of the transmitted light. If the shutters be
nearly closed, so that light finds entrance through a narrow
slit only, a better judgment can be formed, which may be
tested b}' prismatic analysis.
   In an otherwise dark room, lighted by a powerful soda-
flame, it is interesting to remark how very slight a change in
the critical colour manifests itself in the general appearance
of surrounding objects seen through the preparation. When
the ray of maximum transmission corresponds closely to that
of soda, the powder is almost invisible, and objects are seen
as through a clear medium. But so slight a change of tem
perature brings with it a hazy appearance, that it requires
some care to obtain the best effect. It is desirable also to
exclude by absorbing media the blue light which usually
attends a soda-flame in very sensible degree.
  XLII. Optical Comparison of Methods for observing Small
           Rotations. By Lord Bayleigh, F.R.S.*
IN order to measure very small rotations, e. g. of the sus
      pended parts of a galvanometer or magnetometer, two
methods are commonly employed. We may either observe
with a magnifier the motion of a material pointer; or, follow
ing Gauss, cause the rotating parts to carry round a mirror
in which a scale is seen by reflection. In a modification of
Gauss's method, well known from Sir W. Thomson's galva
nometers, the image of a dark or bright line is thrown ob
jectively upon the scale. In deciding which arrangement to
adopt in any particular case, various circumstances would have
to be taken into account, but still a comparison of capabilities
from a purely optical point of view is not without interest.
   In the mirror method the optical limit depends upon the
horizontal breadth of the mirror itself. The easiest road to
the desired conclusion, as well as the most instructive, is by a
direct application of the principles of the wave theory. To
take the simplest case, we will suppose the mirror rectangular.
Consider, then, aluminous point, and its image after reflection,
whether in the focal plane of a telescope, or formed directly
upon a scale. The optical work being perfect, the secondary
rays from every part of the mirror agree in phase at the focal
point. Now suppose that the mirror rotates through such
an angle that one vertical edge advances a quarter of a wave
length     X), while the other retreats to the same amount, and
consider the effect on the phase-relations at the point in ques-

     On the Thermodynamic Efficiency of the Thermopile.            3G1
tion. Tt is evident that one extreme wave is accelerated and the
other retarded by £ X, and that the phases are now distributed
uniformly over a complete cycle. The result is therefore
darkness; and the effect of the rotation has been to shift the
image through half the width of the central bright band
which, with accompanying fringes, is the representative in
the image of a mathematical lino *. Such a motion would
be visible (with proper arrangements as to magnifying), but
the limits of revolving power are being approached. It is to
be noticed that the conclusion is independent of the focal
length of the mirror and of the employment of a telescope.
Provided of course that the full width of the mirror is really
used, a motion of its vertical edges through \ \ may be made
evident.
    A comparison with the method by direct observation of a
 pointer is now easy ; for, as has been proved by the re
 searches of Abbe and Helmholtz, a motion of \ X. may be
 rendered evident in a very similar degree by direct applica
 tion of a perfect microscope to the moving object. If, there
 fore, we suppose the length of the pointer to be equal to the
 half-width of the minor, the two methods are optically upon
 a level. It is needless to say that it would be easy to give
 the pointer a great advantage in this respect ; but the direct
 use of the microscope would often be interfered with by
 motions in the line of sight, making it impossible to preserve
 the focus. And besides this, it is sometimes necessary for the
 observer to remain at a distance.
  XLIII. On the Thermodynamic Efficiency of the Thermopile.
                     By Lord Rayleigh, FM.SJ
 DURING the last few years the thoughts of many elec
          tricians have turned to the question of the possibility
 of replacing Hie dynamo by some development of the thermo
 pile; and it is, I believe, pretty generally recognized that the
 difficulty in the way is the too free passage of heat by ordi
 nary conduction from the hot to the cold junction. The
 matter may perhaps be placed in a clearer light by an actual
  calculation, accompanied by a rough numerical estimate
 applicable to the case of German silver and iron.

   The magnitude of the current (C) is found by dividing
this by the sum of the internal and external resistances
(lt0 + K); and the useful work done externally per second is
11C2. It reaches a maximum when the external resistance is
equal to the internal ; and its amount is then
The value of the internal resistance R0 depends upon the
dimensions and specific resistances of the bars. Denoting the
latter quantities by r,, r3, and taking <r,, cr2 to represent the
areas of section, the common length being I, wo havo

    Tho ratio of this to the useful work is
 independent of (/— f0), of n, and of /. It is further evident
 that the ratio in question does not depend upon the absolute
 values of the sections, or of the electrical and thermal resist

 indicated by these expressions (in which the terminal tempe
 ratures are regarded as given), and probably determined in
 practice by the necessity of conveying the heat to the scene
 of action.
    The resistances being given, the ratio of sections cr2 jax is
 to be determined so as to make our ratio a minimum. This
 happens when

                              e=3-0xl03.
   The value of J is 4*2 x 107, and for t we will assume 500
(absolute measure). The use of these gives, as the ratio of
the work that would be obtained by a perfect engine from the
conducted heat to that actually obtained from the thermo
electric force, the number 300; from which we may concludo
that the steam-engine and dynamo are not likely to be super
seded by a German-silver and iron thermopile, oven though
considerable allowance bo made for the admitted roughness of
the numerical estimate.
   As regards other materials, it is interesting to note that the
ratio contains as divisor the square of the electromotive force
per degree.
XLIV. Electro-optic Action of a Charged Franklin's Plate.
   By John Kerb, LL.D., Free Church Training College,
    Glasgow f.
I HAVE examined this difficult subject in several sets of
      experiments, the last of which was finished about three
years ago. Having satisfied my own mind, I dropped the
subject, thinking that no publication of the results was
     * Everett's 4 Units and Physical Constants' ; Landolt's Tdbcllen.
     t Communicated by the Author.

 364           Dr. J. Kerr on the Electro-optic Action
 required ; but on looking into M. Wiedemann's treatise, now
 in course of publication, I have been led to believe that a
 short paper on the subject may be of some use.
    In his opening remarks on Electro-Optics*, M. Wiedemann
 draws attention to the experiments tried on Franklin's plates
 by MM. Quincke, Gordon, Mackenzie, and Grassman ; and
 he seems to accept the absence of effect in these experiments
 as decisive of the question of action or no action, in a uni
 formly charged plate of glass. Accordingly, when he comes
 to the earliest known instance of electro-optic double refrac
 tion (the effect of intense electric stress at the centre of a
 block of glass, which I discovered in 1875), he introduces my
 experiment as an example of a non-uniform and 0}>tically
 active elecb-ic field, in contrast, with those other experiments f,
 as examples of a field sensibly uniform and optically inuctire.
 Afterwards, at the end of his exhaustive account of the whole
 subject, M. Wiedemann returns to the same point, and makes,
 in substance, the three following statements :—
    ( 1 ) When the dielectric is a solid (a block of glass), and
 the distribution of electric force is not uniform, there are
 certain strains known to be produced (simple expansions,
 which are greatest at the place of shortest lines of force) ;
 and these known strains may account for the observed
effects.
    (2) There appears to be no electro-optic double refraction
in the case of a uniformly charged Franklin's plate.
    (3) But if one of the coatings be much reduced in size,
 or if we use, instead of it, a little mercury, contained within a
 small ring of glass, which is cemented to the upper surface
of the plate at its centre, then the charging of the plate gives
rise to a strain (a simple expansion, such as that produced by
 local rise of temperature) in the part of the plate immediately
 between the coatings, and a ray which passes through the
plate and between the coatings is doubly refracted of course.
    For some additional matter on the subject, not required
here, I must refer to M. Wiedemann's treatise. The prece
 ding statements give a correct view of a theory of the pheno
mena, which was advanced some years ago by M. Quincke ;
the first statement giving his explanation of my experiment
already referred to, and the third giving an explanatory
account of a subsequent experiment of his own. My principal
objection to this theory has always been, that it ignores

those pure and intense effects which I obtained long ago in
liquid dielectrics, particularly in carbon disulphide, and in a
sensibly uniform field. The strains assumed in the first and
third statements are undoubtedly real ; and it must be left to
experiment to determine whether, and how far, they take
effect in any actual case. With regard to my own early
experiments on thick plates of glass, I am not aware of any
evidence to show that these very small strains contributed to
the observed effects in any degree whatever ; but I pass from
these points to our proper subject.
    The second of the preceding statements is not true in any
other sense than as a record of several inadequate experi
ments. I find that a charged Franklin's plate, with uncoated
margin so wide only as to give a small, working difference
of potentials, acts upon transmitted light in the same way as
olive oil, amyl oxide, or any other negative dielectric. My
earlier experiments on the Franklin's plate need not be de
 scribed, as they were chiefly of use in deciding between
 methods, and in showing the difficulties that had to be avoided
 or overcome. My last set of experiments on the subject were
 finished in July 1882 ; and the following account of them is
 drawn from full notes that were taken at the time.
    One of my best plates was a rectangular piece of good
 English plate-glass, exactly | of an inch thick, 2£ inches
wide, 4f long. This piece was one of a set, which wore cut
 out of separate plates or fragments, and were then put together,
 and worked in block as one thick plate. The smaller ends of
 the thick plato were ground to sensibly parallel planes, and
 were polished carefully, till the glass gave a perfectly clear
 and undistorted view of neighbouring objects through the
 length of the block. Before going further with the prepara
 tion of the plates, I tested them separately in the polariscope;
 for 1 had found already that, unless the plates were tested
 and carefully selected, the experiments in view were almost
 hopeless.
    Along with a couple of Nicol's prisms, two other pieces
 were employed—a rectangular slip of thin plate-glass used
 as a hand-compensator, and a larger slip used as a fixed
 compensator, the latter being placed in a simple screw-
 press, and subjected to horizontal tensions and compres
 sions, which could be made to vary continuously through a
  considerable range. The two iNicols were placed in hori
 zontal line with a good paraffin flame, and were exactly
  crossed, their principal sections being at 45° to the vertical.
  The plate was then fixed between the two Nicols, its faces
  vertical, and its terminal polished surfaces perpendicular to

366          Dr. J. Kerr on the Electro-optic Action
the incident polarized pencil. The insertion of the plate
restored the light always from extinction ; and the fainter this
restoration, the more promising was the plate. The fixed
compensator, which stood between the Nicols, and immediately
after the plate, was then strained by trial, with or without
small rotation of the second Nicol, till good extinction was
obtained permanently ; and the feebler the strain thus required,
and the purer and sharper the extinction obtained, the more
promising was the plate. The hand-compensator was then
inserted between the fixed compensator and the second Nicol,
and supplied the last part of the test, which consisted in
observing the degree of strain (horizontal tension or com
pression) which had to be applied, to give good restoration
from extinction. When the requisite strain was small or very
moderate, the plate was accepted as good, otherwise not.
   The most of the plates that I have had in hand were pure
failures under this test, and were therefore thrown aside as
evidently quite unsuited for the electro-optic experiment. Of
the set of six plates last started with, four were rejected with
out hesitation, the fifth was very imperfect, but worthy of
trial, the sixth was good, though not perfect. Of another set
of plates, which were only half as thick as the former, there
was none even moderately good ; but one of them was re
tained, as in a small degree promising. The serious failure
was generally in the last step of the test, that with the hand-
compensator. When a good or very fair permanent extinc
tion had been obtained by the joint action of the plate under
trial and the fixed compensator, I found often that it required
the exertion of almost all my strength on the hand-compensator,
to get anything like a good restoration in the polariscope.
   The light should have been well restored by a barely sensible
effort ; but, in its passage through such a length of irregularly
strained glass, it had lost ever so much of that sensitiveness
under bi-refringent action which constitutes the whole value
of the plane-polarized ray in any really delicate electro-optic
work. No clear optical effect of moderate electric stress
could be reasonably looked for in a plate such as that now
mentioned, which allowed only a very small effect, or a mere
trace of effect, to be given by a comparatively very strong
bi-refringent action of the hand-compensator.
   The plate chosen was coated with tinfoil in the usual way,
the margin left on each face all round being rather less than
a qxiarter inch. Projecting from the centre of each coating
there was a small conducting tongue, made of a bit of tinfoil,
 which was folded several times on itself, opened out at one
end, and pasted securely by that end to the coating. When

                  of a Charged Franklin's Plate.               307
the paste had dried thoroughly, the plate was covered with a
coat of thick lac-varnish all over, with exception of the polished
ends and the conducting tongues. Another co.it of the varnish
was applied afterwards ; and the operation was repeated more
than a dozen times, proper intervals of time being allowed
for the drying of the varnish. When all was done, the tin
coating was dimly visible in a good light, and the envelope of
lac appeared to be perfectly continuous.
   The plate was placed edgeways on the top of a fixed pillar
of glass, and was attached to the pillar by a few drops of
melted lac. Two perforated balls of brass, supported on
separate pillars, were brought up to the plate at the centres of
the two coatings; and the conducting tongues, passing into
the perforations of the balls, were in good permanent contact
with the brass. Through these balls the two coatings could
be put into and out of connection with prime conductor and
earth, and without any pressure on the plate. Two small
screens of thin vulcanite were attached lightly to the plate on
opposite sides of it, so as to protect the eye from all useless
light.
    Final State of the Best Plate.—The insulating power was
not great. When one coating of the plate was connected with
prime conductor and the other with earth, the spark-length
between prime conductor and knuckle was at first about one
sixth of an inch ; but afterwards, when the lac had hardened
better on the plate, and in favourable weather, the spark-
length was fully a quarter inch. Spark and shock were of
course a good deal heavier than from the prime conductor
unconnected.
    The optical action of the best plate (still uncharged) was
 not sensibly different from what had been shown already in
 the process of testing. The sensibility of the ray under the
 action of the hand-compensator was indeed very satisfactory,
 considering that the light had passed through more than four
inches of glass.
    Method of Exj)eriment.— In the simplest mode of working,
 the pieces were placed on the table in horizontal line and in
 this order :—paraffin flame, screen with narrow and short
 vertical slit, first Nicol with principal section at 45° to the
 vertical, the Franklin's plate with coated faces vertical, and
 terminal faces perpendicular to the incident pencil, fixed com
 pensator, a little space for the hand-compensator, second Nicol
 at extinction. The axis of the small transmitted pencil of
 light was equidistant from the upper and lower edges of the
 coatings. ]n another arrangement, the collimator and lunette
  of a spectroscope were used, the lunetle behind the second

 368           Dr. J. Kerr on the Electro-optic Action
  Nicol, and the collimator (with very narrow vertical slit) before
  the first Nicol, the light employed being either a sunbeam or
  a beam from the bright sky. This arrangement served well
  in the case of the very thin plate already mentioned, which
  could not be managed well with the naked eye, because of the
  confusion produced by internal reflections ; but for the larger
  and better plates the first arrangement was preferred.
     The electric force was applied most conveniently as follows.
 A Leyden jar stood on the table near the Franklin's plate ;
  and the outer coating of the jar and second coating of the
 plate were put permanently to earth. The jar was charged
 by twenty to thirty turns of the plate-machine : a common
  discharger, connected with the first coating of the Franklin's
  plate, was brought up to contact with the knob of the jar, but
 gradually, so as to avoid spark-discharge over the margin of
  the plate; and when the contact had been maintained for about
 three seconds, the connection was broken, and the plate was at
 the same time discharged. In this way the optical observation
 lasted only for the few seconds before and after discharge of
 the plate, so that small changes of intensity of the light in the
 polariscope were the more easily detected.
    First Experiment .—Particular attention was given to the
 delicacy of action of the polariscope. The extinction was
 made as pure as possible by proper strain in the fixed com-
 Eensator. The sharpness of the extinction was tested by the
   and -compensator, the requisito delicacy being obtained when
 the light was restored clearly by feeble strains, horizontal
 compression and tension successively. When these conditions
 were fulfilled, the electric force, applied in the manner just
 described, gave good restoration from extinction in the pola
 riscope, the light brightening gradually for a second or two,
 and then, after discharge of the plate, falling back to extinction
 at much the same rate. The intensity of the restored light
 was never great, being equal to that given by a veiy moderate
 compression in the hand-compensator. When the insulation
 was very defective, or the plate optically bad, the effect was
 very poor indeed, and could not always be seized with cer
 tainty; but when these unfavourable conditions were avoided,
 the rise and fall of the light, from extinction and back to it,
were quite distinct and regular.
    Second Experiment .—The light was restored faintly from
extinction, as by horizontal compression of the fixed compen
sator. I say as by horizontal compression, because the
action of the uncharged Franklin's plate in the polariscope was
sometimes equivalent to horizontal compression, and had to be
neutralized by horizontal tension of the fixed compensator ;

                  of a Charged Franklin's Plate.                369
and then the desired effect was obtained by a small diminution
of that horizontal tension. In any case, the permanent initial
restoration required in this experiment, when tested by the
hand-compensator, was clearly strengthened by a feeble
horizontal compression, and clearly weakened by a feeble
horizontal tension. When these conditions were fulfilled,
the light was regularly and very clearly strengthened by
charge of the plate, the intensity rising and falling gradually,
—before and after discharge—as in the first experiment.
Under adverse conditions, the insulation bad, or the plate
optically imperfect, this experiment succeeded a good deal
better than the first, the effect being, as it ought to be,
distinctly stronger.
   Third Experiment.—The light was restored faintly from
extinction, as by horizontal tension of the fixed compensator ;
and this initial effect was seen to be properly affected under
the action of the hand-compensator, clearly weakened by a
feeble horizontal compression, and clearly strengthened by a
feeble horizontal tension. The electric force being applied as
formerly, the changes now observed in the polariscope were
contrary to those obtained in the second experiment, and
apparently of equal range. During charge the light was
weakened, its intensity falling regularly and very clearly for
a second or two, and then, after discharge, returning to the
initial value at much the same rate. In this experiment, as
in the other two, the intensity of the effects was very mode
rate at the best ; but there was no uncertainty or indistinct
ness about the results, except when the conditions were known
to be very unfavourable.
   I have referred already to the earliest known instance of
electro-optic double refraction. In that instance, the electric
field lay between and around the ends of two straight col-
linear wires, at the centre of a block of glass, the thickness
of glass between the terminals being (as in the present experi
ments) about | of an inch, and the thickness traversed by
the ray f of an inch. It would be difficult to realize an elec
tric field much more unlike that of the Franklin's plate ; and
yet the optical effects obtained in that case were of precisely
the same kind as those obtained in the present experiments,—
negative double refractions with reference to line of electric
force as axis. It appears thus, that the fact of electro-optic
double refraction in glass is not dependent on form of the elec
tric field, or mode of distribution of the electric forces.
   There is one thing brought out by the preceding compari
son which is at first sight not satisfactory. In the Franklin's
plate as compared with the old dielectric, there was a con
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 20. No. 125. Oct. 1885.            2 D

  370          Dr. J. Kerr on the Electro-optic Action
  siderable increase of thickness of the dielectric in the direction
  of the ray, and yet there was a large decrease of intensity of
  effect. But if we assume, as we may fairly do, that the
  quantity of optical effect varies as the square of the difference
   of potential of the two coatings, we see that a moderate in
   crease of ray-length in the dielectric may be much more than
   counterbalanced by a moderate decrease of difference of
  potentials. Now in the old experiment and the new, the
  ratio of ray-lengths in the dielectrics was about I to 6, while
  the change of spark-length was from an average of 6 inches
  to a maximum of £ inch, implying a large fall of potential.
   I may even observe that the increase of ray-length in the
  present experiments appears to have told clearly on the in
  tensity of the effect, because, in the old experiment, and in
  the most favourable circumstances, hardly any effect could be
  obtained with as little as an inch of spark-length.
     But, further, we must remember those permanent and irre
  gular strains which were sought to be eliminated in the pre
  liminary testing of the plates. The disturbing influence of
  these strains may be expected to increase with every increase
  of ray-length in the dielectric, and with every decrease of the
  difference of potential. When the ray-length in glass
  amounts to several inches, I believe that it is not possible to
  get rid of this disturbance perfectly. In the best plates that
  I have worked with, not only was the disturbance present,
  but it always told seriously, weakening if not masking the
 effect of any very small birefringent action to which the
 transmitted ray could be subjected. Taking these things
 into account, and viewing the new phenomena and the old
 as cases of the same effect of electric force, I consider the
 small effects now obtained with the Franklin's plate to be as
 good as could fairly be expected, and better than could bo
 expected confidently ; and 1 therefore hold it proved by ex
 periment, that electrostatically strained glass acts in the polari-
 scope as if compressed along the lines of electric force, and thus
 always, whether the electric field is uniform or not.
    I conclude briefly with a simple and important argument,
 which appears to be secured now against all reasonable ob
jection. With reference always to resultant effect in the
polariscope, as characterized by (say) the hand compensator:—
Electrically charged glass acts as if conq>ressed along the lines
of force ; electrically charged resin acts as if extended along the
lines of force ; electrically charged oil of colza, a negative di
electric, acts precisely as glass compressed in a direction parallel
to the lines of force ; electrically charged carbon disulphide, a
positive dielectric, acts precisely as glass extended in a direc

                  of a Charged Franklin's Plate.               371
tion parallel to the lines of force ; and so forward uniformly
 (with variations of intensity and sign, and with occasional
disturbance, mostly from known causes) through a list of
more than 120 different dielectrics, as I have proved by ex
 periments already published. The similarity of all these
optical actions implies a similarity of condition in all the
acting media. We infer that glass, resin, oil of colza, carbon
disulphide, and all those other dielectrics, when electrically
 charged, are also specially and similarly strained. And it
 seems to be quite consistent with proper caution, in the ab
sence of opposing evidence, to extend this conclusion to all
dielectrics whatsoever.
   We are led thus by the facts of electro-optics, and inde
pendently of all theory, to the conception and realization of
electrostatic strain,—a strain maintained by the action of elec
tric force, or (at least) in exclusive and indissoluble connection
with that action, and sustained by the dielectric as an elastic
 medium,—a strain of one type in all dielectrics,—a strain
 essentially directional in liquids as in solids,—a strain sui
generis. And in all this, or rather in the facts themselves,
 we have a remarkable confirmation of the theoretical views of
 Faraday and Maxwell.
   Glasgow, 21st August, 1885.
   Postscript.—In the charged Franklin's plate, the glass is
 compressed by the electric attraction of the two coatings;
and it may be inquired how far this mechanical strain contri
butes to the effect obtained in the preceding experiments. I
have had this question suggested to me by Sir William
Thomson, as too important and too obvious to be neglected,
and admitting also of a simple method of solution ; but I arn
sorry that the best answer obtainable with my present means
is very vague and uncertain.
   When the old Franklin's plate is laid flat, compressed by a
weight uniformly distributed over it, and submitted to the old
test in the polariscope, I find that it requires a total weight of
1£ pound to give an effect equal to the old effect of electric
charge. This compressing force of \\ pound must be much
greater than the attraction of the elect rically charged coatings,
whose dimensions are about 2 x 3| inches, their distance
J inch, and their difference of potentials at the moment of
observation probably less than that corresponding to a spark
of i inch in air. It seems, therefore, that the part of the
optical effect of electric charge which is due to compression of
the glass must be very small, if not insensible. I should men-
lion, however, that by a simple calculation, on the assumption

of an important determination made by Sir William Thomson*,
the preceding figures give a superior limit of the attraction
of the coatings, which is as large as one ninth of the optically
equivalent compressing weight. As to a definite solution of
the question, I hope to attempt that, or something equivalent,
very soon, in a set of experiments which I have had in view
for some time.

XLV. Sequel to Paper on the Seat of the Electromotive Forces
    in a Voltaic Cell. Theories of Wiedemann and q/Helmholtz.
    By Professor Oliveb LoDGEf.
 IN a recent BeibliUter\, Prof. G. Wiedemann points out that
       in my summary of views and work in connection with
 the seat of E.M.F. in the pile I have ignored his theory. I
 had in fact been mainly concerned with possible explanations
 of the Volta-effect ; while Prof. Wiedemann starts with this as
 a datum, and on the strength of it explains the action of the
 pile. Moreover, since most of the theoretical opinions held on
 this subject are summarized at the end of the second volume of
 his Elektricitat, while his own theory is given in the first volume,
 along with the account of Volta-force experiments, I had over
 looked it. To make amends for this oversight, for which I
 beg to express my regret, and because I find it difficult to
 summarize his opinions briefly, I trust I may be permitted
 to give a rough semi-literal translation of his most conspicuous
  passages as a help to other students of the subject.

     " We have now to investigate in what way the electrical
  forces in a closed circuit of two metals and a liquid (e.g. Zn, Cu,
  dilute HC1) are excited. We know that the constituents of
  the binary compound contained in the liquid separate by the
  passage of the current in such a way that the one (H) is set free
  at the copper and an equivalent quantity of the other (CI) at
  the zinc, and that the latter combines with an equivalent
  quantity of zinc to form ZnCl. Tin's process shows that the
  deportment of the binary body between the metals consists no
  longer only in a simple overbalancing attraction of its whole
  mass for one or the other electricity, as in metals, but also in

a special action of its constituents. Since the constituent CI
is liberated where the + current enters the liquid, and H
¦where the negative enters, we suppose that each equivalent of
CI in the compound HC1 is charged with a definite quantity
of negative electricity, which conditions its attraction for the
opposite positive electricity. It is the electro-negative element
of the compound. So also must the equivalent H be charged
with + E and form the electro-positive element. These
charges could be produced by the combination of H and CI
exactly in the same way as they are produced by the contact
of zinc and copper. Since the HC1 formed is unelectrified,
we must suppose that atoms of the + and — constituents
contain equal quantities of + and — E.
    " If now we immerse a Zn and a Cu plate into the dilute
 HC1, we can conjecture that the zinc has a stronger attraction
 for the electro-negative constituent (CI) than for the H. In
 consequence of this the molecule of HC1 touching the zinc
 will so lay itself that its electro-negative element is near the
 zinc and its electro-positive element near the copper. At the
 same time the molecules thus polarized act by electrical attrac
tion on the constituents of the successive molecules of HC1,
 arranging the whole row of molecules between the Zn and the
 Cu plates as in the figure.

     " By induction the negative electricity of the zinc-touching
  electro-negative constituent, chlorine, would act on the E in
  the zinc in such a way that the near parts will charge them
  selves positively, the further parts negatively. In the same
  way the copper adjacent to the electro-positive element (H)
  of the HC1 atom lying against it will receive negative elec
  tricity. The positive will remove itself to the remoter regions.
     " Thereupon the positive electricity in the zinc would com
  bine with the negative of the next-lyiug CI atom, and this
  latter with zinc to form unelectrical ZnCl. The electro-positive
  atom H which was formerly joined to that CI atom would itself
  unite with the neighbouring atom of CI belonging to the second

 ahead, and we will let them serve for the next fifteen or six

    " It is evident that in this process there occurs a continual
 loss of vis viva, since the elements of the binary compound
 rushing up to the metal move with a definite velocity to the
 metal, and then are reduced to rest, either with formation
 of ZnCl or by being set free (H). This loss of vis viva is the
 equivalent of the heat which is evolved by the obviously occur
 ring chemical process, which essentially is the solution of an
 equivalent of zinc in the acid. The same value must like
 wise be tho work applied in effecting the redistribution of
electricity.
    "When, therefore, electricity begins to flow, work must
be done, during the solution of Zn and liberation of an eq. of
 H from the liquid in the whole circuit, whether it be in the
form of heat or of external work, which is equivalent to the
heat-production attending that chemical process.
    " The electrical shearing-force E is an accelerating force,
so its work A in unit time is equal to its product with the
quantity of electricity moved in unit time, m, and the distance
s which the same travels, or
                            A=E . rns.
The product ms expresses the quantity of electricity which
travels per second through the cross section of the conductor.
   " If we have different combinations, as Zn, HC1, Cu ; or
Mg, H2S04 or NaCl,Cu; or &c, we suppose that the same
quantity of E travels per equivalent .... [a long appeal to the
facts underlying Faraday's law is made to prove this] ; hence

or the E.M.F. is directly proportional to the heat generated
by the decomposition of an equivalent of the binary compound
and the solution of the zinc.
   " For the production of steady currents, that electrical force
can alone be active which depends on the unequal attraction
and polarization of the atoms of the binary compound in the
exciting liquid of the cell ; the electrical force at the contact-
place of the metals which no mechanical changes can prelude
must, on the other hand, be inactive. That this latter, if it
perhaps opposed the metal liquid E.M.F. (as by immersion
of zinc and lead in KCy solution), is not compensated by
a definite part of the tension force, is proved by the afore

said complete proportionality of the total electrical force (and
E.M.F.) in the closed circuit with the said heat-equivalent
of the chemical processes. It must then be neutralized in
some other way. This would most simply happen on the
hypothesis that, by contact of the exciting fluid with the
metals, the E.M.F. is excited in a double way : first, by
an unequally strong attraction of the masses of fluid and metal
as a whole for the one or the other electricity ; and, secondly,
by the unequal attraction of the metals for the oppositely
electrified components of the liquid.          (This double pro
perty would be quite analogous to the following : a metal (e. g.
zinc) can not only attract to itself by adhesion the whole mass
of any given fluid (HC1), but also can exert a much stronger
attraction for one constituent of the same (chlorine); just
also as a magnet attracts iron, not only by reason of gravi
tation, but much more because of the magnetic polarization
of its individual particles.)
   " In consequence of the first unequal (mass) attraction for
the electricities, the decomposable liquids would behave exactly
according to the metallic law of tension, and in a closed circuit
of metals aud liquids a complete neutralization of electrical
forces (and E.M.F.) would obtain ; the second (chemical)
action would, on the other hand, alone produce the electrical
shearing-force effective in current formation and its accom
panying E.M.F.
    " We will therefore in the sequel denote the total E.M.F. at
the various junctions with strong letters, and that portion of
the same of which no part engages in exciting the current
by italics in brackets, and by italics without brackets the
 portion corresponding to the chemical work. In the closed
 circuit—zinc, sulphuric acid, copper—the whole active E.M.F.
 would then be
Cu/S + S/Zn + Zn/Cu= Cu/S + S/Zn + ( Cu/S) + (S/Zn) + (Zn/Cu).
   "The experiments of Hankel and others give the total E.M.F.
 between the metal M and water, which we denote by M/Aq,
 and which is compounded, according to the foregoing hypo
 thesis, of the E.M.F. excited by the mass action of the water
 {M/Aq), and that excited by reason of its chemical polariza
 tion M/Aq. If therefore we put into water a copper and a
 zinc plate, the total potential difference, or E.M.F. between its
 ends, is Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn. This is the quantity we should
 directly obtain if we connected the Cu and Zn immersed in
 water with the same named plate of a zinc-copper condenser,
 and after breaking the connection determined the charge of
the condenser.

376           Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
    " On our hypothesis,
     Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn = ( Cu/Aq) + (Aq/Zn) + Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn.
 If we close the circuit by connecting the zinc and copper plate
by a copper wire, the force Zn/Cu adds itself to these E.M.F.s,
 and this force removes from the tension series of the metals
the following forces, (Cu/Aq) + (Aq/Zn) ; wherefore we get
           Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn + Zn/Cu = Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn.
 But this last is the part of the total E.M.F. applied to the
formation of the current. Hence to the directlyfound contact-
forces between different metals and water we must add tlie
electromotive excitation of one metal on the other in order to get
the current-forming E.M.F. in the circuit of a closed cell."
    So far as I am able to see to the bottom of the foregoing
 theory its foundation appears to be as follows :—Contact ex
 periments compel us to accept the summation law for the
Volta-effects, or total differences of potential,
                   E = Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn + Zn/Cu.
The chemical theory constrains us to admit that the E.M.F. of
a cell is the equivalent of the chemical action going on, and
thus suggests that it equals the sum of some chemical contact
forces ; or, in Wiedemann's notation, E ought also to equal
                        Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn.
    How are these two requirements to be reconciled ?
   Assume that at every junction there is a total force made
up of two portions—a chemical force, such as Cm / Aq, and
a physical force, which may be denoted by (Cu/Aq), and
write the whole E.M.F. of a cell equal to the sum of all these
chemical and physical junction-forces,
   E= Cu / Aq+ {Cu / Aq) + Aq / Zn + (Aq / Zn) + (Zn /Cm).
   We have then only to make the physical forces obey Volta's
series law; so that
              ( Cm / Aq) + (Aq / Zn) + (Zn/ Cm) = 0j
and we get the required relation
                      E = Cu/Aq + Aq/Zn,
which harmonizes chemical and contact views.
   Prof. Wiedemann's reconciliation of contact and chemical
theories would thus seem to be somewhat of the same order as
the later and less complete one of Fleeming Jenkin, quoted
in my paper, § (i; but I cannot help feeling that the theory

              Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.          377
of Prof. Wiedemann is rather fuller of hypothesis than most
other contributions to the subject with which I am acquainted ;
for it postulates
   1. An unexplained difference of potential between metals in
         contact.
   2. A similar difference of potential between the elements of
         a compound.
   3. An unequal attraction of bodies for + and — E.
   4. An unequal attraction of metals for chemical elements.
   5. A chemical contact-force between metals and liquids,
         depending on No. 4, not obeying Volta's law.
   6. A physical contact-force, depending on No. 3, obeying
          volta's law.
   7. Proportionality of the chemical contact-forces and the
         heats of combination.
   8. A mechanical falling together of atoms accounting for
         heat-production at electrodes; and
    9. That electrical actions go on between the molecules of a
         liquid, and between those molecules and metals im
         mersed in it, according to the ordinary laws of electro
         statics.
   Not all of the above hypotheses, however, are to be regarded
as independent : the dependence of Nos. 5 and 6 is stated, and
it is possible that some of the others are intended to be likewise
dependent, though I do not clearly see how.
    In some of these hypotheses, for instance Nos. 4 and 5,
and, with considerable differences, Nos. 6 and 7, Prof. Wiede
mann's theory bears a resemblance to the views set forth by
the present writer in the paper to which this communication is
a sequel.
    One obvious objection may be taken to the theory on a
 question of fact. According to it, zinc half immersed in water
is negative to copper half immersed in water (see diagram
 above) : but experiment has failed to exhibit anything of the
kind ; and it is well known that Sir W. Thomson, Prof. Clifton,
and others have shown that zinc and copper immersed in water
or dilute acid are electroscopically at the same, or nearly the
same, potential.
             Theory of Von Helmholtz, 1847 and later.
    There is another theory which I did not indeed ignore, but
 which I passed over with very insufficient mention, in the
 paper referred to (see footnote to § 9, Phil. Mag. April, p. 258);
 viz. the theory of Professor von Helmholtz, which he first stated
 in his great memoir of 1847, Die Erhaltung der Kraft, and

 378           Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
 which he has improved and elaborated since (see Faraday
 Lecture of 1881).
    This fascinating theory has a small hypothetical basis, viz.
 Nos. 3 and 9 of the above list; and on this foundation is erected
 an explanation of the Volta effect, a theory of electrolysis, and a
 great part of a theory of chemical combination.
    Once grant, (1) that every substance has a specific attraction
 for positive or for negative electricity which can be exerted
 only through molecular distances, and (2) that the laws of
 electrostatics may be applied to the charges of atoms in a
 liquid ; and the ease with which a multitude of phenomena are
 explained is surprising. I do not feel certain that a little too
 much is not explained ; but we can postpone the consideration
 of possible objections until the theory itself is briefly stated.
    Metals, and " electropositive " elements generally, attract
 positive electricity or positively electrified atoms whenever
these come within range, i. e. within some molecular distance
of the surface. Potassium and zinc attract strongly, copper
and gold feebly. Oxygen, chlorine, and other " electronega
tive elements, attract negative electricity in a similar manner.
    Bring now two metals, say zinc and copper, into contact,
and the superior attracting-power of zinc for positive elec
tricity will at once charge it at the expense of the copper, so
that the zinc touching-surface becomes strongly positive, and
the copper surface strongly negative. Separate the metals,
and they mostly discharge into each other ; but a feeble
charge remains if the surfaces in contact were large, and if
they have been neatly separated ; and this is the Volta effect.
   Moreover since each metal has a definite attracting-power
depending on itself only, Volta's series law is an obvious
necessity.
   If one of the substances had been an insulator much less
loss need take place while separating them, and accordingly
high charges are then found upon them even after separation
(" frictional electricity ").
   Now consider similarly two atoms in contact, forming, say,
a water molecule. The hydrogen will be positively charged,
the oxygen negatively. If some atoms should get knocked
asunder they retain their charges and therefore tend to unite
again, but, while separate, their mutual attractions and repul
sions will preserve a uniformity of distribution throughout the
liquid —e. g. the repulsion of similar charges will prevent a
number of oxygen molecules crowding together ; and if any
cause should remove oxygen atoms from any part of the liquid,
the vacancy will bo instantly supplied by similar atoms repelled
there.

                Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.                379
    The remarkable thing about the charges of atoms is, how
ever, that they are all equal, and even for different atoms are still
the same, or differ only according to simple multiples of some
one absolute quantity; so that one atom may have three times
as much negative electricity as hydrogen has positive, but not
any fractional number. Such an atom may therefore combine
with three of hydrogen atoms, and thus be called a triad.
Another may be a dyad, &c. A given constant charge belongs
to every unit of affinity which the atom possesses ; and thus is
the fact of chemical equivalence stated, though not accounted
for. Faraday's law compels us to believe that atomic charges
are thus multiples of one definite electric quantity, but why
they should be so we are wholly unable to say. It looks as if
electricity were atomic as well as matter ; a sufficiently
startling idea, as Helmholtz says.
    Chemical affinity is thus duo to the electrical attraction of
oppositely charged atoms ; not so much due to the attraction
of the atoms themselves. This latter kind of attraction Helm
holtz would not indeed deny, and he considers it may account
for " molecular " modes of combination ; but he regards it as
much weaker than the electric forces, and as not effecting
definite chemical combination.
    We have ideas now concerning the size of atoms, and can
calculate roughly what an atomic charge is. The charge of
each atom is but small, but the aggregate charge of an appre
ciable number of them is enormous. It can be easily reckoned
that if you take the opposite electricities out of a milligramme
of water and give them to two spheres a mile apart, those
two spheres will attract each other with a force ot ten tons !
Or, again, the electrical attraction of two atoms at any dis
tance exceeds their gravitative attraction 71 thousand billion
times. Upon such charges as these even very feeble external
electrical influence may exert considerable force, and quite
overpower any other kind of chemical affinity.
     Plunge, therefore, two platinum plates into the liquid and
keep them at some slightly different potential, say a volt or
 two : their surfaces are oppositely charged, and even this
 feeble charge may be sufficient to tear asunder the atoms of
molecules which come close up to it*. If it is not sufficient, it
    * It is easy to calculate the surface-density, and the difference of po
tential, on the above hypothesis, needed to tear asunder oppositely charged
atoms attracting each other across molecular distance x. Let it be tr, and
 let the charge of an atom be q ; then
                                 2™? = 5-
                                         x
 Moreover we know that 19,320 electromagnetic units can decompose 18
 grammes of water, which allows 536 x3x ]010 electrostatic units of each

  380             Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
  will at least hold a layer of oppositely charged atoms facing
  toward it across molecular distance ; so that near each plate
  we have an excessively thin condenser of enormous capacity ;
  but in the mass of the liquid is no such strain, the slightest
  E.M.F. being sufficient to redistribute the atoms here and to
  produce perfect equilibrium. If the atoms are torn asunder
  by the electrode and liberated, fresh ones are continually sup
  plied by the rest of the liquid, the state of strain being con
  stantly re-formed and instantly broken down.
      Thus are the phenomena of polarization and electrolysis
  explained.
      Now insert into the liquid a pair of plates of zinc and copper
  in contact. By the contact the zinc has become positive and
  the copper negative, and accordingly the zinc attracts the
  oxygen (or S04 radical) and combines with it : the copper
  attracts the hydrogen, and does the best it can with it.
      This crudely is Helmholtz's view of a voltaic cell.
      There is, however, one important detail not yet mentioned.
  I have spoken as if the work done by an electrode were to tear
  the atom from its combinations. This is not exactly Holm-
  holtz's view. He adduces arguments to show that the work
  required to effect decomposition has for its object, not the
  separation of the atom from the liquid, but the separation of the
  atom from its electric charge. It is to this that it clings, and
  this that has to be taken from it. If it be made to give this up
  kind of electricity per gramme ; so if ns be the number of molecules in a
• gramme of water, the charge of each dyad atom is
                        1-6x10"
                   9= ——3— ; — 1-6X10-" probably.
  Hence                 j.g ^ jq13
  and, the difference of potential between either plate and liquid being given
  by invrer, the whole difference of potential between the electrodes is
          V = 87r.ro- = C-4 X 10" ; £L -0064 electrostatic units probably,
  or 1-92 volt.
     In reckoning the approximate numerical values above, I have assumed
  that 71 = 10* and that nx=l. The resulting decomposition force comes
  out, quite accidentally as far as I am concerned, very near that needed to
  decompose acid-water. But I need hardly point out that order of mag
  nitude is all that is really calculated in these figures ; and that not only
  decimals but even numerals, prefixed to the power of 10, have very little
  meaning. The value of x may perhaps vary somewhat for different sub
  stances ; and as to the value of «, though that is definite enough, it is very
  probable that it ought to ho something more like 2 x 10* than what I have
  above assumed it.
     It is at any rate satisfactory that the electrostatic hypothesis should
  give, as a polarization E.M.F., a number so entirely comparable with
  actual results.

               Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.            381
by a sufficient E.M.F., it is of small or no moment whether
the ion be really set free, or be dissolved, or otherwise kept in
the liquid. But when the electrode is of such a metal that an
ion can combine with it, that ion retains its charge, and
accordingly very little E.M.F. is sufficient to decompose the
liquid under such circumstances.
    Without this statement it might be objected, that when a
piece of zinc is plunged into acidulated water, since it has a
strong attraction for positive electricity, it ought to attract
the positively charged hydrogen atoms up to itself, instead of
oxygen as commonly supposed. I suppose Helmholtz would
 admit that it must do this to begin with, when isolated from
 other metals, on his theory, but that it has no way of sepa
 rating and liberating atoms because it cannot get rid of their
 charges. If it be kept at a sufficiently negative potential
 artificially it can indeed dispose of these charges, and it then
 does attract and liberate hydrogen. But contact with copper
 raises it to a positive potential, and it then attracts negatively
 charged oxygen, rather than hydrogen, and combines with it ;
 while the negatively electrified copper seizes hydrogen atoms,
 tears their charges away from them, and sets them free.
     I must confess, however, that I feel a difficulty here. The
  natural tendency of zinc is, by hypothesis, to attract positive
 and repel negative atoms ; but, while a very feeble positive
 electrification applied to it is sufficient to reverse this tendency,
 a comparatively strong negative electrification is needed to
  enable it to exert that force which by the hypothesis is sup
  posed to be natural to it.
     In considering a Daniell cell, zinc /ZnSO* / CuS04 / copper,
  Helmholtz obtains the energy producing the current, by point
  ing out that electricity is removed from copper, which only
  attracts it feebly, and given to zinc which attracts it strongly.
  Zinc goes into solution and becomes positively charged, while
  an equivalent of equally positive copper comes out ; and since
  this results in a gain of energy, it follows that electricity must
   do more work in going to zinc, than in going to copper.
      But if zinc attracts electricity so much more strongly than
  copper, why is it so easy to drive electricity across a copper/ zinc
  junction ? And why does no energy manifestation result at
   the junction from such an operation ?
      The answer probably is, because of the large charge already
   existing at the junction ; the zinc has pulled as much positive
   electricity out of the copper as it wants, and there exists at
   the contact an electrical double layer, whose existence makes
   it quite easy for extraneous electricity to flow either way
   across the junction.
      But, then, if zinc pulls so much electricity out of a piece of

 382           Prof. Oliver Lodge on the Seat of the
 copper with which it is put into contact, where does it all
 come from ? And why does it not leave the copper strongly
 negative instead of only feebly so, as evidenced by Sir W.
 Thomson's electrified-needle form of experiment? Why, again,
 does this method of observing the Volta-effect, with the plates
 permanently in contact, agree so well with the old method of
 observing it by separation of the plates, if a great but uncer
 tain part of the charge leak back as soon as separation beyond
 molecular distance is attempted ?
    These and similar difficulties occur to me in connection with
 this most interesting theory ; and I state them, not with any
 idea that they are final and unanswerable, but because it is
 always serviceable to point out the apparent defects of a theory
 as well as its merits.
    It will be seen that, whereas Helmholtz's theory starts with
 a hypothetical differential attraction of matter for electricity,
 and explains the chemical attraction of matter for matter on
 the strength of it, my view starts with a differential chemical
 attraction of matter for matter (i. e. zinc attracting oxygen
 more than copper attracts it), and on this basis works out the
 theory of the voltaic cell and of the Volta-effect.
    In electrolysis proper both views may be at one, because
 here we are concerned with electrical attractions only ; but
 Prof. Helmholtz's has the advantage, because it explains the
 fact of atomic charges, which mine has to assume. My view
 of electrolysis has hitherto been much less electrostatic than
 Prof. Helmholtz's, but also it has been much more vague. A
 great deal is to be said for the assumption of ordinary electro
 static attraction over molecular distances, and by adopting
such more definite ideas I am in hopes of improving my theory
 further. And though, after all, none of these views can be
 really absolute, because they begin and end with action at a
 distance, still electrostatic attraction is a fact, and we know
that it can be accounted for by a strain in a continuous
medium. Hence phenomena reduced to electrostatics maybe
held to be provisionally "explained."
    But beyond electrostatic attraction some other primary
 force is necessary ; either chemical affinity, the attraction of
atom for atom, or electrical affinity, so to speak, the attraction
of atoms for electricity.
    Chemical affinity is a fact, however it be accounted for ;
but, to enable it to explain everything, the fact of atomic
charge must be permitted to likewise go without explanation.
These are the necessary data for my view.
   " Electrical affinity " is not known to be a fact ; but if it be
granted, everything is explained (barring a few outstanding
difficulties), even the fact of atomic charge itself, though not

              Electromotive Forces in a Voltaic Cell.          383
its numerical exactitude. This is the datum required for
Helmholtz's theory.
    It may thus be said that while the writer's view rests on
two admitted facts which it does not attempt to explain, but,
assuming them, explains other things from them ; Helniholtz's
theory rests on one unverified hypothesis, which, being granted,
everything else follows ; except indeed the numerical equality
of atomic charges, which has to be regarded as experimentally
demonstrated in both theories.
    According to my view, the zinc of a cell pulls up the nega
tively charged oxygen atoms (or SO* radicals, whatever the
real ions may be) to itself, not because they are electrified, but
because they are oxygen. The electrical current produced
is a secondary result caused by the chemical action.
    According to Helmholtz, the zinc pulls the oxygen atoms
because it is itself electrified by contact with copper, and
because they are oppositely electrified by contact with hy
drogen. The chemical action resulting is a secondary result
 caused by the electric forces.
    Helmholtz's is thus a true " contact theory," and is in many
respects like Sir W. Thomson's. Sir William postulates an
attraction of zinc for copper, and from this explains the Volta-
effect and the production of a current. I am unable to picture
 to myself exactly hoiv the attraction of zinc for copper results
in a difference of potential when they are put into contact ;
 but undoubtedly such a force, if granted, would put a supply
 of energy at disposal which could account for the Volta-effect.
 And a difference of potential thus set up may result in an
 electrical decomposition of water and maintenance of current,
just as in Helmholtz's theory.
     I must confess that I am unable to feel quite comfortable
 about energy considerations with either of these theories of
 the voltaic cell ; because it seems as if the metallic junction
 were, after all, driving the current, whatever be said about
 chemical energy. But in this I must certainly be wrong ;
 that is to say, there must be some thorough way of reconciling
 these, by such men advocated, views with energy considerations,
 though I am unable satisfactorily to perceive it.
     Both these contact-theories, in explaining the Volta-effect,
 ignore the existence of the oxidizing medium surrounding the
 metals. My view explains the whole effect as a result of this
 oxygen bath, and of the chemical strain by it set up. The
  other theory which likewise took account of the atmosphere
 is the old chemical one ; but this leaves the aspect of the
 matter exceedingly vague. The strictures applied to it by
  Prof. Helmholtz (Faraday Lecture, 1881) are well deserved:—
      " The so-called chemical theory of Volta's fundamental

384          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
experiment was rather indefinite ; it scarcely did more than
tell us—here is the possibility of a chemical process, here
electricity can be produced. But which kind, how much, to
what potential, remained indefinite. I have not found in all
the papers which have been written for the defence of the
chemical theory a clear explanation why zinc opposed to cop
per in liquids, where zinc really is oxidized and dissolved,
becomes negative, and why in air and other gases it becomes
positive, if the same cause (viz. oxidation) is at work."
   To the chemical strain theory, held by me, none of this
remark is in the least applicable. This theory does not say
that zinc opposed to copper in a liquid is negative. It says
that, changing the surrounding medium from air to acid-water,
makes scarcely any difference ; and that accordingly connect
ing zinc and copper by a drop of water leaves them with the
same respective potentials as they had before. The strain of
oxygen-atoms towards a metal exists whether in air or water,
but it can produce no effect in either case until at some point
the oxygen be swept away by contact with another metal.
Then instantly the chemical forces are able to do work, and to
produce, if in air or other dielectric, the Volte-effect ; if in acid
or other electrolyte, the voltaic current. The metallic con
tact equalizes the potential of the two metals in the one case;
in the other it perpetually fails to equalize their potential.
The equalization of an otherwise disturbed potential is its only
effect.
   And no indefiniteness exists as to either the kind or amount
of the Volte-effect as so produced, for I have shown fully that
o Volte-effect can be calculated in absolute measure for any
pair of clean metals immersed in any medium, from purely
thermo-chemical date ; but whether this effect is the real one
or not is at present a matter of opinion.
   These so-calculated effects undoubtedly agree in some cases
with experimentally observed ones ; but whether they all so
agree, and, if not, the extent to which they are erroneous, are
matters mainly for future experiment to decide; and upon
such agreement or disagreement between calculation and
experiment my theory definitely stands or falls.
        XLVI. Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
        ON A DIFFERENTIAL RESISTANCE THERMOMETER.
                      BY T. C. MENDENHALL.
'T'HE determination or registration of the temperature at a distent
      or not easily accessible point is so extremely desirable that
many methods for accomplishing this end have been proposed, and

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               385
to some extent made use of during the past fifty years. Naturally
enough electricity has been utilized in some way or other in the
majority of these systems of telethermometry.
    The requirements of the problem seem to be that the device or
instrument used at the point, the temperature of which is to be
ascertained, shall be of the greatest possible simplicity of construc
tion, involving little or no motion in its parts, so that the liability
to " get out of order " shall be reduced to the minimum ; and that
at the observing or registering station, the necessary appliances
shall possess a maximum of durability and simplicity—so that a
minimum of time and skill will be demanded in making the obser
vations. The whole system must be certain in its indications
and correct within a reasonable limit.
    The first of these conditions is apparently sufficiently well satisfied
by the thermo-electric-junction, which has probably been more ex
tensively made use of than any other form of electric thermometer.
It renders necessary, however, the use of a comparatively delicate
galvanometer, and as the electromotive force of a single couple is
small (it is difficult to use more than one in general practice) the
results are subject to considerable errors arising from unknown or
neglected sources of electromotive force. This source of error
becomes more important as the range of temperature measured
becomes smaller, although it may be almost entirely avoided by
care and skill on the part of the operator. The well-known
resistance method of Siemens satisfies the same condition very per
fectly, and is certainly capable of giving good results when skilfully
applied, at least throughout moderate ranges.
    The desire to possess some form of electric thermometer which
might be utilized in the study of certain problems connected with
meteorology, especially the observation of soil and earth tempera
ture, and the use of which would not demand greater skill than
that of the ordinary meteorological observer, led to the device and
construction of the instrument to be described, which may be called
 a " differential resistance thermometer." It consists essentially of
a mercurial thermometer, not unlike ordinary forms, except that
the bulb is greatly enlarged so that the stem may have a diameter
 of something like a millimetre, and still leave the scale tolerably
 " open." In one of the instruments already made 1° G. corresponds
 to about 5 millim. of the scale. Sunning down through the stem
 is a fine platinum wire about "08 millim. in diameter. The lower
 end may be secured in the bulb so that it is kept straight in the
 bore of the stem, and at the lower end a heavier wire is sealed in
 the glass, so that metallic contact can be made with this wire both
 at the upper end and through the mercury at the lower. It is
 evident that the resistance between these two points will depend
 largely (but not entirely) on the length of the platinum wire which
 is above the mercury in the tube, and this will depend on the
 temperature to which it is exposed. When this temperature rises
 the resistance is decreased by an amount equal to the difference
 between that of the platinum wire which disappears and that of

This equation is not quite rigorous, but the approximation is very
close. It is of the form
                            B,t=B0-Bt-Ct>                            (2)
    The simplest and best way of dealing with it is to determine the
 constants of the equation (2) by a series of observations making
 use of the method of least squares. From the result the resistance
for any degree of temperature may be calculated, or, better, a curve
 can be constructed from w hich the temperature corresponding to
 any resistance can easily be read.
    The advantage of this method over the use of a simple resistance
 coil is that (he change in resistance accompanying a given change
 in temperature is much greater, and in fact it may be made as
 great as one desires. As a result the telephone may be substituted
 for the galvanometer in the resistance measurements, thus greatly
 simplifying the apparatus as well as increasing the rapidity with
 which observations may be made ; or, if preferred, a much less
 sensitive galvanometer may be used. It also possesses the very
 great advantage of allowing an increase of delicacy as the range of
 temperature decreases. For earth temperatures this is very de
 sirable, and it will easily be seen that thermometers of this kind
 can be constructed for a few degrees of range with which, by com
 paratively rude processes, the measurements may be correct within
  a very small fraction of a degree. For use in earth temperature
 measurements the thermometer will be enclosed in a strong brass
  tube for protection, and the connection with the point of observa
  tion made by means of a cable of heavy copper wire. The cable
  will of course form a part of E0 in equation (2) ; but as it is a con
 stant, the substitution of one cable for another, if necessary, will
  affect the position and not the form of the calibration curve. Its
  resistance must be small, relatively, and the influence of tempera
 ture upon it may be neglect ed.
     With this device a temperature observation may be taken in less
 than a minute, no time being consumed in the preparation of liquids
 of known temperature at the observing station, as in the use of the
  thermo-junction or the resistance coil.—Silliman's American
  Journal, August 1885.

  ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF INTERNAL
                   FRICTION. BY WALTER KONIO.
    The author determined the coefficients of a number of liquids by
the method of vibrating disks, and also by that of flow from capillary
tubes, and obtained numbers which agree with those obtained by
other inquirers.
    He also examined whether electrification and exposure in a
magnetic field had any influence on this coefficient, and obtained a
negative result.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 8, 1885.
      NOTE ON THE TRANSMISSION OF LIGHT BY WIRE-GAUZE
                    SCREENS. BY S. P. LANGLEY.
    In the beginning of the present year a friend sent me a series of
wire-gauze screens, which he used to diminish the apparent bright
ness of stars in making meridian observations, with a request that
I would determine photometrically the amount of light transmitted
by them. As such screens are occasionally employed in astronomical
work, particularly in the use of t he heliometer, I have thought the fol
lowing account of our experience of sufficient interest to make public.
    1 used for the measurements a photometer-box originally con
structed for another purpose, and an opaque wheel or disk having
radial slits of variable width, which, placed in the path of a ray of
light and rotated with sufficient velocity, can be made to reduce the
light to any desired fraction of its original intensity. (This I have
employed for some years for photometric measurements when it is
desirable to avoid the use of polarizing-apparatus.) In the centre
of the photometer-box was a sliding Bunsen disk, which could be
 viewed from above by a suitable arrangement of mirrors. The
 open ends of the box were"directed to two opposite windows, and the
 disk placed in such a position that its sides were equally illuminated.
 The wire screen was then placed over one end of the box, the wheel-
 photometer in front of the other end, and the apertures of the
 latter altered until the equality of illumination of the Bunsen disk
 was restored. The screen then cut off the same amount of light as
 the wheel. From several series of measurements made in this way,
 it was found that
 1 screen transmitted                  *395 -j- "004 of the incident light.
 2 screens superposed transmitted "144 + -004             „       „
 3         „        „       „          -052 ±-003         „       „
     These numbers, as was to be expected, are nearly in geometrical
 progression. The screens were returned to the sender and the
 results communicated to him ; but he wrote that, upon trial, he
 found the reduction of light very much greater than the above
 values, three superposed screens reducing the light of a star by 7'1
 magnitudes, which corresponds to a transmission of only -0014.
     I was at that time absent, and my assistant, Mr. J. E. Keeler,
 undertook the investigation of the cause of the discrepancy, which
 he attributed to loss of light by diffraction under the circumstances
 in which the screens were used by their owner, i. e. in front of the
 object-glass of a telescope directed upon a star. With diffuse

388           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
light, such as was used in the measurements with the photometer-
 box, no loss due to this cause was possible.
   In the apparatus devised by Mr. Keeler for an experimental
 determination of the loss by diffraction, the star was replaced by an
illuminated pinhole in the focus of a 3-inch collimating-telescope.
This was viewed by an observing-telescope of nearly equal size, in
the eye-tube of which was an unsilvered plane-glass mirror, which
reflected into the eye-piece a comparison star—the image of an
illuminated pinhole produced by a collimating-telescope at right
angles to the other two. In the path of the rays from this tele
scope could be interposed the wheel-photometer. The light before
entering the first pinhole suffered reflection from an unsilvered
glass surface, in order to reduce its intensity to that of the com
parison star.
   The two images in the field of view having been adjusted to
equality, the wire-gauze screen was interposed between the object-
glasses of the collimating- and observing-telescopes, reducing the
light of the star and producing around it the well-known diffraction-
image of a network. The wheel-photometer was then introduced,
and the intensity of the comparison star reduced until it was equal
to the central image of the other. By enlarging the pinholes until
the superposition of the colours produced white light, the intensity
of the diffraction-images could also be estimated.
   It was thus found that the central image had only -175 of its
original brightness, which would therefore be the proportion trans
mitted by the screen under these conditions, and that the brightness
of each of the four first spectra was -05 of that originally possessed
 by the central image. Two thicknesses of the wire-gauze transmitted
 barely -02, as measured by the intensity of the central image.
   The screens with which these experiments were made were much
 coarser than the original ones, and it was expected that the effect
of diffraction would be less pronounced. The transmission of one
thickness, measured by the photometer-box, was -47; of two
thicknesses, -21.
   Finally, the apertures of the screen and the diameter of the wire
were measured by a micrometer-microscope and the apertures found
to occupy -465 of the total area of the screen.
   It was concluded, therefore, as the result of the experiments :—
   1. That the transmission, as measured by the photometer-box,
was equal to the ratio of the sum of the areas of the apertures of
the screen to its total area, and therefore could be considered to be
the true transmission of the screen ; and
   2. That the much smaller transmission of the screen, when used
in front of the object-glass of a telescope to diminish the apparent
brightness of a star, is satisfactorily accounted for by the loss of
light caused by diffraction under these circumstances.
   3. That screens used for this purpose should have their constants
determined by special experiments of the nature of those just de
tailed, and that their photometric use should then be limited to the
reduction of the light of bodies possessing a small angular magnitude.

XLVII. The Luminiferous jEther. By De Volson Wood,
    C.E., M.A., Professor of Mechanical Engineering in Stevens
   Institute of Technology, Hoboken, N.J*
rpWO properties of the luminiferous aether appear to be
JL known and measurable with a high degree of accuracy.
One is its ability to transmit light at the rate of 1 86,300 miles
per second t, and the other its ability to transmit from the
sun to the earth a definite amount of heat-energy.
   In regard to the latter, Herschel found, from a series of
experiments, that the direct heat of the sun, received on a
body at the earth capable of absorbing and retaining it, is
competent to melt an inch in thickness of ice every two hours
and thirteen minutest. This is equivalent to nearly 71 foot
pounds of energy per second.
    In 1838 M. Pouillet found that the heat-energy transmitted
from the sun to the earth would, if none were absorbed by
our atmosphere, raise 1 "76 gramme of water 1° C. in one
minute on each square centimetre of the earth normally
exposed to the rays of the sun§.
    This is equivalent to 83*5 foot-pounds of energy per second,
   * Communicated by the Author.
   t Professor Michelson found the velocity of light to be 289,740 metres
per second in air, and 209,828 metres in a vacuum, giving an index of
refraction of 1,000,265. Journ. of Arts and Science, 1879, vol. rviii.

and is the value used by Sir William Thomson in determining
the probable density of the aether*. Later determinations of
the value of the solar constant by MM. Soret, Crova, and
Violle have made it as high as 2-2 to 2*5 calories. But the
most recent, as well as the most reliable, determination is by
Professor S. P. Langley, who brought to his service the most
refined apparatus yet used for this purpose, and secured his
data under favourable conditions; from which the value is
found to be 2-8 + calories! with some uncertainty still re
maining in regard to the first figure of the decimal. We will
consider it as exactly 2-8 in this analysis, according to which,
there being 7000 grains in a pound and 15"432 grains in a
gramme, we have for the equivalent energy
        2^x15^432 x 9 x 772 x 144 =
            7000          5 0-155 xbO                    1
per second for each square foot of surface normally exposed
to the sun's rays, which value we will use. Beyond these
facts, no progress can be made without an assumption. Com
putations have been made of the density, and also of the
elasticity, of the aether founded on the most arbitrary, and in
some cases the most extravagant, hypotheses. Thus, Herschel
estimated the stress (elasticity) to exceed
    17 x 10»= (17,000,000,000) pounds per square inchj;
and this high authority has doubtless caused it to be widely
accepted as approximately correct. But his analysis was
founded upon the assumption that the density of the aether
was the same as that of air at sea-level, which is not only
arbitrary, but so contrary to what we should expect from
its non-resisting qualities, as to leave his conclusion of no
value. That author also erred in assuming that the tensions
of gases were as the wave-velocities in each, instead of the
mean square of the velocity of the molecules of a self-agitated
gas; but this is unimportant, as it happens to be a matter of
quality rather than of quantity. Herschel adds, " Consi
dered according to any hypothesis, it is impossible to escape
the conclusion that the aether is under great stress." We
hope to show that this conclusion is not warranted ; that a
great stress necessitates a groat density; but that both may
be exceedingly small. A great density of the ajther not only
presents great physical difficulties, but, as we hope to show,

is inconsistent with the uniform elasticity and density of the
aether which it is believed to possess; and every consideration
would lead one to accept the lowest density consistent with
those qualities which would enable it to perform functions
producing known results.
   In a work on the ' Physics of iEther/ by S. Tolver Preston,
it is estimated that the probable inferior limit of the tension
of the aether is 500 tons per square inch, a very small value
compared with that of Herschel's. But the hypothesis
upon which this author founded his analysis was—Tho tension
of the aether exceeds the force necessary to separate the atoms
of oxygen and hydrogen in a molecule of water ; as if the
atoms were forced together by the pressure of the aether, as
two Magdeburg hemispheres are forced together by the external
air when there is a vacuum between them. This assumption
is also gratuitous, and is rejected for want of a rational
foundation.
   Young remarks:—" The luminiferous aether pervading all
space is not only highly elastic, but absolutely solid."* We
are not certain in what sense this author considered it as solid ;
but if it be in the sense that the particles retain their relative
positions, and do not perform excursions as they do in liquids,
it is a mere hypothesis, which may or may not have a real
existence. If it bo in the sense that the particles suffer less
resistance to a transverse than to a longitudinal movement,
there are some grounds for the statement, as shown in
circularly-polarized light. Bars of solids are more easily
twisted than elongated, and generally the shearing-resistance
is less than for a direct stress. It certainly cannot be claimed
that the compressibility of the aether (in case we could capture
a quantity of it) is less than that of solids.
    Sir William Thomson, in making a probable estimate of the
density of the aether, made a more plausible hypothesis, by
assuming that " the maximum displacement of the molecules
of the aether in the transmission of heat-energy was j-0 of a
wave-length of light, the average of which may be taken as
      of an inch." Hence the displacement was assumed to
be 250^000 °f an incn5 by means of which he found the weight
of a cubic foot to be § x 10-20 of a poundf. We also notice
that one Belli estimated the density of the aether to be ^ x 10-18
of a poundj; but M. Herwitz, assuming this value to be too
small and Thomson's as too large, arbitrarily assumed it as

 small account unless checked by actual results.
    We propose to treat the aether as if it conformed to the
 Kinetic Theory of Gases, and determine its several properties
 on the conditions that it shall transmit a wave with the velo
 city of 186,300 miles per second, and also transmit 133 foot
 pounds of energy per second per square foot. This is equivalent
 to considering it as gaseous in its nature, and at once compels
 us to consider it as molecular; and, indeed, it is difficult to
 conceive of a medium transmitting light and energy without
 being molecular. The Electromagnetic Theory of Light sug
 gested by Maxwell, as well as the views of Newton, Thomson,
 Herschel, Preston, and others, are all in keeping with the
 molecular hypothesis. If the properties which we find by
 this analysis are not those of the aether, we shall at least
 have determined the properties of a substance which might
 be substituted for the aether, and secure the two results
 already named. It may be asked, Can the Kinetic theory,
 which is applicable to gases in which waves are propagated
 by a to-and-fro motion of the particles, be applicable to a
 medium in which the particles have a transverse move
 ment, whether rectilinear, circular, elliptical, or irregular?
 In favour of such an application, it may be stated that
 the general formulae of analysis by which wave-motion in
 general, and refraction, reflection, and polarization in parti
 cular, are discussed, are fundamentally the same ; and in the
 establishment of the equations tho only hypothesis in regard
 to tho path of a particle is—It will move along the path of
 least resistance. The expression V2oCe-r-8 is generally true
 for all elastic media, regardless of the path of the individual
 molecules. Indeed, granting the molecular constitution of
 the aether, is it not probable that the Kinetic theory applies
 more rigidly to the aether than to the most perfect of the
 known gases ?*

 This valne, which is nearly constant for the more perfect
 gases, we propose to call the modulus of the gas, and represent
 it by fi; and for the purposes of this paper we will use
                                   /i = 6-6.
     This relation of the product xy being a constant, has, so far
 as we are informed, been overlooked by physicists, and is
 worthy of special notice, since it determines the value of one
 of the factors when the other has been found. Kronig,
 Clausiusf, and Maxwell give for x the constant number 3,
 but variable values for y %.
     We are confident that the value of x is not strictly constant;
 or if it is, it exceeds 3, since tho effect of the viscosity of a
  gas would necessitate a larger velocity to produce a given
 tension than if it were perfectly free from internal friction.
  For our purpose it will be unnecessary to find the separate
 values of x and y; but if we have occasion to use the former
 in making general illustrations, we will call it 3, as others
 have done heretofore. If the correct value of x exceeds 3, it
  will follow that tho velocity of the molecules exceeds the values
 heretofore computed §. According to Thomson, Stokes showed

sun is practically the same as at the earth.
   Now, starting at the sun with this result, and finding the
density at a distance z from it, then making z infinite, we shall
get the 995,000th root of e, the value of which is also sensibly
equal to unity; hence the density at infinity would be sensibly
the same as at the surface of the sun, the difference in the
densities at the sun and at infinity being less than fo^^ part

 no such known body, therefore the density and tension of the

foot of the column about 100^oou of its length, and would cause
a corresponding increase in the density, the value of which,
after this compression, will be found by multiplying the value
given in equation (9) by ^$^6, which will leave the result
sensibly the same as before. Hence, from this standpoint, we

  again conclude that the density of the aether may be con
  sidered as sensibly uniform throughout space, providing its
  temperature be essentially uniform.
     If we assume that the law of the resistance by which the
  aether opposes the motion of a body varies as the square of the
  velocity of the body, we are still unable to assign the coeffi
  cient which will give the numerical value ; but it is safe to
  assume that the entire mass of the aether occupying the path
  of a body moving through it, will not have a velocity imparted
  to it exceeding that of the body ; but to be on the safe side,
  we will assume that it imparts a velocity equal to itself. The
 energy thus imparted will be lost to the body. To simplify
 the case, consider a planet moving in a circular orbit : r the
 radius of the planet, d its distance from the sun, D its specific
 gravity compared with water as unity, Vj the velocity in its
 orbit; then the mass of aether occupying the place of the
 planet during one revolution about the sun will be, using

at this rate would require more than 1,666,000 trillion
(1,666,000,000,000,000,000,000) years to bring it to rest.
    Equation (18) is not applicable to the resistance offered to
a comet, on account of the elongated orbit of the latter ; but
some idea of the effect of the resistance of the aether to the
movement of a comet may be found by considering what

it would be if the orbit were circular, having for its radius
the perihelion distance. According to Professor Morrison,
the perihelion distance of the great comet (6), 1882*, was
716,200 miles, its aphelion distance will be 5,000,000,000
miles, the diameter of its nucleus shortly before disappearing
on the solar disc was 7 600 miles, the velocity at perihelion
295 miles per second and at aphelion 75 feet per second.
But little is known in regard to the density of comets ; but
to be on the safe side we will assume it as ^ that of water.
 This data will reduce (18) to 13xl0"18 for the fraction of
 energy lost during one of its revolutions about the sun ; and
 as it would make a revolution in, say, 20 hours, it would lose
 in one of our years about 57 x 10~ie of its energy, at which
 rate it would go on for 170 trillions of years. Similarly, at
its aphelion its rate of loss would be less than \ x 10-15 of its
 energy in more than 2000 years—the time of one revolution
 in its orbit.
     The most careful observations and calculations have failed
 to detect any effect due to the resistance of matter in space ;
 and the above analysis shows that, within historic times, it has
 in any case scarcely amounted to an infinitesimal, certainly
 not sufficient to be measured. And when we consider that
 our assumptions have been very largely on the unfavourable
  side, and, further, that the energy imparted to the aether may,
 partly at least, be restored to the body, we assume that its
  resistance never can be measured. Laplace, when he found
  that the force of gravitation, if propagated by an elastic
  medium, must have a velocity exceeding 100 million times
  that of light, concluded that astronomers might continue
  to consider its action as instantaneous [Micanique Cdleste,
  B. x. ch. viii. p. 22, 9035) ; so may we, w ith as much con
  fidence, continue to consider the resistance of the aether as nil.
     Equation (6) gives
  from which the specific heat of the aether may be found if its
  temperature were known. M. Fourier, the first to assign a
  value to the temperature of space, assumed it to be somewhat
  inferior to the temperature at the poles of the earth, or about
   50° C. to 60° C. below zerof. M. Pouillet, considering the

 atmosphere as a diathermanous medium, capable of absorbing
 in different degrees the radiant heat from the sun and the
 dark heat from the earth, deduced for the heat of space—or,
 as he and Fourier called it, the stellar heat—approximately
  -142° C* (-287° F.), which is about 174° F. above absolute
 zero. It is well known that Pouillet's data were imperfect,
 several important elements being neglected, notably that of
 the humidity of the air ; still it is not only the first, but, so
 far as we know, the only attempt to formulate this relation.
 It served to show, what has since been indicated by more
 direct experiments, that the temperature of space is very low.
 The delicate experiments of Professor Langley, before referred
 to, show a great difference in the degree of absorption by our
 atmosphere of different wave-lengths. The mean of the
 values for nine different wave-lengths, treated by M. Pouillet's
 formula, gives 139° F. above absolute zero, and the smallest
 value of absorption, which was for the infra-red, gives only
 71° F. above absolute zero for the heat of space.
    The heat of space may bo considered as composed of three
 parts:— (1) stellar heat, (2) the heat contained in the dark
 matter of space, (3) the essential heat of the aether.
    1. By the stellar heat we mean the heat received directly
 from the stars. It is a matter of easy calculation that, if the
 50,000,000 of stars supposed to be visible with the most
powerful telescopes were all at the distance of the nearest
fixed star (a Centauri), or 221,000 astronomical units from
the earth, and if each radiated the same amount of heat as our
sun,the intensity varying as the inverse squares of the distances,
the earth would receive from them all less than                as much
heat as it now receives from the sun. And when we consider
that only a very few stars are within measurable distances,
and that the remote ones may be, when compared with these,
well-nigh infinitely distant, it is evident that the amount of
heat received from the stars is insignificant and may be
discarded at the earth.
    2. It is certain that there is a large amount of dark matter in
space, since the meteoric dust and meteorites must come from

 beyond our atmosphere. The zodiacal light is supposed to be
 an evidence of meteoric matter between the earth and sun.
 The tails of comets are visible by some action of light upon
 some kind of matter. Matter in space not exposed to the rays
 of the sun will be at about the same temperature as the aether;
 but if in the rays of the sun and destitute of an atmosphere at
 the distance of the earth from the sun, its temperature would
 be very low. If present laws can be extended so far, and the
 earth were without an atmosphere, and the heat received
 were not conducted away, it has been computed that the mean
^temperatureatthe equator would be about — 70° C. ( — 94° F.);
 and at the poles —221° 0. *, or 114° F. above absolute zero.
 The last result is obtained on the supposition that the poles
 receive heat directly from the sun a part of the year ; it is
 further shown that if the poles were never exposed to the rays
 of the sun, the temperature would fall to that of the aether of
 space. But the data is not uniform, and there is too large an
 extension of empirical formulas to satisfy one that the above
 numerical results are reliable ; still they point more and more
 strongly to a temperature not many degrees above absolute
 zero.
    3. By the essential heat of the aether we mean the tempe
 rature which would be indicated by a thermometer graduated
 from absolute zero in a room located in space beyond our
 atmosphere whose walls were impervious to the passage of
 external heat. It is the heat due to the self-agitated aether,
 just as air has a temperature when not exposed to the rays of
 the sun. If the aether be perfectly diathermanous to the sun's
 rays, it will receive no heat on account of the heat of the sun
 flowing through it, though it may be heated from other
 sources. As direct evidence of an extremely low tempera
 ture of space, we cite the facts in regard to the meteorite which
 fell at Dharmsalla, India, July 14, 1860 \. " The most re
 markable thing about it was, while the mass had been inflamed
 and melted at the surface, the fragments gathered immediately
 after the fall and held for an instant were so cold that the fin
 gers were chilled. This extraordinary assertion, which is con
 tained in the report with no expression of doubt, indicates
 that the mass of the meteorite retained in its interior the
 intense cold of the interplanetary space, while the surface was
 ignited in passing through the terrestrial atmosphere." Since
 this body had been exposed to the rays of the sun, its tempe
 rature must have exceeded that of the space through which it

passed, as well as boen warmed by the heat developed at its
surface, from which it may be inferred that it had been intensely
cold. Direct investigations, given above, indicate that this
temperature is less than 200° F. above absolute zero ; and we
cannot assert that it is not less than 100° F. above, or even
much less.
    But, however low be the temperature of the aether, it can
not bo absolutely cold, or, in other words, it must have a tem
perature above absolute zero, for otherwise it would be desti
tute of elasticity, and hence incapable of transmitting a wave.
This is shown by eliminating V between equations (2) and (6),
giving
                                                                      (21)
in which if t=0, e will be zero, all the other factors being
finite, and if e = 0, then V = 0 in (2). Indeed, this principle
is so well recognized in physics, that a proof in this place
seems superfluous. Being unable, in the present stato of our
knowledge, to do more than assign the probable superior limit
of the temperature, we will, for the purposes of this analysis,
assume t=20° F., absolute, being confident that the actual
value is between ^0 of and 10 times this value. This value in
equation (20) gives
                   c=46 xl0u= 4,600,000,000,000 . . . (22)
for the specific heat of the aether, that of water being unity.
This number so vastly—we might say infinitely—exceeds that
for any known gas, as to justify one, at first thought, in looking
with suspicion upon the applicability of the above analysis to
this medium. Assumptions in regard to the absolute tempe
rature will scarcely improve the appearance of this number.
If it be assumed that the absolute temperature be only one
degree, the number in equation (22) would be only twenty
times as large ; and if the absolute temperature be assumed at
 1,000,000° F., the resulting specific heat would still be more
than a million times as large as for hydrogen. A few consi
 derations of other properties of the aether may aid one in being
 reconciled to this paradoxical result. Is the result any more
incredible than the fact, everywhere admitted, that every par
ticle of the aether, in transmitting a wave of light, continually
    * We note that this equation shows that the specific heat for different
gases under the same tension, e, and temperature, t; varies inversely as
the density ; and for the same temperature and density the specific heats
 e will be directly as the tension e. The more perfect gases, as hydrogen,
oxygen, and air, conform nearly to this law.

makes 590,000,000,000,000 (6 x 10u nearly) complete cycles
of movements every second, for a wave-length of              of an
inch ? The number of such complete movements in air for
the fundamental c is only 264 ; and hence the ratio of the
former to the latter of these numbers is nearly 2 x 10ia. The
ratio of the specific heat given in (22) to that of hydrogen
is nearly lJxlO12, which is not so different from that just
given for the ratio of cyclical movements in a second of the
aether and air. The velocity of sound in air at 493° F. above
absolute zero is about 1090 feet per second ; but if the tem
perature could bo reduced to 20 F., absolute, the law being
extended so far, the velocity would be only
                   V=109A/^=217feet;
but the velocity of light is 982,000,000 feet per second, a
number about 4£ million times the former, and near a
million of times that of the velocity in air under ordinary
conditions. The ratio of the mass of air in a cubic foot at sea-
level to that of a cubic foot of the aether as computed, far ex
ceeds any of these ratios. The fact is, the known qualities of
the aether in transmitting light and heat so far transcend
those of any known terrestrial substance, that we might anti
cipate the fact that, in regard to magnitude, all its properties
will be extremely exceptional when compared with such sub
stances. We must accept substantially the number in equation
 (22), or subject this medium to different laws than those of
    We may deduce this result by another process ; thus, since
 the specific heats of different gases are as the squares of the
 wave- velocities in the respective substances, the other elements
 being the same, if the specific heat of air be 0-23, we should
 have for the specific heat of ihe aether
              C=0-23(1^^280)2=46xl0",
 as before. The correct value of the specific heat of air, 0-2375,
 would give over 47 x 10u, and nearly 48 x 10U ; but these
 differences are quite immaterial in this connection, the object
 being to check the former result, and find chiefly qualitative
 values.
    On the other hand, in order that common air might be able
 to transmit a wave of the known velocity of light, its specific
 heat being taken constantly at 0*23, its temperature would be,

    If the sun were composed of a substance having such spe
cific heat, it could radiate heat at its present rate for more
than a hundred millions of centuries without its temperature
being reduced 1° F., exclusive of any supply from external
sources, or from a contraction of its volume. We know only-
such substances in the sun as we are able to experiment with
in the laboratory; and if there be an exceptional substance in
it, we have no means at present of determining its physical
properties. It is, moreover, a question whether the aether
constitutes an essential part of bodies. We conceive of it
only as the great agent for transmitting light and heat through
out the universe.
    On account of the enormous value of the specific heat, it
will require an inconceivably large amount of heat (mechani
cally measured) to increase the temperature of one pound of
it perceptibly. Thus, if heat from the sun, by passing
through a pound of water at the earth, would raise the tem
perature 100° F. and maintain it at, say, 600° F., absolute,
it would, under similar conditions, raise the temperature of
one pound of the aether, if its power of absorption be the same
as that of water, ^ooo^^ of a degree*.
   The distance of the earth from the sun being 210 times
the radius of the latter, the amount of heat passing a square
foot of spherical surface at the sun will bo about 45,000 times
the heat received on a square foot at the earth normally ex
posed to its rays, so that, under the conditions imposed, the
temperature would not be a billionth of a degree F. higher at
the sun than at the earth. This, then, is a condition favour
able to a sensibly uniform temperature even if heated by the
sun's rays. We are now inclined to admit that the aether is
not perfectly diathermanous to the sun's rays, but that its
temperature, however small, may be duo directly to the
absorption of the heat of central suns ; for we begin to
realize the fact that the aether may possess many of the
qualities of gases, such as a molecular constitution, and
hence also mass, elasticity, specific heat, compressibility,
and expansibility, although the magnitude of these pro
perties is anomalous. We have already considered its

occupied by a pound of the respective substances.

compressibility at the surface of the son, due to the weight of
an infinite column, and found it to be exceedingly small ; now
it may be possible that the expansion due to the excess of tem
perature of a small fraction of one degree at the surface of the
sun over that at remote distances will diminish the density
as much, or about as much, as pressure increased it, thereby
making the density even more exactly uniform than it other
wise would be. According to what we know of refraction, it
is impossible for a ray of light to be refracted in passing
through the a;ther only,—at least, not by a measurable
amount ; for not only are the density and elasticity practically
uniform, but their ratio is, if possible, even more constant as
shown by equations (16) and (16')- But the freedom of the
aether-molecules may be constrained, or their velocity impeded,
by their entanglement with gross matter, such as the gases
and transparent solids ; in which case refraction may be pro
duced in a ray passing obliquely through strata of varying
densities. Neither is it believed that the aether does or can
reflect light ; for if it did, the entire sky would be more nearly
luminous. The rays in free space move in right lines.

 fewer than something like a unit eighteen (1019) of molecules in a cubic
 millimetre of a gas at ordinary temperature and pressure" (Phil. Mag. 1868
 [41 xxxvi. p. 141). According to the Kinetic theory the number of mole
 cules in a given volume under the same pressure and temperature is the
 same for all gases. The weight of a cubic foot of hydrogen at the tempe
 rature of melting ice and under constant pressure being 0*005592 of a
 pound, and as a cubic foot equals 28,315,000 cubic millimetres, the probable
 mass of a molecule of hydrogen will be

    The numbers in the third column multiplied by                          will
 give the density (or mass per cubic foot) at the respective
 altitudes ; and the same numbers multiplied by 15 (or more
 accurately 14*7) will give the tension per square inch. Ac
 cording to this law, at an elevation of 300 miles the density
 of the atmosphere will be somewhat less than the density of
 the aether as given by equation (9).
    To find the height at which the tension of the atmosphere,
 according to the above law, will be the same as that of the
 aether, we have, by means of equations (11) and (25), sub
stituting in the latter 2116 for

so that at the height of 127 miles the tension would be less
than that of the aather, the temperature being uniform.
    The mean free path according to the above law, in which
gravity varies as the inverse squares, is less, and for great
heights much less, than would be found according to the
ordinary exponential law. Thus Crookes states that the mean
free path of a molecule at the height of 200 miles is about

about 792,000 miles.
    If a cubic inch of air at sea-level were carried to the height
of J the radius of the earth, and then allowed to expand freely,
so as to become of the computed density of the atmosphere at
 that point, it would fill a space of 4 x 1028'12 cubic miles, or a
 sphere whose radius is 2,398,000,000 miles, which is nearly
 equal to the distance of the planet Neptune from the sun ;
 and there would be less than one molecule to the mile. Such
 are some of the results of extending a law to extreme cases
 regardless of physical limitations, or of the imperfection of
 the data on which it is founded. For instance, a uniform
 temperature is assumed, and, impliedly, an unlimited divisi
 bility of the molecules. The latter is necessary in order to
 maintain a law of continuity. But modern investigations
 show that not only air, but all the gases, are composed of
 molecules of definite magnitudes whose dimensions can be
 approximately determined ; and hence, if there be only a few
 molecules in a cubic foot, and much less if there be but
 one molecule in a cubic mile, it cannot be claimed that the
 gas will be governed by the same laws as at the surface of
 the earth.
     To find the Height of the Atmosphere.—The atmosphere will
 terminate at that height where the vertical repulsive force
 equals the weight of the particles in the topmost layer. As a
 first approximation, conceive that the molecules are arranged
 in horizontal lasers and vertical columns, in a prism whose
 base is one square foot, and whose height extends to the
 height of the atmosphere ; the base of each column of mole
 cules being one of the molecules in the base of the prism.
  Considering the number of molecules in a cubic foot of air
 at standard conditions as lTxlO25, and the weight of the
 same as *08 of a pound, we have for
                                                       a

But with t an unknown variable this cannot be integrated.
If t= t0 we at once have equation (14) . The relation between
t ana z is unknown, if indeed there be any algebraic relation
between them. It is, however, known that, as a general fact,
the temperature decreases with the elevation ; although local
causes and air-currents often cause this law to be reversed
for moderate heights. The best that can be done, in this
case, is to find an expression that will represent, approxi
mately, the mean values of the temperature. It is usually
assumed that the average temperature at the earth is about
59° F. or 60° F., and that for latitudes of, say, 40° N. to
40° S. the perpetual frost-line is from 14,000 to 16,000 feet
above sea-level ; and observations indicate that the rate of
decrease of temperature decreases with the height. The last
fact is suggestive of an exponential law ; hence assuming

   The temperatures given in twenty-five or more reports of
balloon ascensions, not only give values the mean of which
is fairly represented by the celebrated seven-mile ascent of
Mr. Glaisher, but his figures, given in the fourth column of
the table, represent a more uniform law than is common in
such reports. Our computed values exceed his observed
values at all points except at the surface of the earth, where
they agree. In this ascent he reached the point of freezing
at the height of two miles, which is lower than the average,
as determined by many observations; and therefore it appears
that equation (31) probably represents the general law better
than this single set of observations. The effect, however, of
the exponential law is scarcely perceptible within the limits
of observation ; for the exponent of e is so small for eleva
tions under seven miles, that it makes tho law of decrease of
temperature nearly uniform with equal increments of eleva
tion. Thus, omitting fractions, the computed decrease for
the first mile is 10°, and the average for seven miles is nearly
9° ; but to assume a uniform decrease throughout the column
limits the height of the column independently of pressure or
other conditions, for it could not extend beyond the point of
absolute zero. There is no objection to applying such a law

   It is evident that the very low temperature of the higher
portions of the column will shorten very much the hypo
thetical column of uniform temperature ; but there are other
conditions which will modify the preceding analysis. The
assumptions in regard to layers and columns would not be
realized even under statical conditions, and much less for the
conditions in nature. Statically, the molecules would arrange
themselves moi-e like shot in a pile, each being over the space
between the molecules in the layer below, instead of over a
molecule. This arrangement would give a less number in the
horizontal layers than assumed above. But the hypothesis of
constancy in the number of molecules in the layers is open to
greater objections. For the distance between the molecules
will increase with the elevation on account of the diminution
of the pressure of that part of the column above the point
considered, and the elastic force will be correspondingly di
minished ; while, horizontally, in the plane of a layer of the
molecules, the elastic force would remain constant. In other
words, in the medium arranged as assumed the tension would
not be the same in all directions, and hence would be in
unstable equilibrium. As a refinement, we notice that in
every heavy fluid the downward pressure at every point
exceeds the upward by the weight of a molecule.
   Considering, now, that the molecules in the hypothetical
layers are distributed uniformly throughout the spaces imme
diately beneath them, the number in the new top layer will be
less than in the former case, and the column will rise to a
 greater height, and hence will exceed 86 miles ; and, in turn,
 the new column would need another correction, and so on.
 Assuming that the number in the top layer is 1010, and that
 the vertical component of the elastic forces follows the law of

412                 Prof. De Volaon Wood on
equation (33) , wo find
                          2 = 95 miles ;
and if the number in the top layer be 104, we find 2=104
miles, and for one molecule, £=110 miles. In a similar
manner it would be legitimate to assume that the column was
capped by a fraction of a molecule, for that would be equi
valent to one molecule at the top of a column having a base
of several square feet. We are unable to determine where
this process would end in nature; and hence this analysis fails
to fix definitely the extreme height of the atmosphere, even
for statical conditions.
   Assuming that the distance between the contiguous mole
cules would be inversely as the third root of the densities of
the medium, as they would be with sufficient accuracy where
the number of molecules in a cubic foot is immense, we have,
after substituting e, equation (33), and t, equation (31), in
(29'),

where d0 is the distance between contiguous molecules at sea-
level and d the corresponding distance at the height z. Hence
                       d=d0[e *          ']*               (35)

               „ z = 104 „          d=ll-4 „
 These values of d are greatly in excess of the distances be
tween contiguous molecules in the horizontal layers, according
to assumed conditions. Thus, at tho height of 104 miles, it
was assumed that there were 10s molecules on the side of a
square foot, in which case tho distance between contiguous
molecules would he ahout | of an inch instead of 11 inches
as above. These results ought not to agree exactly, for one
analysis assumes that the atmosphere terminates with each
assumed number of molecules, while tho other assumes that
the law is continuous to any height. It is apparent that
the laws represented by equations (33) and (35) both become
practically discontinuous at a height at or less than 95 miles.
 For the sake of giving definiteness to tho following remarks,
we will assume that the mean height for statical conditions is

                       the Luminiferous JEther.                     413
95 miles. But the conditions in nature are not statical. The
changes in temperature in the column will be continually in
creasing or decreasing its height ; the air-currents also operate
to change it, first by increasing or decreasing the temperature
from the mean at considerable heights, and, secondly, hy
operating dynamically to push the top of the column upward;
the aerial tides may operate to raise the column still higher,
and the molecules themselves are supposed to be flying with
great rapidity in all directions. An increase of temperature
of one tenth the mean value, which at the earth's surface
would be about 49° F., would elongate the column about ten
miles, and a corresponding decrease would shorten it about
the same amount, making it 105 miles in the former case and
85 miles in the latter. The effect of air-currents and aerial
tides cannot be so definitely calculated; but it is safe to assume
that they may produce a much greater increase of height
above the mean than they will depression below the mean ;
just as in a highly agitated sea, the depressions below the
mean surface-level may be small compared with the height
above the same level to which the spray from the top of a
wave may be thrown. It seems possible, therefore, that when
the temperature, air-cnrrents, and aerial tides conspire to de
press the column, the extreme height of the atmosphere may
be reduced to less than 85 miles; and when they conspire to
elevate it, it may possibly rise to a height exceeding 120
miles.
    If it be certain, as is assumed, that the meteors are rendered
incandescent by atmospheric friction, and the extreme height
at which they are visible could be determined by direct obser
vation, it would fix a height less than the extreme height of
the atmosphere, independent of other physical considerations;
but the movement of these bodies is so extremely rapid that
it is impossible to determine their height with astronomical
precision. Still computations by Professor Herschel give a
height of about 118 miles*, and Professor Newcomb estimates
it to be about 100 milesf. It is possible that a meteor would
sometimes become inflamed by penetrating the atmosphere
   * Professor A. S. Herschel gives the height of twenty meteors varying
from 40 to 118 miles. ' Nature,' vol. iv. p. 504.
   t Newcomb says :—" The lightning-like rapidity with which the meteors
darted through their course rendered it impossible to observe them with
astronomical precision ; but the general result was that they were first
seen at an average height of 75 miles and disappeared at a height of 55
mileB. There was no positive evidence that any meteor commenced at a
height greater than 100 miles. These phenomena seem to indicate that
 our atmosphere really extends to a height of between 100 and 110 miles."

 only a few miles, for although the atmosphere in the upper
 regions is extremely rare, yet the actual number of molecules
 in a cubic foot is large. Thus, according to our analysis, for
 statical conditions, the topmost cubic foot of the 104-mile
column would contain about 1,000,000 molecules ; and at the
 height of 95 miles it would contain about 1,000,000,000,000,000
 molecules ; so that if the relative velocities of the meteor and
 air be 20 miles per second, the meteor would encounter an
 enormous number in the twentieth or even the hundredth part
 of a second, after first entering the atmosphere.
    The height of the auroral arch—supposed to be within our
atmosphere—has been computed to be from 33 to 1000 miles
 (see article " Aurora,''' Encyc. Brit.). But it has been shown
by experiment, that a vacuum may be produced through
which an electrical discharge cannot be passed, and yet the
atmosphere at the height ot 150 miles under the most favour
able condition, that of uniform temperature, is vastly more
rare than the most perfect vacuum ever produced by the most
perfect Sprengel pump ; and at the height of 200 miles under
the same conditions the vacuum would be some 10,000,000
times as great as the most perfect vacuum yet made ; while,
according to the probable law of the decrease of temperature
with the elevation, and in accordance with the probable mass
of a molecule of air, the extreme height falls far short of 150
miles. It is evident, therefore, that the assumed determination
of the height of the atmosphere by means of the auroral arch
is, to say the least, unreliable*.
    We have pursued this digression in regard to the atmo
sphere partly for its own sake and partly to show, by way of
contrast and accumulative evidence, that the aether is a sub
stance entirely distinct from that of the atmosphere,—that the
former cannot be considered as the latter greatly rarefied, as
some have supposed. Admitting the validity of the prece
ding discussion, some of the distinctive properties are :—
    1. The different modes of the movements of the molecules
in the two substances in the propagation of a wave ; in one
the motion being a to-and-fro movement and in the other a
transverse movement. These are distinctions recognized by
the best writers upon the subject, and are especially noticed
 by Maxwell in an article on Ether in the Encyclopedia Bri-
tanniea.
    2. It is impossible for a wave to be transmitted in air with
the known velocity of light, unless its temperature be increased

rather than a terrestrial origin. ' Science,' 1885, p. 005.

exceedingly large compared with the same ratio in air. The

   4. The specific heat of the sether is, at least, many million
times that of air, or of any other known gas.
   5. The atmosphere is of variable density, elasticity, and
temperature, while the sether is well-nigh isometric throughout
space in regard to each of these elements.
   6. A molecule of aether is well-nigh infinitesimal compared
with one of air.
   7. Air is attracted to a planet with such a relative force,
that its extreme height is only a few miles.
   8. The ratio of the density to the elasticity of the aether is
constant ; but in the atmosphere, on account of the decrease
of temperature with the elevation, the density decreases less
rapidly than the elasticity, as may be seen by comparing
the first part of equation (35) with equation (33) : we have
                            S    \ e
                            — = e . —.
On this account a wave would be propagated with less velocity
in the higher regions of the atmosphere than in the lower,
while a wave in the aether has a sensibly uniform velocity
throughout space.
   The question may arise, May not the resistance of the aether
drag away the remote molecules of the atmosphere, and so
scatter them in space along the path of the earth's orbit. ?
Assuming that the atmosphere is moving with the earth
through space at the rate of 20 miles per second (which
exceeds the actual velocity), and that the resistance of the
sether is measured in the same manner as for fluids, we have
                              v2
for the resistance ^L=kwa^, where v is the velocity of a
molecule of air, a is meridian section, w the weight of a unit
of volume of the sether, and k a coefficient depending upon
the form of the body. Making & = 1, which is greater than its

 actual value, and a=         feet, which, again, is in excess of
 the true area, w the value in equation (10), we find that

 The attractive force of the earth for a molecule of air is given
 in equation (28), and hence the attraction of the earth for a
 molecule of air will exceed 500,000 times the resistance of the
 aether ; hence the molecules accompany the earth in its orbit
 as certainly as does the moon, and are more rigidly bound to
 it than is its satellite.
    The Kinetic energy of a molecule of air at standard con
 ditions is about
            2 * 32 2 x 17 x 10*71600' = ioVa fo°H»o™d i
 and of the ajther, according to our results, about
      I ' 2WToT°(273'000 x 5280)2= 23Ho^ foot-ilound J
 which results are nearly the same ; but in a pound of tho
aather there is some 100,000,000,000 times tbe Kinetic energy
 of a pound of air.
    Considering the terrestrial atmosphere as equivalent to one
 of uniform density and         miles high, each of whose mole
cules has a mean square velocity of 1600 feet per second, and
the aether of uniform density each of whose molecules has the
mean square velocity of 286,000 miles per second, a rough
approximation shows that the Kinetic energy of the ajther in
a sphere whose radius is 92,000,000 miles (nearly the distance
of the earth from the sun) will bo only about 100,000 times
that in our atmosphere.

density of the gas, p. the coefficient of internal friction, and v
the velocity whose square is the mean of the squares of the
actual velocities of the molecules. In regard to the ajther,
these equations contain at least three unknown quantities, /,
p., and the diameter of a molecule, and hence they cannot be

                  On the Determination of the Ohm.               All
completely solved. Comparative results, however, may be
found by assuming that the density of the molecules of aether
equals those of hydrogen, or is any multiple thereof ; for then
the diameter of a molecule of the aether might be found (that
of hydrogen being 5"6 x 10-10 of a metre) ; and the combined
volume in a cubic foot will equal the number of molecules in
a cubic foot multiplied by the volume of one molecule, and
hence will be found the length of the mean free path and the
coefficient of internal friction.
   We conclude, then, that a medium whose density is such
that a volume of it equal to about twenty volumes of the
earth would weigh one pound, and whose tension is such that
the pressure on a square mile would be about one pound, and
 whose specific heat is such that it would require as much heat
to raise the temperature of one pound of it 1° F. as it would to
 raise about 2,300,000,000 tons of water the same amount,
 will satisfy the requirements of nature in being able to trans
 mit a wave of light or heat 18(5,300 miles per second, and
 transmit 133 foot-pounds of heat-energy from the sun to the
 earth each second per square foot of surface normally exposed,
 and also be everywhere practically non-resisting and sensibly
 uniform in temperature, density, and elasticity. This medium
 we call the Luminiferous ^Ether.

 mination of absolute resistance, I have been enabled to carry
 out a determination of the Ohm according to the method
 recently published by met; and beg permission to lay an
 abstract of my results in the following paper before the Royal
 Berlin Academy.
    According to the above-mentioned method, the constant
 divergences of the magnet in the same galvanometer are
 observed—produced in the one case by means of induction-
 currents passing in the same direction through the galvano
 meter at the rate of n per second ; in the other case by means
 of a constant current whose strength is a known fraction of
 the inducing current. Let us call the observed angles of
 divergence aj and a3, the required resistance r will be found

    The advantages of this manner of experimenting are that the
number of the quantities to be ascertained is a comparatively
small one, and that all those quantities are omitted which
require great care in their accurate determination. I place
under this heading the constants and variations of terrestrial
and of rod magnetism, the coefficients of induction of the sur
faces of convolution of the wire-bobbin of many superposed
lavers, the reduction-factor of the galvanometer, the moment
of inertia and logarithmic decrement of magnets in oscillation,
and, more especially, the exact determination of the resistance
of copper wires which are often not all in the same room,
and whose temperature can only be approximated to from the
temperature of the surrounding air*.

a ship's chronometer of Brocking's, which was rated by
observation.
   The solenoid is wound round upon a wooden block re
peatedly coated with glue, such as are used in orchestrions.
It was made in the year 1868, and was again planed down
and polished on the lathe in May of last year. Its dia
meter was determined in three different ways, which were so
chosen that it was possible at the same time to ascertain that
the section of the drum sufficiently approximated to a circle,
and that the whole block was a cylinder. They were :—
    1. Every six diameters of the same section were compared,
by means of a micrometer-screw at thirteen equidistant points
along the length of the block, with a glass rod measuring
23*3264 centim. in length*.
   The diameters found were:—
          Lowest value.        Highest value.            Mean,
             centim.              centim.                centim.

   2. The circumferences were measured by means of strips
of paper at thirteen equidistant points, whence the calculated
diameters were:—
         Lowest value.         Highest value.            Mean,
             centim.              centim.                centim.
            23-3186              23-3252                23-3229
   3. The diameter was reckoned from the length of the wire
wound round it. During the winding the thickness of the
wire was at the same time measured at 332 points by means
of a microscope with ocular micrometer, and found to be
00472 centim. The diameter of the block was found to be
                       D = 23-3262 centim.
   The measurements in No. 2 were repeated after the winding,
D = 23*3190 centim., and were carried out again after each
determination, both with strips of paper and a steel-band mea
sure, D = 23 3194 centim. and 23-3204 centim. As the mean
of all the measurements, we get for radius R the formula (2),
                         R= 11-6846 centim.
    The isolation of the wire coils was tested by means of
Hughe's induction-scale "f.
    The number of convolutions was 2864 ; they covered the
drum to a length of 135'125 centim.

   The induction-coil is also wound round wood, and consists
of 3848 convolutions in 15 sections, which can be combined
at pleasure. The width of the bobbin was 4-01 centini. The
mean radius of each section was reckoned from the circum
ferences of the separate layers of wires, which had been
measured by means of strips of paper. To test the isolation
of the coils, and to possess a control over the paper-measure
ments, the mean radius of each section of the wider one was
determined by Von Bosseha's method *. As, however, the
dimensions of the bobbin are only expressed in the term
2a of formula (2), a mistake of one per cent, would only
falsify the value of r by at most 0*0003.
   The resistance r, which has to be determined in absolute
measurement, amounted either to 1 or             or 2 Siemens units,
and was composed of 2 Siemens units (by Siemen and
Halske), nos. 3(518 and 3(> 1 9, which were used either singly
or parallel, or behind one another. These were made fast in
metal cases, which were filled with oil, and stood in a large
bath of the same. Both before and after the experiments,
both standards were compared with a third unit, and with
each other.
   The thermometers were divided into one-tenths of a degree,
and were three times compared carefully with the standard
thermometers of the Physical Institute.
    The interruptor was driven by a toothed wheel t- For
determining n, the number of interruptions, a counter was
made fast to the axis of rotation, by means of which ^s of a
revolution could be directly read off.
    At least 700 revolutions were counted during each experi-
 that the divergences of the galvanometer were constant
 throughout.
    This appears to me an advantage that this interruptor
 possesses over that used by Herr lioiti J ; and I believe that
 the discrepancies between his separate observations are due,
 if not entirely, at least in a great measure, to the unequal
 action of the " Schmidt" water-motor used by him.

    The galvanometer was not artificially damped. The posi
 tion of rest of the needle was determined from its maximum
divergence. The divergences to be observed, «i and «2, were
never less than 800 millim. on a scale 4 metres distant, and
were always within a few scale-divisions of each other; so that
for the reduction to arcs an approximate knowledge of the
distance of the scale was enough. All connecting-wires were
covered with caoutchouc and twisted lightly together; all the
current-reversers, Ac. were made of paraffin and sealing-wax.
   Altogether, sixty-seven experiments were made ; only the
solenoid is common to them all.
    Here the only variation possible was that the induction-
bobbin could be placed 10 centim. further towards either end,
instead of in the middle.         All other components of the
apparatus were altered in each experiment to a considerable
extent. The sections of the induction-coil were taken either
separately or in combinations of 2-5, corresponding to which
the number of the intermittences was 5-13 per second. The
strength of the inducing current was from 0'0005 to 0-01
ampere. The sensitiveness of the galvanometer was con
siderably alterable. The time taken by the oscillations of
the needle was from 15 to 34 seconds.
   To ascertain if the induction-current passing through the
galvanometer produced any other cross-magnetization of the
needle, besides constant currents of otherwise equal galvano-
                 J which the relation tan «i would be rendered
metric action,' by
unreliable, several experiments were made with magnets of
a diameter of 0*6 centim., those used in the above-mentioned
experiments being hardly 0-l in diameter. No difference
was observed after a certain number (43) of experiments had
been made ; the interrupter was fitted up afresh, and all con
necting-wires as well as current-reversers renewed.
   As the following results tally with the former, it may be
assumed that the isolation was perfect.
   The whole plan of experimenting is based on the constancy
of the source of electricity, be this periodic, as in the observa
tions by means of induction-currents, or continuous, as in the
measurement by means of the constant current. Means had
therefore to be taken to meet the final objection that errors
might arise through possible polarization in the battery.
With this object, I used as sources of the current :—
   1. 1 to 4 Daniell's elements.
   2. Two points of a wire-resistance connecting a number of
        Daniell's or Bunsen's elements.

  XLIX. On the Molecular Theory of Galvanic Polarization.
   By J. Laemob, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge" .
 1. TT was first pointed out by Varley and Sir W. Thomson
     -L that the polarizing action of a galvanic cell may be
 explained by considering the cell to act as an electrical con
 denser of very large capacity. The mechanism of this action
 has since been examined in detail, especially by Helmholtz f.
    In the polarization of a water-voltameter with platinum
 plates for electrodes, the action according to Clausius's well-
 known molecular theory consists in the transfer through the
 fluid of the temporarily dissociated hydrogen and oxygen
 constituents under the action of the electric force ; so that in
 the course of time a layer of hydrogen particles with their
 positive charges accumulates in the immediate neighbourhood
 of the kathode plate, and the complementary layer of oxygen
 particles with their negative charges at the anode.
    Each of these layers will form a sheet, with positive or
 negative charge, lying close to the metal plate. On the plate
 will therefore appear an equal and opposite charge by induc
 tion. There is thus a double electric layer formed at each
 electrode ; the charged particles forming one side of it being
 prevented from coming up to and discharging themselves in
 contact with the metffl, in obedience to the electrical attrac
 tion, by chemical forces of repulsion.
     A double layer of this kind forms an actual condenser,
 whose capacity is inversely proportional to the distance
 between its faces. And Gauss's well-known theorem relating
 to magnetic shells shows, when applied to this case, that the
 effect of such a condenser is to cause a sudden rise or fall of
 potential in passing through it without producing any change
 in the distribution of the electric force in the neighbourhood.

                 Theory of Galvanic Polarization.             423
The notion of a condenser, therefore, gives a complete account
of the principal feature of the galvanic polarization.
   Direct measures of the charge by Kohlrausch showed that
on dividing this polarization-fall of potential equally between
the anode and kathode plates, the distance between the faces of
the condenser comes out to be about the fifteen-millionth part
of a millimetre; while more careful observations by Helmholtz
on cells in which absorbed gases have been removed from the
fluid, give the greater value of a ten-millionth of a millimetre.
And Helmholtz makes out the very important fact that for
all electromotive forces which do not exceed a certain, moderate
value, the capacity, and therefore the distance of the surface-
layers, is very sensibly constant*.
   2. The most accurate and convenient method of observing
the polarization at the common surface of two liquids is pro
bably the electro-capillary method invented and applied by
Lippmann.
   When a surface of separation can persist between the fluids,
the energy, reckoned as potential, of pairs of particles close
to the surface must exceed that of the same particles when
in the interior of their respective fluids. The difference may,
as Gauss pointed out, be reckoned as surface-energy, and
specified by its amount per unit area of surface. If T re
present this amount, it follows, as is well known, that the
forces which arise from it may be represented by a surface-
tension equal to T across each unit of length, tending to con
tract the surface in all directions.
   Now, if the common surface is polarized with constant
charges + Q and — Q on its two faces, there will exist an ad
ditional electrical energy, which is also reckoned by its amount
per unit surface, and whose total value is
                             E = £QV,
or, what is the same,               ryi
where S is the area of the surface and C is its electrical capa
city per unit area.
   The effect of this surface-energy will therefore, the system
being conservative, be represented by a surface-tension T',

i. e. is equal to the electrical surface-energy per unit area of
the surface, with negative sign.
    The effect of the galvanic polarization will therefore be to
diminish the capillary surface-tension by this amount -g.
    In the actual case in which the polarization is maintained
by a battery, the difference of potential V between the faces
of the condenser is what remains constant ; and the system is
no longer conservative, because the battery can be drawn
upon ; we have then
                             E = iCSV»,

                            — = 4CV«

therefore                   dE=-Td&;
i. e. this force T" now acts so as to increase the total energy
of electrification E, and is measured by its rate of increase per
unit extension of area; for the work done by the contractile
force T" in an extension of surface d& is equal to — TrfS,
which is now the increment of the energy, but under the
previous conditions was its decrement.
    It follows that under these circumstances the battery is
drawn upon for an amount of energy equal to twice that
required to do the electrical work of extension, via. the energy
required to do this work together with the equal amount used
up in increasing E, as has just been found. This is a particular
case of a general theorem of Sir W. Thomson's. We have gone
into the matter here to show the consistency of the propositions
which make the capillary surface-tension equal to the rate of
 increase of the ordinary surface-energy per unit extension,
 while the electric surface-tension is equal to the rate of decrease
 of the electrical surface-energy per unit extension.
    Once the surface-tension becomes negative, a free surface
 becomes unstable, and therefore practically impossible. We
 notice therefore that, as the polarization is made stronger
 and stronger, this state of affairs would finally supervene were
 not the polarization previously relieved by electrolytic separa
 tion of the charged layer.
    3. We have proved that the surface-tension is diminished
 by galvanic polarization by an amount equal to ^CV2, where
 C is the electric capacity of the surface per unit area.
    The polarization-charge is therefore zero when T is a maxi
 mum, and the surface is then most curved.
    The method that we have employed to determine the capil

                    Theory of Galvanic Polarization.             425
 lary effect of the polarization-charge is different from that
 used by Lippmann and by Helmholtz. In their mode of pro
 cedure the variation of the energy of the system is expressed
 in terms of the variations of the surface-area and the surface-
 density, and it is claimed that this expression is an exact
 differential, i. e. that any series of operations whereby the area
 or density, or both, are changed so as finally to come back to
 the original values, will also bring back the energy of the
 system to its original value. This assumption seems to require
justification when it is remembered how complex such a series
 of changes really is, and what a number of other variations
 besides those of volume and density may enter into it. Helm
 holtz appeals to Lippmann's experiments on the influence of
extension of the surface-film on its electrification and vice versd,
and to his capillary engine, as pointing in a general way to
the truth of the assumption.
    In the method adopted above, we have proved the general
theorem that the mechanical action of two layers of positive
and negative electricity of equal amounts, spread over the
two faces of a flexible sheet, may be represented by a nega
tive surface-tension of amount numerically measured by the
energy of the electrification per unit area. It follows, then,
on this representation of the phenomenon, that no matter
what other changes are taking place, the effect of the existing
surface-charges is to diminish the surface-tension of the sheet
by the amount just mentioned.
   The case contemplated in the present application of this
general proposition is that of a sheet of uniform thickness ;
but we can clearly extend the result to flexible condensers of
variable thickness of dielectric, provided always that the
thickness be small compared with any radius of curvature of
the surface at the place considered. In this case the mecha
nical effect on the condenser of a charge to potential V is to
produce a negative surface-tension, numerically equal to
KV2/87r<, K being the dielectric constant and t the thickness
of the sheet ; this surface-tension varies from point to point
of the sheet, and is at any place inversely proportional to its
thickness.
   This result may also be at once deduced from the expres
sion for the stress transverse to the lines of force in the
dielectric on Maxwell's well-known theory.
   4. Lippmann's original form of capillary electrometer con
sists of two mercury electrodes in contact with acidulated
water. One of the electrodes is in an extremely fine capillary
glass tube, so that the surface of contact is very small ; and
the other is of considerable area. It follows that when a
battery is applied, all the polarization and consequent change

426              Mr. J. Larmor on the Molecular
in the surface-tension practically takes place at the fine
electrode, as the corresponding charge at the other electrode
is spread over so much greater area. The change in the
capillary constant is measured by the column of mercury
whose pressure is required to restore the meniscus to its
former position.
   Lippmann has given a series of observations with this
instrument in his paper in the Annates de Chimie, vol. v.
p. 507, the electrolyte being water containing one sixth part
by volume of sulphuric acid. He finds that the maximum
surface-tension is attained when the applied electromotive
force is '905 of a Daniell's cell. This value, therefore, cor
responds to absence of polarization at the electrode meniscus.
The following Table, calculated from his results, gives he the
excess (positive or negative) of the electromotive force ubove
this value, hp the excess of the pressure required to neutra
lize its effect over its value when e=*905 D, and (Se)*/Sp,
which is proportional to the capacity of the electrode, and
therefore inversely to the distance between the two electrified
layers,—on the supposition that the condensing arrangement
remains analogous to an ordinary condenser, viz. consists of
two infinitely thin layers separated by a dielectric sheet.

   The pressure supported by the tension of the meniscus

therefore proportional to the maximum surface-tension of the
film. The surface-tension, as ordinarily measured, corresponds
to e=0, and is therefore proportional to the pressure, which
was then 750 millim.
   The last column of this table is in good agreement with
Helmlioltz's result, that for electromotive forces from zero up

                  Theory of Galvanic Polarization.            427
to a limit of considerable magnitude the capacity of the con
densing arrangement remains constant.
   As Sp is measured from a minimum value, it follows that in
the immediate neighbourhood of that value (Be)2 must vary as
Sp ; so that the discrepancies for small values of Sp in the third
column are merely to be attributed to the special difficulty of
the observations in that part of the series.
   Taking the second line of the table to give the average
value of this constant, we may calculate the thickness of the
dielectric, supposed to have the properties of vacuum, and
therefore to have unit specific inductive capacity, on the sup
position that the arrangement acts as an ordinary condenser.
When e=0, Lippmann found by direct measurement that the
surface-tension was '304x981 C.G.S. units, which there
fore corresponds to p=750 millhn. When e= "024 D, we
have Sess — -88, Sp= 337 ; therefore the change of the surface-
tension corresponding to Se is
                       STsfix '304x981.
This, as we have seen, is equal to the energy of the polariza
tion charge per unit area. Now, taking a Daniell to be l'l
volts, i. e. 1-1 x 108 C.G.S. electromagnetic units, which is the
same as l'l x 108-=-(2-98 x 1010) C.G.S. electrostatic units of
potential, we have,

   This calculation has already been made by Lippmann
(Comptes Rendus, 1882, quoted in Thomson and Tait's
' Natural Philosophy,' 2nd edit., Appendix, " On Size of
Atoms "). It gives an estimate of a molecular distance, viz.
that at which the two electrified layers are held by molecular
chemical forces, which, notwithstanding the very rough sup
positions on which it is founded, ought to be of the true order
of magnitude ; and Lippmann has pointed out that it agrees
sufficiently with the estimates assigned by Sir W. Thomson
and others from different considerations.
   It is a satisfactory verification of the general notions in

428             Mr. J. Lannor on the Molecular
volved in this discussion to find that, notwithstanding the
large factors occurring in the calculation, such as the ratio of
the electrostatic and electro-magnetic units, it yet agrees so
closely in order of magnitude with the result 1 x 10~10 metre,
obtained by Helmholtz from actual measurement of the polari
zation capacity of platinum plates.
   5. But, on the principles we have been following, we may
carry the analysis of the phenomenon still further. The
polarization consists in the transfer of charged particles to
wards the electrode under the action of the electromotive
force, and they are finally brought to equilibrium at a distance
from the electrode, whose order of magnitude has just been
determined. As these equally charged particles repel one
another, they will tend to settle down in equidistant positions
along the electrode surface. Instead therefore of two elec
trified sheets analogous to an ordinary condenser, we have
really two sheets, one consisting of equidistant electrified par
ticles, and the other of the charges brought opposite to them
on the electrode by induction. Each charged particle and its
corresponding induced charge will be brought by their mutual
attraction so close together that this attraction will just be
balanced by the chemical forces which hold them apart.
    For polarizations of sufficiently small amount, the sidelong
action of the neighbouring particles will be so small as to
have no appreciable effect on the distance of any one particle
from the electrode surface ; because, in the first place, the
distances of neighbouring particles must be at first large com
pared with the distance of two opposed charges, and, in the
second place, the smaller forces exerted by these neighbouring
particles must be resolved along the normal to the surface, in
 which direction they have no appreciable component. The
 radii of curvature of the surfaces are of course extremely
 great compared with the distance between opposed charges.
    It follows that as the polarization is increased the number
 of charged particles over unit area of electrode increases in
 the same proportion, and these particles all come to rest at
 the same distance from the electrode surface, whatever be the
 amount of the polarization. And we can clearly expect this
 uniformity of distance to hold good until the neighbouring
 particles come within a distance of one another which is of the
 same order as the distance of a pair of the opposed charges.
    The pair of opposed surfaces which is thus arrived at, not
 uniformly charged, but each with a system of equal isolated
 point-charges arranged uniformly all over it, does not, of
 course, act as an ordinary condenser in the sense of pro
 ducing a constant fall of potential in crossing it at all points,
 in positions whose distances from it are of the same order as

                  Theory of Galvanic Polarization.          429
the distance between neighbouring particles. But when we
compare two points on opposite sides at distances from it
great compared with this latter distance, it is immaterial
whether the distribution is supposed to be in isolated points or
uniformly spread over the surfaces. Therefore, as regards
points not in the immediate molecular neighbourhood of the
electrode, the effect of this polarization is still to produce
simply a difference of potential on the two sides, which is just
the same as if the charges were uniformly spread over the
surfaces at the actual distance apart.
   These considerations, then, give a reason for the fact which
is brought out by the table given above, deduced from Lipp-
mann's experiments with the capillary electrometer, and also
independently by Helmholtz from direct measurement of the
capacity of platinum electrodes in fluid with no dissolved gas
(which would disturb the action); viz. that the polarization
capacity is constant for all values of the applied electromotive
force up to limits of considerable magnitude.
    6. In order to form an estimate of the nearness of the
neighbouring molecules on a face of the double sheet when
they begin to exert an influence on one another comparable
with that exerted by the opposite charges, we must assign a
limit to the interval of potentials within which the capacity
remains constant. The table in § 4 shows that we shall attain
the correct order of magnitude by taking it to be, say, 1 volt
 in the case there considered.
   We may now make the following calculation, bearing in
mind that the sign = is to be interpreted as meaning that
 the quantities are of the same order of magnitude.
    Let t be the thickness of dielectric layer ;
        d the distance between neighbouring atoms when their
              effective mutual action becomes comparable to that
              between opposed atoms (the important part of this
              action being that between any atom and the
              neighbours of its opposed charge) ;
        t' the mean molecular distance in the electrolyte ;
         e the constant aggregate charge of a single atom or
              radical ;
so that
    t'-3e=the electro- chemical equivalent of 1 cubic centim.

         = -q- coulombs, approximately,
        = -jj- x 3 . 109 electrostatic C.G.S. units,
and d~"e = surface density.

430             Mr. J. Larmor on the Molecular
   We have, then, for the condensing sheet,
where V = l volt,
           = lO8-^ x 1010) electrostatic C. G. S. units.
    Therefore
therefore
    If now we write for t the value found above, "3 X 10-s,
 and put t! and d equal to each other, both being molecular
 distances of the same kind, we obtain for either the value
                      4      _8
                     jTj x 10 centimetres,
 which is very exactly of the same order as the value for
 molecular intervals obtained already from the other con
 siderations.
    On looking through this calculation it will be seen that
 quantities which we have designated as of the same order of
 magnitude do not differ nearly so much as in the ratio ten
 to one.
     7. The two estimates of molecular distance which have thus
 been found on independent considerations connected with
 galvanic polarization therefore agree within very close limits;
 and they come very close to the third value determined by Helm-
  holtz on the same theory of galvanic polarization, viz. 1 x 10-8
  centim. ; and they are also just below the superior limit as
  signed by Sir W. Thomson to molecular intervals from various
  considerations connected with different physical phenomena,
  viz. 10~8 centim., his inferior limit being ^ x 10-8 centim.
      Sir W. Thomson's different arguments lead to the following
  superior and inferior limits of the average distance of mole
  cules from one another in solid and liquid substances :—

methods given above.
   8. The chief value of this discussion seems, however, to be
not so much that it gives an estimate of molecular distance,
but that its very close agreement with the other independent
estimates derived from considerations connected with the same
phenomenon of galvanic polarization is strong evidence of the
substantial and ultimate truth of that representation of the
phenomenon which has formed the basis of the discussion.
    This argument seems to derive very great weight from the
 wide variety and very different magnitudes of the physical
constants employed in the three calculations, one depending
 on the direct measurement of the polarizing charge, another
 on the direct measurement of change in the capillary constant,
 and the third involving, in addition, the knowledge of the
 quantity of electricity required to decompose a gramme of
 water; while they all involve in different ways a constant of
 such large numerical magnitude as the ratio of the two elec
 trical units of quantity.
    9. The critical value 905 D in § 4 appears to have an im
 portant bearing on the much discussed question of contact
 electrification.
    As was pointed out by Helmholtz, a discontinuous change
 of potential in crossing a surface can only be produced by the
 existence of an electrical double layer on that surface ; so long
 as we look upon electrification or electric distribution as the
 cause of electrical phenomena, this is the only explanation open
 to us.
    It has been seen that this electrification represents a distri
 bution of purely surface-energy ; and if ite properties are to

432             Mr. J. Larmor on the Molecular
be investigated, it is to be expected that much light will be
thrown upon them b)r their relations to other purely surface-
distributions of energy, of which the best known is that lead
ing to capillary phenomena.
   We are not required to explain the manner in which this
double layer at the surface of contact of two dissimilar sub
stances is brought about. We may illustrate it by the rather
crude hypothesis that each molecule of an electrolyte consists
of a positively charged cation radical and a negatively charged
anion radical held together by electrical forces, but partly also
by their forces of chemical affinity, so as to be analogous to a
magnetic molecule with north and south poles ; that along the
surface of the electrode these molecules are all turned into the
same direction (polarized) by reason of the greater chemical
affinity of one of their constituents for the matter of the elec
trode ; and that they thus form a double sheet analogous to a
magnetic shell. This illustration will at any rate show that it
is possible to give an account of the matter which shall be in
unison with the commonly received ideas of electrical and
chemical action, without having to speculate on the deeper
question of the relation of the material atom to its electrical
charge.
    The electro-capillary observations of Lippmann quoted
above, and the later ones of Koenig for various electrolytic
fluids, show that, for one definite amount of polarization, each
of these fluids in contact with mercury shows a maximum
surface-tension. As we have seen that the existence of an
electrical double layer on the surface must diminish the sur
face-tension, it follows that the critical value "905 D for Lipp-
mann's acidulated water is that difference of potential which,
applied from without, just neutralizes the naturally existing
double electrical layer on the surface. It would seem there
fore that the natural contact-difference of potential between
Lippmann's mercury and acidulated water is "905 D, and that
an absolute measure of a contact electromotive force has thus
been obtained.
                            Appendix.
   The result that the mechanical effect of the electrification
on a charged condenser with thin uniform dielectric, whether
flexible or not, is equivalent to a uniform negative surface-
tension, has been derived in § 2 from the Principle of Energy
without the use of any analysis.
   The same result will of course follow from direct calculation
of the mutual forces exerted by the charged elements of the
surfaces on one another. As it forms a good example of the

                 Theory of Galvanic Polarization.             433
theory of surface-energy which Gauss has made the founda
tion of the doctrine of capillary action, in a case in which all
the circumstances of the forces are known, and as it also
illustrates some other points, the direct calculation is here
appended.
    Consider, first, an infinite plane electrified surface, and
imagine a straight line drawn across it. The mutual repulsion
of the electrified parts on the two sides of this line will result
in a tension tending to tear the parts of the surface asunder
along the line, and whose intensity, measured across unit length,
we can calculate as follows.
    Imagine a unit of electricity situated at a point distant f
from the line of division ; the repulsion exerted on it by the
other half of the electrification is easily expressed in polar
coordinates, r, 8 ; 8 being measured from the shortest distance
to the line of separation.
    It will, however, be more convenient to take this unit charge
at a distance h from the plane, and to measure r, 8 from its
projection on the plane as pole. The repulsion exerted on it,
                    — the
 resolved parallel to      I— is
                       — plane,
                             '* ,a   r      p cos 0
 where p is the surface-density of the electrification, and
 cos i = f jr.
     Therefore the repulsion
     To integrate this, write
                        r,_f»=(f,+A»)«*J
 therefore
                        rdr=^~zdz;
 and the integral
                                   ,dz
                        -r
                            L-             Jt=o
     This quantity becomes infinite at the upper limit ; so that
  for an infinite plane sheet the tearing-force due to the electri
  fication would be infinite ; a result which would also follow
  readily from simple consideration of the dimensions of the
  variable involved in the integral.
     Suppose, however, we take a finite sheet bounded on the

434       On the Molecular Theory of Galvanic Polarization.
farther side by the circular arc r=r0 ; the repulsion now is
R ee 2p log { (r»0 + h')l + (r20- f)*} -p log (A3 + g»)
   As we have seen, this expression increases indefinitely as r0
increases. But if now, instead of a single electrical sheet, we
had a double electrical layer with an intervening vacuum
dielectric of thickness t, the repulsion exerted by it on the unit
charge in the plane of the positive face will be equal to
                                 .dR
                                  dh'
   But on differentiating the expression for R, it is obvious that
the first and last terms give parts which become zero when r0
is infinite ; so that the repulsion of the infinite double layer
on the unit charge is finite, and is equal to
                               2tph
   The repulsion exerted on a strip of unit breadth of density
p and extending from f =0 to f=ao therefore

                            = irp%
which is independent of h.
   The repulsion exerted on a strip of the same double sheet is
therefore
t. e. it is the electrical energy of the distribution per unit
area. And this quantity that we have thus calculated is
clearly the surface-tension required.
   It is clear also that the stress across any line drawn on the
sheet is wholly tangential, and has no component normal to
the sheet; so that this surface-tension is its complete speci
fication.
   The calculation just made has been only for the case of an
infinite plane double sheet. For a single sheet the distant
parts exert a finite effect ; and we have seen that the stress
increases indefinitely when the size of the sheet increases.
But for a double sheet the parts very distant relatively to the
thickness no longer contribute sensibly to the result, and the
integrals converge. Thus, if the double sheet be of sensible
but finite curvature, we may calculate the integrals either

   Pressure in Electrical Conduction and Decomposition.          435
from the sheet itself or from the portion of the sheet which
coincides sensibly with the tangent plane at the place consi
dered, or from an infinite plane sheet coinciding with that
tangent plane. This is on the assumption that the part of
the sheet which coincides sensibly with the tangent plane is
of large dimensions compared with the thickness of the
dielectric, i. e. that the latter is small compared with any
radius of curvature of the sheet.
   The result obtained therefore holds for curved double sheets
as well as plane ones.
   Now, if a curved sheet be under a uniform surface-tension
T, it is well known that the stress experienced by any element
oS of its surface is along the normal, and equal to
Ri, "Rg being the principal radii of curvature where 8S is
situated. When we apply this to the electrical double layer,
we obtain the same result as comes from the direct expression,
on Green's theory, of the force exerted by the electrical system
on the two charged faces which belong to the element 8S.
    For a single curved electrified layer of finite dimensions,
open or closed, the surface-tension is different at different
points, and at the same point across different lines on the sur
face ; except in the case of an electrified spherical sheet, in
which it is easily seen to be constant and equal to —irp^a,
where a is the radius of the sphere.

L. On the Influence of Pressure on certain cases of Electrical
    Conduction and Decomposition. By J. W. Clark, Assistant
   Professor of Physics in University College, Liverpool*.
AS the subject of electrolysis is to be brought prominently
         before the next Meeting of the British Association, the
following short outline of an investigation, commenced some
years ago, may not be without interest at the present time.
    The subject properly divides itself into three branches, viz. :—
the influence of pressure on the electrical conduction and
decomposition of—
    I. Dilute sulphuric acid (products of electrolysis occupying
much greater volume than when combined to form the elec
trolyte).
    II. A solution of (e. g.) CuS04 (products of electrolysis
                   • Communicated by the Author.

430         Assistant-Prof. J. W. Clark on the Influence of
occupying about the same volume as when combined to form
the electrolyte).
    III. The conduction of mercury.
    Of these three classes, it will be noticed that the liquids in
I. and II. are composed of complex molecules which, accord
ing to Clausius, are in a state of continuous motion varied by
collisions with one another which cause dissociation*. Mer
cury, on the other hand, is a metallic conductor, and a liquid
which is usually regarded as being composed of simple or
monatomic molecules, which are therefore incapable of under
going dissociation ; but by the application of a sufficient
external pressure its molecules may be brought nearer together,
or, in other words, the lengths of the molecular mean free
paths may be reduced.
     The investigation to which I now wish to refer relates
to the decomposition of dilute sulphuric acid under an ex
ternal pressure which it is my object to make appreciable
in comparison with the molecular forces of the liquid itself, for
 it is only when that condition is fulfilled that any direct results
 are to be anticipated such as those which are here sufficiently
 suggested by the questions :—Is Faraday's law independent
 of pressure ? Do the conduction and decomposition of an elec
 trolyte always vary together? Can electrolytic action be stopped
 by pressure ? It was to obtain a reply to such questions that
 I turned from the region of speculation to the surer ground of
 experiment, and in the first instance set myself to measure
 the electrical resistance of acidulated water, and the amount of
  gas liberated from it by a known current under pressure.
     The method of experiment in outline is as follows :—The
 dilute sulphuric acid to be electrolyzed is hermetically sealed
  in a short glass tube (0*1 centim. in internal, and 0'7 centim.
 in external diameter), through the ends of which pass thin
 platinum-wire electrodes, of which the upper wire is usually
 so encased in glass that only the portion in the electrolyte is
  exposed : a precaution found to be necessary in order to avoid
  continuous recombination. This roughly describes the " elec
  trolytic tube," in which the pressure upon the dilute sulphuric
  acid is generated by the gases liberated hy the current as they
  accumulate in the (determined) volume of the tube which ia
  unoccupied by the liquid. When the circuit includes a gal-
     • If volatility and a large coefficient of expansion for heat may be
 regarded as a probable indication of a long mean free molecular path, it
 does not seem impossible, on the hypothesis of Clausum, that unaer the
 influence of a sufficiently great external pressure, such liquids as condensed
 gases (CO,, NHS, S02, &c, fused HgCl,), might be rendered good elec
  trical conductors, or at least have their conductivity increased.

    Pressure on Electrical Conduction and Decomposition.       437
vanometer as well as a silver voltameter, variations of current,
as well as total current, can be measured ; and, finally, the
quantity of gas liberated in the electrolytic tube under the
accumulating pressure exerted by it upon the liquid is deter
mined by allowing it to burst in a stoppered eudiometer (of
special construction) over mercury, so that the whole of the
gas is collected. From the volume of gas thus obtained the
bursting or maximum pressure can be calculated.
    The principal results may be very briefly stated as follows:—
    1. When such an electrolytic tube containing dilute sul
phuric acid is fixed in a vertical position, the lower electrode
connected with the positive and the upper electrode with the
negative pole of a battery, the evolution of gas appears to
become less and less, and the electrical resistance of the con
tents of the tube increases, until, with an E.M.F. of 30 volts,
the needle of a galvanometer in circuit shows only a very small
deflection. This action appears to be due to the formation of
 very dense sulphuric acid (H2S04 ?) at the + electrode at the
 bottom of the tube, whilst the water from which it has been
separated forms a layer above it of so high resistance as to
almost absolutely stop the passage of the current. This con
dition must not be mistaken for the cessation of electrolytic
decomposition produced by pressure.
    The strong acid is produced at the + electrode by the action
 of the current, and owing to the small sectional area of the
tube, though it again mixes with the liquid above it by diffu
 sion, it does so less rapidly than it is separated by the current.
 Moreover, under a stifficient pressure diffusive rate is lessened
as the length of the mean free molecular path is decreased.
    The above singular action affords a means of concentrating
 sulphuric acid without boiling.
     2. When the poles are reversed, the dense sulphuric acid
 is formed by the current at the upper electrode, and thus
 becomes again mixed with the rest of the liquid in the
 tube as it descends through the liquid, the mixing action
 being facilitated by the bubbles of hydrogen rising from the
 lower electrode. In this way the separating action of the
 current is prevented, and my glass tubes (which burst at about
 290 to 300 atmospheres) fail to withstand the pressure of the
 gases liberated by the current. I sought to strengthen one
 glass tube of special form by first coating it with pure silver
 by Martin's method, and then thickly electrotyping it with
 copper ; but it also burst. It is certain, therefore, that a
 pressure of 300 atmospheres is insufficient to arrest the elec
 trolytic decomposition.of dilute sulphuric acid. I am not yet
 certain whether pressure exercises any direct influence on the

  electrical resistance and on the quantity of gas liberated from
  dilute sulphuric acid, but what there is is slight. There seems
  to be a small decrease in the resistance, but I cannot yet say
  to what this is due ; for this part of the investigation is in
  complete, and it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish and
  separate between possible causes.
     3. Ozone is present in the gases liberated by the bursting
  of the electrolytic tube. 1 have not estimated it quantitatively,
  but I have no reason to think it present in unusual amount.
  Under some conditions, e. g. during the formation of ozone
  under the influence of the silent discharge, pressure might
  facilitate the condensation of oxygen to ozone.
     It may, finally, be needful to increase the pressures employed
 in this investigation still more, and to employ vessels of steel
 or of some other material. The whole investigation is one of
 great difficulty, but I shall probably publish a fuller account
 of the methods and results of which the above forms a short
 and very imperfect summary*.

LI. On the Winters of Great Britain and Ireland, as influenced
     by the Gulf-Stream. By Prof. Henry Hennesst, F.R.S.*
 IN the ninth volume of the Proceedings of the Royal
       Society, p. 324, is printed a letter which I wrote to the
late General Sir Edward Sabine, on the influence of the Gulf-
stream on the winters of the British Islands. I pointed out
that if abnormally cold or warm winters are due to changes
 in the condition of the comparatively tepid currents bathing
 our shores, then during cola winters the differences of tempe
 rature between the Northern and remaining coasts should be
 greater than during mild winters. A comparison of the
 observations made in the months of December 1855, 1856,
 and 1857 presented precisely this result. The winters of
 some recent years having exhibited abnormal features as to
 temperature, I have made a comparison of the results pub
 lished by the Meteorological Office, of which the following
 may be taken as the leading facta.
     In comparing the coast-temperatures of Great Britain, it
 should be remarked that the island is shaped in an irregular
  triangular outline, of which the summit is in North Scotland,
 and the base the south coast of England. For temperature-
  comparisons it is therefore best to compare the South coast
  with the West coast and North-east coast.
     In the winters of 1871 and 1881 the month of January was
  cold in Great Britain, and the following results have been
  grouped as indicated :—

    The mean temperature at Dublin was 430,6 ; whence, if
 this may be taken as about the temperature of the East coast,
 the North exceeded the East by 03.
    If we now compare the cold and warm periods, we observe
 that both in Great Britain and Ireland the difference between
 the Southern and Northern coasts was less in the warm period
 than in the cold ; and the influence of warm currents was also
 exhibited in the higher temperature of northern over eastern
 stations at lower latitudes. The conclusion arrived at in my
 former comparisons has been thus supported, and the influence
 of the thermal currents surrounding these islands in modifying
 the winters appears to be further confirmed.
    In a paper of General Sabine's, to which I have referred in
 the communication printed in the Proceedings of the Royal
 Society, he mentioned the winter of 1845—4 C as exceptionally
 mild. Some confirmation of the law I indicated may be de
 rived from some observations made during that winter on the
 south-west coast of Ireland by Mr. Daniel O'Connell. The
results were communicated by the son of the illustrious orator
 to the late Dr. Humphry Lloyd; and having consulted the
record, I found that Mr. O'Connell observed the temperature
daily at Darrynane Abbey for 106 days during the winter of
1845-46, from November to February ; on applying the cor
rections recommended by Dr. Lloyd in his paper on the
Meteorology of Ireland, I found that the mean for the winter
at Darrynane Abbey was 4< °. During the four winter months
referred to, the mean temperatures were as follows at other
stations :—
                   Cork                       47-5
                   Dublin                     46-3

                   Orkney. . . . . 41-8
   The winter of 1845-46 seems therefore to furnish an illus
tration of the law of temperature-distribution already men
tioned, and therefore of the influence of the heat-bearing
                                                         <U+FFFC>
currents which wash the shores of these islands.

LII. On the Comparative Temperature of the Northern and
   Southern Hemispheres of the Earth. By Prof. Henry
   Hennkssy, F.R.S.*
MORE than twenty years have elapsed since I published
          a systematic proof of the superiority of water over
land as a substance for absorbing and gradually diffusing
throughout its mass the heat received from the sun. The
superficial portions of the earth as a whole, including the
atmosphere in contact with the water, would be thus influ
enced, and in this way the physical properties of water were
shown to have a predominant influence on terrestrial climate.
   The properties of water here referred to are : —(1) Its excep
tionally high specific heat ; (2) its moderate permeability to
luminous rays of heat contrasted with its impermeability to
obscure heat ; and (3) its mobility. From Pf'aundler's obser
vations and experiments it appears that the specific heat of
the soil, which forms the general surface of dry land exposed
to the atmosphere, to sunshine and planetary space radiation,
varies from 019 up to 05. The majority of soils have spe
cific heat of from 025 to 028. Thus the absorbing-power
of dry land for radiant heat is in all cases much less than that
of water. At night land more readily parts with the heat
acquired under sunshine, and from its immobility it cannot
directly transport by convection or by currents any of the
heat it acquires to other parts of the earth's surface. The
conclusions at which I arrived were entirely different from
those which were generally received anterior to the time of
the publication of my views. The generally received notions
at that time are best summed up in the words of Sir John
 Herschel :—" The effect of land under sunshine is to throw
heat into the general atmosphere, and to distribute it by the
 carrying-power of the air over the whole earth. Water is
 much less effective in this respect, the heat penetrating its
depth and being there absorbed, so that the surface never
 acquires a very elevated temperature." t
    These words occur in the latest edition of the work from
which they are quoted. They furnished Sir Charles Lyell
the groundwork of some of his ingenious reasonings regarding
Geological Climate ; but my conclusions were so different
that they might be fitly expressed in terms diametrically

Academy of Sciences for September 1882.

opposite, and in such terms I have in fact expressed tliem
long since as follows : —The effect of land under sunshine
is to rapidly throw off the heat it receives into the upper
regions of the atmosphere and the interplanetary spaces both
by day and by night ; and thus, although it causes a consider
able increase of temperature in the strata of air over it by day,
it is not well adapted for storing up and retaining heat.
Water is much more effective in this respect ; the heat pene
trates to a greater depth within it than on dry land, and it
becomes more completely absorbed, owing to the far higher
capacity for heat of water and the difference between its
diathermanous action on the luminous heat-rays entering it
from the sun compared with its action on the obscure rays
quitting the particles in the interior of its mass.
   Among the consequences following from my theory of
terrestrial climate was one which seemed difficult to recon
cile with the facts accumulated at the time this theory was
brought forward. I refer to the supposed higher temperature
of the northern as compared with the southern hemisphere.
This was formerly attributed to the heating-power of the
great masses of land north of the equator. I could not
account for this inequality unless by supposing that oceanic
and aerial currents which had not been as yet fully examined
transported some of the heat absorbed south of the equator to
its northern side. This supposed superiority of temperature
in the northern hemisphere was employed as an argument
 against my conclusions.
    In 1875, at the meeting of the British Association at
 Bristol, I brought forward my views for the purpose of estab
 lishing my priority in regard to some of the conclusions which
 had been frequently reproduced at different inquiries in Great
 Britain without any reference to their original source. In
 the discussion which followed one of the speakers, Prof.
 Everett, is reported to have asked, " How, assuming Professor
 Hennessy's theory without acknowledgment to be correct, it
 could be reconciled with the generally accepted fact that the
 temperature of the northern hemisphere was greater than that
 of the southern. Professor Hennessy denied that this was a
 fact, but supposing it were so, he would attribute it to oceanic
 currents."
    It now appears that the notion of any superiority of mean
 temperature in the northern as compared to the southern
 hemisphere must be abandoned. When this opinion gained
 currency the number of temperature-observations made south
 of the equator was very small compared to the number
 recorded in northern latitudes. Of late years a considerable

  444               Dr. J. J. Hood on Retardation
 number of observations on the temperature of the sea and air
 have been collected and published by the Government of the
  United States of America. From these observations the
  result has been deduced that the difference of temperature
 between the two hemispheres is insensible, and probably
  slightly in favour of the higher mean temperature of the
 hemisphere which possesses the largest water-covering*. In
  this way my theoretical views have been fully confirmed by
  the crucial test of leading to conclusions which did not seem
 likely to be true at the time I originally placed them on
  record.
     Some further illustrations of the question under consider
 ation may be obtained from the results of observations on
 the distribution of a well-known class of plants. The condi
 tions most favourable to the growth of the larger ferns were
 recognized by Robert Brown and other eminent botanists to
 be humidity, shade, and uniformity of moderately elevated
 temperature. These conditions exist in their most perfect
 form among the smaller islands of the great oceans. In
 islands like New Zealand and others of inferior size the tribes
 of plants alluded to are widely spread and highly developed.
 The relative distribution of these plants in the northern and
 southern hemispheres is highly instructive. The extratropical
 regions of the northern hemisphere contain thirteen times as
 much land as the corresponding portion of the southern hemi
 sphere, and in the latter arborescent ferns are known to grow
 much further from the equator than in the former.
    Professor Lindley remarked long since that at the time of
 the deposit of the Lias formation, a geological epoch of
 somewhat higher general temperature than the present, the
 vegetation was similar to that of the southern hemisphere in
 the Pines as well as in the Cycads.
 LIII. On Retardation of Chemical Change. By John J. Hood,
         D.Sc. (Lond.), Assoc. Royal School of Mines].
IN a short paper published in this Journalf some time ago,
       on Retardation of Chemical Action, it was shown that
   * Dr. J. Ilann has published in the Proceedings of the Academy of
Vienna a good resume" of the facts as to the distribution of temperature
in the two hemispheres of the earth, and he concludes that their tempera
tures are almost equnl. See Ferrel, American Journal of Science, August
1882, page 89, " The Relative Temperature of the two Hemispheres of the
Earth:'

                       of Chemical Change.                      445
the rate at which ferrous-sulphate solution is oxidized by
potassic chlorate is retarded in a remarkable manner by the
addition of various sulphates. The principal results obtained
were these—that the amount of such retardation is propor
tional to the quantity of the sulphate added, and that certain
groups of analogous sulphates produce, for equal weights, the
same retardation-effect. For instance, equal weights of the
sulphates of sodium, potassium, and ammonium were found
to produce the same amount of retardation ; so also did the
potash- and ammonia-alums ; whereas the sulphates of zinc
and magnesium, although classed together as analogous salts
in the same sense as those of the alkali metals, produced dif
ferent retardations. The natural inference that was drawn
from these experiments was, that the study of retardation
might afford a means of classifying chemical substances on a
dynamical basis, and of determining for each salt or group of
salts a numeric, the coefficient of retardation, of a character
somewhat similar to what Mills* has termed the "bergmannic"
of a salt. Owing to the small number of soluble sulphates
 that can be employed in the above reaction for studying their
 retardation-effects, it is very limited in its application ; conse
 quently search was made for other reactions that could be
 employed for the same purpose, of such a nature that nitrates
 or chlorides could be experimented with. Of the several
 reactions that were tested for this purpose, it was found that
 the oxidation of ferrous chloride by potassic chlorate was by
 far the best, being analogous in all respects to that of the
 oxidation of ferrous sulphate, and capable of being rendered
 as quick or as slow, by alteration of conditions, as might be
 necessary for the purpose in view ; besides, the list of soluble
 chlorides whose retardation-effects could be studied is a com
 paratively large one. The results, however, that have been
 obtained with these salts are such as have modified somewhat
 the author's original notions concerning retardation and the
  molecular movements that are generally supposed to take
 place in a system undergoing chemical change.
    It has been usual, in establishing the formulae that are em
 ployed in the study of the rate of chemical change, to ignore
 the fact that the products of the reaction, however inactive
 they may be in the chemical sense, may retard the rate of the
 change considerably. In the experiments with ferrous sul
 phate referred to, it was shown that the introduction of so
 small a quantity as one gram of the sulphates of the alkali
 metals in 260 cubic centims., the volume of the experimental
                          • Phil. Mag. [5] i.

446               Dr. J. J. Hood on Retardation
solution, caused the oxidation to progress at a rate 10 per cent,
less than when no such salt was added ; an effect which might
be produced even to a much greater extent by the products
gradually formed during the course of any chemical change,
especially where the quantities of material in unit volume are
comparatively large, as, for instance, in the many cases of
etherification that have been studied dynamically during the
last few years, and might consequently vitiate somewhat the
inferences drawn from such experiments.
    As it was found in the experiments alluded to that the
amount of retardation was proportional to the amount of the
sulphate added, it would naturally be supposed that the pro-
ducts formed during a reaction
or accelerating effect (for the latter is possible, as these
experiments show) proportional to their quantity ; and it is
easy on this hypothesis to introduce this effect into the
equations.
    Suppose in a chemical system undergoing change there are
n different bodies taking part in the reactions, and the mea
surements that are made of the progress of the change relate
to one of these n bodies. Let Aj, A2, . . . An be the initial
 quantities of the active substances, and at time t from the
 commencement of the change *uaSt... a„, the quantities of
 these that have become chemically inactive members of the
 system, and let the measurements that are made relate to the
 body A,. At time t the quantities of these substances that are
 still capable of reacting one with the other will be A1—al}
 A2—a3, . . . A„—an ; and the inactive products resulting from
 the changes that have taken place will be «! + «2 + . . . «„. Then,
 on the usual hypothesis that the amount of change that takes
 place in unit of time with regard to any one of these bodies,
 A«, is proportional to the product of the active substances, and
 that the retardation- or acceleration-effect of the products of
 the reaction is proportional to their amount, the equation
 representing this would be written
              d"*     (A,— «i)(A,-«a) . . . (A„— «,)
              dt    M    B + (\/«1+X"«,...X"«») »          *   *  (»)
 where X', \", &c. are the coefficients of retardation or accele
 ration of «j, «2, &c, and + is taken according as these
 effects are all of the first or of the second character. The
 nature of the effect of each individual product au a?, &c.,
 whether ±, could be determined experimentally by adding a
 considerable quantity, and noting the difference in the rate of

                        of Chemical Change.                        447
such an experiment and of one where no such substance is
present excepting what is formed during the reaction.
   If the initial quantities A1; A3, . . . A„ are in equivalent
proportions, they may be expressed in terms of AK, thus
A1=elAK . . . A„ = eBA«. But suppose for the most general
case that they are multiples of these quantities, or A1 = y1e1 A, . . .
A„ = v„e„A, ; ctlt «2, . . . «„, however, are always in equivalent
proportions, or ai=elaK . . . «„ = eBa". Substituting these values,

Writing AK — uK=y, the amount of A* that remains active at
time t, and -jjj* = —            This equation may be written in the
form            i

   The reaction under consideration (the oxidation of ferrous
chloride by potassic chlorate) is represented by the equation
      6 FeCl2 + KCIO3 + 6 HC1 = 3 Fe3Cl6 + KC1 + 3 H30 ;
and consists of a system of three active members, in which the
iron, or y, was made the subject of measurement. In the
preliminary experiments that were made, the ratios of the
 chlorate and acid to the iron were varied, in order to find the
 quantities, and consequently the rate, of the oxidation most
 suitable for bringing out the retardation-effects of the chlorides.
 Some experiments were made with all three materials in equi
 valent quantities which would be represented by the equation
                            dy _      ay3 .
                            dt       b+y
 But such conditions were unsuitable ; for the experiments
 showed, as is evident from this equation, that, as the rate
 varies as the third power of y, at the start the reaction pro
 ceeds very rapidly, and quickly becomes very slow, a state of
 matters most inconvenient for the purpose in view. It was
 ultimately found best to employ different multiples of equiva
 lents of acid and chlorate for the different purposes of studying
 retardation of sulphates, of chlorides, and influence of tempe
 rature, as given below.
    The preliminary experiments with the chlorides showed

448               Dr. J. J. Hood on Retardation
that these substances, even in large quantity, influenced the
rate of the change comparatively little ; and that consequently
the terra in (2) relating to the retarding or accelerating effects
of the products of the reaction could be neglected ; as indeed
the calculations from the experimental numbers showed to be
true, as is illustrated in the experiments with MgS04 given in
detail below.
   For part of the work relating to the retardation of sulphates
and influence of heat, the following equation was employed:—
             g = -a^(K1-l)A+^(vs-l)A+^,
which, on integrating, gives
       iogwy+(v1)A-("i-i) ioglo-y+(v;-1)A }-#+«*
                  tf                           if      *
whilst in the experiments with chlorides the iron and chlorate
were in equivalent quantities, and the acid several multiples,
represented by the equation
                   ! = -0i^(K,-l)A+y},
which, on integrating, becomes
   Taking either of these equations (3) and (4), it is easy to
see that ~ a/-1, or that the time required to oxidize the
iron from %J to y" is proportional to /; consequently in a
series of experiments in which everything is the same except
ing the presence of inactive salts, by a comparison of the
values obtained for / with its value for an experiment in which
no such extraneous salt is added, or a blank experiment, a
measure is obtained of the effect of such a salt on the rate of
the oxidation ; so also in the case of variations of temperature
a measure is obtained of the accelerating effect of heat on the
rate.
                            Sulphates.
   The original design of this investigation was to determine
the retardation-effects of the various soluble chlorides. The

                         of Chemical Change.                         449
results, however, obtained for these salts, to be found further
on, being of a rather anomalous character, the influence of
sulphates was made the subject of a long series of experiments,
the results obtained being contained in Table I.
    Each experimental solution had a volume of 110 cubic cen-
tims., and contained "3736 gram Fe" as chloride, and T321
gram free HCI. To this was added 25 cubic centims. KClOg
solution, equal to *3406 gram, making the total volume =135
cubic centims., care being taken to have the solutions at the
same temperature before mixing. From such a solution 10
 cubic centims. were withdrawn, run into a small flask contain
ing a few cubic centimetres of a nearly saturated solution of
 MgSO^*, and titrated with permanganate.
    The chemical conditions represented by these quantities of
 materials are
               6 FeCI8 + (2-5)KC103 + 6(5-425 )HC1.
    The value for A was determined by diluting 10 cubic cen
 tims. of the stock solution of ferrous chloride (="3736 gram
 Fe") to 135 cubic centims., and titrating 10 cubic centims. of
 this with the permanganate, the number of cubic centimetres
 required being taken as equal to 10-5, the value for A ; but
 although or\\y approximately of this strength, the usual pro
 portional corrections were made on the values for y for each
 experiment ; in which way all the experiments are rendered
 comparable with each other, as if performed with the same
 standard solution of permanganate.
    Inserting these values of v1 = 2-5, i's= 5*425, and A=10*5
 in equation (3), it becomes
      Jim-*
     /^4-42ologio==^— y + 15-75    ,

    The following three experiments will illustrate this formula,
 and how the retardation-effects are determined with magnesic
 sulphate as the retarding agent. Employing the first and
 third observations, the values obtained for / and g in equation
 (5) are 1 15*1 and 77"2 respectively ; and side by side with
 the observed values for t are the calculated quantities.
    * Besides tending to stop the reaction, the addition of MgSO,, the
  author has shown (Chemical News, vol. 1.), renders the estimation of iron
 by permanganate in presence of free hydric chloride perfectly reliable.
  Mr. W. H. Deering has drawn attention to the fact that Zimniermann
  had previously proposed MnS04 for the same purpose.

   The noteworthy points exhibited by these numbers are
that equal weights of the sulphates of ammonium, sodium,
potassium, and lithium produce equal retardation-effects of
approximately 17*2 percent per gram ; whereas the sulphates
of zinc, cadmium, and magnesium, metals usually grouped
together in the same sense as the alkali ones, all produce
different effects. If the percentage retardation produced by
one gram of a salt be defined as its retardation-coefficient, the
values for the above salts are, for the alkali group, 1 7*2 ; for
ZnS04, 11 ; CdS04, 7 ; and for MgS04, 14-2.
   The study of the influence of heat on the values of these
retardation-coefficients it was considered would be of interest,
in view of the general In'pothesis regarding the intermolecular

coefficient of MgS04 increases slightly with the temperature,
from 15-2 at 6°-13 C. to 16-5 at 17° 0., the rate of oxidation
between these limits of temperature increasing about three

experiments, the relation being in the former p = /i(l*097)*,

                                 Chlorides.
    When the present experiments were undertaken, the prin
cipal object in view was to determine the retardation-
coefficients of the different chlorides ; and it was conjectured
 that, with the evidence obtained from former experiments,
 these salts would be found to group themselves together as
 regards retardation-effects. Such a grouping, however, has
not been found to exist. Indeed the anomalies that the expe
 riments exhibit are of a very striking character. For instance,
 instead of a retardation, the presence of certain chlorides has
 been found to produce a considerable acceleration on the rate
 of oxidation ; whilst in another case, that of sodic chloride,
 neither retardation nor acceleration occurs.
      Instead of employing quantities of iron, chlorate, and acid
 in accordance with equation (5), it was found that, by using
 only one molecule of chlorate and so rendering the rate much
 slower, the effects of the chlorides, being comparatively small,
  were better brought out. The acid being the same in amount
  as in the experiments with sulphates, or vs = 5'425 and A = 10"5,
  inserting these values in (4), the equation becomes

      From these numbers it will be seen that no two chlorides
   give the same retardation-effects. Sodic chloride practically
   produces no effect whatever, whilst the chlorides of magne
   sium, cadmium, and zinc produce an acceleration of the rate

                        of Chemical Change.                   455
of oxidation. In the case of the sulphates, the retardation-
effects of the three latter stand in order of magnitude thus :
 MgS04 > ZnS04 > CdS04; and the accelerations of the chlorides
are seen to be in the same order—MgCla > ZnCl2 > CdCl3.
    In attempting to form a mental image of the state of mat
ters in a chemical system undergoing cnange, it is customary
 to think of the moving parts or molecules, their velocities of
 translation, and the influence of various agencies, such as heat
 &c, increasing the velocities of the molecules and multiplying
the chances of collision in a given time. Employing such
language, it is easy to account for the retardation occasioned
by the presence of chemically inactive substances in the system
 by saying that, by the motions of the molecules of such bodies,
they interfere with the movements of the chemically active
molecules by coming into collision with them ; in fact, con
tinually getting in the way of the molecules of the several
bodies undergoing chemical change, and so diminishing the
number of impacts in a given time between the latter.
   To such an explanation, however, the experiments in the
first part of this paper are open to a grave objection. It
might be argued, that the introduction of a sulphate into a
solution of ferrous chloride in presence of much free HOI
would give rise to such double decompositions as would
account for the retardation observed in the rate of oxidation.
If this were so, however, it is difficult to see how the retarda
tion is the same in amount for equal weights of different
sulphates, as well as proportional to the amount of the salt
present, being the same result as was obtained with sulphates
in a ferrous sulphate solution. In the experiments with
chlorides no such double decompositions could occur, but here
the results are anomalous. 5 grams of sodic chloride produce
no effect whatever, whilst the same weight of the sulphate in
ferrous chloride would give a retardation of 85 per cent., and in
ferrous sxilphate a retardation of 50 per cent. If retardation-
effects are to be interpreted on the hypothesis of intermoleeular
movements and interference, and consequent diminution in
the number of impacts, how comes it that so much sodic chlo
ride produces no effect, whereas the same weight of potassic
chloride causes a retardation of 22 per cent.? And, considering
the subject in the same light, more remarkable still are the
effects of magnesic, zincic, and cadmic chlorides, which pro
duce an acceleration of the rate of oxidation, or increasing the
number of collisions of the active bodies in a given time by
an amount varying from 6 to 20 per cent. It seems difficult
to account for such results on the hypothesis of interdiffusion
and simple contact between the active molecules. Instances

of the difficulties that lie in the way of such a theory are
exhibited by the great differences observed in the rates of
somewhat analogous chemical changes. To take one example :
how could such a theory explain the fact that, under suitable
conditions of temperature and dilution, ferrous sulphate is
oxidized by potassic chlorate at such a rate that only a frac
tion of the total work capable of being done is accomplished
in ten thousand minutes, whereas permanganate performs the
same work practically instantaneously? Interdiffusion and
simple contact among the active molecules alone would seem
incapable of offering any explanation of this and similar facts ;
at the same time it would be dangerous to speculate on the
tendencies that chemical compounds undoubtedly possess to
resist or undergo change under various conditions, in the face
of the small amount of work that has been done bearing on
chemical change.

for affording me facilities for performing the above expe
riments.
LIV. Atmospheric Electricity. By C. Michie Smith, B.Sc,
    F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., Prof. Phys. Sc. Madras Christian
    College*.
IN 1882 I presented to the British Association a short
     report on observations made on atmospheric electricity in
Madras, which, though few in number, were of some interest,
as they seemed to show that negative electrification of the air
was not necessarily associated with broken or stormy weather.
At the same time it may be noted that the observations were
by no means conclusive, as they were in each case followed
by local showers which fell some hours afterwards. Since my
return to India, however, I have obtained a large number of
observations, many of which fully bear out the conclusion
that, even in fine weather, the air may at times be highly
charged with negative electricity.
   Neglecting a few single observations, the first series obtained
was in September 1883, when, on twelve days between the
3rd and 25th, negative readings were recorded. At the time
that these readings were taken I thought they were in some
way connected with the green sun and the wonderful sun-
glows which appeared that month ; and an account of them
will be found in my paper on these phenomena in the Transac
tions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxxii. p. 389.
More recent observations have, however, shown that, under

        Neglecting cases occurring in broken weather, the next
     negative readings were got in March 1884. During that
     month negative readings were obtained on six days, and on
     each occasion the weather was bright and the wind south
     westerly; and no rain fell in Madras on these days, nor, in

     458                    Prof. C. Michie Smith on
     fact, until nearly a fortnight after the last negative reading
     was observed. The readings in April and the first half of
     May were all normal ; and during the next two months
     absence from Madras prevented me from continuing the
     observations, which were not renewed till July 14. Between
     the 14th and 31st of July the readings were negative on
     seven days. On only one of these days did any rain fall at
     the place of observation, and then only 0-04 inch fell some
     eight hours after. In each case the wind was westerly, and
     in most cases raised great clouds of dust.
         During August negative readings were obtained on nine
     days, and on none of these could the negative potential be
     traced to storms at. or near the place of observation. On
     August 1, for instance, the readings were negative from
     11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and no rain fell till 4 r.M. on the 2nd ; on
     the 28th they were negative from noon to 5 P.M., ranging
     from 8 to 467 divisions (say 37 to 2140 volts), and no rain
     fell till the morning of the 31st. The following table (II.)

         It will be noticed that the effect of a shower is to make
      the succeeding readings positive ; and generally it is found
      that negative readings are got only when the ground is dry
      and also warm ; for on a bright morning the readings become
      negative earlier than when the morning is cloudy.
         In September there were negative readings on 13 days
      almost entirely during bright fine weather.

        From September 24, 1884, to May 14, 1885, only one nega
    tive reading has been obtained in fine weather.
        Looking over the tables of electrometer-readings, the first
    feature that strikes one is that in only one case is the potential
    negative before 9 A.M. ; and that in most cases, if the poten
    tial is positive at 10 a.m., it remains positive all day, though
    on one or two occasions when a low positive reading was
     obtained at 10 a.m., a negative one was obtained at 11 or 12.

o'clock. Again, in all cases mentioned above, the negative
readings were got with a westerly wind, which in Madras is
usually very dry, having blown over a large extent of flat dry
land. Whenever the wind veered round so as to blow in the
least degree from the sea, the potential at once became positive.
This has been well marked in all cases, and when the sea-
breeze came on early in the day no negative readings were
obtained ; but when, as happened on several occasions, the
sea-breeze was delayed till late in the afternoon, even then
negative readings continued till the wind veered round. An
important question is, What is the influence of tho clouds of
dust that are usually flying on days when we get negative
readings ? This is a question which I have not yet been able
to answer fully; but certain observations tend to show that
there is an intimate connection between the presence of dust
and the negative electrification of the air. Many observa
tions were made extending over 10 to 20 minutes: and it
was almost invariably found that the negative electrification
was strongest during gusts of dust-laden air. At such times
the potential would often run up so rapidly that it was im
possible to measure it accurately, while during lulls it would
often fall almost to zero. The mere friction of the dry dust
against the match and insulated umbrella would not account
for this ; for the potential began to increase rapidly before
the dust-cloud actually reached tho place of observation.
Again, it was found that higher negative readings were got
when the observations were made on the ground than when
they were made on the roof of a house ; and, further, that in
parts of the town where there was little dust, negative read
ings were rare, and were never very high. Too much stress
must not be laid on this last point, for simultaneous observa
tions could not be carried out at two places, as I had only one
electrometer. A number of observations have been made in
dust with south-easterly and north-easterly winds ; but the
air was never found to be negatively electrified. This
may be explained readily enough as due simply to the
presence of moisture; for one of the earliest facts im
pressed on an experimenter on static electricity in this
part of India is that, however well an electric machine may
work, or a Lej den jar hold its charge, while a westerly wind is
blowing, the moment the wind veers round to the east the
Leyden jar loses its charge almost at once and the electric
machine ceases to act, be it a Holtz, a Voss, or a Wimshurst,
or any other machine warranted to work " in all weathers."
   When the weather becomes sufficiently dry I intend to make
some direct experiments on the action of dust, and on the
height to which the negative electrification extends.

   I have found it impossible, unaided, to carry out a suffi
ciently complete series of observations to get the diurnal curve
during these times of land wind ; but the accompanying dia
gram may be taken as a first approximation to it between the
hours of 6 a.m. and 1 1 p.m. It is prepared from the observa
tions of September 1883 and August and September 1884.

Handbook of Technical Gas-analysis, containing concise Instructions
  for carrying out Gas-analytical Methods of Proved Utility. By
   Clemens Winckleb, Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry at the Frei
   burg Mining Academy. Translated, with a few additions, by
  Geosoe Lunge, Ph.D., Professor of Technical Chemistry at tht
  Federal Polytechnic School, Zurich. Van Voorst. Loudon.
THO those who have, during the last eight or ten years, been under
      the necessity of analyzing the gaseous mixtures from the flues
of regenerative furnaces, and there are many such persons in this
country, the name of Dr. Winckler is favourably known as being
one of the first so to simplify the operations as to render it un
necessary to employ the methods of Bunsen and Kegnault. The
translator is, we think, scarcely aware of the extent to which tech
nical gas-analysis is cultivated in England ; for, in his preface, he
says that " it is now quite usual, at any rate in Germany, to perform
technical gas-analysis, not merely in chemical works, but for testing
the efficiency of steam-boiler furnaces and such purposes. In
England some of these processes have also been introduced ; but
they are not as yet known and appreciated to the same extent
as abroad." It would of course be difficult, if not impossible, to
compare the actual number of analyses made in the two countries ;
but we have no hesitation in saying that Dr. Bantu's process, at all

 462                 Notices respecting New Books.
 events, is well known, thoroughly appreciated, and frequently em
 ployed for analyzing the gases from regenerative furnaces in this
 country.
    In this little work of 125 pages the author has succeeded in con
 densing so large an amount of information that any chemist, even
if previously entirely unaccustomed to the analysis of gaseous mix
 tures, may, with a moderate amount of practice, soon find himself
 in a position to undertake the analysis of flue gases.
    One of the great advantages of the new method is that water is
 made to supersede mercury in the various manipulations ; the
 extent to which this substitution does away with the necessity for
 personal skill in the operator can only be appreciated by those who
 have had to analyze gases by the older processes.
    The author very properly commences by describing the apparatus
employed by him in sampling the gases to be examined, and the
 directions given are so complete as to leave nothing to be desired ;
 on the other hand, a properly educated chemist would never have
 any difficulty in devising a method of withdrawing a portion of gas
 from a flue or chamber, and storing it in a convenient vessel from
 which small quantities could be removed as required. It must be
remembered, however, that the work is intended by the author for
the instruction of students and others who have not previously
acquired skill in gas-analysis. Among the devices described is
 Bonny's automatic aspirator, which he has patented in Germany.
This instrument appears to us to have advantages which will make
it extremely useful under many circumstances. The chapter on
the measurement of gases will be found very useful, especially to
those who are unacquainted with the methods commonly employed
in scientific researches. The author (p. 30) states that "Gas-
meters are never altogether reliable ; but they give serviceable
approximate figures, especially if mprely the number of revolutions
is noticed as shown by the dials, without looking for the absolute
volume of the gas passed." To this we may add that, although the
best gas-meters in this country are very well made, and quite suffi
cient for every technical purpose unconnected with refined analysis,
it is very difficult to adjust even the most expensive ones to a less
error than one third of a per cent, on the total volume of the gas
passed.
   We think the author might with advantage have omitted the
description of his own gas-burette, as it is admitted to have been
superseded by newer and better forms.
   The descriptions of Honigmann's, Bunte's, and Orsat's apparatus
are given clearly ; and the same remark applies to the ingenious gas-
pipettes of Hempel, founded, we believe, on that of Doyere.
   Altogether this is a very valuable little work, and is absolutely
indispensable to every chemist who undertakes the technical analysis
of gases. The author is to be congratulated on the excellence of
the typography and the admirable manner in which the engravings
have been reproduced. For the fidelity of the translation the name
of Dr. Lunge is a sufficient guarantee.

  ON THE SEPARATION OF LIQUID ATMOSPHERIC AIR INTO TWO
              DIFFERENT LIQUIDS. BY S. WROBLEWSKI.
TN my note of April 13, 1885, 1 had occasion to remark that the
     laws of the liquefaction of atmospheric air are not those of
the liquefaction of a simple gas, and that air behaves like a mix
ture the components of which are subject to different laws of
liquefaction. If at first sight liquid air seems to behave in such
fashion that we might speak of the critical point of air, that arises
simply from the slight difference there is between the curves of the
tension of the vapour of oxygen and of nitrogen. Thus we may
designate the pressures between 37 and 41*3 atmospheres and the
temperatures between — 140°-8 and —143° as defining the critical
point of air. The curve of the tensions of air depends, among
other circumstances, on the manner in which the quantity of the
liquid is used for the experiment. Much more does this curve
cease to have any significance when we obtain temperatures of
— 190° C, and especially at still lower temperatures. Thus with
air liquefied under high pressures, and then liberated and exposed
to the pressure of only one atmosphere, the boiling-point rises
gradually from — 191°-4 to — 187° C, and that owing to a change in
the composition of the liquid. As nitrogen evaporates more rapidly
than oxygen, the temperature of the boiling liquid tends towards
— 1810,5 C, which is the boiling-point of pure oxygen.
   Still more striking are the special features shown by air evapo
rated in oxygen, as seen from the following Table :—

   While the tension of the vapours of liquids evaporated by the
pump diminishes steadily, the temperature, as shown in the Table
for equidistant intervals of time, passes through a series of maxima
and minima ; under low pressures it ultimately attains values
which are scarcely higher than those of pure oxygen at the same
pressure. In these conditions the air only contains a very small
quantity of nitrogen.
   But this is not all. Air can give two distinct liquids, different
in appearance and in composition, forming two separate layers

464            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
separated by a perfectly visible meniscus. I have attained this
result by the following method : —Having liquefied at — 142° C.
a certain quantity of air in the tube of the apparatus which I
employ for using permanent gases as cooling mixtures, I allow a
quantity of gaseous air to enter the tube, such that the pressure of
the gas having become equal to 40 centim. and its optical density
equal to that of the liquid, the meniscus entirely disappears, after
which I slowly lessen the pressure ; the moment the manometer
indicates a pressure of about 37"6 atmospheres, I see that a new
meniscus forms at a point in the tube much higher than the place
previously occupied by the vanished meniscus. A few minutes after
wards the first meniscus reappears at the place at which we had
seen it disappear, and at the same moment two liquids are distinctly
seen, different in character, one on the top of the other. The
two liquids remain separated for several seconds. After this a
current of very small bubbles forms, which ascend, detaching them
selves from the meniscus which separates the two liquids. Ia
consequence of this phenomenon the upper liquid becomes a little
 opaque ; the meniscus, gradually destroyed by the current, ulti
 mately disappears altogether, and the last result is a single liquid
 homogeneous in appearance. *
    By means of a small metal tube introduced into the apparatus
 I have been able, without destroying the meniscus, to take at will
 either from the bottom or top layer a quantity of liquid sufficient
 for analysis. While the lower liquid contains 21-28 to 21-5 of
 oxygen, the upper one only contained 17-3 to 18-7.
    This experiment is of great importance in the theory of the
 critical state of gases. It shows in fact, contrary to the assertion
 made some years ago by certain physicists, that the disappear
 ance of the meniscus of a liquid, when it is obtained by increasing
 the pressure exerted by a gas on a superposed liquid, does not effect
 a solution of the liquid in the gas. — Comptes Rendus, Sept. 28, 1885.
  ON THB SOURCE OF THE HYDROGEN OCCLUDED BY ZINC DUST.
                     BY GREV1LLE WILLIAMS, F.R.S.
    In my paper " On the Synthesis of Trimethylamine and Pyrrol
 from Coal-Gas, and on the Occlusion of Hydrogen by Zinc Dust,"t
 I showed that, under certain conditions, zinc dust behaved towards
 hydrogen like palladium ; and I inferred, from the phenomena
 observed, that the zinc dust occluded hydrogen at ordinary tempe
 ratures, and gave it off in an active condition when heated. In my
 second paper, " Note on the Occlusion of Hydrogen by Zinc Dust
 and the Meteoric Iron of Lenarto " $, I gave the results of determi-
    • In this experiment air, which is a completely colourless liquid, shows
 moreover a singularly enigmatical optical phenomenon, which immedi
 ately precedes the appearance of the upper meniscus. The part of this
 tube where the meniscus should form, assumes a feebly orange coloration,
 which disappears the moment the meniscus appears. A like phenomenon
 never precedes the appearance of the lower meniscus, which separates the
 two liquids.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           465
nations of the amount occluded in the dust by direct heating, and
also by combustion with cupric oxide. I likewise made the sugges
tion that the hydrogen, in the cases both of the dust and the meteor
ite, had probably been originally derived from water, and not neces
sarily, in the latter case, from the meteorite having at one time
been exposed to an atmosphere of hydrogen at a high pressure.
The present paper is to be regarded as a study of the effect of
water, in the forms of liquid and vapour, upon the amount of
hydrogen occluded. As my later determinations were made on a
fresh specimen of the commercial dust, I considered it necessary,
in the first place, to determine the volume of the hydrogen con
tained in it. In the course of the experiments it was found, on
leaving the apparatus to repose after the hydrogen had been ex
pelled, that the volume of the mixture of gas and air in the
measuring-tube gradually diminished ; and this is one cause of
the variations in the amounts obtained in the earlier experiments.
Variations in the volumes are also caused by differences in the tem
peratures to which the retorts containing the zinc dust are exposed ;
and, at an early stage of the experiments detailed in this paper, I
was led to finally abandon the use of soft glass in favour of retorts
made from combustion-tubing.
     Determination of the Hydrogen contained in a Fresh Sample of
                             the Zinc Dust.
    Experiment 1.—6"4790 grammes of a fresh sample of zinc dust
were heated in a soft glass retort to as high a temperature as it
would bear. The arrangements were precisely the same as in the
experiments detailed in my second paper. The reason why 1 con
tinued to use 6*4790 grammes (100 grains) was because this amount
had been previously found to occupy the volume of one cubic cen-
tim. All volumes are reduced to a temperature of 60° Fahr. (15°-55
 C.) and a pressure of 30 inches of mercury ; and a correction is
made for the volume of that portion of the exit tube of the retort
which enters the measuring-apparatus. The graduated tube before
the experiment contained 46-8 cubic centim. of air. After the
apparatus had cooled to the atmospheric temperature, the volume
was found to be 78 cubic centim. This gives 31-2 cubic centim.
for the hydrogen expelled from 1 cubic centim. of the zinc dust
at the temperature at which the experiment was made. This is
the lowest result yet obtained, and was doubtless due to insufficient
heating.
    Experiment II.—In this experiment 6-4790 grammes were
heated in a horizontal retort made from hard combustion-tubing.
The air in the measuring-tube before heating amounted to 7"3 cubic
 centim. After heating and subsequent cooling to atmospheric
temperature the volume was 44-1 cubic centim. ; after deducting
the air we have 36-8 cubic centim. from 1 cubic centim. of zinc
 dust. This result approximates pretty closely to the experiment
 in ray second paper, which gave 37-5 cubic centim.
    Experiment III.—In this experiment the utmost heat of the lamp
 was continued for a long time —until, in fact, there was no indica

  466            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  tion of any trace of gas being expelled ; and the volume was read
  off directly the retort had cooled to the temperature of the labora
  tory, thus preventing reabsorption. The hydrogen after all correc
  tions amounted to 46*4 cubic centim.
     Experiment IV.—in a fourth experiment, made like the last,
  47*4 cubic centim. were obtained.
     "We now have the following values for the volumes of hydrogen
 expelled from the new sample of commercial zinc dust :—

     The volume in the last experiment is the largest lhave been able
 to obtain, and shows that ordinary commercial zinc dust may
 contain nearly fifty times its volume of hydrogen.
         Effect of Wetting on the Amount of Hydrogen Occluded.
     Experiment I.—I took the usual amount of zinc dust (6*4790
 grammes) and thoroughly wetted it with boiling water. On drying
 it in the water-oven until the weight was constant it was found to
 have increased by 0*1924 gramme. The retort was then charged
 with 6*4790 grammes of the dried dust, and heated in a retort
 made from combustion-tubing. The air in the measuring-tube
 before the experiment amounted to 3*9 cubic centim. The volume
 of hydrogen evolved, after deducting the air and making all correc
 tions, amounted to 89-4 cubic centim., or 42 cubic centim. more
 thau in the highest result obtained from unwetted zinc dust. This
 very large increase in the yield of hydrogen as compared with any
 of the experiments made with the original zinc dust points very
 clearly to the source whence it was obtained, and strongly tends to
 confirm the view thrown out in my second paper, that this source
 was water. It was again found in this experiment that it required
 the highest heat of the lamp to drive off the last traces of hydro
gen, and it was observed that during the operation a certain amount
of water was produced. On keeping the apparatus in the state in
which it was left after the experiment, it was found that the volume
of the gas and air in the measuring-tube became less day by day,
until, at the expiration of a fortnight, it only measured 80-4 cubic
centim. The absorption therefore amounted to 9 cubic centim.
As the air in the measuring-tube only amounted to 3-9 cubic cen
tim., it became evident that the absorption was chiefly, if not
entirety, due to hydrogen. So that we have now conclusive proof
that zinc dust, in addition to taking up water and giving up its
hydrogen on heating, absorbs this gas at ordinary temperatures
when surrounded by it in a moist condition, thus confirming the
conclusion arrived at in my first paper from the phenomena ob
served during the synthesis of trimethylamine. Whether it absorbs
the gas when it is in an anhydrous state I propose to determine
later on.
    Experiment 11.—In a second experiment 6*4790 grammes of tho

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.         467
dust, on being saturated with boiling water and then dried in the
water-oven until the weight was constant, gave an increase of
0*1561, or 0-0363 gramme less than in the first experiment. I
then subjected 6-4790 grammes to a dull red heat ; and the result
ing gas, in two hours after the operation, measured when all correc
tions were made, gave 89 cubic centim., or 8*4 cubic centim. more
than in the last experiment. The two highest experiments with
unwetted zinc dust gave 46-4 cubic centim. and 47-4 cubic centim.,
the mean being 46-9. The two with wetted zinc dust gave 89-4
and 89 cubic centim. The mean of these is 89-2, or only 4-6 cubic
centim. less than double the amount from unwetted zinc dust.
   It is proper to notice that the increase of weight of the zinc
dust on wetting and subsequent drying in the first experiment was
0-1924 gramme, and in the second 0-1561 gramme. The mean of
these is 0-1742. Now, if 10 atoms of zinc (65-3 x 10) had fixed 1
molecule of water, the increase would be 0-1785—a number so near
to the mean of the experiments as probably not to be entirely with
out meaning ; but, on the other hand, I have not yet had time to
analyze the zinc dust, which, of course, cannot be taken as repre
senting even moderately pure zinc.
        Effect of Exposure of Zinc Dust to a Moist Atmosphere.
   Having shown that the wetted dust after drying gives off nearly
double as much hydrogen as was evolved from it in the condition
in which it was received, it became important to know how the
hydrogen had been occluded by the dust which had not been
wetted. It has long been known that shippers are unwilling to
carry large quantities of zinc dust in their vessels, owing to the
danger of its getting wetted, in which case it becomes heated to an
extent which may become dangerotis. It being, therefore, extremely
improbable, that the specimens with which I worked had ever been
wetted, or even rendered damp purposely, it struck me that it had
probably absorbed moisture from the atmosphere. This would per
fectly account for the presence of hydrogen in the commercial
product ; and, owing to its being kept closely packed, for the
amount being small as compared with that contained in the dust
which had been thoroughly wetted. To determine the question I
placed 6-4790 grammes in a watch-glass over a vessel containing
water, the whole being th >n covered by a bell-glass. The apparatus
was kept in a room having a nearly constant temperature of about
72° Fahr. It was weighed almost every day from the commence
ment of the experiment (Aug. 6) until the 17th of September, by
which time it had ceased to increase. It was found that for the
first fourteen days it gained about 3 centigrammes a day ; the next
fourteen days the increase fell to about 1\ centigrammes a day ;
and after this it gradually diminished, and at last entirely ceased.
It was then dried in the water-oven until the weight became
constant. The substance which had caked together was then
pulverized and taken for the following experiments.
   Experiment I.—One quarter of the usual amount, namely 1-6198
grammes, was heated in a similar manner to the previous experi

 merits. The corrected volume of hydrogen was 85-3 cubic centim.,
 which multiplied by 4 gives no less than 341-2 cubic centim. of
 hydrogen from 6-4790 grammes. This is about seven times the
 amount afforded by the original dust, and 3-8 times more than the
 mean of the results obtained with the dust which had been wetted.
    Experiment II.—In this experiment, in which the full heat of a
 strong Bunsen flame was kept until the volume of hydrogen ceased
 perceptibly to increase, 907 cubic centim. of hydrogen were ob
 tained from 1-6198 grammes, or 362-8 cubic centim. from 6-4790
 gramines=100 grains.
    The above results confirm in the strongest manner the views I
 had entertained as to the source of the hydrogen in zinc dust, and
 conclusively show that exposure to a moist atmosphere at a mode
 rate temperature is eminently favourable to the condensation of the
 hydrogen. It is not improbable that, by suitably modifying the
 conditions, this amount may be exceeded. As zinc dust thus
 charged with hydrogen can hardly fail to become an important
 chemical reagent, I shall endeavour to determine the maximum
 amount that can be occluded, and the ratio to the amount of
 metallic zinc present.—Journal of Gas Lighting, Oct. 13, 1S85.
        ON TWO NEW TYPES OF CONDENSING HYGROMETERS.
                            BY M. G. SIRE.
    The accuracy of condensing hygrometers is known to depend on
 the exactitude with which we observe the temperature of the
 surface on which dew is deposited as well as on the more or less
 distinct perception of this deposit.
    I have succeeded in rendering thrse determinations very distinct
 by observing the deposit of aqueous vapour on a cylindrical or a
 plane brilliant surface, which gives rise to two new types of con
 densing hygrometer, where the fall of temperature is produced by
 the evaporation of ether in which is a thermometer.
    The reservoir of the first type consists of a cylindrical tube of
 thin polished metal, the ends of which are insulated in the interior
 by two pieces of ebonite, so that the volatile liquid is only in con
tact with the metal side by a middle zone of about 1 centim. in
height. On this zone the dew is deposited ; it shows itself by a
whitish ring which appears at half the height of the reservoir.
   The reservoir of the second is entirely of ebonite ; it is traversed
laterally by a circular aperture closed by a thin metal disk, polished
on the inside. On the part of this disk which closes the aperture
the dew is deposited, forming a dull white circle in the centre ;
under a certain angle the disk appears of a pure black.
   The bright surfaces are obtained by an electrochemical deposit
of palladium ; the black polish of this metal reveals the slightest
traces of condensation.
   The essential character of these hygrometers is that the deposit
is made in the centre of a brilliant metal surface without a break.
On the other hand, the agitation of the liquid and the thinness of
the sides ensures perfect equality of the two parts in each instru
ment. — Cornptes Jiendus, Sept. 28, 1885.

LVII. On the Dilatancy of Media composed ofRigid Particles
    in Contact. With Experimental Illustrations. By Professor
    Osborne Reynolds, LL.D., F.R.S.*
                                [Plate X.]
IDEAL rigid particles have been used in almost all attempts
       to build fundamental dynamical hypotheses of matter :
these particles have generally been supposed smooth.
    Actual media composed of approximately rigid particles
exist in the shape of sand, shingle, grain, and piles of shot ; all
which media are influenced by friction between the particles.
    The dynamical properties of media composed of ideal smooth
particles in a high state of agitation have formed the subject
 of very long and successful investigations, resulting in the
 dynamical theory of fluids. Also the limiting conditions of
 equilibrium of such media as sand have been made the subject
 of theoretical treatment by the aid of certain assumptions.
    These investigations, however, by no means constitute a
 complete theory of granular masses ; nor does it appear that
any attempts have been made to investigate the dynamical
Eroperties of a medium consisting of smooth hard particles,
  eld in contact by forces transmitted through the medium.
 It has sometimes been assumed that such a medium would
Eossess the properties of a liquid, although in the molecular
  ypothesis of liquids now accepted the particles are assumed
to be in a high state of motion, holding each other apart by

  470     Prof. Osborne Reynolds on the Dilatancy of Media
  collisions ; such motion being rendered necessary to account
  for the property of diffusion.
     Without attempting anything like a complete dynamical
  theory* which will require a large development of mathema
  tics, i would point out the existence of a singular fundamental
  property of such granular media which is not possessed by
  known fluids or solids. On perceiving something which
  resembles nothing within the limits of one's knowledge, a
  name is a matter of great difficulty. I have called this unique
  property of granular masses " dilatancy," because the property
  consists in a definite change of bulk, consequent on a definite
  change of shape or distorlional strain, any disturbance what
  ever causing a change of volume and generally dilation.
     In the case of fluids, volume and shape are perfectly inde
  pendent ; and although in practice it is often difficult to alter
  the shape of an elastic body without altering its volume, yet
 the properties of dilation and distortion are essentially distinct,
 and are so considered in the theory of elasticity. In fact
  there are very few solid bodies which are to any extent dila
 table at all.
     With granular media, the grains being sensibly hard, the
 case is, according to the results I have obtained, entirely dif
 ferent. So long as the grains are held in mutual equilibrium
 by stresses transmitted through the mass, every change of
 relative position of the grains is attended by a consequent
 change of volume ; and if in any way the volume be fixed,
 then all change of shape is prevented.
    In speaking of a granular medium, it is assumed to be in
 such a condition that the position of any internal particle
 becomes fixed when the positions of the surrounding particles
are fixed.
    This condition is very generally fulfilled, but not always
 where there is friction ; without friction it would be always
 fulfilled.
    From this assumption it at once follows that no grain in
the interior can change its position in the mass by passing
between the contiguous grains without disturbing these;
hence, whatever alterations the medium may undergo, the
same particle will always be in the same neighbourhood.
    If, then, the medium is subject to an internal strain, the
shapes of the internal groups of molecules will all be altered,
the shape of each elementary group being determined by the
shape of the surrounding particles. This will be rendered
most intelligible by considering instances ; that of equal
spheres is the most general, and presents least difficulty.
   A group of such spheres being arranged in such a manner

              composed of Rigid Particles in Contact.         471
that, if the external spheres are fixed, the internal ones cannot
move, any distortion of the boundaries will cause an alteration
of the mean density, depending on the distortion and the
arrangement of the spheres. For example :—
    If arranged as a pile of shot (Plate X. fig. 2), which is an
arrangement of tetrahedra and octahedra, the density of the
            1 it
media is          taking the density of the sphere as unity.
    If arranged in a cubical formation, as in fig. 1, the density
¦ IT
is g, or </2 times less than in the former case.
    These arrangements are both controlled by the bounding
spheres ; and in either case the distortion necessitates a change
of volume.
    Either of these forms can be changed into the other by
 changing the shape of the bounding surface.
    In both these cases the structure of the group is crystalline,
 but that is on account of the plane boundaries.
    Practically, when the boundaries are not plane, or when
the grains are of various sizes or shapes, such media consist
of more or less crystalline groups having their axes in different
 directions, so that their mean condition is amorphous.
    The dilation consequent on any distortion for a crystalline
 group may be definitely expressed. When the mean condition
 is amorphous, it becomes difficult to ascertain definitely what
 the relations between distortion and dilation are. But if,
 when at maximum density, the mean condition is not only
 amorphous but isotropic, a natural assumption seems to be that
 any small contraction from the condition of maximum density
 in one direction means an equal extension in two others at
 right angles.
    As such a contraction in one direction continues, the con
 dition of the medium ceases to be isotropic, and the relation
 changes until dilation ceases. Then a minimum density is
 reached ; after this, further contraction in the same direction
 causes a contraction of volume, which continues until a
 maximum density is reached. Such a relation between the
 contraction in one direction and the consequent dilation would
 be expressed by
                           c-I^a /Sin2";
                                   v       el
 e being the coefficient of dilation, a that of contraction, and
 «i the maximum dilation ; the +ve root only to be taken.
     The amorphous condition of minimum volume is a very
 stable condition ; but there would be a direct relation between
                              2L 2

472     Prof. Osborne Reynolds on the Dilataney of Media
the strains and stresses in any other condition if the particles
were frictionless and rigid.
   If the particles were rigid the medium would be absolutely
without resilience, and hence the only energy of which it would
be susceptible would be kinetic energy ; so that, supposing
the motion slow, the work done upon any group in distorting
it would be zero. Thus, supposing a contraction in one direc
tion and expansion at right angles, then if px be the stress in
the direction of contraction, and ps, p„ the stress at right
angles, a being the contraction, b and c expansions,
                        p*a +pyb +psC = 0 ;
or, supposing b = c, pt=Pz,
                        pja-\-py{a + c)=0.
With friction the relation will be different ; the friction always
opposes strain, i. e. tends to give stability.
   It is a very difficult question to say exactly what part fric

where <j) is the angle of repose, we cannot assume that tan <f>
has any relation to the actual friction between the molecules.
   The extreme value of 0 is a matter of arrangement ; as in
the case of shot, which would pile equally well although
without friction.
    Supposing the grains rigid, the relations between distortion
and dilation are independent of friction ; that is to say, the
same distortion of any bounding surfaces must mean the same
internal distortion whatever the friction may be.
   The only possible effect of friction would be to render the
grains stable under circumstances under which they would
not otherwise be stable ; and hence we might with friction be
able to bring about an alteration of the boundaries other than
the alteration possible without friction ; and thus we might
possibly obtain a dilation due to friction. How far this is the
case can be best ascertained by experiment.
    In the case of a granular medium, friction may always be
 relaxed by relieving the mass of stress, and any stability due
 to this cause would be shown by shaking the mass when in a
condition of no stress.
    But before applying this test, it is necessary to make per
fectly sure that during the shaking the boundary spheres do
not change position.
    Another test of the effect of friction is by comparing the

              composed of Rigid Particles in Contact.         473
relative dilation and distortion with different degrees of fric
tion. If the dilation were in any sense a consequence of
friction, it would be greater when the coefficient of friction
between the spheres was greater. Where the granular mass
is bounded by solid surfaces, the friction of the grains against
these surfaces will considerably modify the results.
   The problem presented by frictionless balls is much simpler
than that presented in the case of friction. In the former
case the theoretical problem may be attacked with some hope
of success. With friction the property is most easily studied
by experiment.
   As a matter of fact, if we take means to measure the volume
of a mass of solid grains more or less approximately spheres,
the property of dilatancy is evident enough, and its effects
are very striking, affording an explanation of many well-
known phenomena.
   If we have in a canvas bag any hard grains or balls, so
long as the bag is not nearly full it will change its shape as it
is moved about ; but when the sack is approximately full a
small change of shape causes it to become perfectly hard.
There is perhaps nothing surprising in this, even apart from
familiarity ; because an inextonsible sack has a rigid shape
when extended to the full, any deformation diminishing its
capacity, so that contents which did not fill the sack at its
greatest extension fill it when deformed. On careful conside
ration, however, many curious questions present themselves.
    If, instead of a canvas bag, we have an extremely flexible
 bag of india-rubber, this envelope, when filled with heavy
 spheres (No. 6 shot), imposes no sensible restraint on their
distortion ; standing on the table it takes nearly the form of a
 heap of shot. This is apparently accounted for by the fact
 that the capacity of the bag does not diminish as it is deformed.
 In this condition it really shows us less of the qualities of its
 granular contents than the canvas bag. But as it is imper
 vious to fluid, it will enable me to measure exactly the volume
 of its contents.
    Filling up the interstices between the shot with water so
that the bag is quite full of water and shot, no bubble of air
in it, and carefully closing the mouth, I now find that the bag
has become absolutely rigid in whatever form it happened to
be when closed.
    It is clear that the envelope now imposes no distortional
constraint on the shot within it, nor does the water. What,
 then, converts the heap of loose shot into an absolutely rigid
 body ? Clearly the limit which is imposed on the volume by
the pressure of the atmosphere.

474     Prof. Osborne Reynolds on the Dilatancy of Media
   So long as the arrangement of the shot is such that there is
enough water to fill the interstices the shot are free, but any
arrangement which requires more room is absolutely prevented
by the pressure of the atmosphere.
   If there is an excess of water in the bag when the shot are
in their maximum density, the bag will change its shape quite
freely for a limited extent, but then becomes instantly rigid,
supporting 56 lb. without further change. By connecting
the bag with a graduated vessel of water so that the quantity
which flows in and out can be measured, the bag again becomes
susceptible of any amount of distortion.
    Getting the bag into a spherical form and its contents at
maximum density, and then squeezing it between two planes,
the moment the squeezing begins the water begins to flow in,
and flows in at a diminishing rate until it ceases to draw more
water.
   The material in the bag is in a condition of minimum den
sity under the circumstances. This does not mean that all
the parts are in a condition of minimum density because the
distortion is not the same in all the parts ; but some parts
have passed through the condition of maximum while others
have not reached it, so that on further distortion the dilations
of the latter balance the contractions of the former. If we
Continue to squeeze, water begins to flow out until about half as
much has run out as came in ; then again it begins to flow in.
We cannot by squeezing get it back into a condition of uni
form maximum density, because the strain is not homogeneous.
This is just what would occur if the shot were frictionless ; so
that it is not surprising to find that, using oil instead of water,
or, better (on account of the india-rubber), a strong solution
of soap and water, which greatly diminishes the friction, the
results are not altered.
    On measuring the quantities of water, we find that the
greatest quantity drawn in is about 10 percent, of the volume
of the bag ; this is about one third of the difference between
the volumes of the shot at minimum and maximum density.
                   : 1, or 30 per cent, of the latter.
On easing the bag it might be supposed that the shot would
return to their initial condition. But that does not follow :
the elasticity of form of the bag is so slight compared with
its elasticity of volume, that restitution will only take place as
long as it is accompanied with contraction of volume.
   So long as the point of maximum volume has not been

              composed ofRigid Particles in Contact.         475
reached, approximate restitution follows quite as nearly as
could be expected, considering that friction opposes restitution.
But when the squeezing has been carried past the point of
maximum volume, then restitution requires expansion j and
this the elasticity of shape is not equal to accomplish, so that
the bag retains its flattened condition. This experiment has
been varied in a great variety of ways.
   The veiy finest quartz sand, or glass balls | inch in dia
meter, all give the same results. Sand is, on the whole, the
most convenient material, and its extreme fineness reduces any
effect of the squeezing of the india-rubber between the inter
stices of the balls at the boundaries ; which effect is very
apparent with the balloon bags, and shot as large as No. 6.
   A well-marked phenomenon receives its explanation at once
from the existence of dilatancy in sand. When the falling
tide leaves the sand firm, as the foot falls on it the sand
whitens, or appears momentarily to dry round the foot.
When this happens the sand is full of water, the surface
of which is kept up to that of the sand by capillary attrac
tion ; the pressure of the foot causing dilation of the sand,
more water is required, which has to be obtained either
by depressing the level of the surface against the capillary
attraction, or by drawing water through the interstices of
the surrounding sand. This latter requires time to accom
plish, so that for the moment the capillary forces are overcome ;
the surface of the water is lowered below that of the sand,
leaving the latter white or dryer until a sufficient supply has
been obtained from below, when the surface rises and wets
the sand again. On raising the foot it is generally seen that
the sand under the foot and around becomes momentarily
wet ; this is because, on the distorting forces being removed,
the sand again contracts, and the excess of water finds
momentary relief at the surface.
   Leaving out of account the effect of friction between the
balls and the envelope, the results obtained with actual balls,
as regards the relation between distortion and dilation, appear
to be the same as would follow if the balls were smooth.
   The friction at the boundaries is not important as long as
the strain over the boundaries is homogeneous, and particu
larly if the balls indent themselves into the boundaries, as
they do in the case of india-rubber. But with a plane surface
the balls at the boundaries are in another condition from the
balls within. The layer of balls at the surface can only vary
its density from 2/v3to 1. This means that the layer of
balls at a surface can slide between that surface and the adja
cent layer, causing much less dilation than would be caused

476     Prof. Osborne Reynolds on the Dilatancy of Media
by the sliding of an internal layer within the mass. Hence
where two parts of the mass are connected by such a surface,
certain conditions of strain of the boundaries may be accommo
dated by a continuous stream of balls adjacent to the surface.
This fact made itself evident in two very different experiments.
   In order to examine the formation which the shot went
through, an ordinary glass funnel was filled with shot and oil,
and held vertical while more shot were forced up the spout
of the funnel. It was expected that the shot in the funnel
would rife as a body, expanding laterally so as to keep the
funnel full. This seems to have been the effect at the com
mencement of the experiment ; but after a small quantity had
passed up it appeared, looking at the side of the funnel, that
the shot were rising much too fast, for which, on looking into
the top of the funnel, the reason became apparent. A sheet
of shot adjacent to the funnel were rising steadily all round,
leaving the interior shot at the same level with only a slight
disturbance.
   In another experiment one india-rubber bag was filled with
sand and water ; at the centre of this ball was another much
smaller ball, communicating through the sides of the outer
envelope by means of a glass pipe with an hydraulic pump.
It was expected that, on expanding the interior ball by water,
the sand in the outer ball w^ould dilate, expanding the outer
ball and drawing more water into the intervening sand. This
it did, but not to the extent expected. It was then observed
that the outer envelope, instead of expanding, generally bulged
in the immediate neighbourhood of the point where the glass
tube passed through it ; showing that this tube acted as a
conductor for the sand from the immediate neighbourhood of
the interior ball to the outer envelope, just as the glass sides
of the funnel had acted for the shot.
   As regards any results which may be expected to follow
from the recognition of this property of dilatancy,—
   In a practical point of view, it will place the theory of earth-
pressures on a true foundation. But inasmuch as the present
theory is founded on the angle of repose, which is certainly
not altered by the recognition of dilatancy, its effect will be
mainly to show the real reason for the angle of repose.
   The greatest results are likely to follow in philosophy, and
it was with a view to these results that the investigation was
undertaken.
   The recognition of this property of dilatancy places a
hitherto unrecognized mechanical contrivance at the com
mand of those who would explain the fundamental arrange
ment of the universe, and one which, so far as I have been

            composed of Rigid Particles in Contact.         477
able to look into it, seems to promise great things, besides
possessing the inherent advantage of extreme simplicity.
   Hitherto no medium has ever been suggested which would
cause a statical force of attraction between two bodies at a
distance. Such attraction would be caused by granular media
in virtue of this dilatancy and stress. More than this, when
two bodies in a granular medium under stress are near
together, the effect of dilatancy is to cause forces between the
bodies in very striking accordance with those necessary to
explain coherence of matter.
   Suppose an outer envelope of sufficiently large extent, at
first not absolutely rigid, filled with granular media, at its
maximum density. Suppose one of the grains of the media
commences to grow into a larger sphere ; as it grows, the
surrounding medium will be pushed outwards radially from
the centre of the expanding sphere. Considering spherical
envelopes following the grains of the medium, these will ex
pand as the grains move outwards. This fixes the distortion
of the medium, which must be contraction along the radii,
and expansion along all tangents.
   The consequent amount of dilation depends on the relation
of distortion and dilation, and on the arrangement of the
grains in the medium. At first the entire medium will un
dergo dilation, which will diminish as the distance from the
centre increases. As the expansion goes on, the medium
immediately adjacent to the sphere will first arrive at a con
dition of minimum density ; and for further expansion this
will be returning to a maximum density, while that a little
further away will have reached a minimum. The "effect of
continued growth will therefore be to institute concentric
undulations of density from maximum to minimum density,
which will move outwards ; so that after considerable growth
the sphere will be surrounded with a series of envelopes of
alternately maximum and minimum density, the medium at
a great distance being at maximum density. At a definite
distance from the centre of the sphere not more than
                             1.4R,
where R is the radius of the sphere, the density will be a
minimum, and between this and the sphere there may be a
number of alternations depending on the relative diameters of
the grains and the spheres.
   The distance between these alternations will diminish rapidly
as the sphere is approached. The distance of the next maxi
mum is 1 . 2 R, the next minimum is given by 1 . 09 R, and
the next maximum 1 . 06 R.

478     Prof. Osborne Reynolds on the Dilatancy of Media
   The general condition of the medium around a sphere which
has expanded in the medium is shown in Plate X. fig. 3,
which has been arrived at on the supposition that the sphere
is large compared with the grains.
    From a radius about 1 . 411 outwards the density gradually
increases, reaching a maximum density at infinity ; and at all
distances greater than 1 . 811 the law is expressed by
                             de=l
                             dr ~ r"'
where n has some value greater than 3 depending on the
structure of the medium.
    Within the distance 1 .4R the variation is periodic, with a
rapidly diminishing period. In this condition, supposing the
medium of unlimited extent and the sphere smooth, the sphere
may move without causing further expansion, merely changing
the position of the distortion in the medium ; for the grains,
slipping over the sphere, would come back to their original
positions. It thus appears that smooth bodies would move
without resistance if the relation between the size of the grains
and bodies is such that the energy due to the relative motion
of the grains in immediate proximity may be neglected.
The kinetic energy of the motion of the medium would be
proportional to the volume of the ball multiplied by the density
of the medium and the square of the velocity.
    But the momentum might be infinite supposing the medium
infinite in extent, in which case a single sphere would be
held rigidly fixed.
    If we suppose two balls to expand instead of one, and sup
pose the distortion of the medium for one ball to be the same
as if the other were not there, the result will be a compound
distortion. Since, however, the dilation does not bear a linear
 relation to the distortion, the dilation resulting from the com
pound distortion will not be the sum of the dilations for the
separate distortions unless we neglect the squares and products
 of the distortions as small.
    Supposing the bodies so far apart that one or other of the
 separate distortions caused at any point is small, then, retaining
squares and products, it appears that the resultant dilation at
 any point will be less than the sum of the separate dilations
 by quantities which are proportional to the products of the
 separate distortions.
    The integrals of these terms through the space bounded by
 spheres of radii R and L are expressed by finite terms, and
 terms inversely proportional to L, which latter vanish if L is

              composed of Rigid Particles in Contact.         479
infinite. Thus, while the total separate dilations are infinite,
the compound dilations differ from the sum of the separates
by finite terms, and these are functions of the product of the
volumes and the reciprocal of the distance.
   Assuming stress in the medium, the difference in the value
of these finite terms for two relative positions of the bodies
multiplied by the stresses, represents an amount of work which
must bo done by the bodies on the medium in moving from
one position to another.
    To get rid of the difficulty of infinite extent of medium, if
for the moment we assume the envelope sufficiently large and
imposing a normal pressure upon the medium, then, since the
work done will be proportional to the dilation, the force be
tween the bodies will be proportional to the rate at which
this dilation varies with the distance between them.
    The force between the bodies would depend on the cha
racter of the elasticity as well as on the dilation.
    It is not necessary to assume the outer envelope elastic; this
may be absolutely rigid and one or both the balls elastic.
    In such case the two balls are connected by a definite
kinematic relation. As they approach they must expand,
 doing work which is spent in producing energy of motion ;
 as they recede, the kinetic energy is spent in the work of com
 pressing the balls.
    As already stated, the momentum of the infinite medium
 for a single ball in finite motion may be infinite, and propor
 tional to the product of the volume of' the ball by the velocity ;
 but with two balls moving in opposite directions, with velo
 cities inversely as the masses, the momentum of the system
 is zero. Therefore such motion may be the only motion
 possible in a medium of infinite extent.
    When the distance between the balls is of the same order
 as their dimensions, the law of attraction changes with the
 law of the compound dilations and becomes periodic, corre
 sponding to the undulations of density surrounding the balls.
 Thus, before actual contact were reached, the balls would
 suffer alternate repulsion and attraction, with positions of
 equilibrium more or less stable between, as shown in figs. 4
 and 5 (PI. X.).
    We have thus a possible explanation of the cohesion and
 chemical combination of molecules, which I think is far more
 in accordance with actual experience than anything hitherto
 suggested.
    It was the observation of these envelopes of maximum and
 minimum density which led me to look more fully into the
 property of dilatancy.

 480     Prof. Osborne Reynolds on the Dilatancy of Media.
    The assumed elasticity of the surrounding envelope, or of
 the balls, has only been introduced to make the argument clear.
    The medium itself may be supposed to possess kinetic
 elasticity arising from internal distortional motion, such as
 would arise from the transmission of waves in which the
 motion of the medium is in the plane of their fronts.
    The fitness of a dilatant medium to transmit such waves is
 only less striking than its property of causing attraction,
 because in the first respect it is not unique.
    But as far as I can see such transmission is not possible in
 a medium composed of uniform grains. If, however, we have
 comparatively large grains uniformly interspersed, then such
 transmission becomes possible. If, notwithstanding the large
 grains, the medium is at maximum density, the large grains
 will not be free to move without causing further dilation; and
 it seems that the medium would transmit distortional vibra
 tions in which the distortions of the two sets of grains are
opposite.
    Such waves, although the motion would be essentially in
 the plane of the wave, would cause dilation, just as waves in a
 chain cause contraction in the reach of the chain. They
 would in fact impart elasticity, to the medium, exactly as,
 in the case of a slack chain having its ends fixed but other
 wise not subject to forces, any lateral motion imparted to the
chain will cause tension proportional to the energy of distur
bance divided by the slackness or free length of chain.
    Distortional waves therefore, travelling through dilatant
material which does not quite occupy the space in which it is
 confined when at maximum density, would render the medium
uniformly elastic to distortion, but not in the same degree to
compression or extension. The tension caused by such waves
would depend on the gross energy of motion of the waves
divided by the total dilation from maximum density conse
quent on the wave-motion. All such waves, whatever might
be their length, would therefore move with the same velocity.
    If, when rendered elastic by such waves, the medium were
thrown into a state of distortion by some external cause, this
would diminish the possible dilation caused by the waves.
Thus work would have to be done on the medium in producing
the external distortion which would be spent in increasing
the energy of the waves. For instance, the separation of two
bodies in such a medium, which, as already shown, would in
crease the statical distortion, would increase the energy of
the waves and vice versa.
    As far as the integrations have been carried for this con
dition of elasticity, it appears, with a certain arrangement of

                    On the Refraction of Fluorine.             481
large and small grains, that the forces between the bodies
 would be proportional to the product of the volumes divided
by the square of the distance ; i. e. that the state of stress of
the medium may be the same as Maxwell has shown must
 exist in the aether to account for gravity. We have thus an
instance of a medium transmitting waves similar to heat-waves
and causing force between bodies similar to the forces of gra
vitation and cohesion, in such a manner as to constitute a con
servative system. More than this, by the separation of the two
sets of grains, there would result phenomena similar to those
 resulting from the separation of the two electricities. The
observed conducting power of a continuous surface for the
grains of a medium closely resembles the conduction of elec
tricity. And such a composite medium would be susceptible
of a state in which the arrangement of the two sets of grains
were thrown into opposite distortions, which state, so far as it
has yet been examined, appears to coincide with the state of
a medium necessary to explain electrodynamic and magnetic
 phenomena according to Maxwell's theory.
    In this short sketch of the results which it appears to me
may follow from the recognition of the property of dilatancy,
I have not attempted to follow the exact reasoning even so
far as I have carried it.
    In the preliminary acceptance of a theory the mind must
be guided rather by a general view of its adaptability than
by its definite accordance with some out of many observed
facts. And as it seems, after a preliminary investigation, that
in space filled with discrete particles, endowed with rigidity,
smoothness, and inertia, the property of dilatancy would cause
amongst other bodies not only one property but all the fun
damental properties of matter, I have, in pointing out the
existence of dilatancy, ventured to call attention to this
dilatant or kinematic theory of aether without waiting for the
completion of the definite integrations, which must take long,
although it is by these that the fitness of the hypotheses
must be eventually tested.
              LVIII. On the Refraction of Fluorine.
                  By George Gladstone, F.C.S.*
IN his paper on the Refraction-Equivalents of the Elements,
      published in the Phil. Trans, of 1869, Dr. Gladstone
estimated the equivalent of fluorine at 1'45, from the results
   * Communicated by the Author, haviDg been read at the Meeting of
the British Association at Aberdeen, September 1885.

482                  Mr. G. Gladstone on tlie
of an observation taken of a solution of fluoride of potassium.
He gave it, however, with all reserve, remarking at the same
time that " fluor-spar and kryolite gave very small values for
fluorine, or rather indicate that this body has scarcely any
influence on the rays of light." In the same paper he gives
the specific refractive energy as 0*073, which corresponds to
the refraction-equivalent given above. As it stands, it is by
far the lowest on the list, none of the other elements having a
specific refraction of less than 0*1 ; but had it been calculated
from the results given by the minerals above mentioned, the
specific refraction would have been as low as 0*01 6.
   As the discrepancy then noted was so very wide, and special
interest attaches to fluorine in this connection on account of
its singularly small refractive power, I have thought it worth
while to review all the evidence upon the subject, and to
obtain new observations of a solution of fluoride of potassium.
   Brewster gives 1*344 and 1*349 as the index of refraction
of kryolite. The mean of these will give 24*63 as the refrac
tion-equivalent for Na3Al2F6. Deducting 13-2 for the sodium
 and 9*7 for the aluminium, which is the most recent value
 assigned to this metal, there will only be 1*73 left for six
 atoms of fluorine. Thus fluorine equals 0 29.
    Of fluor-spar there are several independent observers.
 Brewster gives 1*436 for the index of refraction for the bright
 part of the spectrum ; and Wollaston l-433. Fizeau gives
 1*435 for the line D ; Stephan, in 1871, gives 1*4339 ; and
 Kohlrausch, in 1878, gives 1*4324 and 1*4342 for the same.
 The average of these is 1*4341, which, taking the specific
 gravity at 3*183, according to Landolfs tables, will give a
 refraction-equivalent of 10*64 for CaF2. Deducting 10*0 for
 the calcium, fluorine will equal 0*32.
    I am indebted to my brother for a redetermination of the
 aqueous solution of fluoride of potassium, which gives 8*15 as
 the refraction-equivalent for the line A ; deducting 7*85 for
 the potassium, the fluorine equals 0"30.
    These are all closely accordant.
    Messrs. Topsoe and Christiansen have taken the indices of
 refraction and the specific gravities of a series of crystalline
 fluorides of uniform composition. They are biaxial crystals ;
 and the observations are given by them for the lines C, D,
 and F of the spectrum, both of the ordinary and extraordinary
 ray. In the following table I have taken the mean of the two
 rays for F, and give also the mean value for A calculated
 from the differences between the indices for the lines C and
 F. The refraction-equivalent of the substance is given for

                        Refraction of Fluorine.                      483
the line A, and the last column contains the value for fluorine
obtained by deducting the amount due to the other elements,
viz. 35*556 for the water, 7*4 for the silicon, 11*5 for copper,
9*9 for nickel, 9*8 for zinc, 6*7 for magnesium, and 11*5 for
manganese, and then dividing the residue by six. The
refraction-equivalents for the above-named elements are taken
from the revised list published in the ' American Journal of
Science ' for January 1885.

    Four out of the five will be seen to give closely accordant
results, and agree well with the general average, which is 0*77.
   The same observers give similar data for a silico-ammonio-
fluoride, 2NH4F, SiF4, which is a uniaxial crystal. The
index for the line F is 1*3723, and the calculated figure for
the line A is 1 3670. The specific gravity being 1*970, the
refraction-equivalent will be 33*16. The latest estimate for
NH4 being 11*1, there will be 3*56 left to satisfy the six atoms
of fluorine, after deducting what may be due to the other
elements. This gives 0*59 for fluorine ; which is, as near as
possible, the mean of all the observations here examined.
    This still leaves a range of from 0*3 to 0*8 ; but in any case
the refraction-equivalent is of exceedingly small amount ; and
the specific refraction, even at the highest limit, can scarcely
be the half of that of any other substance known. Thus,
while the specific refraction of chlorine, bromine, and iodine
amounts to 0*279, 0*191, and 0193 respectively, that of
fluorine will lie between 0*015 and 0*044, as calculated from
the extreme results of the observations recorded above.

  LIX. On Measurements of the Intensity of the Horizontal
      Component of the Earth's Magnetic Field made in the Phy
     sical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow. By Thomas
     Gray, B.Sc, F.R.S.ES
                                 [Plate XI.]
  IN the course of some measurements of the horizontal com
       ponent of the intensity of the earth's magnetic field, which
  have recently been made in the physical laboratory of the
  University of Glasgow, several improvements in the apparatus
  and mode of conducting these experiments suggested them
  selves. The following paper is a description of these mea
  surements.
     The method adopted was, in general principle, that of Gauss ;
  that is, the determination by a deflection-experiment of the
  ratio M/H, and by an oscillation-experiment of the product
  MH, where M is the magnetic moment of a magnet, called in
  this description the deflector, and H is the horizontal intensity
  of the earth's magnetic field at the place of experiment.
 The earlier experiments, of which the results are given below,
 were, with the exception of the mode of determining the
 effective length of the deflector, conducted in the way that
 has for several years been practised in Sir William Thomson's
 laboratory, and descriptions of which have already been
 published^.
     The Deflection Experiment consists in finding the deflec
 tion produced by the deflector on a second needle, called the
 magnetometer-needle, suspended at a known distance from it,
 and thus furnishing an equation of the form
 where /(2a„r) is a function of 2ax the effective length of the
 deflector, and r the distance between the centre of the deflector
 and the centre of the magnetometer-needle, and 6 is the
 angle of deflection. The function f(2ax,r) depends on the
 relative direction of the line joining the centres of the deflector
 and magnetometer-needles, the direction of the axis of the
 deflector and the direction of the lines of force in the magnetic
 field, and on the distribution of magnetism in the deflector and
 magnetometer-needles. Strictly/(2a,, r) should be f(2au b, r),

where b is the length of the magnetometer-needle ; but it is
one of the merits of the method here described that the mag
netometer-needle is made so short that its magnetic length
 may be neglected, and the resulting equation thus much
simplified.
   The positions adopted in these determinations were, for the
line joining the centres of the deflector and the magnetometer-
needle, the magnetic meridian and a line at right angles to it ;
and for the direction of the magnetic axis of the deflector, a
line at right angles to the magnetic meridian. We then have
for the former of these positions,

   Now, besides M and H, the value of % is also unknown ; but
when 0O and 8X are determined at nearly the same time, we
can calculate a, from the above equations. We have clearly
                      (r»-q?)' _tan^
Expanding the numerator and denominator on the left-hand
side of the above equation, and neglecting small terms, we
readily obtain, as a close approximation,
  There is in the method here described a departure from the
usual practice—namely, determining the effect of the length
of the deflector and deflected magnets, by double and triple
experiments with the deflector placed at different distances
along a line through the centre of the deflected magnet. In
the first place, the third experiment is rendered unneces-

486    Mr. T. Gray on Measurements of the Intensity of the
mry by making the deflected magnet so short that its magnetic
length may be neglected ; and, in the second place, the effect
of the length of the deflector is found by adopting two posi
tions for which the length enters in the resulting equations (4)
and (5) above, with opposite sign, rendering the observation
highly sensitive to that effect. By adopting this method a
good estimate of the effective length of different deflectors is
obtained ; and this is useful information outside of the parti
cular object of the experiment.
   The latest form and arrangement of the apparatus for the
deflection-experiment is shown in PI. XI. fig. 1, where
T is the table on which the apparatus is placed, M the
magnetometer, A and B the deflector-stands, and C the scale
on which the deflections are read. The magnetometer M
consists of a light mirror about -8 centim. in diameter, on the
back of which two magnets, 1 centim. long and -08 centim. in
diameter, are fixed. A better form of needle would, as has
been pointed out by Sir William Thomson, be two thin disks
of hard steel mounted with their planes parallel and at a dis
tance apart somewhat less than the diameter of the disk.
   The mirror with attached magnets is suspended by a single
silk fibre (half a cocoon-fibre) in a recess cut in a block of
wood, W. Two holes at right angles to each other, and pass
ing through the position of the mirror and magnets, allow the
magnetic system to be accurately adjusted when setting up
the apparatus. The holes, with the exception of that in
front of the mirror, are plugged while the instrument is in
use, and the mirror and fibre are protected from currents
of air by means of a plate of plane glass. The sole plate,
P, is furnished with three brass feet, which rest on a " hole,
elot, and plane " arrangement cut in the top of the glass
plate, p, fixed to the table. The deflector-stands, A and
B, consist of a base plate of mahogany furnished, as in the
case of the magnetometer, with three brass feet which rest on
" hole, slot, ana plane " arrangements cut in the glass plate p.
A centre pivot, c, is fixed in the sole plate and passes through
a closely-fitting hole in the glass plate, g, which rests on three
thin blocks of hard wood and is free to turn in azimuth. A
strip of wood having a V-groove cut along its upper side and
furnished with an adjusting-screw, «, is cemented to the top of
the glass plate g in such a way that the bottom of the V-groove
is vertically above the centre of the pivot c. The screw, s, gives
an adjustment for the centre of the magnet, which is necessary
if the magnets differ slightly in length. The centre of the
magnet is seldom exactly at the middle of the length of the
bar, but, with the arrangement here adopted, the adjustment

     Horizontal Component of the Earth's Magnetic Field.      487
can be readily made by turning the screw s until equal deflec
tions are obtained on opposite sides of zero, when the deflector
is reversed by turning the plate g through 180° in azimuth.
The deflectors, d, are shown in positions east and west of
the magnetometers ; and the distance between their centres
when in this position is 70 centim. Two plates similar to p
are placed, one on the north and one on the south side of the
magnetometer, in such a position that, when the deflector-stand
is resting on them, the distance between the centres of the
deflectors is 60 centim., and the line joining them is in the
magnetic meridian. The feet on which the deflector-stands
rest are so adjusted that the deflectors are equidistant from the
magnetometers, and at the same distance apart when the posi
tions of the stands are interchanged. The scale C is graduated
to millimetres on glass, and is placed with its centre directly
in front, and in the focus, of the magnetometer-mirror. The
distance between the scale and the mirror is 129 centim.
   A paraffin-lamp, with a copper funnel which has a vertical
slit in front, with a fine wire in its centre, covered by a plane
glass plate, is placed behind the scale, and furnishes a beam of
light which is focused on the glass scale by the magnetometer-
mirror. The scale being transparent, the deflections can be
read either from the back or the front of it. When the deflec
tions were read from behind the scale, it was found convenient,
although not absolutely necessary, to render the glass partially
obscure ; and this, acting on a suggestion of Mr. Bottomley,
was done by dusting lycopodium-powder over it. The deflec
tions were taken in the following manner :—
   The table T was first placed in such a position that the line
joining the centres of A and B (PI. XI. fig. 1) was exactly at
right angles to the magnetic meridian . This was done in one or
other of the following ways :—(1)A thin wire was passed under
the magnetometer and stretched along the line joining the
centres of A and B, and then taken back, either over the top of
the magnetometer, or beneath and at a greater distance from it,
in such a way as to form a vertical plane circuit. An electric
current was then sent through the circuit, and the table turned
until it produced no deflection on the magnetometer-needle.
(2) One of the deflectors was placed in its position north or
south of the magnetometer, and lifted out of its V by the sus
pension-fibre. The table was then turned until the suspended
needle produced no deflection of the magnetometer-needle.
When this is the case, the direction of the magnetic axes of
the deflector and the magnetometer-needle are in the same line ;
and if the latter needle be in its proper position, this line also
passes through the centre of the deflector when placed on the
                              2 M2

488     Mr. T. Gray on Measurements of the Intensity of the
 other side of the magnetometer. To ensure that this was the
 case, the deflector was placed on the other side and the position
 of the table for no deflection again observed. The magneto
 meter-needle was then adjusted, by turning the levelling-
 screws, until the two positions were coincident. A combination
 of the methods (1) and (2) gives a ready means of testing
 whether the plates g have been properly placed on the table.
    Suppose A to be east and B west of the magnetometer.
The deflectors were turned by means of the plate g until their
lengths were accurately in the magnetic east and west line,
and their poles so placed as to produce a deflection to the
same side of zero. The deflection was then read. The plates
g were next turned through 180° and the deflection on the
opposite side of zero read. The plates g were then turned back
to their first position, and the deflection again read. The dif
ference between the mean of the first and third reading and
the second gives twice the deflection. The same operation was
then repeated with A north and B south, with A west and B
east, and with A south and B west. The mean of the deflec
tions for the east and west positions and the mean of the
deflections for the north and south positions were then found,
and from them the mean effective length of the two deflectors
calculated. This length was then substituted in equations (11)
and (12) below, and the value of H calculated.
   Previous to the adoption of the above apparatus only one
deflector was used, and it was placed by hand in the positions
necessary for a cycle of operations similar to that above de
scribed. The idea of using two deflectors placed on opposite
sides of the magnetometer, and the arrangement for them
shown in fig. 1, is due to Sir William Thomson. It has the
advantage of greater symmetry, it allows the deflector to be
placed at a greater distance from the magnetometer, and,
what is most important, the magnet need not be handled
during the experiment.
   Thk Oscillation Experiment consists in finding the
period of oscillation of the deflector when suspended with its
axis horizontal, and free to perform horizontal oscillations
under the influence of the earth's magnetic field. This expe
riment gives the value of MH from the equation
                       MH + *=4J^                              (8)
The quantity x refers to the torsional rigidity of the suspen
sion, which was practically zero in these experiments ; fi is
the moment of inertia of the oscillating system, and P the

      Horizontal Component of the Earth's Magnetic Field.      489
  period of oscillation. The following is a description of the
 arrangement and the mode of observation.
     A length of single cocoon-fibre was taken, and a stirrnp
  like that shown at S (fig. 2) formed on one end of it by fold
 ing it twice, so as to make four fibres, and making a knot
 about 3 centim. from the end. The other end was passed
 through a small hole in the brass bow, b (fig. 1), and then
 fixed to a small strip of sheet lead which simply rested on the
 sole plate and held the deflector in the proper position. The
 deflector was placed in the stirrup S, and the loops adjusted
 so as to suspend it horizontally. The magnet was thus sus
 pended in a stirrup almost devoid of inertia, and by a fibre of
 negligible torsional rigidity. This leaves jtt, the moment of
 inertia of the deflector, and P, its period of oscillation, to be
 determined. The moment of inertia can be very accurately
 calculated from the mass, length, and thickness of the bar,
 when, as is the case with these deflectors, the bar is a round
 cylinder of small and perfectly uniform diameter. Greater
 accuracy in these calculations, and the advantage of small
 diameter in the " side on " position when taking deflections, are
 the main reasons, apart from simplicity, why a solid cylinder
 is preferred to a thin tube for the deflector. The period of
 oscillation P was in the earlier experiments obtained either by
 observing, with the eye placed behind a narrow slit, the times
 of successive transits of the end of the bar across a fixed mark
 (usually a black thread stretched vertically near the end of
 the magnet and in the same magnetic meridian) ; or by ob
 serving the times of the successive transits across the vertical
 wire of a telescope. In the later experiments, one end of the
 deflector was polished with the view of using it as a mirror to
 reflect a beam of light to a scale placed at some distance.
 This method was not successful, owing to defects in the mirror,
and it has been abandoned in favour of a light silvered-glass
mirror, m (fig. 1), about 0*3 centim. in diameter and 0*01
gramme in weight, attached to the stirrup with its plane
parallel to the length of the magnet. The same lamp and scale
are thus available both for oscillation and deflection experi
ments. With this arrangement the amplitude of the oscilla
tion need never exceed one degree, and hence no correction
for arc is necessary.
    With regard to the effect of the inertia of the mirror on
it is to be remarked that its total moment of inertia is about
•001, while that of the deflector is about 40 ; so that, even if
the inertia of the mirror be neglected, the error is not more
than       per cent.
    When a second observer was available, time was usually

 490    Mr. T. Gray on Measurements of the Intensity of the
 taken from a watch with a centre seconds hand moving over
 a dial divided to quarter-seconds. The watch was keeping
 almost perfect time. In this case an observer counted the
 oscillations of the magnet, and called now at the end of every
 four or five periods, while the other observer noted the time.
 Personal error does not enter into this method, as it is elimi
 nated in taking the differences. When the transits and time
 were taken by the same observer, the time was taken from a
 chronometer beating half-seconds. The observer took time,
 say, at the beginning of a minute, and then counted the beats
 until he coula observe a transit. By simply counting the
 number of beats between two successive transits, the total
 number of periods in one minute could then be estimated ; and
 the time of the first transit after each minute was then taken
 as long as the amplitude was sufficiently large to allow the
 time to be accurately estimated. Fractions of half seconds
 were estimated from the position of the magnet at the beat
 next before and next after transit.
   The results of the different observations of time were com
 bined in the following manner :—First suppose an even
 number 2n observations to have been taken. The sum of the
 intervals of time between the nth and the (n + 1 )th, the (n — 1 )th
 and the (n + 2)th, and so on to the 1st and 2nth, divided by
 the square of the number of intervals, and by the number of
 periods between each pair of observations, gives the average
 period as nearly as it can be obtained from that set of obser
vations. Suppose next an odd number 2n + 1 observations to
have been taken. The sum of the intervals between the 1st
and the (n + l)th, the 2nd and (n + 2)th, and so on to the nth
and (2n+l)th, each divided by the corresponding number of
periods, divided by the number of intervals, gives the average
period. Two sets of observations were usually taken ; and if
they agreed closely, the mean of the two was assumed to be
the true period.
   We have then the following equations for the determination
of H when one deflector only is used :—
                                                                 <•)

if ai has been properly calculated. The value of — is always
calculated, as it gives an idea of the quality of steel used for
the deflector. The results are given along with the values of
 H in tabular form below.
   The values of H derived from equations (9) to (12) require
 correction, in the oscillation experiment, for arc of vibration,
 for virtual increase of inertia due to air moved, and for change
 of inertia, due to change of dimensions of the deflector, if the
 temperatures when the bar is measured and when it is vibrated
 are different. Neither of these produced a sensible error in
 the experiments, and hence they were neglected. There are
 besides a correction for the effect of variation of temperature
 during the experiment in altering the magnetic moment of
 the deflector, and a correction for the change of magnetic
 moment between the oscillation and deflection experiment, due
 to the deflector having its length in the direction of the mag
 netic meridian in the former, and at right angles to it in the
 latter experiment.

492   Mr. T. Gray on Measurements of the Intensity of the
   The magnets were found to change by jToocF °^ *heir vame
per degree centigrade change of temperature ; but as the change
of temperature never exceeded two or three degrees, this cor
rection was neglected.
   The correction for induction, however, was found to be
considerable in some cases, and the results tabulated below
have all been corrected for that.
   The Temperature Coefficient was obtained by placing the
deflector behind the magnetometer-needle in such a position
as to produce a deflection of 1000 scale-divisions, and the
change of deflection produced by raising the temperature
about 40° C. observed.
   The Induction Coefficient was determined by placing the
deflector, surrounded by a magnetizing coil, near the magneto
meter-needle, and observing the change of deflection produced
by passing a known current through the coil. The arrange
ment for these measurements is illustrated in PL XI. fig. 3 ;
 and the results of a number of experiments on the effect of the
 length and hardness of the deflector on this correction are
 given in Table II., and are shown diagrammatically in the

  Referring to the figure, m is the magnetometer-needle ; C0
and Ci two coils, consisting of one layer of No. 30 B.W.G.
silk-covered copper wire, wound in glass tubes about 5 millim.
in external diameter ; C is a scale divided to millimetres, on
which the deflection of the magnetometer-needle is read, in
the manner described for the deflection-experiment above ;
R is a box of resistance-coils, and G a current-galvanometer.
The line D E represents a magnetic meridian, and A F a line
passing through the centre of m and at right angles to D E.
   The coil C0 was placed with its axis parallel to A F, and its
centre on the line D E. The coil Cj was placed with its axis
on the line A F, and at such a distance from m that a cur
rent passed in the proper directions through both coils pro
duced no deflection. In making this adjustment a current,
equal to about 30 times the greatest current subsequently used
in the experiment, was passed through the coils.
   The magnet to be tested was then introduced into one of
the coils, adjusted to the proper position, and the deflection of
m read. A current of such strength as to produce a field of
about ^ C.G.S. units intensity was then passed through the
coils, and the change of deflection read. The current was
then reversed, and the deflection again read. This operation
was repeated with stronger and stronger currents until a field
of from one to two units intensity was reached. The magnet
was next introduced into the other coil, and a similar series
of measurements taken. The results plotted on a sheet of
section-paper show clearly that a field of considerably greater
intensity than that used is required to permanently alter the
magnetic moment of the magnets when they are hard-
tempered.
   The changes of deflection obtained when the magnet is in
the coil C0 are always a smaller fraction of the total deflection
than they are when it is in the coil Qv This is no doubt due
to a change of magnetic distribution. The equations to the
deflections in the two cases are :—
                            #-        M
for the coil C0, and
                            „ _      2rM
for the coil 0V
   From these equations it is clear that either a change of M or
of a-i will affect the deflection, but that the effect of the change
of ai is opposite in the two cases. The method of measurement

  494    Mr. T. Gray on Measurements of the Intensity of the
 therefore allows both the change of moment M and the change
 of effective length 2aj to be determined. When the change of
 moment only is required, this method has still an advantage
 in the fact that the effect of want of exact compensation
 between the two coils can be eliminated by means of the two
 measurements.
    Sufficient sensibility is, for most purposes, obtained by
 using a deflection within the limits of the scale, but almost
 any degree of sensibility may be obtained by using an inferred
 zero. It is not advisable to place the magnets very near to
 m, because, if the tangent method be adopted, the compen
 sation of the coils will not then be perfect unless m is always
 brought to its original zero position ; and if this objection be
 got over by using a sine method, in which the whole appa
 ratus, including the magnetometer, can be turned round a
vertical axis, there still remains the objection that the effect
of distribution becomes very pronounced. An inferred zero
method therefore involves, when small magnets are being
tested, a diminution, by artificial means, of the intensity of the
 field at m. This, however, cannot be pushed far, on account
of the very inconvenient fluctuations of zero which then take
place, due to changes of declination in the earth's field, com
bined with the small variations of intensity of " H " being
superposed on a field, the whole strength of which is not large
compared with these variations.
    The results of these experiments, given in Table II., show
that it is of great importance, so far as induction is concerned,
that the length of the magnets should be at least forty times
their diameter, and that they should be made as hard as
possible. It appears that for the steel employed in the experi
ments, which was of the kind commonly called silver steel, a
much stronger magnet is obtained with a blue than with a
glass-hard temper*. The magnets were originally magnetized
by placing them between the poles of a large Ruhmkorff
magnet excited by 24 tray-cells. They were again magne
tized by placing them between the poles of the same magnet
   * Note added October 26, 1885.—Since this paper was in type I have
received a copy of No. 14 of the ' Bulletins ' of the United States Geolo
gical Survey, which is wholly devoted to a discussion of experiments on
the " Physical Characteristics of the Iron-Carburets," by C. Barus and
V. Strouhal. In this work a large number' of interesting experiments on
the effect of annealing specimens of this " silver steel," which had been
previously tempered glass-hard, are quoted. Among other things the
large increase of magnetic moment which is obtained by softening the
steel, up to a certain point, is clearly brought out.—T. G.

     Horizontal Component of the Earth's Magnetic Field.     495
excited by a dynamo having a low-resistance armature, and
fiving a potential of 100 volts. The relative strengths of the
  iff'erent magnets remained the same, and the strength only
very slightly increased, thus showing that they were nearly
magnetized to saturation.
   The greatest trouble in the determination of the intensity
of the earth's magnetic field arises out of the variations of the
field itself—variations in declination causing changes of zero,
and variations of intensity between different determinations
causing apparent inaccuracy in the results.
   This trouble was in the later measurements got over by
means of a permanent magnetic vibrator, the period of vibration
of which, at different times, gives a comparison of the intensity
of the magnetic field at these times. In order to render the
result of any one determination free from error due to diurnal
variation, the period of the vibrator is taken at the beginning
of the experiment, between the deflection and the oscillation
experiment, and again at the end of the experiment. If these
agree well and the results also agree well among themselves, the
value found is considered reliable ; if not, the whole experi
ment is discarded. This vibrator has only lately been adopted,
and hence the results up to those taken on June 11th are not
corrected for diurnal variation. The results are tabulated in
the order in which they were taken on each day ; and it will
be observed that the earlier results are generally the smaller,
this being due to diurnal variation. The last three results
given in the Table are corrected to noon for diurnal variation.
   It has been found impossible to get consistent results at all
on several occasions, owing to extraordinary variations, and
this was notably the case on the 1st of September. It is
interesting to note how readily the vibrator shows extra
ordinary variations which take place suddenly. The observer
has only to watch for sudden changes of amplitude. These
changes of amplitude are sometimes extremely marked, the
vibrator being almost stopped on some occasions, and after
wards gradually worked up to a largo swing.
   Table I. gives the results of the various determinations.
The meanings of the numbers in the different columns are
clearly indicated in the headings.

LX. The Periodic Law, as Illustrated by certain Physical
   Properties of Organic Compounds.—Part II. The Melting-
   and Boiling-points of the Halogen and Alkyl Compounds of
   the Hydrocarbon Radicals. By Thomas Carnelley, JD.Sc,
   Professor of Cliemistry in University College, Dundee*.
IN the present series of papers my object is to determine
       whether the elements are in any way analogous to the
hydrocarbon radicals of Organic Chemistry. For this purpose
                       * Communicated by the Author.

498         Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law.
I have made a careful comparison of the physical properties
(chiefly melting- and boiling-points) of a large number of
both organic and inorganic compounds, and believe that I
have been able to make out numerous and varied relationships
between these properties.
   My first paper (Phil. Mag. [5] xviii. p. 1) dealt with the
melting- and boiling-points and heats of formation of the
normal halogen compounds of the elements, and I showed that
certain well-defined relationships existed as regards the above
physical properties of these compounds. My second paper
(ibid. [5] xx. p. 259) dealt in a similar manner with some of
the physical properties of the normal alkyl compounds of the
elements, which were shown to exhibit exactly the same rela
tionships as those of the corresponding halogen compounds ;
proving, therefore, that the function of the alkyl radicals—
methyl CH3, ethyl CSH5, propyl C3H7, <fcc.—was exactly ana
logous to that of the halogen elements—chlorine, bromine,
 and iodine.
    In the present paper I wish to show that the normal ha
 logen and alkyl compounds of the hydrocarbon radicals exhibit
 relationships similar to those of the corresponding compounds
 of the elements, and therefore that the elements and hydro
 carbon radicals are analogous and have the same function in
 their several compounds. In a fourth and final paper I intend
 to take a general review of the whole question, and to draw
 certain conclusions as to the nature of the chemical elements
 and of the Periodic Law.
    The following table contains the experimental data, with
 the authorities, which have been used in drawing the conclu
 sions given below. For the purpose of avoiding minus signs
 all temperatures are reckoned from the absolute zero ( — 273).

    The above series, of course, might be considerably extended ;
 but I have not thought it necessary to carry ray investigations
 beyond the 8th series for the halogen compounds, nor beyond
 the 5th series for the alkyl compounds*.
    When there are several isomeric modifications of the same
 empirical formula, only those which are strictly analogous
 should be compared ; thus, normal compounds should be com
 pared with normal, and iso-compounds with iso-, &c. In
 some instances, however, this is not possible, owing to the
 data being incomplete, or to the constitution being unknown,
 or when the compounds belonging to different groups of the
 name series are to be compared ; in this case the mean of the
 melting- or boiling-points of the several isomeric compounds
 is employed. As a general rule, however, the same results
 are obtained, no matter whether we use the mean melting- or
 boiling-point for all the isomeric compounds, or whether we
 compare only those compounds which are strictly analogous.
     Now the same general rule that we have already shown
 (ibid, xviii. p. 2) to hold good as regards the corresponding
 compounds of the elements also holds in the case of the above
 hydrocarbon radicals ; for in whatever way we may arrange
 the melting- or boiling-points of their normal halogen or
 alkyl compounds, provided only that we arrange them syste
 matically, we always find that certain definite and regular
 relations may be traced between them. The following are
 examples of such relations :—
     Relation 1. If the above hydrocarbon radicals be arranged
 in the order of their atomic weights, then the melting-points and
 boiling-points of both their halogen and alkyl compounds rise
 and fall periodically.
     This periodicity is such that the values increase from the

 however, been completed to the end of the eighth series.

first (monad) up to the fourth or middle (tetrad) member of
each series, and then diminish to tho seventh (monad) or last
member (see Table II.*).
   This periodicity is not exactly the same as that in the case
of the corresponding compounds of the elements ; I shall not,
however, discuss this point at present, but defer it to my next
communication.

     N.B.—In the above table the mean value is given when there are several
 isomers having the same empirical composition. Sometimes, however,
 in the case of the melting-points, there are several pairs or triplets of iso
 meric substances of which the melting-point of one only is known, the
 others being liquid ; a mean number is therefore impossible ; in this case
 the known melting-point is given.
      1 This is the mean of 448°-473°, which are the temperatures given
 in Watts's Dictionary (i. p. 768) as those between which protochloride
 of carbon melts and boils. Chlorine does not act upon this compound
 even in sunshine. It is most probably a polymer (C,Cl2)n. Berthelot in
 fact regards it as C]0C110. Its vapour-density, however, does not appear
 to have been determined.
    J This is the boibng-point of chlornicene, as given by St. Evre (Jahres-
 bericht, i. p. 630). This substance, if a definite compound, is probably a
 polymer (CsIIjCl)».

         In those cases where there is a common difference between the
      atomic weights of several pairs of hydrocarbon radicals, then the
      differences between the boiling-points increase as the sum of the
       atomic weights of the several pairs of hydrocarbon radicals
       diminishes. (See Table VI.)

      N.B. The numbers followed by a (d) are not strictly comparable with the others,
   as one of the substances is decomposed on boiling, so that its boiling-point can
   not be determined with any degree of exactness.
      The numbers marked with an * are exceptions to Relation 9. They are all
   due to the b.p. of propane, C,H„ being too high. Cf, footnote to Tables V. and VI.

     Relation 9. (a) The differences re/erred to in Relation 8
increase algebraically as the algebraic difference between the
atomic weights of the hydrocarbon radicals increases. (See
Table VII.)
     (b) In the case where several pairs of hydrocarbon radicals
have a common difference in atomic weights, then the differences
between the boiling-points of their halogen compounds increase as
the sum of the atomic weights of the several pairs of hydrocarbon
radicals increases. This rule also holds for the alkyl compounds
so long as the difference between the boiling-points is a minus
quantity (i. e. so long as the boiling-point of the alkyl com
pound of the polyvalent hydrocarbon radical is lower than
that of the corresponding alkyl compound of the monovalent
hydrocarbon radical), but when this difference becomes a plus
quantity the rule is reversed. (See Table VII.)
     For the purpose of illustrating the above relationships we
have chiefly made use of the compounds of the sixth and
seventh groups of hydrocarbon radicals, because the sets of
compounds belonging to these groups are much more complete
than in the case of the other groups ; the rules, however, hold
equally with the latter as with the former.
     The above nine rules have been applied in 1997 cases, of
which 71 (or 3*6 per cent.) are exceptions. The exceptions
are distributed as follows :—

   Of the above 71 exceptions no less than
    45 are due to the b.p. of propane, C3H8, being too high.
      5         „        „       isobutane, CHMe3, being too low.
      2         „       ni.p. of carbon tetrabromide, CBr4, being
    —                       too high.
     52
So that 52 of the 71 exceptions would be accounted for by
errors in the boiling-points of two of the above compounds,
and in the melting-point of the last one. As regards propane
there is certainly a considerable error in its boiling-point, or
rather in the number which has been assumed as the boiling-
point in our investigations ; for its actual boiling-point has
not been determined, the value used being in fact the mean
temperature of condensation, viz. —25° to — 30° (cf. footnoto
to Table V.). With respect to isobutane, the boiling-point em
ployed was that ( — 17°) given by Butlerow(^4«na/w,cxliv. 10).
Konovaloff states that it boils below —10° (Ball. Soc. Clam.
 (2) xxxiv. 333). Finally, carbon tetrabromide is not only an
 exception to some of the relations noted above, but it was also
shown, in my paper on the Halogen Compounds of the Ele
ments, that, owing to its abnormally high melting-point, it was
the most marked exception to some of the rules there stated.
    In conclusion it will be seen, by a comparison of this and
 my previous papers, that the above nine relationships, together
with others of less importance, hold good for the following
 four classes of compounds :—
    (1) The Halogen compounds of the Elements (t. e. of ele
         ments with elements).
    (2) The Alkyl compounds of the Elements (t. e. of elements
         with hydrocarbon radicals).
    (3) The Halogen compounds of the Hydrocarbon Radicals
         (i. e. of elements with hydrocarbon radicals).
    (4) The Alkyl compounds of the Hydrocarbon Radicals (?". e.
         of hydrocarbon radicals with hydrocarbon radicals).
    Though the periodicity of Relation 1 holds for all the four
 classes of compounds, yet the nature of the periodicity is not
 exactly the same throughout for the compounds of the hydro
 carbon radicals as for those of the elements.
    We are therefore justified in concluding that, with the ex
 ception just stated, the physical properties of the compounds
 of the hydrocarbon radicals (so far as investigated) follow the
  same rules and exhibit exactly the same relationships as the
 corresponding compounds of the elements.
    In my next paper I hope to indicate the theoretical signi
 ficance of this general fact.

       LXI. Some Thermodynamical Relations.—Part I.
 By William Ramsay, Ph.D., and Sydney Young, D.Sc*
rpHE relations to be considered in the following pages are,
 J- we believe, well founded ; but we hope to confirm them
by more exact experiments than have as yet been made.
    It appears advisable here to state the share which each of
the authors has had in this work. For our purpose, the
equation
                              L _dp t
                           «! — st dt ' J
will be employed. The relations of the first term of this
equation were the subject of a communication to the Chemi
cal Section of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in the
year 1877 by Dr. Ramsay, which, however, he considered too
incomplete to be published ; while the application of the last
 term of the equation to the vapour-pressures of substances,
 which formed the subject of a joint research by both authors,
 was independently discovered by Dr. Young. It is also right
 here to mention that some of the relations discovered by Dr.
 Ramsay have been pointed out subsequently and independently
 by Trouton (Phil. Mag. 1884, vol. xviii. p. 54).
     The term          (where L represents the heat of vaporiza-
               »i — «j
 tion of a liquid or solid substance at its boiling- or volatilizing-
 point, and where e2 's the volume of the liquid or solid at
 these temperatures, and «, that of the gas into which one or
 other is converted), if stated in words, denotes the heat ex
 pressed in units required to produce unit increase of volume
 of substance at the temperature of ebullition of the liquid or
 volatilization of the solid.
     Two laws have been discovered, representing certain rela
  tions between different liquids.
     The first law may be stated thus :— The amount of heat re
  quired to produce unit increase of volume in the passage from
  the liquid to the gaseous state at the boiling-point under normal
 pressure is approximately constant for all bodies ; or
  = C.                                                         ** ~ **
      The data on which this law is based are imperfect. The
  heats of vaporization of but few bodies have been determined
       * Communicated by the Physical Society : read November 28.

516                  Drs. Ramsay and Young on
with accuracy; and we have recently shown in a communica
tion to the Royal Society that the results obtained by Favre
and Silbermann, by Regnault, and by Andrews for ethyl
alcohol are only approximations to truth. It is probable that
the data given for other substances less easy to obtain in a
pure state are still less to be relied on. We have also shown
in that paper that the density of saturated vapour of alcohol
is normal, or nearly so, only at temperatures below 50°.
Nevertheless, in calculating by means of the above-mentioned
formula the constant for alcohol, it has been assumed that the
saturated vapour of alcohol possesses normal density at 780,4;
and from want of knowledge it has similarly been assumed
that at their boiling-points the saturated vapours of the other
liquids to be considered have also normal density. It must
therefore be acknowledged that considerable doubt rests on
both the expressions in the term                , and this doubt pre-
                                        *i — *8
vented the previous publication of these relations ; but it will
be seen in the sequel that the much more trustworthy deter
minations of vapour-pressures amply confirm the law whicb
has been stated.
  Tbe following table exhibits these relations at normal pres

   It will be seen that these numbers vary between 0'2453 for
phosphorus chloride and 0 3240 for ethyl alcohol. The alco
hols, water, and acetic acid give all nearly 0*32 ; and benzene,
and bodies containing halogens and sulphur give lower num
bers, averaging 0"2564.
   The sequel will show that these numbers cannot be regarded
as experimental deviations from a constant ; but that they
have significance can hardly be denied. It would also appear
that the nature of the element in the compound, and its
amount influence the absolute value ; though the nature and
extent of this influence can hardly be formulated.
   The second law is :—If the amounts of heat required to pro
duce unit increase of volume in the passage from the liquid to
the gaseous state be compared at different pressures for any two
bodies, then the ratio of the amount at the boiling-point under a
pressure p, to the amount at anotlier pressure p2, is approxi
mately constant for all liquids.

    Another method of comparison is to regard the value of
 —— for water as equal to unity at each pressure, when the
 numbers for chloroform become
    100 0-962 0-953 0-938 0-922 0 911 0-903 0-893 0 885 0-850.
 Similar results may be obtained on comparing other bodies
with water; it may be, however, remarked that the instance
chosen is one of those in which least concordance is to be
noticed. It is evident that here also the concordance is
merely approximate.
    Another point worthy of notice is this. The heat of
vaporization is expended in at least two channels :—it pro
duces expansion against pressure, thus doing external work ;
and it is partly expended in internal work on the molecules
of the body. Now it follows from what has preceded that
the internal and total work bear an approximately constant
proportion to each other for any one pressure, whatever be
the liquid. Thus at a pressure of approximately 760 millims.
the ratio of external to total work is shown as follows :—
                        Total work.                              Total work.

    In the equation ¦ ^          =^f -4; both terms are approxi-

paring them it is necessary to reduce the pressures which
have been given in the previous part of this paper in milli
metres of mercury, to grams per square centimetre. The
comparison has been made for water, with the following
results :—

   The non-equality of these numbers may be ascribed to
various causes : want of accuracy in experiment, most pro
bably in determination of the heats of vaporization, and the
assumption that the density of the saturated vapour of water
is normal at high pressures, are among the most likely.
With such results for water, it was thought unnecessary to
compare these terms for other liquids, where the constants
are probably less accurately determined. These numbers,
however, suffice to prove that the relations pointed out in the
first part of this paper, although derived from observations
and assumptions not always trustworthy, agree fairly well
with those deduced from the vapour-pressures, which have
been determined with a high degree of accuracy.
   We now proceed to exhibit the relations between the
vapour-pressures of various liquids. The constants of the
bodies considered were determined by Regnault, Olszewski,
Naumann, Isambert, Moitessier and Engel, and by ourselves.
   If a curve be constructed to represent the relation of tem
perature to pressure for any substance, and if tangents be
drawn to touch the curve at various points corresponding to
certain temperatures, these tangents will give the rate of
increase of pressure per unit rise of temperature ; in other
words, the value        for those temperatures.
    If we construct curves for a number of substances, and
determine the value of ¦£ for each of them at the same tem-
                           at
perature, it is clear that the values obtained will differ widely,
and will be greater for volatile substances than for those
 which are less volatile. But if we determine the values of
^ for the same series of bodies, not at the same temperature,
 but at the same pressure, the conditions under which the
 comparison is made will be more similar, and the resulting
values may be expected to differ much less.
                                 202

520                Drs. Ramsay and Young on
   In the calculation of the vapour-pressures of a number of
substances for each degree between certain limits of pressure,
it became evident that at any given pressure the rate of in
crease was generally, though not always, greater for the
volatile substances than for the less volatile.
   It was found that the product of the absolute temperature
into the rate of increase of pressure         .   at any given
  ressure was approximately the same for the bodies examined,
  ut the differences were evidently too great to be ascribed to
errors of experiment or of calculation. That this product
should be approximately the same for different substances
might perhaps be anticipated from the following considera
tions :—If there are two bodies, the absolute temperatures of
which must be raised to 200° and 400° respectively, in order
to produce a certain effect, the same for both, it might be
expected that a further rise of temperature of 1° would pro
duce a greater effect on the substance whose temperature was
200° than on that at 400°; for the rise of temperature in the
first case is greater in proportion to the temperature to which
the body has already attained than it is in the second, the
rise in the one case being from 200° to 201°, and in the other
from 400° to 401°. The rise of temperature would perhaps
rather be proportional if the temperature of the hotter body
were raised from 400° to 402°, or if the rise of temperature
in each case were made proportional to the absolute tempera
ture. In order, then, to make the conditions as similar as
possible in the calculation of the value of ^ for different sub
stances, the magnitude of the unit degree of temperature
should be made to vary in the same ratio as the absolute
temperature of those substances, corresponding to the par
ticular pressure at which they are compared ; or, in other
words, keeping the unit degree constant, the value ^ should
be multiplied by the absolute temperature t.
   The values of ^ . t were determined for a number of liquids
at several different pressures ; and it was found that the pro
ducts obtained for different stable substances at the same
pressure were always approximately the same, whatever that
pressure might be. Thus at a pressure of 400 millims. the
following values were obtained :—

                some Thermodynamical Relations.             521
           Carbon bisulphide .      4436        1-000
           Alcohol . . . .          5873        1-324
           Chlorobenzene . .        4724        1-065
           Bromobenzene .           4703        1-060
           Aniline . . . .          5124        1-155
           Methyl salicylate .      4959        1-112
           Bromonaphthalene         4930        1-111
           Mercury .                4812        1-085
   This may be better seen by making one of these values
equal to unity, and reducing the others in the same ratio.
The second column is thus calculated.
   Repeating this operation at another pressure, a second series
of values was obtained; and these were reduced in the same
way. It was at once noticed that the reduced numbers at the
new pressure were identical within the limits of error of expe
riment and calculation with those at the first pressure.
   The calculations were therefore continued so as to include
the widest attainable ranges of pressure, and at every pres
sure the value of     . t for one substance was made equal to
unity j and the others reduced in the same ratio.    The values
of ^ . f for water were made = 1, because the vapour-pres
sures of this substance have been determined by Regnault
between wide limits of temperature with very great care; but
it was noticed that the values for both water and alcohol were
very much higher than for the other substances examined j
and a similar comparison was therefore made by taking the
values lor carbon bisulphide as equal to unity.
   It was then found that for pressures ranging between 1 50
and 1500 or 2000 millim. the reduced values for each substance,
with the exception of mercury, were very nearly constant
for all pressures.
   In the case of alcohol and water, employing the vapour-
pressures of water as determined by Regnault (Mdmoires de
VAcadfrnie, vol. xxv.), and of alcohol as determined by Ramsay
and Young, the ratio of the values ^ . t was seen to be the
same at pressures between 150 and 20,000 millim.
   Two methods of calculation were adopted. In the first and
more accurate method the vapour-pressures for each degree
were calculated by the method of differences; and from these

522               Drs. Ramsay and Young on
numbers the value of -J? at any pressure could easily be calcu
lated with very small error. The time required by this pro
cess is very great ; and it was only adopted in the case of
water, for which the pressures for each degree between —32°
and 230° have already been calculated (Balfour Stewart,
' Treatise on Heat '), and of carbon bisulphide, alcohol, chloro-
benzene, bromobenzene, aniline, methyl salicylate, bromonaph-
thalene, and mercury between certain limits of pressure,
generally 150 or 200 to 700 millim. (Ramsay and Young,
Chem. Soc. Journ. 1885, p. 640).
   In all other cases tangents were drawn to touch the vapour-
pressure curves at points corresponding to definite pressures,
several curves being required for each substance on different
scales to admit of this being done. With care, this method
yields fairty satisfactory results.
   It has been mentioned that the identity of the reduced
numbers for any one substance holds at pressures ranging
between about 150 and 1500 to 2000 millim. At lower pres
sures it is much more difficult to determine the values of
                                                               at
 with accuracy, and the influence of experimental errors is
 greater. Moreover, it has been necessary provisionally to
 adopt the method of tangents for all substances except water
 and carbon bisulphide at low pressures ; and it is doubtful,
 therefore, whether much confidence is to be placed in the
 values at pressures below 150 millim.
    As regards high pressures, with the exception of alcohol all
 the substances have been investigated by Regnault ; and it may
 be worth while to mention one or two facts which appear to
 throw some little doubt on the accuracy of some of his determi
 nations at pressures above 2000 or 3000 millim. In vol. xxvi.
 of the Mdmoires de VAcad&niie Regnault gives the vapour-
 pressures of a large number of substances for each 5°, calcu
 lated from his empirical formulae. Many of these series have
 been examined by the method of differences ; and it has been
 found that in several cases the numbers forming the third set
 of differences increase slowly up to pressures of from 2000 to
 3000 millim., but decrease at higher pressures. This is
 notably the case with alcohol ; and it has been shown by
 Ramsay and Young, in a paper read before the Royal Society
 in May 1885, that the higher vapour-pressures of this sub
 stance as determined by Regnault are too low. It has also
 been pointed out by Vincent and Chappuis (Comvt. Rend.
 vol. c. p. 1216) that the vapour-pressures of methyl chloride

                 some Thermodynamical Relations.               523
above 7 atmospheres are much higher than those calculated
from Regnault's formula, the difference at 140° amounting
to no less than 11 "3 atmospheres.
   Where this decrease is observable in the third set of differ
ences, it seems therefore justifiable to doubt the accuracy of
the results at the higher pressures.
   It may be stated in conclusion:—(1) That the values of
     t are approximately the same for all stable substances at
the same pressure, but that the differences are real, and are
not due to errors of experiment or calculation ; and (2) that
the rate of increase of this value ^ . t with rise of pressure is
the same for all stable bodies, at any rate for pressures between
150 and 2000 millim., while for alcohol and water it is the
same for all pressures between 150 and 20,000.
    In the tables which follow, the values of           t (absolute
                      dp                              '
 temperature), and ^ . t are given for a number of stable
 substances at definite pressures, also the reduced values of
      t, that for (1) water and (2) carbon bisulphide being made
  = 1*000 at each pressure, the values for other substances at
 the same pressure being reduced in the same ratio.
    The second series of tables contains similar data for several
 substances which dissociate more or less completely on their
 passage into the gaseous state. It will be seen that for such
 bodies the values of       . t at any pressure are considerably
 higher than for stable substances at the same pressure.
    The initial letter of the name of the observer of the vapour-
 pressure of each substance is given in the table containing the
 values of       at the foot of the vertical columns. R. stands for

LXII. On the Velocity with which Air rushes into a Vacuum,
   and' on some Phenomena attending the Discharge of Atmo
   spheres of Higher into Atmospheres of Lower Density. By
   Henry Wilde, Esq.*
CONSIDERING the present condition of our knowledge
        respecting the mechanical properties of air and other
gases, some apology might appear to be needed in bringing
before this Society the results of an investigation touching
some fundamental principles in pneumatics, which for more
than a century have been considered to rest on foundations
as secure as the laws of gravitation of the heavenly bodies.
A survey of the history of the dynamics of elastic fluids will,
however, show that, great as are the advances which have
been made in this branch of science, the laws of the discharge
of elastic fluids under the varied conditions of elasticity and
volume are still left in much obscurity. The several circum
stances which have combined to produce this anomalous state
 of our knowledge of this subject are :—(1) The application of
 the laws of discharge of inelastic fluids, without any modifica
tion, to those which are elastic ; (2) the confusion of the
 quantity of the discharge of elastic fluids after leaving the
vessel, with the velocity of discharge through the aperture in
 the vessel ; and (3) the want of a sufficient number of expe
 riments, under varied conditions and through sufficient range of
 pressure, to compare with the deductions derived from theory.
    It has hitherto been assumed, as a leading proposition in
pneumatics, that air rushes into a vacuum with the velocity
which a heavy body would acquire by falling from the top of
 a homogeneous atmosphere of the same density as that on the
 earth's surface ; and since air is about 840 times lighter than
 water, if the whole pressure of the atmosphere be taken as
 equal to support 33 feet of water, we have the height of the
homogeneous atmosphere equal to 27,720 feet, through which,
by the free action of gravity, is generated a velocity of 1332
   * Communicated by the Author, having been read at a Meeting of the
Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, October 20, 1886.

532                Mr. H. Wilde on the Velocity
feet per second. This, therefore, is the velocity with which
air is considered to rush into a vacuum, and is taken as a
standard number in pneumatics, as 16 and 32 are standard
numbers in the general science of mechanics, expressing the
action of gravity on the surface of the earth.
   Now, so far as I am aware, no experiments have hitherto
been made directly proving this important proposition. It is
true that attempts have been made to determine the initial
velocity by discharging air at extremely low pressures into
the atmosphere ; but, apart from the conditions of the dis
charge into the air and into a vacuum being different, the
history of physical science shows that it is unphilosophic to
predicate absolute uniformity of any law through the order
of a whole range of phenomena of the same kind ; as nature
is full of surprises when pushed to extremes, or when interro
gated under new experimental conditions.
   It was long ago shown by Faraday* that, in the passage of
different gases through capillary tubes, an inversion of the
velocities of different gases takes place under different pres
sures, those which traverse quickest when the pressure is
high moving more slowly as it is diminished. Thus, with
equal high pressures, equal volumes of hydrogen gas and
olefiant gas passed through the same tube in 57" and 135""5
respectively ; but equal volumes of each passed through the
same tube at equally low pressures in 8' 15" and b' 11"
respectively. Again, while the velocities of discharge of
inelastic fluids are as the square roots of the heads, some
mathematicians have justly considered that this law does not
apply to those which are elastic, and have assumed with good
reason (though what appears unlikely at first sight) that the
velocity of air discharged into a vacuum is the same for all
pressures. But whatever differences of opinion there may be
amongst natural philosophers on this point, all are agreed in
estimating the quantity of air discharged from a higher into
air of a lower density, from the difference between the two
densities, us in the similar case of the discharge of inelastic
fluids, by the difference or effective head producing the pres
sure. Ibis mode of determining the amount of the discharge
from a higher to a lower density, like that of the velocity of
the atmosphere into a vacuum, has not, so far as I know, been
made the subject of experiment through any considerable
range of pressure. It therefore appeared to me that, as each
gas has its specific velocity of discharge, such a series of ex
periments might be useful in confirming and extending our
knowledge of the dynamics of elastic fluids. In the course of

             with which Air rushes into a Vacuum.          533
these experiments I have met with some results which I
thought of sufficient importance to bring before the Society.
   The apparatus employed in this investigation consisted of '
two strong cylinders of cast iron, shown in the engraving.
The small cylinder, A, had an internal capacity of 573 cubic
inches, while the large cylinder, B, had a capacity of 8459
cubic inclies, or about fifteen times the capacity of the cy
linder A. To the top of this cylinder was fitted a syringe for

534               Mr. H. Wilde on the Velocity
condensing the air up to nine atmospheres, and also a Bour
don's pressure-gauge of an improved construction, graduated
through every pound of the above pressure. The accuracy
of this gauge was tested in my presence by the constructors,
Messrs. Budenberg and Co., through the whole range of pres
sure, by comparing its readings with a column of mercury
of equivalent height. For pressures of 15 pounds above, and
for pressures below the atmosphere, a mercurial gauge and a
Bourdon's vacuum-gauge were employed, the readings of
which were compared with each other : 30 inches of mercury
were considered equal to one atmosphere, and 2 inches of mer
cury to one pound of pressure. The upper part of the glass
tube of the mercurial gauge was fitted with a brass cap and
screw-stopper, so that it could readily be used as a pressure-
gauge, or as a vacuum-gauge when required. The discharging
arrangement on the cj'linder A consisted of a stopcock and
union for securing a thin plate, through which the discharge
was made. The orifice in the plate opened as required, either
directly into the atmosphere or into the end of a short iron
tube two and a half inches internal diameter, communicating
with the bottom of the cylinder. The thin plate was a small
disk of tinned iron, three quarters of an inch in diameter and
one hundredth of an inch in thickness. The centre of the
disk was pierced with a circular hole two hundredths of an
inch in diameter. The size of the hole was accurately deter
mined by means of a wire expressly drawn down to the above
diameter ; the wire being calibred by one of Elliott's micro
 meter-gauges, divided into thousandths of an inch. The hole
in the plate was enlarged so as to fit tightly the gauged wire,
 and the burrs on each side of the bole were carefully removed,
 as this small amount of projection, as Dr. Joule has shown*,
 exercises a notable influence on the rate of discharge through
 apertures in thin plates.
    The general reasonings, and the inferences drawn from
the experiments to bo described, are based on Boyle and
Mariotte's law of the density of a gas being as the pressure
directly, and the volume as the pressure inversely for constant
temperatures.
    I have said that the capacity of the cylinder A was 573
cubic inches, which represents the same number of cubic
inches of air in the vessel at atmospheric pressure of 15 lb.
on the square inch ; and, generally, n times 573 cubic inches

              with which Air rushes into a Vacuum.            535
of air forced into the cylinder would be the equivalent of n
atmospheres of absolute pressure.
   In converse manner, 5 lb. of pressure, or one third of an
atmosphere, is the equivalent of one third of 573 cubic inches,
or the equivalent of 191 cubic inches of air at atmospheric
pressure ; and, generally, 5 lb. of pressure is the equivalent
of 191 cubic inches of air at atmospheric pressure and for all
the higher pressures. The mode of experiment was as fol
lows :—Air was forced into the cylinder to the required density,
and after the heat of compression had subsided, the time of
each 5 lb. reduction of pressure was taken by means of a half-
seconds pendulum, commencing its oscillations at the moment
of discharge ; and the stopcock was suddenly closed, and the
number of oscillations noted for every definite discharge and
reduction of 5 lb. of pressure. In my earlier experiments, it
was found that when the air was compressed to nine atmo
spheres, and successive reductions of 5 lb. were made to the
lowest pressure, the cooling of the air produced a notable
effect in diminishing the rate of discharge. By commencing
the experiments with the lower pressures and increasing them
by 10 lb. successively after each discharge of 5 lb., the changes
of temperature atttending the changes of density of the air
were kept within the limits of 5 lb. of pressure till the highest
density was attained. The small changes of pressure attend
ing each discharge by the addition and abstraction of heat to
and from the cylinder were after a little practice easily cor
rected, so that each discharge may well be considered as
having been made under conditions of constant temperature.
The large cylinder B was first used as a vacuum-chamber to
receive the discharge from the small cylinder. The chamber
was fitted with an exhausting pump and suitable vacuum-
gauges, and the pressure within the chamber was reduced to
six tenths of an inch of mercury ; and that degree of vacuum
was maintained during the experiments.
   The following table shows the velocity of air flowing into a
vacuum, as deduced from the time and difference of pressure
for every 5 lb. from 135 lb. to 5 lb. absolute pressure. The
velocities of the first column are deduced from actual experi
ment, and in the next column the velocities are calculated
from the difference of the area of the discharging orifice and
the vena contractu by applying the hydraulic coefficient '62.

   From this table it will be seen that the time of discharge
of 5 lb. from 135 lb. absolute pressure is 7*5 seconds. Now,
as 5 lb. pressure is the        part of the total pressure, we have
573
     =21*22 cubic inches of air from 135 1b. pressure dis
 charged into the vacuum chamber in 7-5 seconds : or, in
another form, since 5 lb. and 191 cubic inches of air at atmo
spheric pressure are equivalents, so 191 cubic inches condensed
                      191
to 9 atmospheres -jp = 21*22 cubic inches of discharge, as in
the above calculation. Again, we have for a cubic inch ex
tended into a cylinder 0 02 of an inch in diameter (the size of
the discharging orifice), 265*25 feet x 21*22 = 5628 feet.
Hence V= 7*0 seconds—                    r second for the discharge
                             = 750 feet per
of air from 135 lb. to 130 lb. into a vacuum through a hole in
                            750
a thin plate. Or V= -.^ =1210 feet per second when the
orifice is formed to the contracted vein.          By the like method

               icith which Air rushes into a Vacuum.         537
of calculation the velocities for the discharge of each 5 lb. of
pressure from 135 lb. to 10 lb. have been found.
   The velocity with which air rushes into the vacuum, as seen
from the table, is considerably less than that which has hitherto
been assigned to it by theory, and is not constant for all
pressures, as might have been expected from the known ratio
of elasticity and density : the difference in the velocities be
tween each discharge for the higher pressures, as will be seen,
is so small as to be exceeded by experimental errors. The
amount of this difference will, however, appear more clearly
when we are considering the velocity of air discharged into
the atmosphere. Meanwhile I may remark that the velocities
increase with the pressures by small asymptotic quantities, so
that the theoretic velocity of 1332 feet per second would be
obtained at a pressure of 40 atmospheres if the law of Boyle
and Mariotte held good for so high a density.
   While the rate of each discharge may be considered ap
proximately uniform for the higher pressures, the initial and
terminal velocities of each discharge of 5 lb. for the lower
pressures would be much different. This is specially notice
able for the velocity (842 feet per second) assigned to atmo
spheric pressure of 15 lb. ; and as it was a matter of much
interest that this important constant of nature should be de
termined with all the accuracy attainable, experiments were
made to ascertain the velocity of discharge for every pound of
pressure from 15 lb. to 2 lb. In these experiments the read
ings were taken from the mercurial gauge, and the vacuum
in the chamber was reduced to 0"4 of an inch of mercury.
   The results obtained are shown in the table.

we obtain for the initial velocity with which the atmosphere

   That the differences between the theoretic and experimental
velocities was not caused by the friction of the stream of air
against the circumference of a smaller orifice being greater
in proportion to that of the circumference of a larger orifice,
was proved by discharging air of 15 lb. pressure through a
hole one hundredth of an inch in diameter in another similar
thin plate, when the times of discharge through the short
range of 1 lb. of pressure were found to be in the ratio of
4 to 1, or inversely as the areas of the orifices.
   Taking into further account the difference between the
initial and terminal velocities due to the reduction of pressure
from 15 lb. to 14 lb., the results of these experiments show
that an absolute pressure of 30 inches of mercury, and at a
temperature of 60° Fahrenheit, the atmosphere rushes into a
vacuum with a velocity not greater than 1050 feet per second,
or less than the velocity of sound.
   Some anomalous rates of discharge which I obtained when
air of different densities was discharged into the atmosphere,
induced me to repeat the experiments with the same apparatus

and under precisely the same conditions as those which had
been made into a vacuum as above described. The results
are shown in Tables III. and IV.
   On comparing the times of discharge in Table III. and the
velocities calculated therefrom with the times and velocities
in Table II., a remarkable difference will be observed in them
for the same effective pressures. Thus, the velocity of dis
charge from 15 lb. to 14 lb. appears to be double that
assigned to the same pressure when the discharge is made
into a vacuum ; while in the discharge from 2 lb. to 1 lb.
(the lowest pressure in the table) the velocity appears to be
more than six times greater, or 4219 feet per second. No
less remarkable than this apparent increase in the rate of dis
charge is the complete inversion of the order of the velocities
as compared with those when the discharge was made into a
vacuum for the same effective pressure. Now, we have
knowledge of several causes competent to diminish the velo
city of air of constant temperature flowing into the atmosphere,
but none to increase the velocity except the form of the
aperture, which in this case remained unchanged. Recog
nizing the fact that when air of 15 lb. effective pressure was
discharged into the atmosphere the cylinder actually con
tained two atmospheres of absolute pressure, we are led to the
conclusion that the phenomenal increase in the rate of dis
 charge observed is caused by the external atmosphere acting
 as a vacuum, and offers no resistance to the discharge into it
of air of 15 lb. pressure, which thereby becomes 30 lb. effec
tive pressure. The velocity of air of 15 lb. effective pressure
discharged into the atmosphere based on this conclusion is
 1021 feet per second, the same as the velocity found for the
discharge into a vacuum. For effective pressures below
 15 lb. the velocities are compounded of the rate of discharge
into a vacuum, and the resistance of the atmosphere without
any regular ratio, but approximating to the square roots of
the pressures.
    That the atmosphere acts as a vacuum to the discharge of
 air into it of 15 lb. effective pressure, is further evident from
 the results obtained, and shown in Table IV.

   In this table it will be observed that the times of each
discharge from 120 lb. to 15 lb. effective pressure into the
atmosphere are identical with the times of discharge from
135 lb. to 30 lb. absolute pressure into a vacuum. Hence we
are able to formulate and prove the general proposition that
the atmosphere acts as a vacuum, and offers no resistance to
the discharge of air of all pressures above two absolute
atmospheres.
   Although the times of discharge for each reduction of 5 lb.
of pressure, as we have seen, are the same as those for pres
sures one atmosphere higher, when the discharge was made
into a vacuum, yet it seemed to me that a table showing the
apparent velocities due to the effective pressure would be
useful as exhibiting some further points of interest, and re
vealing the fallacy involved in estimating the velocities from
the effective pressures. On comparing the velocities of each
discharge from 120 lb. to 40 lb., it will be seen that the theo
retic velocity of 1332 feet per second is as'nearly attained as
the units of pressure and time adopted in these experiments

              with which Air rushes into a Vacuum.
would permit. We have therefore in the table a measure of
the difference of the theoretic and experimental velocities
with which air rushes into a vacuum by the same method of
calculation. This difference, as will be seen, amounts to
exactly one atmosphere of pressure.
    For each reduction of 5 lb. from 120 lb. to 40 lb. the times
of discharge are inversely as the pressures ; and as the density
of the issuing stream of air diminishes in the same proportion,
the velocity of discharge is the same for all the pressures from
120 lb. to 40 lb., as shown in the table. Hence it appeared
to me at the commencement of this investigation, that the
theoretic and experimental velocities with which air rushes
into a vacuum were rigorously exact. The anomalous and
apparent increase in the velocities from 40 lb. to 10 lb., how
ever, led me to suspect that the atmosphere in some manner
affected the results, and induced me to make the discharge
into a vacuum with the results shown in Table I.
    That the phenomenal rate of discharge which I have de
scribed should not hitherto have manifested itself in some
form, or be associated with some facts explanatory of it,
would indeed be surprising considering the varied circum
stances in which the discharge of elastic fluids comes into
play. Hence, it has long been known that a jet of air issuing
from an aperture in a vessel produces a rarefaction of the
atmosphere near to the discharging orifice. This phenomenon
was first observed on a large scale by Mr. Richard Roberts in
the year 1824, and is described in a paper read before this
Society in 1828*. Roberts noticed that when a valve was
placed over an aperture in a pipe used for regulating a strong
blast of air for blowing a furnace, the valve, instead of being
blown off by the force of the blast, remained a short distance
from the aperture, and required considerable force of the hand
to remove it to a further distance. Subsequent experiments
showed that the adhesion of the valve was caused by the
partial vacuum formed between the valve and its seating by
the expansion of the issuing air. These experiments were
repeated and extended by Mr. Peter Ewart to similar effects
produced by the discharge of steam through various apertures.
 Some of these experiments were described before this Society,
and afterwards published in the Philosophical Magazine in
1829t. The degree of rarefaction produced by the discharge
of air and high-pressure steam was carefully measured by
   * Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society, 2nd series, vol. v.
p. 208.
   t " Experiments and Observations on some of the Phenomena attend
ing the Sudden Expansion of Compressed Elastic Fluids."

542                 Mr. H. Wilde on the Velocity
 Ewart by means of gauges inserted in different parts of the
jet. He also noticed the sudden fall of temperature from 292°
 to 189° F. in the rarefied part of the jet when steam of 58 lb.
 pressure was discharged into the atmosphere.
    Sir William Armstrong also, in his experiments on Hydro-
 electricity in the year 1842*, described a singular effect of a
jet of steam by which a hollow globe made of thin brass, from
 two to three inches in diameter, remained suspended in a
jet of high-pressure steam issuing from an orifice ; and
 when the ball was pulled on one side by means of a string,
 a very palpable force was found requisite to draw it out of
 the jet.
    It is abundantly evident from these experiments, that when
 ever elastic fluids escape into the atmosphere a partial vacuum
 is formed near to the discharging orifice, the degree of vacuum
 depending on the density of the issuing stream. Ewart's
ingenious explanation, that the vacuous space formed near the
 discharging orifice is caused by the joint action of elasticity
 and momentum of the suddenly released particles repelling
 each other beyond the distance necessary to produce equili
 brium with the external pressure, has a high degree of proba
 bility ; but that this vacuous space should have the effect of
 increasing the rate of discharge could only be ascertained, as
we have seen, by a direct comparison, under like conditions,
 with the amount of the discharge into a vacuum.
    Having established the fact that the atmosphere acts as a
vacuum to the discharge of air of all pressures above two
 atmospheres within the range of my experiments, it appeared
 to me that this phenomenon might only be a particular case
 of a general law of the discharge of elastic fluids, and that it
 would be interesting to know through what range of relative
 pressures in two vessels the one would act as a vacuum to the
 other. With this object air was compressed into the large
 receiving cylinder from two up to eight atmospheres absolute
 pressure, while air was condensed into a small discharging
 cylinder up to nine atmospheres of absolute pressure. The
 air was discharged from the same orifice as in the former
 experiments, and the time of discharge recorded for each
atmosphere was for a reduction of 5 lb. of pressure. The
results obtained are shown in the table.

     In this table the first vertical column to the left shows tlie
 number of atmospheres in the small cylinder from which each
 discharge of 5 lb. was made into the receiver. The ordinal
 numbers at the head of the table indicate the atmospheres in
 the receiver when the discharge was made, commencing with
 vacuo ; and the time of each discharge, in seconds, is shown
 against the pressure in the discharging and receiving cylinders
 respectively. The times in the second and third vertical
  columns are obtained from those in Tables I. and IV., when
  the discharge was made into a vacuum and into the atmo
  sphere. On examining these results, commencing with the
  lower pressures, it will be seen that for two atmospheres of
  absolute pressure, the time of discharge (43 seconds) was the
  same for a vacuum as it was when made into the atmosphere,
  as has already been demonstrated. It will also be seen that
  a pressure of two atmospheres in the receiver acts as a vacuum
  to four atmospheres in the discharging cylinder. This is evi
  dent from the equalitj' of the time (20 seconds) when the
  discharge was made into one atmosphere or into a vacuum.
  The like ratio will also be observed up to three atmospheres
  in the receiver, which act as a vacuum to the discharge of six
  atmospheres of pressure from the small cylinder. As the
  pressure in the receiver was increased, the diminution of
  resistance of the recipient atmospheres becomes still more
  marked, till for the highest pressures we have the remarkable
  phenomenon of six atmospheres acting as a vacuum to the
  discharge of nine atmospheres of pressure. That this peculiar
  relation of the discharging and receiving atmospheres has not
   reached its full limit will be obvious from a comparison of the
  numbers in the table, from which it would appear that, for
   pressures exceeding those used in these experiments, the

544      On the Velocity with which Air rushes into a Vacuum.
resistance of the recipient atmospheres would be still further
diminished correlatively with an increase in the amount of
discharge.
   With the object of giving more completeness to this research,
experiments were made to ascertain through what range of
relative densities the air in two vessels would act as a vacuum
to the other for pressures below that of the atmosphere. The
results are shown in Table VI., which are arranged in the
same manner as those in Table V. The times in the second
vertical column are taken from those shown in Table II. when
the discharge was made into a vacuum for each pound of
pressure, and the other times in the Table are those obtained
for successive discharges into air of different densities below
the atmosphere, the large cylinder being again used as a
receiver.

    As equality in the times indicates equality in the quantities
and velocities of the discharge for constant pressures, a simple
inspection of the table shows that, for discharging pressures
as low as (5 lb., the recipient air still acts as a vacuum up to
half the density of the discharging stream, and the regularity
of this law is maintained within the limits of 6 lb. and 90 lb.
absolute pressure, as shown in Table V. For discharging
pressures below 6 lb. the relative times of discharge and the
 resistance of the recipient air increase ; and as we have already
 seen that the similar times and resistances for discharging
pressures above six atmospheres diminish, the continuity of
 regular law is broken at both ends of the series of pressures,
just as it is in the series of planetary distances and some other
quantitative phenomena of nature.

              LXIII. Notices respecting New Books.
Elementary Mechanics, including Hydrostatics and Pneumatics.
   Revised Edition. By Oliver J. Lodge, B.Sc. London, Professor
   of Experimental Physics in University College, Liverpool. London
   and Edinburgh : W. and E. Chambers. 1885.
T17 KEN the first edition of this little book appeared, those who
  " knew the tendencies of the time in the teaching of Mechanics
were bold to predict for it a certain and speedy success. The call
for a new and revised edition is the evidence that these prophets
were right, and that the demand for sound, clear, elementary expo
sition of the essential laws of matter and motion is a genuine and
growing one. Thomson, Tait, Maxwell, and Clifford took a fresh
look at the old and well-worn principles, and presented them to us
in a fashion that was implicitly full and complete as well as novel.
But their language is not that of the people—of the school-boy, of
the artizan-stud -nt, of the young engineer ; and even the trained
mathematician finds that their terse statement does not reveal all
its meaning and all its bearing at the first glance. Maxwell's
' Matter and Motion ' is the best example : his booklet of text
would require a volume of commentary to develop its entire sig
nificance ; and so while it gives practised readers all the delight of
severe healthful exercise, it is virtually sealed to the tyro. Some
work was wanted, then, which should lay open in ordinary language
what was hidden in the works of the masters. To do this without
sacrificing a jot of precision, without blurring by over- or under
statement the sharp definition of the originals, without intruding
misleading illustrations intended to be vivid, without practising the
easy device of simplifying difficulties by evading them, itself requires
a kind of masterhood ; and this we think Professor Lodge to a
great extent in the first edition, to a greater extent in this second,
has come very near to indeed.
   He has a happy audacity which in work of this kind is almost
genius : at any rate it gives the capacity of " taking a fresh look "
which talent often lacks, especially the talent of talented textbook-
writers. They have told us for generations that "force is that
which tends to produce motion," and that word "tends" covered
with its five letters a very chaos of doubts and difficulties to the
hapless beginner who thought. The word " force " was made more
mysterious by its definition. Lodge cuts the metaphysical knot,
and sends the student straight to rhe concrete by telling him that
"by the term force we are to understand muscular exertion, and
whatever else is capable of producing the same effects " (p. 13).
Again, after a brief and clear investigation of the normal accelera
tion of a point moving in a circle, that intangible phantom to the
beginner, we are told—"Although the point is always gaining velo
city normal to the curve or along its radius at this rate, it does not
follow that it ever possesses any such velocity. It is in fact impos
sible for a point to possess any velocity except, that along the curve

 546                Notices respecting New Books.
 or at right angles to the radius of curvature ; for as fast as velocity
along the radius is generated, so fast does the direction of the radius
change ; in the same sort of way that a promise for to-morrow need
never be fulfilled, because ' to-morrow never comes ' " (p. 23). To
give a puzzled student a hint like this is to " make his face to
shine." Once more, in the part on Hydrostatics the question of
the pressure on the base and sides of a vessel containing liquid is
discussed without algebra or calculation, yet with perfect precision,
and each of the student's difficulties is hit off and dissipated by a
happy phrase or analogy : then, when by a kind of experimental
induction he is led to see how all the cases are converging to a
common principle, the last step is taken almost by the student
himself—"in symbols, P=sAA. There is nothing more to explain.
This simple formula contains it all" (p. 159). How much more
truly educative is this method than the other that begins by raising
a dust of symbols, aud forces a reluctant consent for the bothered
and unconvinced reader.
   There is a further excellence in Professor Lodge's method which
teachers will value. He every now and then reminds the student
that there are large and interesting parts of the subject which are
only touched ou for the present ; and not content with stating this,
he gives him a glimpse of the directions in which these parts lie.
He opens up vistas of future interest which encourage the student
to persevere, in the hope that if he is faithful he will some day
reach wider pastures. Thus at p. 50 enough is hinted to let the
student guess " what Rigid Dynamics is about : " he is brought to
the point where he must feel that some larger calculus is necessary.
The mystery of gravitation is glanced at in pp. 15, 81, and glanced
at in the right way, not as hopeless, but as stimulating. The
Degradation of Energy is aptly illustrated at p. 84, and its Trans
formation at p. 8(3 ; a bit of Graphical Statics is worked in at p. 1 10,
with a characteristic note that the bit is " an indication of quite a
large art .... which may well occupy the student's attention at a
later stage ; " the measures of stability are touched ou at p. 130,
and meet halfway many perplexities of the inquiring student.
Lastly, at p. 164, after finding the vertical fluid pressure on an im
mersed cube, we are told—" If we did not care for simplicity the
same might be shown by the symbols for a solid of any irregular
shape whatsoever, and a most important mathematical theorem it
would be. You may make its acquaintance hereafter in a more
general form under the name of Green's theorem."
   This, we repeat, is something entirely different from the method
of cramming a smattering of all things into a primer : no student
can by such allusions as these to advanced matters have his head
turned to the vain fancy that he knows all about them ; one and all
they come in as baits and lures to more earnest effort now and
higher achievement hereafter.
   We need say little here about the good and trustworthy appa
ratus of exercises abundantly provided, oi the clearness and patness
of the figures, or the terse Saxou of the writing. What we desire

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.         547
most is to call the attention of enlightened teachers to a truly
educative manual, whieh is no mere collection of dry bones, but
alive with suggestion, and interest, and insight.
Transit Tables for 1886. By Latimer Clabk, F.R.A.S., M.I.O.E.
                        London: Spon. (Pp. 71.)
    These Tables constitute a multum in parvo for the use of those
who do not care to turn over the pages of the bulky Nautical
Almanac. Mr. Clark has added to the usefulness of his previous
issues by appending the Eight Ascensions of what he calls
" Additional Stars," as well as the time of the Moon's southing on
every alternate day of the year. He has also reverted to his
original plan of giving the times of transit to hundredths of a
second.
    With the aid of this handy volume and one of the excellent
Transit Instruments, invented by the Author, the merest amateur
will be able to keep his clocks going in accordance with Greenwich
 or his own local time.

   VISIBLE BEPRESENTATION OF THE FOCUS OF ULTRA-BED RAYS
               BY PHOSPHORESCENCE. BY E. LOMMEL.
   A "WELL-KNOWN experiment for making the ultra-red rays
         visible is that of Tyndall. He uses a lens obtained by
 filling a spherical flask with a solution of iodine in bisulphide of
 carbon. This solution is opaque to the ordinary rays, but trans
  mits the ultra-red rays and concentrates them in a focus ; the in
 creased heating effect in this point is shown by the ignition of
 tinder or gun-cotton, or the incandescence of platinum.
     This focus can easily be made visible by means of certain phos
  phorescent substances. Balmain's luminous paint is well adapted
  for the purpose ; or, still better, a greenish-blue phosphorescent
  calcium sulphide, the properties of which I have already described*.
  If this has been made slightly phosphorescent by ordinary daylight,
  it is increased to a bright luminosity by the less refrangible, and
 particularly by the ultra-red rays ; and when the radiation is mode
  rately strong this lasts for hours, and even after the radiation
  ceases it gradually diminishes, but is visible for some time. After
  this cessation a dark spot appears on the irradiation place, because
  here, in consequence of increased emission, the luminous power
  diminished or entirely destroyed.
     If a transparent screen be made of this substance by spreading a
  layer of the powder between two glass plates cemented at the edges,
  the ultra-red region of the spectrum may be shown in greenish-
  blue phosphorescence near the red end of the spectrum, both on
  the front and back of the glass.
     The same screen can be used to render visible the dark focus .
                 * Wiedemann's Atmalen, vol. xx. p. 853.

548            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
If it be received on the screen, it appears as a bright spot on a
feebly luminous ground, and changes after a lengthened action into
a black spot, which has the same appearance as if a hole had beeu
bored in a bright surface.
    Instead of a solution of iodine or bisulphide of carbon, both
which substances have their drawbacks, 1 use a solution of nigro-
sine in chloroform or alcohol. These solutions are quite black
and only transmit ultra-red rays. Alcohol, it is true, strongly
absorbs the ultra-red rays, so that the alcoholic solution only gives
a focus of small thermal action. This fact is. however, advantageous
for the above experiment ; for the luminosity of the very sensitive
phosphoescent substance lasts longer, and the blackening does not
set in so rapidly, as if the focus were more intense. The far more
diathermanous solution in chloroform gives a sufficiently hot focus
for demonstrating the thermal action ; nigrosine is insoluble in the
still more diathermanous bisulphide of carbon.
   "With the great sensitiveness of phosphorescent substances for
ultra-red rays, the flame of gas, of a lamp, or even a candle is
sufficient to show the phenomenon. By means of the spherical
flask, or, still better, by means of a lens with interposition of a
plane parallel trough filled with the black liquid, a sharp bright
(positive) image of the flame is received on the screen ; after the
radiation has ceased this lasts with continually decreasing intensity,
and then turns into a dark (negative) image on a brighter ground.
This is a kind of photography by means of invisible ultra-red rays. —

ON THE TONES PRODUCED IN A PLATE OR A COLUMN BY FREQUENT
    DISCHARGES OF AN ELECTRICAL MACHINE. BY E. SEMMOLA.
   The conductors of an induction machine are connected, by means
of two wires 5 metres in length, with two binding-screws fixed at
the opposite sides of a brass plate 1 millim. in thickness, which rests
on an ebonite funnel. If, now, the path of the current is broken
so that sparks strike across, the brass plate begins to sound. It
sounds also even if a Geissler's tube or a lead wire is interposed ir
the break ; and also if iustead, a wire is led to earth from the one
binding-screw, and in this a break is made. If the end of the
broken wire is so far removed from the binding-screw that sparks
pass, the tone is stronger, and can be distinctly discriminated from
the sound of the sparks.
   Even if the wires are connected with a metal plate which stands
opposite that on the hearing-apparatus, .sounds are heard in the
last-mentioned experiments. If the plate on the hearing-tube is
connected with the earth, the note is stronger. The same is also
slightly the case when a glass plate is interposed. If the wire
leading to earth is not broken, no sound is heard.
   If the wires are connected with the insulated wire of a sonometer
instead of with the brass plate, nothing is heard ; if, however, an
ebonite ear-trumpet is placed on the box the sound is audible.—
