  I. On the Mean Density of the Earth.                     By Dr. Chaales
                   HUTToN, F.R.S.
Although      the determination of the mean density of the whole
terraqueous globe of our planet, is admitted to be a problem of
the utmost importance to several branches of philosophy, parti
cularly to physical astronomy, and the figure and constitution of
the earth; it would seem, from the discordancy of the declared
opinions of some eminent philosophers, that the problem is still
in an uncertain state.    Since the first notice of this subject by
Newton in his admirable Principia, it has often been incidentally
alluded to without receiving a precise determination,      with the
exception of two instances only, in which it has been stated to
be certainly or approximately determined by experiment, namely,
in the case of the Schihallien experiment, by Dr. Maskelyne and
myself; and by the Hon. Henry Cavendish, by a method invented
by Mr. Michell.
    The former of these experiments was made by Dr. Maskelyne
in the years 1774, 1775 and 1776, by means of that large moun
tain in Scotland, in measuring          its
                                     dimensions, and     comparing  in
its             on                                    of                       on
    attraction  a     plummet, with that     the whole earth    the
same; the calculations    on  the same  being  made     myself, andby
first published  in the Philos. Trans.    the year 1778; and since
                                              of of
more correctly    in  theby 2dvolume     my Mathematical Tracts.
The other experiment         Mr. Cavendish, was                by
                                                      observing the
           on   small pendulous balls,     two inches diameter,                     by
attraction                                    as of
larger ones of   ten inches diameter,    compared with the attrac
tion of the earth on the same.
  By some strange mistake,         or
                                perversion, for many years,     was           it
customary among certain persons,         withhold the mention
                                               to                                   of

have made, some little justice has lately been awarded       me          to         on I

            estimate their quantity and durations. To produce
these minute   motions, very complex  machinery     necessarily                                         is
employed, while the delicate movements are watched for many
hours together, during many days, and recorded with regard                                                                  to

the extent and time of each vibration. Then, from these spaces
and times, the density of the earth is to be calculated, by peculiar
theorems, as compared with the vibrations of common pendulums,
that are produced by the attractions of the earth.
    All these effects were so minute, and produced by machinery.
so complex, and the results calculated by theorems derived from
intricate mathematical investigations, that it is impossible at first,
for ordinary readers, to conceive how any accurate results can be
deduced from them, and even for the more judicious reader to
place confidence in them, except chiefly on account of the high
character of the experimenter himself.        From the nature of the
machinery I could therefore derive no confidence in the results,
nor compare them with the mountain experiment, without re
peating the whole of the calculations.     But, after a long life spent
in almost   daily abstruse investigations, from the tenth year of my
age, and now being at 84, and oppressed with distressing illness,
 I thought I might be excused from such a task. But after urging
more than one mathematical friend, without being able to                                        in
terest them sufficiently to engage in so severe an operation, my
anxiety to accomplish the business induced me to make an ex
ertion to effect it myself; especially as the learned experimenter
informs us, that he availed himself of the assistance of the then
Clerk of the Society, who he says made some of the experiments,
and who doubtless made most of the arithmetical computations;
operations, of both kinds, in which I remember he was also much
employed by Sir Charles Blagden, and other gentlemen, in pre
paring their papers for the Royal Society. I have therefore re
computed           all
              the experiments, and have traced the investigations
        all
in of
      the theorems; and have found that my labour has not been
     vain; but,   the contrary, has been rewarded with the follow

erroneous, the true medium being only 5-31; and                  rather                it   is
curious that that medium 5:48 has been obtained,            taking the            by

                        this were the  only error,   might perhaps     it                              be

   Here the medium of the first six of these experiments is 5:19:
of the other 23 experiments it is 5'43; and the mean of both
these means is 5:31, instead of 5-48, as stated in the former table,
being the error arising from the sum of the numerical calcula
tions. The remaining difference 0:31, about the 17th part of
the whole, must therefore be ascribed to the inaccuracy of making
and reading      off
                experiments, with such intricate and inadequate
machinery.

stead of a  mountain,   for this experiment. Such a body offers se
veral advantages for the purpose.       In the first place, the mass is
sufficiently large, standing on a base of about the size of the whole
space of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and of a height almost double of
that of St. Paul’s steeple, or near three times the height of the
Monument: then the station for the plummet, or zenith sector,
could be taken much nearer the centre of the mass than on amoun
tain, which would give a larger quantity of deviation of the plum
met; then the regular figure and the known composition of the
mass would yield great facilities in the calculation of  attraction.                        its

is vertical. Then, if we make the second inclined plate revolve, it
will turn around the reflected ray, forming always with it the same
angle; and the plane in which the second reflection takes place,
will necessarily be directed towards the different points of the ho
rizon, in different azimuths.   This being arranged, the following
phaenomena will be observed.
   When the second plane of reflection is directed in the meridian,
and consequently coincides with the first, the intensity of the light
reflected by the second glass is at its maximum.
   In proportion as the second plane, in         revolution, deviates          its
from       its
          parallelism  with the first, the intensity     the reflected                        of

agate which he employed, was bounded by parallel faces, was
about the fifteenth of an inch thick, and was cut into a plane, per
pendicular to the laminae of which it was composed.            When the
image of a taper reflected from water at an angle of 52°45', so as
to acquire the property discovered by Malus, was viewed through
the plate of agate, so as to have           laminae parallel    the plane       its                                 to

   Mr. Skrimshire has given an extensive catalogue of such sub
stances in Nicholson's Journal, 8vo, vols. 15, 16, and 19. He shows
that Canton's pyrophorus yields more light by this treatment than
any other body; but that almost every native mineral, except
metallic ores and metals, becomes more or less luminous after the
electric explosion.    A slate from Colly Weston, Northampton
shire, which effervesced with acids, gives a beautiful effect. When
the explosion of a jar is taken above the centre of a piece some
inches square, not only the part above the discharging rods is lu
minous, but the surface of the plate appears bespangled with very
minute brilliant points to some distance from           centre; and                       its

    2. This light is a constituent chemical principle of some bodies,
particularly of marine fishes, from which it may be separated by
a peculiar process, retained and rendered permanent for some
time. A solution of one part of sulphate of magnesia, in eight of
water, is the most convenient menstruum for extracting, retaining
and increasing the brilliancy of this light.      Sulphate and muriate
of soda, also answer in a proper state of dilution with water.
When any of the saline solutions is too concentrated, the light
disappears, but instantly bursts forth again from absolute dark
 ness, by dilution with water.     I have frequently made this curious
 experiment with the light procured from whiting.              Common
 water, lime-water, fermented liquors, acids even very dilute,                                       al
 kaline leys, and many other bodies, permanently extinguish this
 spontaneous light.      Boiling water destroys        but congelation  it,
 merely suspends        exhibition; for
                          its                reappears  it liquefaction.      on

  111.    Answers by Dr. W.M. BURNEY to the Queries proposed by
        John FAREY, Esq: Sen., in Phil. Mag, for June, respecting
          - Is
        Shooting Stars and Meteors.
                                    Gosport Observatory, June 11, 1821.
  SiR,       answer to   your 1st Query,   I do not think that so small
 a portion of light as that produced by reflection from the moon to
our atmosphere, when she is only one or two days old, is “suffi
cient to obscure numerous of the smallest and medium shooting
Stars.” The moon at that age is too near her conjunction with
the sun, and the light which she then reflects is fainter than that
reflected from either Jupiter or Venus when they are on the me
ridian two or three hours after sunset, at which time these pla
netary lights are sufficient to produce shadows of objects on the
ground; whereas, it does not appear that the moon’s light at that
age will do so : yet the rays of Jupiter or Venus, from my obser
vations, do not obscure the smallest shooting stars at a distance
of 30° or 35° from them.          The moon from her first to her third
 quarter may afford enough light to obscure the very smallest and
 highest of them, but not the middle-sized meteors that are formed
 low in the atmosphere.          Indeed, an observation of Dr. E. D.
 Clarke's is recorded in the llth volume of the Annals of Philo
sophy, pages 273 and 4, of his having been an eye-witness to the
perpendicular descent of a brilliant meteor to within 15° of the
horizon, at 2 o'clock P.M. on the 6th of February 1818, when
it was opposed to the full rays of the sun in a cloudless sky. The
Doctor then thought that            appearance was entirely due
                                          its                          the                       to

                                          was seen      Swaffham nearly at

sparks drawn from insulated metallic rods during a thunder-storm,
and sometimes during the passage of a nimbus, strengthen this opi
nion. I have often thought that the friction of the peculiar pro
perties of a dry portion of the air, or the gaseous exhalations from
the earth (in which we may suppose the absence of electricity),
may be the cause of accensions, or the appearance of the small
and middle sort of meteors.      From these considerations, does it
not  appear  very probable,  that  the gaseous exhalations from the
earth, and also that condensed electricities, in combination with
the properties of the atmosphere, have been the natural cause of
the largest and most ponderous Meteorites that have so often,
and in most situations, fallen on the earth's surface, and from

   To the 6th Query, I answer that it may be practicable, but
fear that, even in the present improving state of science, few men
of equal ability and skill in the doctrine of meteors are to be
found, compared with those versed in meteorology.                For with
out  being possessed  of a competent    knowledge    of  the  science, and
of proper  instruments for the   purpose,   their observations would
be rendered vague and erroneous.
   The 7th, 8th, and 9th Queries, which require time and new
observation to solve, must be left unanswered for the present.

the greater or less degrees of moisture that prevail, are some of
the causes that have most influence, more particularly on the tem
 perature of the stratum of air in the immediate vicinity of the
 earth.  But there is a predominant cause, which makes the tem
perature continually diminish as we ascend to greater heights in
the atmosphere.      We allude to that property of air, by which it
absorbs heat when it expands by being less compressed.        A por
tion of air that has become heated at the earth's surface, rises up
ward on account of         diminished density;
                                    its                ascends, the                 as    it
pressure being less,   expands and becomes colder

heat; and hence the velocity      ascent decreases, and   finally

  mond, we shall obtain results quite erroneous and unsatisfactory.
  The decrease of heat in the atmosphere, as determined by the
  ascent of balloons, seems to follow a slower rate than in the case of
  altitudes on the earth's surface. There can be no doubt that this
  manner of experimenting is free from many causes of irregularity
  to which terrestrial observations are subject. We might therefore
  hope that by this means much light would be thrown on the gra
  dation of heat in the atmosphere; but a sufficient number of
  accurate experiments are wanting to establish a conclusion in
 which confidence can be placed.            In the case of the ascent of
  Gay-Lussac, we obtain a rate of nearly 95 fathoms to a centesi
 mal degree, which is not extremely different from the mean found
 by terrestrial altitudes.
     If we could abstract from the many and powerful causes by
 which the natural and regular propagation of heat in the atmo
 sphere is continually disturbed, there is no doubt that the tem
 perature would decrease nearly in the same proportion that the
 height increases.      But this must not be understood in a sense
 strictly literal and mathematical.         If we conceive the height of
 a column of air to be divided into        portions  corresponding to the
 same    given difference of  temperature,     it is much more probable
 that these portions will form a progression increasing or de
 creasing slowly, than that they will constitute a series of perfectly
 equal increments.       Such however are the anomalies attending
 observations of the   temperature     of the atmosphere, that it is ex
 tremely difficult to determine by experiment, whether the heat
 decreases in a less or greater ratio than the height increases.
Accordingly the opinions of philosophers on this point are divided.
The late Professor Playfair, in his Outlines of Natural Philosophy,
supposes that the increment of altitude necessary for depressing
the thermometer one degree, is a quantity continually increasing
as we ascend higher.        But the contrary opinion, that the heat
decreases more      rapidly  than the height increases, is more ge
nerally prevalent; and it seems to deserve the preference, be
cause it is adopted by those philosophers, such as Ilumboldt and
Ramond, who have more particularly directed their attention to
this research.
    We may draw from the theory of the astronomical refractions
an argument in favour of the conclusion, that the heat of the         at
mosphere decreases in a greater ratio than the height increases.
It has hitherto been found to be impossible to reconcile the hori
zontal refraction of the stars with the actual rate of the decrease
of heat in the atmosphere.          If we adopt the law of a uniform
decrease of    temperature,     and take the rate at 90 fathoms to a
centesimal degree as found by experiment, the horizontal refrac
tion thence determined will exceed the true quantity by about a

minute of a degree.     In order to reconcile the theory with astro
nomical observations, the elevation for one degree of depression
of the thermometer must be diminished by a fifth part, or rather
more.        insteadIf,                 of

displayed in the experimental investigation of the formula, it
seems hardly possible to ascertain, from that process alone, the
degree of confidence that ought to be placed in  accuracy. The                                its

   It is extremely probable that, in regard to the astronomical re
fractions, Professor Leslie's formula will be found to be equivalent
to the law of a uniform gradation of temperature in the atmo
sphere, the rate at which the heat decreases depending upon the
constant coefficient.    If this conjecture shall turn out to be just,
it must be allowed that the introducing of the formula can have
no other effect than to lead off the attention from the true prin
ciples and the real difficulties of the problem.

V. On the black Rete mucosum of the Negro being a Defence
  against the scorching Effect of the Sun's Rays. By Sir
  EveRARD Home, Bart. F.R.S.*
To                    of the black colour of the rete mucosum in
       ascertain the use
the Negro, has occupied the attention of many physiologists;
and I confess that this subject formed the first investigation in
which I ever engaged.     Fruitless, indeed, were my attempts; and
when I learnt that black surfaces absorbed heat, and raised the
temperature several degrees beyond any others, I gave the matter
up in despair. Two years ago my attention was again called to
this inquiry, upon being told by our late excellent President, that
a silver fish, in a pond at Spring Grove, during a very hot sum
mer, immediately after some trees by which the pond was shaded
were cut down, was so much exposed to the sun's rays as to have
its back scorched, the surface putting                      on
                                             the same appearance                                           as
after  aburn, and  rising above the scales     the surrounding skin.
                                                                 of
I saw the fish several times, and directions were given          send                      to              it
to me when      died; but was not

that subject.
   The effect of the sun's rays upon the fish under water, led me
to suspect the mixture of light and heat to be the cause of this
scorching effect.
   To ascertain the truth of this opinion, I made the following
experiments.

became vascular under my eye       the pain was very severe.

      Erp. G.-September 8,  1820, at eleven o’clock, the heat in
 the sun 90°; the concentrated rays applied to my naked arm
 produced a vesicle.   This experiment was repeated when the
 heat was 84°, and in seven minutes a blister formed on the arm.
      Exp. 7.—September 9th,  eleven o’clock, the thermometer in
the sun at 90°. The concentrated rays applied to a piece of black
kerseymere cloth, made tight round my arm for 15 minutes, gave
no real pain, and left no impression whatever on the skin,                                al
though the nap of the cloth had been destroyed.
   This experiment was repeated with white kerseymere, the heat
at 86°; in 15 minutes a blister was formed.
   Repeated with Irish linen, the thermometer 86°.     In 15 mi
nutes a blister was formed, and coagulable lymph thrown out,
which had become vascular.
     The same experiment  was made with a white handkerchief
loose upon  the hand, the heat 83°.  In 15 minutes an inflam
matory blush was produced over a surface of several inches ex
tent, which almost immediately disappeared on withdrawing the
hand from the sun's rays.
      Erp. 8.—September    12th. The sun's heat at noon 85°. The
concentrated  rays  applied  to the back of the hand of a Negro
from  Grenada,  for 15  minutes,  produced no visible effect; at the
first moment he felt a stab  going   inwards, but that went off, and
 afterwards he had no pain.
    From these experiments, it is evident that the power of the
 sun's rays to scorch the skin of animals is destroyed when ap
plied to a black surface, although the absolute heat, in conse
quence of the absorption of the rays, is greater.
    The same wise providence which has given so extraordinary a
provision to the Negro for the defence of his skin, while living
within the tropics, has extended it to the bottom of the eye, which
otherwise would suffer in a greater or less degree when exposed
to strong light; the retina, from       transparency, allowing
                                                     its                                it

pass through without injury.

   “Having had frequent opportunities, during my residence in
France, of seeing a great many repeating reflecting circles, several
of which I observed with, and having found much consistency in
the results deduced from observations made with them ; it oc
curred to me, that if I could engage Mr. Troughton to execute
one for me, it would be a most perfect instrument.” This was
done, it appears from the General’s memoir, previous to the 8th of
November 1817, and since, the latitude deduced is about 50°20'.
We believe the observations had been made in France. The
General pays a just tribute to Mr. Troughton as an artist, and
then adds,          “I
                  beg to be permitted to be a little more particular
than I otherwise should, as to the manner I have pursued in cal
culating and deducing the latitudes from the instrument, as it is
 not by any means as yet generally known in England, although
 I have no doubt that when quite understood it will be found to
 surpass      all

claims     Mr. R. finds that the theorems of correction are pre
cisely the same. We beg leave to remark, that there is a typo
graphical error in the denominator of the first factor of the first
term in General B.'s formula, which he tells us with an honest
frankness he got from Delambre.       This however is corrected in
the second line below, though one still remains in the second
term in both places.     As Mr. R. says the two are the same, his
of course partakes of the same error, which we wonder much he
has not corrected     “But,” says Mr. R. on the subject of the
theorem,     “I
              dare say  neither of us fancies he has made any dis
covery.” I do not know what Mr. R. may at some future period
be tempted to think, but sure am I that General B. can think no

 VIII.     On the magnetic Phaenomena produced by Electricity, in
        a Letter from Sir H. Davy, Bart.- F.R.S. to W. H. Wol
        LAston, M.D. P.R.S.*
 MY       DEAR             Sin,       The
                           similarity of the laws of electrical and
 magnetic attraction has often impressed philosophers; and many
 years ago, in the progress of the discoveries made with the Vol
 taic pile, some inquirers (particularly M. Rittert) attempted to
 establish the existence of an identity or intimate relation between
 these two powers; but their views being generally obscure, or
 their experiments inaccurate, they were neglected: the chemical
 and electrical phaenomena exhibited by the wonderful combination
 of Volta, at that time almost entirely absorbed the attention of
 scientific men; and the discovery of the fact of the true con
 nexion between electricity and magnetism, seems to have been re
 served for M. CErsted, and for the present year.
    This discovery, from                              its
                                 importance and unexpected nature,
 cannot fail     awaken    tostrong    interesta   the scientific world;                 in

    same manner as in the last experiment; the other wires seemed
    to have no effect, except in acting merely as parts of the elec

inches, the effect was sensible; and it increased with the quan
tity of immersion.    Two arrangements of this kind acted more
powerfully than  one;  but when the two were combined so as to
make the zinc and copper-plates but parts of one combination,
the effect was very much greater.    This was shown still more
distinctly in the following experiment.          Sixty zinc plates with
double  copper-plates   were  arranged     in alternate order, and the
quantity of iron filings which a wire of a determinate thickness
took up observed: the wire remaining the same, they were ar
ranged so as to make a series of thirty; the magnetic effect ap
peared more than twice as great; that              the wire raised more     is,

  The facility with which experiments were made with the com
mon Leyden battery, enabled me to ascertain several circum
stances which were easy to imagine, such as that a tube filled
with sulphuric acid of a quarter of an inch in diameter, did not
transmit sufficient electricity to render steel magnetic ; that a
needle placed transverse to the explosion through air, was less
magnetized than when the electricity was passed through wire;
that steel bars exhibited no polarity (at least at their extremities)
when the discharge was made through them as part of the cir
cuit, or when they were placed parallel to the discharging wire;
that two bars of steel fastened together, and having the dis
charging wire placed through their common centre of gravity,
showed little or no signs of magnetism after the discharge till
they were separated, when they exhibited their north and south
poles opposite to each other, according to the law of position.
    These experiments distinctly showed, that imagnetism was pro
duced whenever concentrated electricity passed through space;

it was evident, that if the similar sides could be brought in con
 tact, steel filings upon them would repel each other.—This was
very easily tried with two Voltaic batteries arranged parallel to
each other, so that the positive end of one was opposite to the
negative end of the other: steel filings upon two wires of pla
tinum joining the extremities strongly repelled each other. When
the batteries were arranged in the same order, i.e. positive oppo
site to positive, they attracted each other; and wires of platinum
(without filings) and fine steel wire (still more strongly) exhibited
similar phaenomena of attraction and repulsion under the same
circumstances.
   As bodies magnetized by electricity put a needle in motion, it
was natural to infer that a magnet would put bodies magnetized
by electricity in motion; and this I found was the case.    Some
pieces of wire of platinum, silver, and copper, were placed sepa
rately upon two knife edges of platinum connected with two ends
of a powerful Voltaic battery, and a magnet presented to them;
they were        made  all roll along the knife edges, being attracted
                                      to
when the north      pole                   of
                              the magnet was presented, the positive
side     the battery being
          of                        the right hand, and repelled when
                                                     on
it was      the left hand; and vice versa, changing the pole
               on                                                      the                                        of

                                                     June 20, 1821.Pocklington,
SIR,   -- Tn E following remarks  on that curious insect called the
Glow-worm, are founded on my own experience.—If you think
they will be entertaining or useful to any of your readers, they
are at your service.
   The glow-worm is an insect of the beetle kind:—the female
deposits her eggs in the months of June or July, among moss,
grass, &c. : these eggs are of a yellow colour, and emit light.
After remaining about five or six weeks, the larvae break the
shells and make their appearance: at first they appear white,
and are very small; but they soon increase in size, and their co
lour changes to a dark brown or nearly black colour.              The body
of the larva is formed of eleven rings; it has six feet, and two
rows of reddish spots down the back.            It emits light in the dark:
this   light  arises from the last   ring  of      body under the tail, and
                                                                 its
appears like two brilliant spots when examined attentively.
    The larvae are seen creeping about and shining during the fine
nights     in  autumn, and the light they emit               direct them    is   to                   to
                                  offon
their food: they feed         small snails, the carcases        insects, &c.          of
They frequently cast           their skins.
    After the expiration              of
                                about one year and nine months from
their birth, they arrive        their perfect size—they then cease
                                       at                                                             to
eat, cast off their skin, and assume another appearance: the form
of   the perfect insect may         discovered through
                                            be                thin skin that      a
 covers them.       After remaining                 in
                                           this state two       three weeks           or
(scarcely ever moving) they throw off their last skin, and arrive
at    perfection.     The male then appears          perfect beetle, having
                                                                   a
 wings, and covers        the same. The female,

 SIR. —      A SELECT Committee of the House of Commons, on
 Weights and Measures, after considering the three several Re
ports * of the late Government Commissioners on the same sub
ject, have made a Report to the House (which was ordered to be
 printed on the 2Sth of May, and which doubtless will find a place
in your present or some early Numbert) in which Report, after
a well-merited compliment paid to Capt. Kater, for his elaborate
 and gratuitous Experiments on the Pendulum, in London, and for
similar Observations on the principal Stations of the Trigonome
trical Survey of Great Britain, the Commisioners remark as fol
lows, viz. “From these observations, deductions have been made,
of great importance with respect to the general figure of the
Earth,      density and internal construction. So that your Com
             its

                                      of    will   highly proper                         be

and repeated, at so many others of the British Stations, as to be
able to institute rigid calculations, of the lengths of degrees of
Latitude, on two or three other Meridians, besides that already
calculated, which passes through Dunnose in the Isle of Wight;
and also degrees of Longitude, (or else of great circles perpen
dicular to some particular meridian) in several different Latitudes:
in order, that by the consistency and agreement or otherwise,
amongst the results, with the known fact of the Earth nearly ap
proaching in figure to an Ellipsoid slightly flattened at the Poles,
it may be seen, and duly appreciated, what degree of dependence
can be placed on the methods of observations and calculations,
which hitherto have been adopted or recommended.
    In particular I am anxious, that the District around and to the
northward of Arbury Hill, wherein Capt. Kater has concluded,
that a mass of the Stratification of great comparative specific
 Gravity, must be situated, at no great depth below the surface,
should be surrounded and crossed by several lines or degrees of
 latitude and of longitude, and by those also of oblique Arcs or
 Rhombs, between the several Stations surrounding the district
 under investigation: from which, and the proposed minute Stra
 tigraphical Surveys, to try the practicability, of consistently de
 ducing the magnitude, shape, position and specific Gravity of
 the supposed heavy or deflecting Mass, which is assumed to have
 occasioned such a deflection of the plumb-line at Arbury Hill
 Station, as to have presented the anomaly, of degrees of the Me
 ridian, increasing in length, in the contrary direction to those of
 the Ellipsoid, above alluded to: and whether or not, a mass of
  Granite, the top of which presents itself at Mount Sorrel, Grooby,
 and other places” in and near to the south part of Charnwood
 Forest, is sufficient to account wholly, or in considerable part, for
 the deflection alluded to.
     Until the facts as to our own country shall have been settled
 beyond dispute or doubt; or at least, until the attempt shall se
 riously have been made, to explain or remove the Arbury-Hill
 anomaly in the lengths of meridional Degrees, it would, I submit
 to your Readers, be premature, and likely to perpetuate rather
 than to remove errors, if the Observations, merely as hitherto
 conducted, and without going more deeply into the subject, were
 extended to the other countries of Europe, with the view, as the
 Committee appear to propose, of thereby coming to definitive

conclusions       as to the dimensions,                      figure and structure             of the
 Earth.
     Entertaining as I do, a high respect for the person, abilities
 and labours of Dr. MacCulloch, and not being by any means de
 sirous of undervaluing the Services to Mineralogy and Geology
 which he has performed, and on which I understand him to be
 yet engaged in Scotland, and with respect to a mineralogical
Map and description of that Kingdom, as is briefly mentioned in
 p.228 of your 56th volume, I hope and trust, that what I am going
further to remark, may not give offence to that Gentleman or any
of his Friends.     It was naturally to be expected from the an
nouncement made in 1816, which is quoted in p. 427 of your
48th volume, that the making of minute stratigraphical Maps
and Sections around each principal Station of the Trigonometrical
 Survey, in Scotland, at the least, was then intended: I have not
however yet been able to learn, that any such materials for cal
culation, as to the existence and extent of local deflecting causes
on the plumb-line in Scotland, have resulted from Dr. MacCul
loch's appointment; or that anything has been attempted of this
kind in England, by him or any other person.
    If Government have seen it right to devote a part of the public
Money to the making of a Mineralogical Survey and Map of
Scotland,       (in
                addition                to
                           the sums devoted        Canals, Bridges, to   its

    P. S.—Mr. WiLLIAM SMITH, after the considerable interrup
 tion to the publication of his series of County Geological Maps,
 which has originated in the unhandsome treatment received, in the
 quarter from whence he should have expected effective patronage,
 has completed his Map of Yorkshire, in four sheets, and the same
 is now in course of delivery by Cary of St. James's street: this
 Map, from embracing almost the whole series of the British
 Strata, and from the ample details which it contains, cannot fail
 of being acceptable to Land and Mineral Owners, and to      those                                     all

   In Switzerland, however, by a very simple contrivance the ob
jections to the scythe have been completely obviated.            Each
 mower is   accompanied  by  a person  bearing  a light straight long
pole, whose business it is to press the pole in a horizontal position
against the stems of the corn which are to be cut, so as to bend
the ears considerably away from the mower, and leave him a full,
fair, stroke at the aggregated stems. The pole is best made of
deal, much about the thickness of the handle of a sweeping-brush,
and in Switzerland is commonly about nine feet in length; but
this must be determined by the nature of the scythe used", or
rather by the sweep or extent of the stroke : for the person who
 bears the pole must be out of the reach of          danger from the         all
scythe, and              at
                 the same time there must           sufficient length   be                                  of

corn which the mower can       compass    with his  scythe.     The per
son who bears the pole, commonly         lad, stands with his face to

as the bearer finds most convenient; and steadied, either against
his body,    his thigh, according

are thus pressed back never straggle, either during       after the                      or
stroke, but slide along the pole; which,       properly held, keepsif
them quite even, and they will fall one way, smoothly and regu
larly.
   Should the corn have been beaten down      rain     storm, the       by              or
scythe cannot certainly               be

the field, and put small cross bars or rods, from stake to stake, so
as to bear the stems up; and after this the corn may be mowed.
But in the case of a fine, even, upright crop, whether of wheat
or other grain, there can be uo hesitation in preferring the
scythe and pole, if properly used, to the sickle.
   After the mower has passed on, two or more women or boys,
commonly women, follow, whose business it is gently and care
fully to spread the corn that has been mowed, much in the same
way that flax or hemp is spread, in even regular layers.        When
properly dried, a third operation preparatory to binding is per
formed by two other persons, commonly women, one of whom
earries two wands or rods, about four feet in length, the other
one rod only.     The person carrying the two rods, thrusts them,
one in each   hand,  under the layer of corn which lies spread out
on the   ground;   the person with the single wand, at the same
time standing opposite to the other, puts the single wand under
the layer, directly midway between the two opposite wands. Then
the hands are raised, whilst the points of the rods or wands re
 main on the ground, and thus the corn slides, or is shoved        to
gether, in heaps large enough for binding.        If the crop is thin,
the gatherings must begin the wider apart, or two gatherings
may be united, and great attention during this operation is paid
to collecting any scattered or straggling stems.      The same ope
ration  may  be performed  with a  long-toothed  rake;   but the corn
is shaken much less when the wands are used.
   The binders follow those who have collected the heaps:          and
it is to be particularly noted, that the Swiss do not    use the fresh
 cut corn for bands, but make them, at home in the barns, of
straw, at some convenient time in advance.         When wanted for
use, they are carted to the field, and distributed along the rows.
The time spent in knotting the bands in the fields is thus saved,
and the loss of grain from twisting the bands or rubbing against
other sheaves in carrying home is avoided.
   The advantages derived from this method, and the division of
labour, will be obvious to any person who has once seen the per
fect practice; and I do not think there is any exaggeration in
stating, that with the same hands, a crop may by such means be
saved in half the time.    But I am inclined to go further, and ex
press my conviction, that the crop may be saved in half the time
with even fewer hands than the sickle requires.        Much however
will certainly depend on the dexterity and willingness of the peo
ple employed; but the mere experiment of the scythe and pole
may be tried without any expense or difficulty.

Report    of the Select Committee on the Ophthalmic Hospital.
   pp. 8. 8vo.
   It is with much pleasure we have perused this Report of a Se
lect Committee of the House of Commons, on a branch of the
public service which has of late been the object of much jealousy,
 and, we must add, of much calumny and misrepresentation.           It
is drawn  up  with  great  clearness and ability; and it does merited
justice to the exertions of the individual whose discoveries, or at
 least superior intelligence and skill, gave rise to and placed him
 at the head of the Ophthalmic Establishment.
    “The objects of this institution,” says the Committee, “ have
 been stated to us to be three.
   “First, To   diffuse, generally, among the surgeons of the army,
the  knowledge  of the best modes of treating the chronic and third
                                                           -
stage of the disorder.
   “Secondly, To diminish, if possible, the charge of the out
pensioners of Chelsea Hospital, by curing or relieving men who
had received pensions for defective sight.
   “Thirdly, To check in some degree the annual augmentation
of the pension list, by treating men about to be discharged for
defective sight, and by thus diminishing their claim to pension, as
far as it might be founded upon the impaired state of their vision.
   “Your Committee are of opinion that these objects were of
sufficient importance to justify the steps which were taken for
their attaininent.
   “With     respect to the first point, your Committee have the sa
 tisfaction to find, that this, which was the most imyortant ob
ject, has been greatly promoted. The ophthalmia having upon
 the return of our troops from Egypt become, comparatively speak
 ing, a new disease in this country,     its   proper treatment was     at
 first imperfectly understood.    It   appears, however, that the at
 tention of  the Medical Department      of   the army has  of  late years
 been most    successfully  directedto  this  subject,  and that the best
 modes   of treating  all  the different stages  of   the ophthalmia are
 now well understood and practised       in  the army; and your Com
                                                                    mittee

mittee are satisfied, that the establishment of the Hospital, under
Sir William Adams, has greatly contributed to promote this de
 sirable object, not only by the direct opportunity it afforded of
studying the various modes of practice, but indirectly, by the
manner in which it appears to have excited the emulation and
attention of other practitioners.
    “With respect to the second point, indeed, it has been stated,
that valid doubts were suggested, how far it was in the power of
the Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital to take away, or diminish,
any pension which they had granted under the provisions of the
act of the 46 Geo. III. ; and consequently, your Committee have
not thought it necessary to direct their inquiries to this point, as
no diminution of pensions already granted could, under any cir
culmstances, have been effected.
    “With respect to the third point, as but a few men so circum
stanced have been placed in the Hospital, it does not appear to
your Committee, that Sir William Adams has had sufficient op
portunity of showing how                  far
                                     could have effected this object,
                                                he
upon the scale originally proposed.      But the general diffusion                                     of
 knowledge among the medical officers            the army, must ne

cessarily lead      to
                   the accomplishment        this end.     of
    “With regard                                   this establishment,
                             to to
                       the future continuance                        of

                                                the Department with
which     originated, that the main objects for which
         it                                                  was insti               it
tuted   having  thus been   attained,     does not   appear
                                                      it      that any
public inconvenience would now arise from
                                                                      to its

Inthis opinion your Committee are disposed           concur, and they
therefore        ecommend, that the Establishment should      discon                      be
tinued,     as   soon    as

effected.
     “Upon       the claims        Sir William Adams upon the public, your
                                     of

place of safety in his park, and I was afterwards most hospitably
entertained at his mansion. To him my gratitude is due; and but
for his kind exertions, I have no doubt the balloon would have
suffered considerable injury from the great crowd of persons that
assembled on my descent.       I believe, from the best calculation
I can make, that I travelled altogether, in various directions, up
wards of 50 miles.

 magnitude and destructive effects, have been entertained,                 think         I

gineer to the directors general of inland navigation, to carry into
execution any works that could be devised to arrest the progress
of the bog. Mr. Killaly at once perceived that the only feasible
remedy was to draw off the water that had accumulated; and to
accomplish this end, he employed a number of labourers, to open
the course of the stream where it was choked up, and also the
drains through the valley that could be directed into the stream.
By this means the head of the water was soon lowered, and in
consequence the bog ceased to flow, and                 the loose masses    to all
which floated            on

islands disappear, and nothing is observed but a thin deposit,
consisting of granulated black bog-mud, varying from one to
three feet in thickness. This, though destructive for the present
year, may when dry be burnt, and removed for manure to the
neighbouring uplands, or left on the spot to fertilize the valley.
    Thus the whole distance which the bog has flowed is about
three miles in length, namely, one mile and a half in the bog,
and the same distance over the moory valley; and the extent co
vered amounts to about 150 acres.

                   THE NORTHERN       EXPEDITION.
  We have been favoured with the following interesting extract
of a letter from

                                Coast of America, June 26, 1821.
  “I    take the opportunity of writing you, by the return of the
Nautilus transport, which accompanied us to carry our heavy
stores.   We have had an excellent passage from the Orkneys to
this part of the world; the weather, however, since we have been
here, has not been so favourable.
   “We have made two attempts to unload the transport, having
made fast to icebergs for that purpose, but have been blown off
successively by heavy gales, with the loss of some of our boats
from the deck, and no small share of tribulation for the trans
port, which has not been properly fortified for the ice. She has
come off, however, very well, considering everything, having only
lost the copper from her bows.     We are now taking advantage
of a fine day, and hope to get rid of her in a day or two, and to
proceed on our destination.
   “We made an island about a week ago, called Resolution
Island, where we expected to see some Indians; but there was
so much ice between the ships and the land, that we could not

   “I   can hardly give you an idea of our intended route, or,
more properly, of our ideal route; first, because our course must,
in a great measure, depend upon the state of the ice; secondly,
for want of a chart; for those in common use are so incorrect in

78                                           Meteorology.
                                            To Dr. Tilloch.
                                         -             Gosport Observatory,   July   5, 1821.
     SIR,-]  herewith forward for your Philosophical Magazine
and   Journal,  a description of a meteoric phaenomenon that ap
peared here last evening, in order to obtain, if possible, a more
satisfactory account of it from some other observer situated
further to the westward, in which direction it lay.
   I find the latitude of this place (which you asked for on the
cover of your last Number), from many observations, to be 50°
47'38" north; and longitude 1" 6' 40" west of Greenwich.       In
time 4' 26".7.
                         I am, sir, your obedient servant,
                                                                      William BURNEY.
     A meteoric appearance of triangular and spheroidal forms, was
observed here last evening (July 4th) between 9 and 10 o'clock,
about W. by S. 11° or 12° above the horizon, and to the north
of the moon, which was hid by a cumulostratus, so as only to
show small portions of her deep red crescent at intervals, through
the apertures of that compound cloud. Had the moon been some
days older, to have enabled her to reflect a strong light in the at
tenuated haze in which this phaenomenon was apparently situ
ated, I should have attributed it to a paraselene; as it was not
far beyond the ordinary distance of one from the moon, and dis
played bright prismatic colours, as deep red, yellow, &c.             But
the aforesaid forms which it alternately assumed, and which were
serrated round the edges; the diverging pencil rays issuing from
the object, both in horizontal and perpendicular directions; the
surprising contractions and expansions which it repeatedly un
derwent, from upwards of a degree and a half to a mere point,
and then gradually increasing to           former brilliancy and extent;

XVI. On             the Problem in Nautical Astronomy                                     for finding                 the
     Latitude by Means of two Observations of the Sun's Altitude

Thr method       generally practised in the British Navy for solving
this  problem  was invented by Douwes, an examiner of sea officers
and   pilots at Amsterdam, who proposed it to the English Admi
ralty in 1740. It is however no more than a very limited solu
tion; since it can only be applied with the desired success to
correct the latitude by account when one of the observations is
very near the meridian, or when the middle time is very little
different from half the interval between the two observations.
In   allother cases one application     the rules will hardly lead

which adds to the length and perplexity of the operations, before
too complicated.     In the Quarterly Journal of Science, No. 22,
Dr.  Brinkley has computed   an example making allowance for the
change of declination; and if a fair comparison be instituted be
tween his calculation and that by the direct method, as applied
to the same example in No. 21 of the same Journal, it appears
hardly possible to avoid giving the preference in every respect to
the latter.
   I have now to propose a direct solution of the problem, sim
pler and easier in the calculation than that recommended by
Delambre, and which, I conceive, will be found more convenient
in practice than the indirect process commonly used. In ex
plaining this solution I shall first assume that the sun's declina
tion is the same at both the observations and equal to the mean
quantity between the two times; and I shall afterwards point
out an easy way of correcting the error which this assumption
introduces in the result.
   The principles of the method are contained in this preliminary
proposition.

88                               On finding the Latitude.
        This is Dr. Brinkley's third example (pp.    11 and 12).     It is
an unfavourable instance for his rules, requiring several compu
tations and corrections to arrive at a right result.         It admits of
two solutions but without       ambiguity,  if the latitude   by account
be sufficient to ascertain that the true latitude   is  less than 5° 46',
the  complement    of p.    The other latitude is 1° 31'-6.
   These examples will be sufficient for showing the method of
calculation.    I proceed now to consider the correction required
for the sun's change of declination in the interval between the
observations.     The true place of the pole will now be at P', with
out the great circle DO which bisects the arc AB, because the
polar distances P'A and                    P
                                 B are unequal.    Draw P'P perpen
dicuar to that    great  circle,  and complete   the isosceles triangle
AP3. The arcs AP and PB make               equal angles with the circle
 P’P; and hence in the small change of place from P to P', one
 of          the
         two arcs AP' and BP' will increase just     much      the                         P            as

 other decreases;  and each     the arcs AP and of    will   equal                                     be

brief recapitulation, with the view merely of connecting them
with what is to follow.
   In the first of these essays (Nicholson's Journal, 8vo, June,
1805), I detailed a series of experiments on the gases obtained
by the destructive distillation of wood, peat, pit-coal, oil, wax,
&c., from which it appeared that the fitness of those gases for
artificial illumination was greater, as they required for combustion
a greater proportional volume of ºxygen; and that the gases gene
rated from different inflammable bodies, or from the same inflam
mable substance under different circumstances, are not so many
distinct species, which under such a view of the subject would be
almost infinite in number, but are mixtures of a few well known
gases, chiefly of carburetted hydrogen with variable proportions
of olefiant, simple hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic
acid, carbonic oxide, and azotic gases; and that the elastic fluids
obtained from coal, oil, &c. have probably, in addition to these,
an inflammable vapour diffused through them when recent, which
is not removed by passing them through water *. In the same
paper I explained certain anomalies that appear in the experi
ments of the late Mr. Cruickshank, of Woolwich, which are not
at    all chargeable              as
                            errors upon that excellent chemist, and

that a similar decline in the value of the products takes place,
but not to the same extent, owing, probably, to the greater uni
formity of temperature which is attainable in large operations”.
   On the practical conclusions, which it was the object of the
last mentioned Essay to establish, I forbear to dwell, because they
are unconnected with my present purpose, which is limited to
the chemical constitution of these compound gases, and to the
methods of separating them accurately from each other. The
view of their nature and composition, which was taken in the
first Essay, was opposed by those able philosophers M. Berthol
let, and Dr. Murray, of Edinburgh, who both contended for
greater latitude as to the proportions in which hydrogen and
charcoal are capable of uniting, and considered these proportions
indeed as subject to no limitation.        The facts, however, which
have since been    multiplied  in this,  as well as in other depart
ments of     chemistry,  tending   to   prove  that bodies capable of
energetic combination unite in a few definite proportions only,
leave little doubt that the same law holds good with respect to
the compounds of hydrogen and charcoal. Not that it is meant
that the known compounds of those elements are the only possi
ble ones; for others will probably be discovered, which will still
be found conformable to the general law, that when one body
combines with another in different proportions, the greater pro
portions are multiples of the less by an entire number.
    A different view of the subject has lately been taken by the
ingenious author of the Bakerian Lecture, published in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1820.         In that paper, Mr. Brande
has endeavoured to      prove,  that the gas called light carburetted
hydrogen, or simply carburetted hydrogen, or hydro-carburet, is
 not entitled to be considered as a distinct species; that the only
aériform compound of charcoal and hydrogen, which is with cer
tainty known to exist, is the gas called olefiant, or bi-carburetted
hydrogen; and that the gases evolved by heat from coal and oil,
are in fact nothing more than mixtures of olefiant and simple
hydrogen gases in various proportions.
   In assuming, in the first Essay, the existence of light carbu
retted hydrogen as      a     definite compound,      characterized      by   its   re
quiring, for the complete combustion      each volume, two volumes

distillation of camphor, from which it differs essentially in com
position, it is plain that he was not correctly acquainted with the
properties of pure carburetted hydrogen.         Previously to the se
cond set of experiments, I satisfied myself by the careful analysis
of a specimen of the gas from stagnant water, for which I was
indebted to Mr. Dalton, that it really has the properties which
have been ascribed to it by him as characteristic; and in
 1807 I found precisely the same characters in the fire-damp of
coal-mines *. Dr. Thomson, also, from experiments in 181 lit,
on the gas from stagnant water, and Sir Humphry Davy f, from
the analysis of the fire-damp in 1815, drew the same conclusions.
It is in the power, indeed, of every chemist to investigate for
himself the properties and composition of carburetted hydrogen
gas, since it may easily be procured in considerable quantity, by
stirring the bottom of almost any stagnant pool, especially if
composed of clay.       During the last summer, I obtained it from
a source of this kind, which afforded it in such abundance, that
several gallons might have been collected in a few minutes. This
gas I submitted to repeated and most careful examination.             It

having acquired a small quantity of those gases which are always
present in water, and of which it is impossible
                                           -    to deprive it even
by long continued boiling.
   The process, by which carburetted hydrogen gas is evolved in
natural operations, is no doubt the decomposition of water, and
admits of being explained on the atomic theory of Mr. Dalton,
by supposing two atoms of charcoal to act at once on two atoms
of water.  One atom of charcoal attracts the two atoms of hy
drogen, forming carburetted hydrogen gas, and the other atom
of charcoal unites with two atoms of oxygen, constituting carbo
nic acid. This is illustrated by the annexed
figure, in which two atoms of charcoal C.C. are
represented as interposed between two atoms of
                                                 GDGC <>
water, each consisting of an atom of hydrogen ( 0.
and an atom of oxygen.     Dividing the diagram
  vertically into three parts, we have the original substances; and
 separating it horizontally, we obtain the two new compounds.
 This theoretical view of the subject is confirmed by the fact, that
 the carburetted hydrogen, formed at the bottom of stagnant
 pools, is never accompanied by carbonic oxide, but always by
 carbonic acid, the full quantity of which is prevented from ap
 pearing, in consequence of the absorption of a great part of it by
 the mass of water, under which the changes are taking place.
     Being provided with such an abundant supply of carburetted
 hydrogen, I availed myself of it to examine the mutual action of
 that gas and chlorine on each other, principally with a view to
ascertain, how far reliance may be placed on the latter as an            in
strument in the analysis of mixed combustible gases. This is a
part of the subject that was first investigated, though with a dif
ferent view, by Mr. Cruickshank”.         He observed that a mixture
of chlorine with hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, or carbonic
oxide, in certain proportions, kept in a bottle entirely filled with
the mixture, and furnished with an air-tight stopper, did not ex
hibit any immediate action, but that in twenty-four hours, on
withdrawing the stopper, the fluid immediately rushed in, and
filled most of the space originally occupied by the gases.     But he
was not aware of the influence of      light on these changes,  which
was discovered about the same time by Gay Lussact and by Dal
ton f.     It does not, however, appear to have been ascertained
by either of them, whether the complete exclusion of light pre
vents any degree of action of chlorine and carburetted hydrogen
on each other.       I mixed, therefore, those two gases in different
proportions in well stopped vials, which were completely filled

 with the mixture, and covered by opake cases.      When the stop
  pers were removed under water, at various intervals after the mix
  ture, from a few minutes to 39 days, no diminution whatever of
 volume was found to have taken place; and after having removed
 the chlorine by liquid potash, the carburetted hydrogen gas gave
 the usual products of carbonic acid, and consumed the usual pro
 portion of oxygen.     Mixtures also of hydrogen and chlorine, and
 of carburetted hydrogen and chlorine, standing over water in
 graduated tubes, which were shaded by opake covers, sustained
 no loss of bulk, except what arose from the absorption of chlorine
 by the water, the combustible gas remaining wholly unaltered.
 It may be considered, therefore, as quite essential to the mutual
 agency of these gases, that they should be subjected to the                                       in
 fluence of light.   But it is not necessary that the direct rays of
 the sun should fall on the mixture, the light of a dull and cloudy
 day being fully adequate to the effect.    On a day of this sort, I
 filled several stoppered vials, graduated into hundredths of a cu
bic inch, with a mixture of 30 volumes of carburetted hydrogen
with from S0 to 90 of chlorine, and uncovering them        the same                all   at
moment, exposed them        the feeble light which was then abroad.

or twenty minutes, and then quickly washing the remaining gas
with dilute solution of potash, in order to remove the excess of
chlorine.   From the volume of the residuary gas, it was neces
sary to deduct the amount of impurity previously ascertained to
exist in the chlorine; and the remainder, taken from the volume
of mixed   gases which had been operated on, showed how much
olefiant  gas   had been condensed by the chlorine.              When very
narrow tubes were        employed,   and the column of        gases   mixed                                  .
with chlorine was of considerable length, a longer continuance of
the experiment was found necessary, and the gases were suffered
to remain in contact during an hour or more.                 In this way it
was   ascertained,   that olefiant gas  may   be accurately    separated by
chlorine from    hydrogen,    carburetted  hydrogen,    or carbonic oxide
gases, or from mixtures of two or more of those gases, which are
left quite unchanged in volume and in chemical properties, when
light has been carefully excluded from the mixture.
    This property of chlorine is the foundation of a fresh analysis,
to which I have thought it expedient to submit the gases from
coal and oil, in order to decide what acriform fluids remain after
the separation of that portion which is condensible by chlorine;
—whether the residue consists, as I have heretofore maintained,
of carburetted hydrogen chiefly, with variable proportions of                                        hy
drogen and carbonic oxide; or whether, according to the new
view of the subject, it consists of hydrogen gas only.

on from 60 to 80 cubic inches of             gas         oil

100                                    On the Discovery                of
courage and perseverance, amidst appalling difficulties, and trials
almost superhuman.
   Though currents and other circumstances sufficiently evince the
existence of a North-west passage, it would appear, from the ac
counts before us, that there cannot be a hope of accomplishing
it in the parallel of the newly-discovered Georgian Islands. In
your Number of January, it was recommended to attempt to ef
fect a passage into the Hyperborean Sea, out of Repulse Bay, at
the North extremity of Hudson's Bay; and there, at this moment,
the discovery ships are making such attempt.     This dreary and
inhospitable coast runs nearly East and West, about the parallel
of 70°, and between 90° and 160° of West longitude, to Icy Cape,
where the American coast runs South-south-west to Behring's
Straits. We have no accounts of this coast on which any reliance
can be put; and if we credit such as we have, the sea in these
Northern regions is constantly frozen up. It appears from Cook's
Voyages, that even in summer the sea was frozen over between
the Russian and American coasts.            This shows, that whatever
may be the result of the present attempt to the East or West of
Southampton Island, there cannot remain the slightest hope of
effecting the passage through Behring's Straits. In former state
ments, there was some reason to suppose that the passage would
be achieved through the Polar Basin, considerably to the North
ward of the parallel of the new discoveries, with the disadvantage
of a longer run than by the usual course.             however, the northIf,

    Having premised thus much, I come now to the most import
ant object of this paper, and paramount to every other considera
tion attached to the subject. If no other advantage arose from
the present voyages than the recent discovery of a North-west
Magnetic Pole, that alone is so valuable to science in establishing,
in process of time, a sure theory of the Magnetic Variation, so                                                 in
dispensable for nautical purposes, that the best thanks of the
country are due to the Admiralty for the efficient manner in which
these voyages have been directed.       In giving such requisite effi
cacy, the talents, knowledge, and general information of that able
and useful character, Mr. Barrow, have been essentially subser
vient.
    When your Number for January was published, it was not di
stinctly known, that among the Georgian Islands the movement
of a balanced needle became so weak and sluggish as to be nearly
annihilated; that is to say, the magnetic action of the real North
 Pole of the Earth became as nothing compared to the strong and
direct attraction of the North-west Magnetic Pole, evidently                                                    si
tuated within the Earth, and in a site very nearly under the sea
surface moved over by the Discovery-ships.         For centuries have
 ingenious philosophers been conjecturing the existence of one or
more Magnetic Poles, in endeavouring to reduce visible effects to
 causes, and to form theories, if not demonstrable, at least plau
 sible. At length, to the honour of the British nation, the first
 in arts, arms, and philanthropy,                       all
                                           doubt and uncertainty are
 happily removed; and                   by

104        Answer to Remarks on determining the Latitude.
   That in October 1818 I transmitted to you a full account of
a method of finding the latitude by observations made with the
seatant near moon, which I had practised for a considerable time
previous; and that the observations in the accompanying ex
ample were made on September 24, 1817.
   That in the spring of 1821 I observed a notice in the Edin
burgh Phil. Journal, that Gen. Brisbane's promised communica
tion on this subject was just published in the Edinburgh Phil.

XX.     A Communication of a singular Fact in Natural History.
    By the Right Honourable the Earl of MoRtoN, F.R.S., in a
    Letter addressed to the President”.
MY DEAR      Sin-I      vestERDAY had an opportunity of observing
a singular fact in natural history, which you may perhaps deem
not unworthy of being communicated to the Royal Society.
    Some years ago, I was desirous of trying the experiment of
domesticating the Quagga, and endeavoured to procure some
individuals of that species.       I obtained a male; but being dis
appointed of a female, I tried to breed from the male quagga
and a young chesnut mare of seven-eighths Arabian blood, and
which had never been bred from: the result was the production of
a female hybrid, now five years old, and bearing, both in her form
and in her colour, very decided indications of her mixed origin.
 I subsequently parted with the seven-eighths Arabian mare to
Sir Gore Ouseley, who has bred from her by a very fine black
Arabian horse. I yesterday morning examined the produce,
namely, a two years old filly, and a year-old colt.            They have
 the character of the Arabian breed as decidedly as can be ex
 pected, where fifteen-sixteenths of the blood are Arabian ; and
 they are fine specimens of that breed; but both in their colour,
and in the hair of their manes, they have a striking resemblance
 to the quagga.      Their colour is bay, marked more or less like
the   quagga   in a darker tint.     Both are distinguished by the dark
 line  along the  ridge of the  back,  the dark stripes across the fore
 hand, and the dark bars across the back part of the legs. The
 stripes across the fore-hand of the colt are confined to the withers,
 and to the part of the neck next to them; those on the filly co
 ver nearly the whole of the neck, and the back as far as the flanks.
 The colour of her coat on the neck adjoining to the mane is pale,
 and approaching to dun, rendering the stripes there more con
 spicuous than those on the colt.        The same pale tint appears in
 a less  degree  on the   rump;    and in this circumstance of the dun
 tint also she resembles the quagga.
    The colt and filly were taken up from grass for my inspection,
 and, owing to the present state of their coats, I could not ascer
 tain whether they bear any indications of the spots on the rump,
 the dark pasterns, or the narrow stripes on the forehead, with which
 the quagga is marked. They have no appearance of the dark
 line along the belly, or of the white tufts on the sides of the mane.
   3oth their manes are black; that of the filly is short, stiff, and
 stands upright, and Sir Gore Ouseley's stud-groom alleged that
 it never was otherwise. That of the colt is long, but so stiff as

to arch upwards, and to hang clear of the sides of the neck; in
which circumstance it resembles that of the hybrid.              This is the
more remarkable, as the manes of the Arabian breed hang lank,
and closer to the neck than those of most others.                 The bars
across the legs, both of the hybrid and of the colt and filly, are
more strongly defined, and darker than those on the legs of the
quagga, which are very slightly marked; and though the hybrid
has several quagga marks, which the colt and filly have not, yet
the most striking, namely, the stripes on the fore-hand, are fewer
and less apparent than those on the colt and filly. These cir
 cumstances may appear singular; but I think you will agree with
 me, that they are trifles compared with the extraordinary fact
 of so many striking features, which do not belong to the dam,
being, in two successive instances, communicated through her to
the progeny, not only of another sire, who also has them not,
but of a sire belonging probably to another species; for such we
have very strong reason for supposing the quagga to be.
                        I am, my dear sir,
                                    Your faithful humble servant,
Dr. li/. H. Wollaston.                                           MoRTON.
    P. S. I have requested Sir Gore Ouseley to send me some spe
cimens of hair from the manes of the sire, dam, colt, and filly;
and I shall write to Scotland for specimens       *     from those of the
quagga and of the hybrid.
    I am not apt to build hypotheses in a hurry, and have no pre
dilection either for or against the old doctrine of impressions pro
duced by the imagination; but I can hardly suppose that the
imagination could pass by the white tufts on the quagga's mane,
and attach itself to the coarseness of its hair.
   Wimpole-street, Aug. 12, 1820.
                          Note by Dr. JP'ollaston.
   By the kindness of Sir Gore Ouseley, I had an opportunity of seeing the
mare, the Arabian horse, the filly, and the colt, and of witnessing how cor
rectly they agreed with the description given of them by Lord Morton.
   Having shortly afterwards described the circumstances to my friend Mr.
Giles, I found that he had observed some facts of nearly equal interest, of
which, at my request, he has since sent me the following account.
XXI.     Particulars   of a Fact, nearly similar       to that related by
    Lord MoRtoN, communicated to the President in a Letter
   from DANIEL GILEs, Esq.
Is answer to your inquiries,        I will now give the best account I
can of my sow and her produce.
    She was one of a well known black and white breed of Mr.
Western, the Member for Essex.            About ten years since I put
                                                                         her

 her to a boar of the wild breed, and of a deep chesnut colour,
 which I had just received from Hatfield House, and which was
 soon afterwards drowned by accident. The pigs produced (which
 were her first litter) partook in appearance of both boar and sow,
 but in some the chesnut colour of the boar strongly prevailed.
    The sow was afterwards put to a boar of Mr. Western's breed
 (the wild boar having been long dead).       The produce was a   lit
 ter of pigs, some of which we observed, with much surprise, to
 be stained and clearly marked with the chesnut colour which had
 prevailed in the former litter.
    This sow had afterwards another litter of pigs by a boar of
 Mr. Western's breed, and I think, and so does my bailiff, that
 some of these were also slightly marked with the chesnut colour;
 but though we noticed the recurrence with surprise, it is so long
 since, that our recollection is much less perfect than I wish it
 to be.
    I should observe, that I have known Mr. Western's breed many
 years, but never in any other instance observed the least appear
 of the chesnut colour. Believe me, &c.

                             To the Editor.
 DEAR   SIR,-    If   you consider  the following subject worthy a
place in any of the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine, you
are welcome to the communication; it may I think prove useful
to sportsmen.       I  have been in the habit of shooting for some
years past, and have always loaded with shot cartridges, the ad
vantage of which I think worth attention.         In the first place,
using the cartridge ensures the sportsman a more rapid succes
sion of discharges, if the game be numerous.            No wadding
is required after the first or second discharge.       The shot is
not wasted by scattering it out of the measure, which is fre
quently the case when loading in a hurry. The touch-holes are
not damaged by the return of shot into the breeching of the
gun, which I have frequently observed, and which is probably
occasioned by bad powder, the succeeding discharge generally
forcing the shot into the touch-hole itself, making it ragged and
enlarged. The shot cartridges fired at ten yards or less distance
from a sheet of paper, will cover it as well as if blown from a
gun loaded in the usual way.—I have frequently tried my own

I ever observed was that a few more shot were thrown within the
compass, consequently it may be inferred that my way of loading
carries closer.   No difficulty attends making the cartridges; the
accompanying     No. 1 is the exact pattern of the paper, which
should be thin and soft.      No. 2 is the former upon which the
paper is rolled spirally from the broad perpendicular side, and

XXVI.     Notice respecting a Volcanic Appearance in the Moon,

  KATER,           F.R.S.*
                                                                              London, Feb. 8, 1821.
DEAR        SIR,-       Ir may perhaps               be interesting to the                  Royal Society
to be informed, that on Sunday evening, the 4th instant, I ob
served a luminous spot in the dark part of the moon, which I
was inclined to ascribe to the eruption of a volcano.
   The telescope used was an excellent Newtonian of 6; inches
aperture, with a power of 74.        The moon was exactly two days
old, and the evening so clear, that I was able to discern the ge
neral outlines in the dark part of her disk.     Her western azimuth
was about 70°, and her altitude about 10 degrees.
    In this position at 6 hours 30 minutes, the volcano was situ
ated (estimating by the eye) as in the accompanying sketch [di
stant from the northern limb of the moon about one-tenth of
her diameter].      Its appearance was that of a small nebula sub
tending an angle of about three or four seconds.
     Itsbrightness was very variable;      luminous point, like small
                                                              a                                    a

centre, and      suddenly disappear, and these changes would some
                   as

    On the 6th, again observed

which will be made in the publication, renders it desirable to com
mence with the more important zodiacal region.
    An account of the several existing catalogues having been
drawn up by the present writer, and inserted in the last volume
of the Phil. Mag., renders it unnecessary to repeat in this place
those details, which would otherwise have formed part of the          -
present introduction.                              -
    The catalogue consists of twelve columns, the contents of which
shall  be explained   seriatim.
    1–3.   Under the head “Synonyms,” are in the first place
comprised three columns.          The first contains the number by
which each star is    distinguished  in Piazzi's last catalogue.    It is
essential to notice,  that  every hour of Right Ascension commences
a fresh numerical series; consequently, in quoting from Piazzi,
it is necessary to prefix to the number of the star, the hour of
Right Ascension as marked in Roman numerals at the top of the
seventh column.       The second column exhibits in like manner
the number by which the star is distinguished in Bode's folio
catalogue; with this difference, that here the numbers recom
mence with each constellation, which makes it necessary to men
tion the latter, when quoting from Bode.         The third column     in
cludes the number by which the star is known in the general
catalogue of Flamsteed (frequently termed the Britannic) or the
zodiacal ones of Mayer, or La Caille.          Although the same star
should be found in more than one of the three last mentioned
catalogues, yet   it is considered sufficient to give the reference to
one only: and the reader should bear in mind, that it is by the
denomination given in this third column, that the star is most
commonly known among astronomers. The numbers from Mayer
or La Caille have the letters M and c prefixed to them respec
tively; those from Flamsteed are without any letter.           It is  al
most superfluous to observe, that where the third column is blank,
the star is not found in either of the three catalogues to which
that column is appropriated.
    4. contains the Greek or Roman character; and includes not
only those adopted by Flamsteed (which vary a little from the
 original ones of Bayer), but also the additional ones first intro
 duced by Bode in his Uranographia, which have not before been
 noticed in any English work. These additional characters are
 included between parentheses.
    5.  The name of the constellation is inserted in the fifth column,
 but is abbreviated to save room.        A dash signifies the same as
 the preceding line.     The boundaries of constellations being al
 together arbitrary, it maybe readily supposed, that the catalogues
frequently disagree in this particular. The Brit, Cat. is well

known to have been very negligently drawn up in this respect;
yet the numbers have acquired by long usage such a degree of
authority, as to render any alteration of boundary an invidious
task.   It has been, however, attempted by Bode, with consider
able success.   In the present compilation, where a star has been
placed by Bode in a constellation different from that assigned by
Flamsteed, both constellations are put down, and the number of
each catalogue placed in a line with       proper constellation,            its                                      as

       to
same minuteness has not been thought necessary, and            these                                          in

I only uotice this, because Mr. Herapath seems to consider the
doctrine of repulsion a necessary part of the received theory”.
   I come now to examine the propositions.         In the first prop.
I grant that the duration of the shock or stroke of perfectly hard
bodies is independent of their initial velocities.   If smartness be
used as synonymous with duration, I assent to the whole prop.,-
but not otherwise.
   By the Cor. I understand that the intensity of the shock is as
the momentum of the striking body.
   I object to the second prop. because it requires us to assume the
existence of an object absolutely immoveable: such a thing does
not exist, and it is not necessary to determine the laws of colli
sion. But in preference to refuting particular parts of Mr. Hera
path's theory of the collision, I will briefly lay down what I
conceive to he the true theory of the collision of hard bodies.
   If a body A moving with a momentum M have                  motion                                    all   its

Herapath will grant; and therefore, when         strikes      being                                         B,    B

   If two hard bodies move in opposite directions, upon the same
line, with different momenta, the momentum after the stroke will
be equal to the difference of the momenta before the stroke. The
body which had the greatest momentum before the stroke will be
at rest after           it,
                  and the other hody will move with     momentum                       a

the great length of time requisite for ascertaining the result of
their industry; for the apple-tree, when raised in the common

XXXIII.       Olservations   on   Sir EveRARD Home's Paper           on the
                 black Rete mucosum         of   the Negro”.
Sia  EveRARD Home, it appears, has delivered a lecture to the
Royal Society, in which he endeavours to prove, by experiment,
that the rete mucosum of Negroes is a provision of nature against
the scorching effects of the sun's rays.    This, I presume, is the
Croonian Lecture, which is a lecture delivered annually to the
Royal Society, in pursuance of the will of a Dr. Croone, who
left a sum of money to that Society, upon condition that a yearly
lecture should be delivered upon muscular motion. Of late years,
when that subject began to be exhausted, the lecturer has very
properly been allowed to choose any anatomical subject.            The
task has almost always fallen upon Sir Everard Home, one of the
few remaining stars of the English Royal Society.         As it is well
known that he delivers these lectures  chiefly  to keep   up the cre
dit of the Soeiety, it would be hardly   fair to criticise them with
much severity.
   Nevertheless, his ideas are so obviously wrong, and his experi
ments so completely inadequate, that they disgrace the Transac
tions of the Royal Society, and will be greatly ridiculed at Paris,
and indeed everywhere by enlightened men.             Professor Roux
came over to London to vist the English schools; and when he
returned home, he ridiculed certain things, in his public lectures,
most unmercifully.     But he never had so fair a theme as this.
    First: As a provision against the rays of the sun, black is the
very worst colour that could possibly be chosen.—What should
we think of the man, who, to defend his bare poll against the
scorching rays of the sun, put on a black hat instead of a white
one?—Unless nature were an idiot, she certainly would have pre
ferred white.—Sir Everard proves his point in the most absurd pos
sible manner.    He interposes a piece of black crape between the
skin and the concentred rays of the sun; and then, because
the ardour of the rays is blunted, he maintains that the rete
mucosum of Negroes is for this purpose ! The texture of the crape
is the true defence, and I will never believe but that white crape
would answer much better.
   Secondly: Why should nature be so partial to black men The
ancient Egyptians, the ancient Hindoos, and Charibbs,        lived  all
within the tropics; the former were white, unless      those parts
                                                               in
exposed  tothe sun; the latter were red.     this day the Coquin
                                                       At
Chinese are yellow, and yet they reside    very hot climate.
                                                  in   a                  It
istrue, the banks   the Senegal and Gambia are hotter still: but

there are black men in New Holland, and very dark-coloured
skins near the north pole.
   Thirdly: There is no such thing as a pigment in the rete mu
cosum at all. In the eye, indeed, there is a pigment. There was
once a Frenchman who pretended to demonstrate one in Edin
burgh; but neither Professor Monro nor any person could dis
cover     it,
         but only the Frenchman himself.         quite impossible                It   is
to separate the rete mucosum from the cutis vera      under skin,                            or
otherwise than                by
                       arbitrary   an
                                 separation.   The colour     the                                              of
skin depends not upon any pigment, but upon         texture; the                           its
texture    that    the Negro
               be of     of       thicker, but coarser wove. This
                                                   is
would        better preventive against the sun's rays than any pig
               a
ment. But the truth                     is,
                            the whole idea    ridiculous; and    was        is                                 it

    A school of arts has been established in Edinburgh, for the in
 struction of mechanics in such branches of science as are of prac
 tical application in their several trades.    Lectures on practical
 mechanics and    practical chemistry will be delivered twice a week,
during the winter season. A library containing books on popular
and practical science has already been established.         The insti
tution is conducted under the direction of a committee of fourteen,
having a clerk and librarian.
                       FRENch Asiatic society.
    A  number    of learned men have united to form, at Paris, an
Asiatic   Society,  the object of which is to encourage, in France,
the   study  of the principal languages of Asia. It is their intention
to procure oriental MSS. ; to circulate them either by means of
printing or lithography; to have extracts or translations made of
them; and to join in the publication of grammars and dictionaries.
This new institution will correspond with other societies which
devote themselves to the same object, and with learned men who
apply to the study of the oriental languages.—25 francs per annum
is to be the subscription; and many learned men are enrolled.

of  Mexico,    consisting   of 1740 leaves, and forming 13 large folio
volumes.      The    following   account of this work is given in the
Morgenblatt, published at Stutgard:—MM. Sesse, Mocino and
Cervantes had travelled over New Spain, with the view of col
lecting a Mexican Flora. They made a drawing of each plant
on the spot where they found                M. Mocino had returned

   The Prussian State Gazette contains the following extract of a

Cairo, April 13, 1821 :
     “Iam, thank God, in good health, though we have had, for
some days, a burning chamsin, which threatens general suffoca
tion, and gives to the coolest apartments a temperature of 28° or
30° by Reaumur's thermometer.        This dangerous wind has a
very bad effect, and promotes the eruption of the plague, which,
for these three months past, has at times prevailed in Alexandria.

     Mr. Campbell (the missionary) has kindly favoured us with the
  following description of the head of a very singular animal which
  he has just brought from the interior of Africa.     We also have
  had an opportunity of seeing     and fully agree with Mr. Camp

   Pliny’s description of the unicorn is                    a     sort of medium between
Mr. Campbell's account, and the animal depicted on the royal
coat of arms. It is as follows:—“Asperrimam     esse feram, reli
quo corpore similem equo, capite cervo, pedibus elephanti, cauda
apro, mugitu gravi, uno cornu nigro mediá fronte cubitorum
duum eminente.”
  Our readers are aware that measures have been taken to obtain
a complete specimen of the animal supposed to be the unicorn,
which is said to exist in considerable numbers in Thibet.  The
description which has hitherto been furnished us rests entirely on
the evidence of natives; but as it differs in several essential points
from Mr. Campbell's account of the African unicorn, the scien
tific world will be anxious to compare the specimens as soon as
they are enabled to do so. Mr. Campbell's demonstration is the
best as yet, and will probably never be excelled.(Asiatic Journal.)
                         LIZARD IMBEDDED IN STONE,
    In our last Number we mentioned                             a curious instance which
had occurred at Auchtertool in Scotland, of a lizard being found
imbedded in a large block of stone. The phaenomenon is thus
ingeniously attempted to be accounted for in a work which Mr.
Welch, of Stonehouse, Devon, has in the press, entitled Religiosa
Philosophia,
   “This phaenomenon,” says the author, “is a further testi
mony in favour of the principle of the present work; and if the
author may be allowed to venture an opinion how the lizard be
came imbedded, and by what means it was preserved in this solid
mass of stone, he offers the following:

writings of Eunapius, of Menander of Byzantium, of Priscus, and
of Peter the Protector. Among the inedited works of Polybius
are prologues of the lost books, and the entire conclusion of the
39th, in which the author takes a review of his history, and de
votes his 40th book to chronology.      The fragments of Diodorus
and of Dion are numerous and most precious.        Among them is
a rapid recital of many of the wars of Rome; a narrative of the
Civil, Punic, Social or Italic, and Macedonian wars; those of
Epirus, Syria, Gaul, Spain, Portugal, and Persia. Parts of the
history of the Greeks and other nations, and that of the succes
sors of Alexander, &c. are among these. They were discovered
in a MS. containing the harangues of the rhetorician Aristides,
from a large collection of ancient writings, made by order of Con
stantinus Porphyrogenetes, of which only a small part are known
to be extant.    The writing appears to be of the llth century.
M. Maio has also met with an unedited Latin grammarian, who
cites a number of lost writers, and a Latin rhetorician now un
known; also a Greek collection containing fragments of the lost
                                                   —
works of Philo. He has also found writings of the Greek and
Latin fathers prior to St. Jerome, with other valuable works,                                                     all

  eight and nine o'clock, and 24” higher at twelve and one, aver

     Colonel Beaufoy has calculated the height of Bushey above
 Leighton, from the July observations, to be about 247 feet.             I
 observed with pleasure the attention shown to this subject by
 Dr. Burney; I am however afraid the wheel barometer cannot
 be relied upon, but in the absence of a better instrument may be
 used with some advantage if correctly compared with a good
 standard instrument previous to any removal from the situation
 it occupied at the time of observation.
     It appears to me that Gosport is too far from London to be
 used as a medium of transfer of the zero, provided full reliance
 could be placed on the barometrical calculations; but in the pre
sent state of our knowledge of the atmosphere, it would in my
 opinion be unsafe to trust to that mode of fixing the zero in
London, even in the shortest line that could be drawn to the coast;
and as the section of the river Thames is a most interesting ob
ject independent of our present inquiry, it is to be hoped that
nothing short of actual levelling will satisfy the public in trans
ferring the zero from the coast to London.
     I have received a letter in the name of Mr. Ralph Tredgold,
suggesting a more extended course of observations, to which I
beg to state, that some arrangements have long been in train to
render the advantages of the barometrical observations more ge
neral and certain, by which any person may render available as
many observations every day as may be convenient to himself.

XXXVII.       On the new Method proposed by Dr. Young for cal.
     culating the Atmospherical Refraction.  By JAMEs Ivory,
     M.A. F.R.S.
Is the last Number of the Quarterly Journal of Science (No.22),
Dr. Young has reprinted what he calls A Postscript on Atmo
spherical Refraction, which was first published in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1819. The problem is a very difficult one,
and has been treated of by geometers of the first rank; and, in
the new point of view in which it is here presented, it is supposed
that the principal difficulties have been evaded or overcome.
No   apology will therefore be necessary, if we endeavour to ap
preciate the improvement thus achieved in mathematical science,
    candidly inquiring how far the pretensions held out are ful
#lled.
   The leading idea of Dr. Young's method is to develop the

162                           On the new Method           for
For this purpose the horizontal refraction, on the supposition of
a uniform dispersion of heat in the atmosphere, might have been
chosen with great propriety, as a case that had already been de
termined with the greatest accuracy by the calculations of La
place and Kramp.        This very instance is indeed one of Dr.
Young's examples; but he employs data different from what the
foreign geometers proceed upon; and, on this account, it is dif
ficult to compare the results obtained by the different methods.
Besides, the numerical computations in the article in the Journal
of Science, are so inaccurate that no conclusion can be drawn
from them in which confidence can be placed. Thus, at p.357,
the horizontal refraction on the supposition above alluded to, is
brought to an equation of which the solution is said to be
r"--000121 ; but the real value which will be found by actual
substitution to satisfy the equation, is r"--0001259; and hence
r= 011220, or 38' 34", being 44” greater than the result in
the Journal of Science. Again, in a similar calculation, p. 359,
the author concludes, r* = .000103, and r = 34' 53”; but it
should be, r*=-0001066, and r = 35'29".                            *
    The  examples   given in the Quarterly  Journal leave the   ques
tion of the convergency of the series quite undecided.         There
can be no doubt that a few of the first terms will in every case
enable us to compute the greater part of the quantity sought;
but the author has done nothing to determine the precise degree
of exactness that will be attained, when only a certain number
of the first terms of the series are taken in, and the rest rejected.
 We shall succeed better in this inquiry if we do not confine our
selves strictly to the mode of calculation imagined by the author.
                                                                                     of if,

amount to half a second.
   The differential expression of the refraction now contains only
two variable quantities; namely, the height above the earth's
surface, and the decrease of the density of the air in ascending
to that height. These two quantities are not entirely indepen
dent of one another.    They are connected by a condition which
depends on the pressure, and which we must now investigate.
Let y denote the pressure of the atmosphere at the height r,
measured by a barometer; and y', the like pressure at the earth's
surface.    Dr. Young supposes the pressure at the earth's surface
to be  unit, and uses y to denote the relative pressure at any                                                     al

y—dy; and the small column of mercury dy will be equivalent

                calculating the atmospherical                           Refraction.                              167
of the first terms of the series, or even a considerable number
of them, are not sufficient for computing the refractions with the
requisite exactness. It appears therefore that no great improve
ment of the theory of refraction is to be expected from the new
way of considering the subject.
   For greater illustration we may apply the foregoing method to
the actual calculation of the horizontal refraction, taking the
data as they are given in the Mécanique Céleste; that        the                                           is,

   The Table in the Nautical Almanac is easily compared with
that in the Connaissance des Tems. Both suppose the same mean
temperature, 50° of Fahrenheit, and 10° of the centigrade scale.
In the English Table the mean pressure of the atmosphere is
taken at 30 inches; in the French Table, at 0.76 metres, or
29-92 inches. The numbers in the two tables will therefore be

gravity and chemical properties, are occasioned by the tempera
ture at which it is produced.   So far as my experience goes, no
temperature short of ignition is sufficient for the decomposition
of oil into permanent combustible gases; but the lower the heat
that is employed, provided it be adequate to the effect, the hea
vier and more combustible                                  is the gas, and the better suited

chlorine, and then fired with oxygen, it must necessarily happen
that the excess of oxygen spent in the first combustion, above

the first experiment above that generated in the second, will be

177                         On a new System of Defence.
sions as are safely deducible from the foregoing investigation.
These may be briefly recapitulated as follows:
    1. That carburetted hydrogen gas must still be considered as
a distinct species, requiring for the perfect combustion of each
volume two volumes of oxygen, and affording one volume of car
bonic acid; and that if olefiant gas be considered as constituted
of one atom of charcoal united with one atom of hydrogen, car
buretted hydrogen must consist of one atom of charcoal in com
bination with two atoms of hydrogen.
   2. That there is a marked distinction between the action of
chlorine on olefiant gas, (which, in certain proportions, is en
tirely independent of the presence of light, and is attended with
the speedy condensation of the two gases into chloric ether,) and
its               hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic
                    on to
     relation

fectly excluded from the mixture.
  3.   That since chlorine, under these circumstances, condenses
olefiant gas without acting                  on
                                  the other three gases,     may
                                                                                                              or be

employed       the correct separation
               in                            the former from one      of
more of the three latter.
                                                      to by
  4.  That the gases evolved        heat from coal and from oil,
though extremely uncertain          the proportions
                                                 as     their ingre                          of
dients, consist essentially             of
                               carburetted hydrogen,  with variable
proportions     hydrogen and carbonic oxide; and that they owe,
                of
moreover, much        their illuminating power
                            of                         elastic fluid,                        an
which resembles olefiant gas        the property   inbeing speedily                  of to
condensed      by    chlorine.
   5.   That the portion            of       oil
                                gas and coal gas, which chlorino
thus converts into    liquid form,
                              a     does not precisely agree with
olefiant gas    in      its
                   other properties; but requires, for the com
bustion  of each volume, nearly two volumes         oxygen more than            of
are sufficient for saturating one volume        olefiant gas, and          of                                af

not be pointed so as to touch him, on account of his closeness
to the rampart. In order therefore to annoy the enemy in that
position, Mr. Carnot invented a new system of attacking him
there by what he calls Vertical Firing, which has obtained great
applause by engineers on the continent of Europe. This method
is described as a mode of discharging a multitude of small balls
from cannon pointed upwards, nearly in the vertical direction,
so that the balls, after ascending to their utmost height, may
fall down again like a shower of hail, on the heads and shoulders
of the men in the ditch.  It seems that those engineers imagined
that these showers of  balls,  in their descent, would fall to the
ground with a velocity or force equal to that with which they
were discharged from the cannon, and that as the latter is ca
pable of destroying men, the former must likewise have the same
effect.
   But this it appears is a very vain and fallacious opinion,                                   as,

equal.    Indeed for distances greater than 60°, such a correction
is scarcely worth noticing, unless the scale of the projection be
very great.
   If it were wished to construct a plate of this kind on a large
scale, it might tend to ensure still greater accuracy in the part
that relates to parallax, if in place of the sines of the apparent
altitudes, we use the sines of the altitudes corrected for refrac
tion; attaching however still to these lines as their arguments
the apparent altitudes only: so that no additional trouble will
occur in the use of the plate, except that the correction for re
fraction should be applied to the distance before finding that of
parallax. But after all, these niceties would seldom have any
sensible effect.  The part for the correction of refraction might
be brought to give the effect of the mean refraction to almost
i.    degree of exactness, by slightly curving the three principal
 liles.
   The foregoing speculation, it is presumed, will be found to
contain principles for constructing a single plate whereby       the                               all
cases may     solved with scarcely less facility

   184       Mr.   Farey  on Shooting  Stars and Meteors.
  ful perusal of which I perceive, with regret, that when drawing
  up those Queries, and in some other papers which I have written
  on the subject, I have not been sufficiently on my guard, to ex
  pressly exclude from my description, of those Shooting-stars and
  Meteors seen high in the Atmosphere (to which I have been de
  sirous of aseribing a satellitic origin) those lower, fiery appear
  ances, locally and occasionally seen in the Air, to which some
  observers' attention is directed, and which they think to arise
  from gaseous exhalations from the Earth; amongst which class
  of phaenomena, the ignis faluus is an undoubted instance. Others
  have called in the aid of Electricity, to account for other lumi
  nous atmospheric appearances, citing, and perhaps truly, the
  aurora borealis, as one of the same class of phaenomena with
  Lightning, especially that which on sultry evenings, sometimes
  appears almost incessant and universal,     yet unaccompanied    by
  thunder.
      I seem to have been mistakenly supposed by Dr. B. to main
  tain, that not any Meteors are visible in full moon-light; whereas
  I believe many fiery appearances in the Atmosphere, besides
  Lightning, including some Meteors which have been in the act of
  exploding and throwing down Meteorolites, to have been seen in
  full day-light: and yet maintain this to be, noways inconsistent
  with the opinion, that real Shooting-stars of the smaller classes,
  are rendered invisible, by very small degrees of extraneous light in
  their vicinity, whether such be from bright planets, or from the
  Moon almost ever so near her change; such obscuration of the
  faint light of small Shooting-stars, extending considerably further
  round the one-day's Moon, much further yet around the two-days
   Moon, and in a short time afterwards in the lunation, whenever
...the Moon is above the horizon, the smaller Shooting-stars may
  in vain be watched for, in any part of atmospheric space.
      There are resident in the Country, many curious Gentlemen,
  who have it in their power to procure the assistance of two and
  occasionally of a third steady person (such for instance as their
  domestics or clerks) in the first two or three hours after dark, in
  the Evenings which may prove free from general clouds; who
  are provided with a good pendulum Clock, which by a transit or
  other Instrument they have the means of regulating, and also
  with a Watch carrying a second's Hand: and who either possess
  or could make a large Planisphere, in portions overlapping each
  other, and depicting the smaller Stars, of such a zone of the
  heavens, as within the course of a year passed in convenient view,
  from some window of their House, adapted for the scene of Stellar
  observations.
      To the zeal of such Gentlemen for the extension of knowledge,
  I  beg to address myself, and to request the favour of their con
                                                             currence,

 currence, in steadily making, and recording, through a sufficient
 period of time, Olservations on the Shooting Stars and Meteors,
 which may present themselves to the Eye; such not being made
 to wander about the field of view, in search of moving objects,
 but kept steadily fixed on some one constellation, or on a remark
 able Star, not too bright, which through the successive Evenings
 of three or four weeks, may be fixed on, as the centre of the ob
 servations to be made.
    One of the Assistants should be seated before the Watch, care
 fully following the second's Hand with his Eye, and inwardly
 counting the seconds elapsed, since each successive minute: an
 other Assistant should be seated with the Planisphere before him,
 having his Eyes occasionally directed to the central Star agreed on
 as above mentioned, with Paper also before him, and Pen in
 hand, ready to write down instantly, any observations which may
 be dictated to him, and to trace with the pencil on the Plani
 sphere.
    Things being thus arranged, preparation may be made for
 commencing the Observations, by noting down the date and the
time; with the addition of                   all
                                    observable circumstances, regarding

                                                                    or

   The Observer should then dictate, for the Assistant to write
down, the rough apparent direction, as for instance, “from left

“from above downwards, direct,” “from below upwards, inclin

the apparent course was straight or otherwise, whether long or
short; whether the object was minute, small or comparatively

 18S                    Address to a Phrenologist.
 may consult you as our forefathers did a Lilly, or a Dee; but
 superior minds will regard you with a mixture of compassion
 and contempt*.        Take counsel, and follow another course; the
 field of useful knowledge is wide, it is of a rich soil, and yet af
 fords but a small produce from the want of labourers that are
 willing to abandon altogether toy-making, and the construction
 of ingenious riddles.
    Essex, Sept. 14, 1821.                                         D      T.
    * If you be eminent in any branch of human knowledge, beware how
you engage with phrenology, for the foibles and false steps of superior
minds are sometimes recollected when their real excellencies are nearly
forgotten or kept out of sight; you will find an instance of this in a descrip
tion of Merchiston Tower, in a late Number of the “Provincial Antiquities
of Scotland." In that description, those fathers of science, Newton and
Napier, have their foibles exposed with too free a hand, when it is consi
dered that the authority of this popular writer will be gladly seized by men
who would willingly sink the greatest talents to the level of their own. The
writer seems also to be in error when he makes Napier's bones a name of
logarithms.
XLIII.      Talles of the Longitude and Altitude of the Nonagesi
       mal Degree of the Ecliptic. By Mr. JAMEs Utting.
                              To Dr. Tilloch.
SIR,   -I     HAve sent you for insertion in the Philosophical Ma
gazine and Journal, a Table of the Longitude and Altitude of the
Nonagesimal Degree of the Ecliptic.           As the finding of the longi
tude and altitude of the Nonagesima is an extremely tedious
operation, I presume the Table I have calculated will be found
valuable, more particularly as the Tables inserted in the first vo
lume of Dr. Maskelyne's Astronomical Observations made at the
Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and in Vince's Astronomy,
give the longitude and altitude only to within 10 seconds (being
calculated before Taylor's Tables of Logarithms were published),
and moreover contain no correction for the Variation of the
Obliquity of the Ecliptic, and but a very brief Table of the cor
rection necessary to be made for a change of latitude.
Longitude      and   Altitude of the Nonagesimal Degree of the
    Ecliptic, for the Latitude of the Royal Ql servatory at Green
    wich, 51° 2S' 40" North, or 51° 17' 48" reduced to the
    Earth's centre, the Ellipticity of the terrestrial Spheroid being
    1-399th part of the Equatorial Radii.          With the Variations of
    Longitude and Altitude for 100 Minutes of Latitude North of
    Greenwich; and for 100 Seconds Diminution of the Obliquity
    of the Ecliptic.     (Obliq. Ecliptic 23°28') Calculated from
   Taylor's Tables of Logarithms.

August 18, 1821.    At 10 minutes before 10 P.M. a coloured
    meteor   passed from the star 3 in Aquila to a in the head of
     Hercules, a space of 26°: the train was of a light red colour
    and about 16° long.    At 35 minutes past 10, a bright me
    teor, without a train, appeared about 12° above the western
    point of the horizon, and descended obliquely towards the
    S.W. Copious dews fell in this and the subsequent night.
—     20th. Two small meteors appeared at a quarter before
            P.M.,   one on each side of the North, rn Crown.
—
       9
        21st.   From 9 till 12 P.M. nine small meteors appeared
       in various directions in an apparently clear sky, one of which
       had a train behind it.
—— 22d.        Between 9 and 10 P.M. three small meteors ap
       peared to the westward.
—       23d.   About 9 P.M. a large and brilliant meteor with a
       long coloured train appeared several seconds in descending
       obliquely from near the zenith towards the N.W.; seven
  other meteors appeared in various parts of the sky between
  9 and 12 o'clock, with no other characteristic than that of
  being small, lofty, and having a great velocity.
—— 24th. From 10 till 1 P.M four small meteors appeared,
  two under the constellation Hercules, one under Ursa Ma
       jor, and one under Georgium Sidus.          The three preceding
       days were the hottest of          all
                                      others     this month; and from
                                                        in
       this time till the 27th  inclusive,  the sky  was filled with va
       pours, followed    by   2%

       generally accompanied            by
                                    strong easterly gales.
Sept. 1st.Three small meteors descended between the clouds
       inwesterly direction, about

                         each side of, and both 22° 35' distant
       from, the sun, which was then due East. The silvery co

                              so
      naked eye,    and   appeared     to be formed in a mixture of cir
     rocumulative and cirrostrative clouds; the parhelion to the
     South of the sun was formed last, and both entirely disap
     peared when the clouds passed off.             These mock-suns were
     followed by a faint solar halo, two winds, the lower one from
     S.E. and the upper one from S.W., and frequent showers
     in the day. Vivid lightning and distant thunder prevailed
     throughout the night. From 12 till 2 o'clock, after a heavy
     shower of rain, the warm flashes of lightning were awfully
     grand, particularly those in the northern part of the horizon,
     where the electric streams frequently shot up from the clouds
     3° or 4° in perpendicular and oblique directions.
Sept. 9th. At a quarter past 8 P.M. a coloured meteor with a
     short train descended almost perpendicularly from behind a
     large cloud, and appeared to fall in the western point of the
     horizon. A very stormy night followed.
—— 10th. At half past 7 A.M. a bright parhelion appeared
     to the North         of,
                           and 22°40' radius from, the sun; and                                at

    July,
          In perusing the Number of the Philosophical Magazine
           my attention was arrested by an article entitled “Re
marks on Mr. Riddle's Claim to the Invention of a new Method
of determining the Latitude.” As I happen to be acquainted
with some circumstances connected with the insinuation thrown
out by the writer, that Mr. Riddle obtained the first idea of the
method of calculation under discussion from General B.'s paper,
which y asserts was published “before Mr. R. had said any
thing about        it,
                and the memoirs which followed were merely                                      a
continuation of the same or      somewhat similar method:”—

With respect     the former part
                    to              the assertion,  offeel myself               I

                    to           my certain knowledge Mr. Rid

by  General        B.
                 for determining the time with accuracy, dated
“Paris, 23d November 1817,” previous         the period when this  to
latter paper was written: and, from various circumstances, have                             I
every reason        to
                   believe that                he
                                   had practised them for some
years before the  period    which  can speak from my own know

water    the bottle; because the cork was compressed into half
          in

         Inconfirmation       far     this, Mr. Perkins remarks,
                                        so             of
                                                                  When                         .                           *

   Thus it would appear that the mode adopted by Mr. Perkins
in these experiments, was rather inadequate to the purpose he
had in view.    I would therefore, in conclusion, suggest, that in
any future trials he may be disposed to make, he should previ
ously  fill
          the bottles          to

the bottles were broken when brought up,             might then justly            he
conclude, that the re-expansion          the compressed water had

must have presented the effect       pressure from without

 204            New Determination                of the Proportions
 every possible facility in our design, by putting at our disposal
 the laboratory of Arcueil.
     The apparatus employed in the first experiments on the com
 position of water, did not allow of that precision which is now
 required in chemical analysis.       But the fact being once esta
 blished, that water is the result of the combination of oxygen and
 hydrogen, the knowledge of the precise proportions required only
 two facts to be determined; namely, the relative volumes of the
 two elements, and their specific gravities.      The latter, being                      in
dispensable in a variety of researches, were already known; and
 for the former, Volta's eudiometer was sufficient.         The greatest
 confidence was justly reposed on this method, after Messrs. Gay
 Lussac and Humboldt had shown, in their masterly Memoir on
 Eudiometry, the true proportions, in volume, of the constituents
of water; and after Messrs. Biot and Arrago had applied the
most minute attention to the determination of the specific gra
 vity of the greater number of the gases.
    If the proportion of hydrogen deduced from these results,
namely, 13.27 per cent, was erroneous, the error was in esti
mating the specific gravity of either the hydrogen or the oxygen,
or both ; for the computation of respective volumes has this re
markable advantage, that, being dependent on a general law, it
is incapable of error. Before we entered on new observations on
the densities of oxygen and hydrogen, we wished to obtain, by a
simple method, the confirmation of our doubts. The decompo
sition of an oxide by hydrogen appeared to us the most accurate
and convenient way; and we adopted the following precautions
to render the experiment conclusive:
    We first procured perfectly pure hydrogen gas. Distilled zinc
is not pre<U+017F>erable for this object to common zinc, for they both
contain the same impuritics, namely, lead, tin, copper, iron, cad
mium, and sulphur; but on passing the hydrogen through a tube
containing fragments of caustic potash slightly moistened, the
gas loses  its odour completely, and comes out perfectly pure.
    Hydrogen gas, obtained             by
                                   the action    diluted sulphuric acid
                                                        of

                              sending the current through moistened

  If we take the above proportions in weight of the elements of
water, and take the density of oxygen as obtained by our experi
ments at 1.1026, the specific gravity of the hydrogen will turn
out to be 0.0688, but by direct experiment it gave us 0.0687.
  It appears, then, that the greatest difference between our results
and those of Messrs. Biot and Arrago relates to the density of hy
drogen; which confirms what we have said above on the cause
of this difference. The increase in the number which we have
given for carbonic acid, though small, is sufficient, however, to
influence in a sensible manner the number expressing the den

                                                         of
our observations, approaches more nearly         that which   to de                   is

                                the nitrates.
   For the convenience           of
                            those who engage         analytical re     in

the departments of the pay-master of the navy, navy board, and
surveyors of the navy.
   Mr. Dupin examines at great length the office of transports as
it was in time of war, and the victualling office. He describes
with peculiar minuteness the humane provisions which have been
made to secure the health of the troops when embarked and very
often crowded in great numbers; and shows from some striking
facts the happy result which has been produced by the im
provements         thus introduced.
     Mr. Dupin is still more particular about         the means       im          all                        of
proving the food                 of

in food and drink; and expatiates           the care which        on

the navy itself either in time of peace or war.  He shows the pro
gress of our naval force since our glorious Revolution to the pre
sent day; he finds the number of large ships four times greater;
the number of seamen employed on them 3} times greater; and
he declares that, comparing this with the services rendered by
the navy at the two epochs of 1688 and 1808, we must be asto
nished how it is that with so little an increase in number, both of
ships and men, we could produce results of so different an im
portance and magnitude.
   We have read with peculiar attention the chapter in which
Mr. Dupin considers the number of dead and sick in our navy
in time of war. He shows from the data furnished by Dr. Blane,
the happy change which has taken place since the last thirty
years in the healthiness of our men of war, in consequence of
the better victualling, the greater care given to cleanliness, ven
tilation, and comforts.

 the new smithery erected under          the inspection and upon the
 plans of Mr. Hall; Mr. Hookey's means of binding timber; the
 saw-mills erected by Mr. Brunel; the extensive and beautiful hy
 draulic works carried on at Sheerness by Mr. Thomas under
 the direction and according to the plans of Mr. Rennie, &c.
 At Portsmouth as well as Chatham Mr. Dupin describes the
 buildings, docks and machinery, for which we are indebted to
 Gen. Bentham, formerly superintendent of our naval works.
    Mr. Dupin gives also very accurate descriptions of the great
naval hospitals, of Haslar at Portsmouth and of Plymouth : with
respect to the latter, he acknowledges himself indebted for many
valuable informations about the treatment of sick seamen to Dr.
 Hammick, one of the principal medical officers of our navy.
    At Plymouth the most interesting work described by our au
thor is the break-water conducted by Mr. Widby under the           in
spection and upon the plans of Mr. Rennie. This description,
already published in French, translated into English, and received
with a merited favour by the public, will be found considerably
improved in this volume, to the end of which we are at last
 arrived.
    The naval part is accompanied by a dozen large drawings beau
 tifully engraved, and representing with the greatest nicety the
architectural or naval works and machines described in the two
volumes.
    Such is the great variety of interesting information collected
by Mr. Dupin, that we have only been able in this account to
indicate the principal heads of the most interesting objects com
prised in his descriptions.
    No doubt persons well conversant with the subject will find
some inaccuracies or mistakes in various parts of the two vo
lumes which we have reviewed; but we can say with the learned
critic of Mr. Dupin's military part in the Quarterly Review”, far
from being astonished by such mistakes, or inadvertencies, we
must only wonder how they are so few in number. We suspect that
but few officers either of our army or navy have acquired so ex
tensive, deep and accurate knowledge of our military institutions,
studies and works, as this intelligent foreigner exhibits.

applicable, though certainly considerable attention has of late
years been bestowed on this department of botany.       The pur
pose of the present neat and unassuming tract is generally to

as well as the larger kinds, and particularly to recommend to
botanists, and such as are fond of drawing flowers, to take accu
rate figures accompanied with descriptions of such of them as
they may happen to meet with.       “What renders it peculiarly

    A new species of black currant has been cultivated in Cam
bridgeshire, the fruit of which is so large, that in some instances
a single berry weighs 61 grains, and measures in circumference
two inches and a half.                                         -

which has produced one carnation half red and half a flesh colour;
another wholly a flesh colour spotted with red; and the third a

    The Professor of  Agriculture  and Botany in the University of
Modena, strongly recommends a species of Clover that has not
 hitherto been cultivated in this country, namely, the Trifolium
incarnatum, or Crimson Clover. He recommends this plant as
the earliest of Trefoils; as the most useful for increasing the                                fo
rage; as requiring only one ploughing and harrowing to cover
the seed; as peculiarly calculated for dry soils, even gravels:
and as preferring the mountain to the plain.      It is so hardy that
it may be sown even in autumn, and it stands severe frosts well.
 If sown in spring, it will yield a good crop that year. Some ex
periments have been tried with this plant in Berwickshire, which
in a great measure justify what has been urged in         favour.            its

height, but in a very ruinous state. He also saw seven or eight
temples, of which one (upwards of 300 feet in length) was covered
with hieroglyphics. It is probably in the neighbourhood of these
ruins that search should be made for Nabatha, and not the Me

Greek inscriptions.   He assures us that he has seen nothing in
his travels comparable to the monuments of Nubia, and that he

Moniteur.
   A letter from Marseilles of the llth of August contains the
following interesting piece of intelligence:--
    “M. Tedenat, son of the French Consul at Alexandria, well
known by his discoveries in Upper Egypt, is just arrived at Mar
seilles with a number of curiosities from that celebrated country.
He traced the cataracts of the Nile from their very commence
ment, and visited the famous city of the hundred gates. He car
ried his researches into the mountain of granite, which is close
to the ruins of that city, and which is opposite to the grand tem
ple. He discovered very fine mummies, and manuscripts on pa
pyrus of the finest kind, and in the most perfect preservation.
It is supposed no library in the world possesses any of the kind
in a better state of preservation.     His most abundant harvest in
matters of that description was in the mountain of Gourma. He
had the singular good fortune to discover a large cable, made of
the leaves of the palm-tree, which was used for letting down the
bodies of wealthy persons into a well, which were afterwards bu
ried in spacious sepulchral chambers hewn into the side of the
granite mountain, more than sixty toises in depth.
    “The wells seem to be designed for the concealment of tombs
in the interior; and at the present time it is necessary to exca

                                   discover them.

thousand  plants, which now thrive only in vegetable  mould, could
not grow  on our earth some thousand   years ago.   Must we adopt
the opinion, that plants and vegetables have risen gradually? In
East Friesland, if earths are dug up on the sea coast, &c. from
a depth of ten or twelve feet, plants then grow, which are not
otherwise to be met with in those parts of the country.        Did
these plants exist in the ancient world?    Have their seeds re
tained the germinating power for some thousand years 2        Can
this power be retained so long? or whence do these plants
come?
                         ANTIQUE GLASS.
    A cabinet has been opened in Naples in the Studi palace for
the  antique glasses found in Pompeii and Herculaneum. The
collection contains a great variety of forms and colours, and
proves that the ancients made use of glass as the moderns do,
both in decorating their rooms and in instruments of chemistry.
The cabinet contains also a number of cinerary urns, for the most
part inclosed in vases of lead.

   The mausoleums at Surat belonging to the English, erected
about the middle and end of the 17th century, are in the ara
besque style.    One, to the memory of Governor Oxenden, 1669,
must have been built at an enormous expense; the dome rises
to the height of 40 feet surmounted with gothic arches, forming
an upper story supported by massive pillars, with stair-cases in
the angles leading also to a terrace and entablatures; the dia
meter of the building 25 feet. This is not so magnificent as one
built over a Dutch chief who died about the same time; the      in
ner room of this, where the body is deposited, is of an octagon
shape, with regular doors and windows; the sides of it orna
mented with Scripture inscriptions and the escutcheons of his fa
mily, the whole surmounted with a dome supported by elegant
pillars, forming a piazza round it; it is of much larger dimen
sions than the former one: the name is Wander Heft, 1679. These
lofty piles accord not with the humility of the Christian religion,
and are evidently borrowed from the Mahomedans, who required
room in their mausoleums for the performance of their religious
rites: that is, for the attendance Priests, Fakirs, and Devotees,

        SIR,-For
             the information of those who are fond of the study
of Natural History,  I beg leave to make known a few remarks
upon the Chameleon, from ocular demonstration.
   It is commonly believed that this curious little animal has the
power of changing        colour       its

utility, therefore, of this invention may be seen at a glance; it
enables firemen to brave the flames with impunity, whereas, in
most instances of excessive heat, they are driven off, and the
flames are permitted to spread.     The shield is used in another
and equally beneficial way.     By varying the form, it is carried
up stairs to the third story of houses not on fire, but the roof of
which requires water, and by a simple machinery carried in hand,
it is projected from a window like a painter's platform; the
leader is then carried through the house, up stairs, and so out of
the window, and is directed by the fireman behind the shield to
that part of the adjoining houses which it may be necessary to
protect. It is extremely useful in churches, and from steeples,
and may be applied in a variety of ways.       Firemen have been
frequently injured in health and person, by approaching too near
the flames, and giving full scope to that intrepidity of character
and humanity for which they are distinguished.         By this fire
shield they will be effectually protected, and it will be found in
narrow streets to be peculiarly useful.”

   Among the additions recently made to Dr. Mitchill of America's
museum of curiosities is a letter from the Chippewa tribe of                          In
dians to the Sioux, with the answer of the Sioux to the Chippe
was, done during the summer of 1820. Both are executed with the
point of a knife, or some other hard body, upon the bark of the
birch tree. They are examples of picture writing, bordering upon
the symbolic or hieroglyphic, and show the manner in which the
aborigines of North America communicate their ideas at the pre
sent day. After having served the purpose for which they were                         in
tended, they were procured by Captain Douglas from the banks of
the Mississippi, where they had been placed by their authors, and
brought home by that gentleman as specimens of the way                             pur
sued by those people to transact their public business.

substances that are known.    Raleigh, toward the end of the six
teenth  century,  had heard the name of curare pronounced as
being a vegetable substance, with which arrows were envenomed;
yet no fixed notions of this poison had reached Europe.      The
missionaries Gumilla and Gili had not been able to penetrate                                                   in

 know,” said he, “that the whites have the secret of fabricating
 soap, and that black powder which has the effect of making a
  noise and killing animals, when they are wanted.            The curare,
- which we    prepare  from father to son, is superior  to  any thing you
  can make down yonder (beyond sea). It is the          juice  of an herb
  which kills silently (without any one knowing whence the stroke
  comes).”
     This chemical operation, to which the master of the curare
  attached so much importance, appears to us extremely simple.
  The liana (liujuco), which is used at Esmeralda for the prepara
  tion of the poison, bears the same name as in the forest of Javita.
  It is the bejuco de mavacure, which is gathered in abundance
  east of the Mission, on the left bank of the Oroonoko, beyond
 the Rio Amaguaca, in the mountains and granatic lands of Gua
  naya and Yumariquin.                                  -
     The juice of the liana, when it has been recently gathered, is
  not regarded as poisonous; perhaps it acts in a sensible manner
 only when it is strongly concentrated.       It is the bark, and a part
  of the  alburnum,   which contains this terrible poison.      Branches
 of the mavacure four or five lines in diameter, are scraped with a
 knife; and the bark that comes off is bruised, and reduced into
 very thin filaments, on the stone employed for grinding cassava.
 The venomous juice being yellow, the whole fibrous mass takes
 this colour.    It is thrown into a funnel nine inches high, with an
opening four inches wide.           This funnel was, of                     all

 pours arising from this poison when thrown on burning charcoal,
 may be inhaled without apprehension ; and that it is false, as
 M. de la Condamine has announced, that Indian women, when con
 demned to death, have been killed by the vapours of the poison
 of the ticunas.
    The juice is thickened with a glutinous substance to cause it
 to stick to the darts, which it renders mortal; but taken inter
 nally, the Indians consider the curare to be an excellent stoma
 chic. Scarcely a fowl is eaten (adds our author) on the banks
 of the Oroonoko, which has not been killed with a poisoned
 arrow.   The Missionaries pretend, that the flesh of animals is

LII.   Some Erperiments made with a view to the Detection
   and Prevention of Frauds in the Sale of skimmed Milk; to
   gether with an Account of a simple Lactometer for effecting
   that Purpose.      By EDMUND DAvy, Esq. Professor of Che
   mistry and Secretary to the Royal Cork Institution.
Skimmed milk,        as is well known, is used to a very great ex
tent in  Ireland,   and especially in the South *, where it forms
an indispensable part of the subsistence of the lower orders.
Potatoes and skimmed milk, indeed, constitute almost their
sole, or at least their principal food. It is therefore of much im
portance, that an article which essentially contributes to the
support of a very large portion of the community, should be sup
plied in a genuine unadulterated state.         Unfortunately this has
not been the case. Much of the skimmed milk exposed for sale
in our milk markets, has been largely adulterated with water;
and for want of the means of detection, this fraud has been prac
tised with impunity, not only in Cork, but also in other parts
of the country. An unsuccessful attempt had been made to               re
medy this evil. Persons called tasters were appointed to inspect
the milk markets in Cork, and empowered to detain such milk
as they supposed to be adulterated.        But the inadequacy of such
a mode of    prevention   must be  apparent;   for nothing can be more
vague and uncertain than decisions founded upon the mere taste
and appearance of milk.         In consequence of the total incompe
tency of tasters, to prevent the commission of frauds in the sale
of skimmed milk, a Committee composed of respectable farmers,
&c. was formed for the express purpose of putting a stop to this
disgraceful practice, so injurious both to the poor, and to the
fair dealer. The Committee waited upon our active chief ma
gistrate Sir Anthony Perriere, knt., to apprize him of their           in
tention, and to solicit his assistance. Anxious to co-operate with
the Committee in promoting a measure of acknowledged public
utility, Sir Anthony afforded every assistance in his power, and
promised to adopt any practical remedy which should be devised.
At his suggestion, the Committee consulted me as to the best
means of carrying their design into execution, and in compliance
with their request, I directed my best attention to the considera
tion of the subject.      An instrument on the principle of the hy
drometer, seemed to promise the simplest means that could be
employed for the detection and prevention of frauds in the sale
of skimmed milk; but whether it was practicable to construct
such an instrument, depended upon circumstances which could
   * The sale of skimmed milk in the markets of Cork alone, I am informed,
amounts to about 1000l. per week.

expectations as to the result of my investigation; but after I

in the sale of this article.   Accordingly, I procured at different
times, a great number of specimens from the milk markets; and
on submitting them to a careful examination, I found that some
were genuine, and of course corresponded with good skimmed
milk in every particular. Others were adulterated in different
degrees, but the only foreign substance I could detect in the adul
terated specimens, was water.       By adding a certain quantity of
water to  genuine  skimmed    milk,  it became of the same density
as the adulterated milks from the markets. By simple distillation,
the adulterated milks furnished pure water, and became of the same
density as genuine milk.     In some cases, I found skimmed milk
from the markets adulterated with more than one-fifth of water;
in other instances, with about one-sixth, one-seventh, and one
eighth of water.    The worst of the adulterated milks from the
markets was of the specific gravity lºo26, the highest of the ge
nuine milks from the markets was 1,039, the thermometer being
at 50°.

SIR,    -A      vERY common experiment, no less interesting than
surprising, is shown in lecture-rooms for the purposeof illustrating
the theory of refraction.       A piece of money is placed at the bot
tom of an      empty basin,  the experimenter retiring until the edge
intercepts the object: an assistant then pours in water; the piece
of money seems to rise over the edge, becoming perfectly visible
and well defined.      This experiment seldom fails to surprise the
audience, handed down from one generation to another, even
from the days of Aristotle; yet I am led to believe the real cause
is little understood.    Mr. Harris gives the following explanation
in his Optics, page 25:
   “Hence (says this writer) we have the common phaenomenon
of a shilling or other object placed in an empty vessel, appearing
to be elevated higher and higher as the
vessel is filled with water.    Suppose the *

      Exp. 1.-Having placed a piece of money at the bottom of
  a  wine-glass    on the table, I made the edge intercept my view;
  on pouring in a small quantity of water the shilling seemed to
  rise; I now perceived two images of the object, one at the bot
  tom, and another floating at the top of the water, very apparent
  when the glass was a little inclined to the eye. This floating
  image was agitated by every movement of the water.                 To ascer
 tain whether this image was the real cause of vision, I held the
 glass above my eye, and saw the image floating by reflection on
 the surface of the water, as well defined as if reflected from the
 face of a mirror. Further to convince myself that it is this float
 ing image we see, and not the shilling at the bottom of the
 vessel, I brought my eye on a line with the image, and then gently
 lowering the glass, at the same time keeping my eye intently
 fixed on               it,
                      saw the image
                         I                                          by
                                              transmitted rays. Thus the
 floating image was seen                          by         line with, and be
                                                                                     If on

 analogy with reflecting mirrors; for               we   place  two candlesif
 different distances, although the images are both evidently formed
 and reflected from the same surface, yet they appear                    the ob                            to
 server       very different distances behind the glass.

draw few optical inferences from this interesting experiment.

such        as
           telescopes, microscopes, spectacles, &c. we take our ideas
not from the rays immediately sent from the object itself                     the                                 to
eye, nor from imaginary images                foci, but from images formed

   Erp. 2.-Having procured from the glass-house solid glass                                            a

fined. Could  any person    this experiment        in
                                             venture  say that                                          to

                                                                   251

we take our ideas immediately from the object, and not from the
inverted image of that object seeming to float on the posterior
surface of the solid sphere 2 To argue that we could see better at
a distance than close to any object, would be absurd. Indeed it
is evident from this experiment, as well as from the former, that
we take our ideas from the inverted image floating on the poste
rior surface of the globe, and not from the object, which is as     in
visible as if it were placed behind our backs.       When an oar ap
pears bent in the water, the image of the immersed part is one
fourth nearer to the eye than the rest, consequently it appears
bent, or as if broken.
     Exp. 3.--When we hold a black pencil or any other substance
behind a cylindrical tumbler of clear water, when the pencil is
 close behind the glass we perceive a magnified image; on with
 drawing the pencil to yet a greater distance, this image becomes
 more and more magnified, and two other images laterally everted
 are seen at the sides of the tumbler; at yet a greater distance we
 lose sight of the anterior or magnified image; the two lateral ones
 floating towards each other, at last form one well defined everted
 image at the posterior surface, from which, and not immediately
 from the object, we take our ideas, the object itself being per
 fectly invisible.
     Rays of light diverge, instead of converging, in a convex lens;
 neither do they cross to form pictures of objects, as generally
 believed.
      Should I be enabled to establish these as facts, I strike at the
 very root of optical science, which I am sanguine enough to be
  lieve is likely at no very distant period to undergo as great, if
  not a greater revolution than the science of chemistry.         From
 the earliest   aera, when lenses were first discovered, to the present
  time, philosophers seeing that on emergence the rays formed a
  cone, and then crossed, laid it down as an analogical inference,
  that they also converged in the body of the glass medium. When
  we find mathematicians measuring the sines of refraction, with
  a ridiculous accuracy, we cannot help smiling at such waste of
  time and trouble, when informed by direct and incontrovertible
  experiments, that nature and the philosophers were travelling very
  opposite roads.      Although every school-boy on looking through
   his burning-glass, and every old woman through her spectacles,
   saw objects enlarged; yet the philosophers, instead of repeating the
   experiments, set about explaining their fanciful theories by the
   greatest absurdities, and it is looked on as a sort of sacrilege to
   call in question the opinions of a Newton. However, it should be
   remembered that in former ages the auto; sºn of Pythagoras
   was held in equal if not greater estimation, and that it is only
                                     1 i 2                        within

   Having formed the letter T on a sheet of white paper, I held

the erect image becomes considerably magnified, and the inverted
images are seen forming a luminous circle around; and, as the
lens is distanced, they contract or coalesce into one inverted image
forming the focus. This may be esteemed an experimentum

Dr. Herschel justly remarked that the greatest heat was beyond
the focus or image; and I have found by repeated experiments
that inflammation does not take place at the image of the sun,
but on the crossing of the rays.    The focus g, h, is produced by
reflections from c, d, and therefore I would suggest the term re
flected instead of geometric focus.

not only magnified in                    all
                          their dimensions, but they appear much
blacker and better defined, and also much nearer      the eye. How                   to

                 On Napier's Rules            of the Circular Parts.                        259
                                                                                                 -
condly, we may employ the two rules and the circular parts of
Napier. The two methods are fundamentally the same, and
differ from one another only in form.
    In the preceding investigation only three related triangles have
been mentioned, whereas the author of the rules employs five.
It is to be observed that each of the two complementary trian
gles has itself a pair of complementary triangles; and as the given
triangle is one of each pair, there are no more than two new tri
angles found in this manner, and these complete the five of Na
pier.    All the five triangles will be exhibited on the surface of
the sphere, if each of the two oblique angles of the given trian
gle be made the pole of a great circle; for the intersections of
the two great circles and the three sides of the triangle will form
five different right-angled triangles, the hypothenuses of which
inclose a pentagonal figure.         Every one of the five triangles
      its
                                                                 in on
has      two complementary triangles next          either hand.
                                                        it          The
real principles        Napier's Theory consist
                        of                          these two things:
First,     all

cular parts; secondly,        we take the circular parts
                                   if                           the           of   all         tri
angles, making       similar part always occupy the middle place,

triangle and      its

   “Praeter hanc probationem per inductionem omnium casuum,

 270             A   Demonstration    of Le Gendre's              Theorem
means serious falls would be greatly avoided.   On the presump
tion that the machine could thus be guided along any intended
track, it might perhaps be practicable to change the men at se–
veral stages like coach horses.    Indeed I should not despair of
yet seeing some such method employed as the most expeditious
for conveying the mail from one place to another.
   This contrivance is no doubt very inferior to the organs of
 flight with which the feathered race are furnished, and which
enable them to traverse the air with such admirable facility. But
it is still a recommendation, that it is free from any reciprocating
motion, the vanes obviously acting during every part of their re
volution; which is a property entirely wanting in those un
fortunate artificial wings contrived to act in imitation of the
birds; since such unwieldy wings are not simply useless whilst
returning to renew their stroke, but really retard and destroy the
flight altogether, as the experiment has uniformly proved.
     I have not yet attempted to compute the force to be exerted
in supporting such a machine. This would be a task of some dif
ficulty as well as uncertainty; since our best theories of the re
sistance of fluids are still something short of perfection. It might
however, to a certain extent, be compared with the forces acting
in the common windmill.
   If the above scheme, which is perhaps as plausible as most of
the kind that have been proposed, seem to deserve a place in the
Philosophical Magazine, the insertion of it will oblige

LXII.    On the Change of Colour in Blue vegetable Colours by
              metallic Salts.     By Mr. J. MURRAY.
We      had rested quietly in the belief that the relations of acids
and alkalis to vegetable colours were uniform ; that the first
class of bodies turned vegetable blues to red, or restored the ori
ginal tint obliterated by an alkali; and that the seeond class, or
alkalis, restored the blue colour changed to red by acids, or
deepened the yellow and red obtained from turmeric, Brasil wood,
&c. into brown. It was at length discovered that boracic acid
produced the same effect on turmeric as alkalis would do, and I
further find that on tincture of cabbage, and syrup of violets, this
peculiar characteristic is still maintained.
    Wol. 58. No. 282. Oct. 1821.               M   m                In

  274          On the Solar Eclipse   of September 7, 1820.
.  .  In a series of experiments lately made on vegetable colours, I
  discovered the remarkable fact, that subacetate of lead, nitrate
  and sulphate of copper, nitromuriate of platinum, nitromuriate of
  gold, &c. turned syrup of violets, tincture of cabbage, columbine,
  blue byacinth, &c. green; and that when these colours are even
  reddened by acetic or citric or carbonic acid, &c. the metallic so
  lutions restore the original llue colour. Boracic acid reddens
  the yellow colour obtained from Reseda lut., and so do the me
  tallic solutions.
      It seems evident, therefore, that we have yet to learn the   in
  variable characteristics of alkalis and acids. We may attempt
  to cover our ignorance by a free use of the term anomaly, but
  I do hold that in the universe of God there is no such thing as
                            º
  anomaly.
  LXIII.      On the Solar          of the 7th September 1820; being
      a  Comparison    of Calculations with some of the Observations
      made in Great Britain and on the Continent.             By Mr.
      GkoRGE INNEs.
                               To  Dr. Tilloch.
  SIR,   - Is    order to compare the observed with the computed
  times of the phaenomena of the late solar eclipse, I have se
  lected several of the observations which have appeared in your
  Magazine, and in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, and made
  the necessary calculations for the several places by the Tables of
  Delambre and Burckhardt.          From these calculations it appears
  that the tables give the time of conjunction too early, and the
  moon's apparent semidiameter too great; as a less semidiameter
  would have made the errors of the tables, as deduced from the
  several observations, more uniform for the beginning and end.
      The results obtained from the observations of the beginning
   and end at Gosport, and of the end at Padua, differ much from
   the rest.    Perhaps some error has been committed in allowing for
   the errors of the clocks, or in transcribing. In calculating the
   time of the end for Plymouth, I have used the longitude given
   with the observation; but I observe that it is greater than any
  of those given in the Requisite Tables, as the result of accurate
  observations, for eight places in Plymouth.
       It is not stated whether the instants of the last five observa
  tions are given in mean or apparent time, but from the calcula
  tions it would appear that they are given in mean time.
       In making the calculations it will be found, that an error of
   1" in the moon's semidiameter gives an error of about 2",98, and
    -
                                                                 2",64

           On the Solar Eclipse      of September 7, 1820.       275
2",64 in the times of beginning and end respectively for England,
and a little more for the other places, owing to their being in
lower latitudes.   I would beg leave to request that some of the
observers, who, I doubt not, have paid attention to so important
a point, would communicate the diameter of the moon, as mea
sured on the sun's disc. The mean of the moon's apparent semi
diameters by the calculations made for England is 14' 50",73 at
the beginning of the eclipse, and 14' 47",42 at the end. By
the calculations for the other places, it comes out about 1”
greater in both cases.     I am, sir, yours respectfully,

 as  the arrangement            Mr. Ramsden's bar, required that the
                                       of
support        which the microscopes were attached should rest on

   By the mean of these comparisons, it appeared that the forty
inch bar was too long      29 divisions  of the micrometer, or .00012.4
of an inch *.
   The preceding measures were taken from the middle of the
lines on the gold pins; but as it was found that these lines were
not quite parallel, this accidental circumstance afforded a method,
of which I availed myself, to attain a greater degree of accuracy.
   The deviation of the two lines was obtained by measuring the
difference of the distances of their extremities, and by the mean
of six comparisons was found to be 16-8 divisions.
   Now, as this is the deviation due to the whole length of the
lines, they will have approached each other 2-9 divisions, at about
one-sixth part of their length, reckoning from their most distant
extremities.
   This portion of the line being estimated, transverse lines were
drawn, indicating the points from which future measurements
were to be taken.
   On the 14th of April I resumed my comparisons.
   Conceiving that it would be preferable to ascertain the dif
ference between some one interval and the mean of all the                  in
tervals of Mr. Ramsden's bar, and afterwards to compare such
interval with the forty-inch bar, I now directed my attention to
this object.

  LXVI.      On Shot Cartridges.            By Mr. Joseph Steevess.

                               To Dr. Tilloch.
Sin, -Observiso in          your Number for August a paper by
A Correspondent in India,   on the use of shot cartridges for fowling
pieces; I beg to observe that I adopted the use of such cartridges
in the year 1793, and myself and several friends have continued
to use them ever since.   From the year 1793 to 1804, they were
several times taken to India by a friend of mine (who was a
Purser in that service): whether he consumed the whole, or dis
posed of a part with his investment, I know not: certain it is
they were not returned to England.       Cartridges containing both
powder and shot were introduced at the same time, and in many
instances have been found very advantageous.        And as your Cor
respondent has omitted to describe the chief utility of shot car
tridges, I shall here describe both, and state a few out of many
experiments made by myself and others for that purpose.
   The chief advantages of shot cartridges are, the prevention of
the barrel from leading, and at the same time actually assisting
in cleaning it on every discharge.     It is well known that in order
to make shot bright and handsome, as it is termed, a consider
able quantity of black lead is used, a portion of which is at every
discharge deposited in the inside of the barrel, and so closely does
it adhere that the ordinary mode of cleansing is not sufficient to
remove it; and I have within a few days seen a barrel so leaded,
as to materially impede      projectile force, divert the shot from
                                its
its rectilineal course, and deliver       irregular clusters, leaving
                                               it
spaces near the centre     of
                           the charge       at in
                                           forty yards distance, four
or  five inches diameter; besides which, the lead from the shot,
together with the deposit         the powder, actually
                                  of                           contracts    so
the barrel    immediately  in front    theofcharge, that  (although  the
gun has been cleaned      inthe ordinary way)    have known
                                                        I         sound          a
barrel blown    to  pieces from this cause alone, which the use                           of
shot cartridges would have prevented.          Yet         not consider
                                                             I         do

                                       I       them  generally,   except
where      quick  succession     discharges
                                 of             essential. The opera

      of a
tion      cleansing  at every discharge     thus performed: the car

explosion  of the powder, and, pressing hard against the sides of
the barrel, carries before it a considerable portion of the deposit
of the last discharge, without allowing the shot to come in con
tact: thus lessening, instead of increasing, the foulness of the gun,
while it renders the leading of the barrel impossible.         Giving
shot a gloss with black lead is said to be useful as well as orna
mental, as it renders it lubricous, and less friction is the conse
quence: this however holds good only to a limited extent, as
the foulness of the barrel by the deposit of the lead soon counter
acts the effects of lubricity.    In order to discover whether any
real advantage was obtained by glazing the shot, I fired fifty
charges 24 oz. each of No. 4 shot, at a circle three inches dia
meter, on the balistic pendulum, at fifty yards distance; the gun
was cleaned every five discharges: fifty charges 24 oz. each of
the old patent shot not glazed, were fired at the same pendulum,
at the same distance, and with the same gun cleaned after every
tenth discharge. The number of shots put in the circle, were with
the glazed shot 153, with the old patent 161. Fifty charges of
each were then fired in cartridges; the gun cleansed only once in
each operation, viz. after the 25th discharge. The numbers were,
new patent glazed 159; old patent not glazed 169: the old
patent had the advantage in projectile force in both cases, as was
obvious by      its
                action                on
                           the pendulum.    The facility    loading                          of

of tin, open at the outer end:—not one of the whole went in a
lump, but the spreading of most of those in the paper-cases
was irregular, and that in the tin-cases very much so : several
of them were deflected from the line of collimation so much as
                          -
to be useless.
    From these as well as a variety of other experiments, I was
induced     to adopt blue cartridge, white cartridge, and brown
paper.    I have continued this practice now twenty-eight years,
and know of but three instances of the whole charge going in a
lump.      I have now by me some cartridges upwards of twenty
years old. When thin paper is used, the cartridge soon becomes
 so deformed and enlarged in the middle, as to stick fast in ram
ming down. Powder and shot cartridges are made similar to
those of shot only, the cases being longer. The shot is put in
first, then a wad of paper, and then the powder; the end of the
cartridge is finally closed over the powder (by the head of the
former), which is easily and expeditiously opened when used, the
paper being too stout to be bitten off.
   I have found those cartridges extremely useful, having with these,
as well as with shot cartridges, frequently loaded and fired with
effect without drawing the ram-rod. The only objection I know to
powder and shot cartridges             that   or is,

  ceed with a certainty of obtaining this desirable end.                From a
  variety of experiments, I am induced to believe there is a certain
 ratio between the length of the barrel and diameter of the bore,
  which gives the maximum of perfection.                Perhaps some of your
 scientific readers will favour the public with some observations on
 this subject.                I am, sir, your obedient servant,

Ir     cannot but fall under the observation of every one, that the
 health and comfort of families, and the conveniences of domestic
 life, are materially affected by the supply of that most necessary
 article, water.        The quality of water is undoubtedly of great im
 portance in the arts of brewing, baking, and various others con
 nected with the preparation of food; as also in the washing and

 sp.gravity cannot constitute a test of the hardness of water, when
 we find that one grain of earthy salt, dissolved in 2000 grains of
 pure water, converts it into the hardest spring water that is com
 monly found.
   We shall now proceed to notice some of the most useful tests
in the analysis of waters.
    l. Soap Test.—When a piece of soap is agitated in distilled
or pure rain water, a part of it is dissolved, producing a milky                                               li
quid, which continues for many days unaltered.         But when soap
is agitated with hard spring water, the milkiness produced almost
instantly degenerates into a curdy substance, which rises to the
surface, and leaves the liquid below nearly transparent.         This
curdy substance is understood to be the earth of the salt com
bined with the                 oil
                        the soap.    of has     glutinous, unpleasant
                                                           .    It         a
feel when rubbed upon the hands, and soils glass and other ves
sels   so     require hard pressure

                                                                of

this test  sufficiently distinguishes  hard water from soft      pure                                    or

   There are many other tests than those I have enumerated, but
they are more than can usually be wanted in the analysis of ordi
nary springs.    My object is not to give a catalogue of tests, but
to show in what manner their application may be improved, and
reduced to a system intelligible to moderate proficients.
   The improvements I would propose in the use of tests are, that
the exact quantities of the ingredients in each test should be pre
viously ascertained and marked on the label of the bottle; this
might easily be done in most of them in the present state of che
mical science.   We should then drop in certain known quanti
ties of each from a dropping tube graduated into grains, till the
required effect was produced; then from the quantity of the test
required, the quantity of saline matter in the water might be de
termined without the trouble of collecting the precipitate;                                                       or,

this was done, the one method would          check upon the other.

         an          well known that his numerous publications
                         it   is
have been uniformly held   the greatest estimation, and that even

able mathematicians, and thus greatly enlarging the boundaries
of useful science.
   As a Teacher, too, his labours have been singularly success
ful, especially as Professor of Mathematics for nearly forty years
in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich; an Institution
which, by his judicious plans and unremitting care, he raised to
the highest degree of celebrity and national importance.     To his
instructions, indeed, and his improvements in Military Science,
his country is deeply indebted for the superiority and success of
the British Artillery and Engineers, in every part of the world,
for the last half eentury.
   Such are the important objects to which Dr. Hutton has con
stantly devoted his valuable time and talents: and such are his
well-founded claims to the gratitude and admiration of every
lover of science,—claims which must ensure to him the lasting
fame of having been one of the most efficient promoters of ma
thematical knowledge in any age or country; especially in im
proving and simplifying those sciences which are conducive to great
public utility.
   And here it must be gratifying to add, that this extraordinary
man, though now in his eighty-fifth year, is still an ardent, and
occasionally an active promoter of Science.

Gray's Inn; Dr. Gregory, of Woolwich; Dr. Kelly, of Finsbury

   A Model of the intended Bust is already completed, and is
considered a very accurate likeness. It may be seen at the Sculp
tor's premises, No. 37, King-street, Edgware road.         Casts of
the Bust, at two guineas each, will be prepared for such friends
of Dr. Hutton as may choose to order them; but the Marble Bust
is to be given to the Doctor himself, with the hope that he will
hereafter present it to some Scientific Institution.
                         NEW SHOWER BATH,
                            To Dr. Tilloch.
   SiR,-1    had been long convinced of the danger to be appre
heuded from the use of the common shower bath in particular
diseases incident to humanity or delicate constitutions.   The sud
den death of Mr. Spratt, at Brighton, from the shower bath, is a
verification.
   Impressed with this conviction, I described an invention wherein
the water was suspended by the resistance and upward pressure
                                                                 of

   The bulk of the   descending   spherulae   of water is proportional
to the orifices in the base, and the period of duration correspon

   It is also obvious, that if the recipient be supplied with water
at 98°F, and        aperturesthe                    are
                                   sufficiently minute,     heated dew                          a

the  neighbourhood   of Bristol and county of Somerset. We wit
nessed ourselves in a field belonging to Capt. Parish, at Timsbury,
a few years since, an innumerable accumulation of them. On
approaching heat they are observed to leave their hiding-place
near the roots of grass, crawling upon the leaves and plants near
it, and thus become visible        the superficial observer.

  A  tanner, near Portsmouth, has lately discovered a most im
portant process, whereby crop hides are tanned in four months,
and made to overweigh the raw halves (which is the present
common standard) from five to ten pounds upon each hide: con
sequently the advantages are double and triple—first, in point of
saving so much time; secondly, in point of weight; and, thirdly,
because returns are made thrice a year instead of once, according
to the present practice of the trade.

                                     [From   a Correspondent.]
   We gave some account in a former number of Mr. Cusac's
researches into the ancient state of Britain and Ireland before the
Christian aera, and previous to the entrance of Alexander the Great
into Babylon, in which Tacitus and the Norwegian and Icelandic
annalists appear as his chief guides.   We also find he has left some
dramatic pieces founded on the great events of that remote pe
riod, and which may ultimately once more replace our three King
doms on their ancient pinnacle of glory. With such a view they
were probably composed.

If    there be any circumstance by which the present age is pre
 eminently distinguished, it is the advantage with which the results
 of scientific inquiry have been applied in the practical concerns of
 life. This observation is applicable to almost every branch of
 philosophical investigation; but           truth      strikingly obvious

                                               observers had collected                                         a

322                   Observations on the present State
of the science, and the rude kind of instruments employed in ob-
serving, might lead us to expect.
    But from the moment that the principle of gravitation was dis
covered, and applied to account for the anomalies of the planetary
 motions, it is curious to observe how steadily and how rapidly
 the science has advanced towards perfection.                It resulted from
this   principle, That each    planet  in the  system    exerted a disturbing
force on the motions of the         others,   and that the force of each
depended both on            its
                            distance and         quantityits    matter,    of            or    its
weight. To determine the distances                  the planets, might ap
 pear   a task sufficiently difficult; but                   to of
                                                    estimate with any pre

years ago those best acquainted with the subject could scarcely
have anticipated.
   When Mr. Flam:steed, the first Astronomer Royal, received his
appointment     1675,    in was enjoined “to apply himself with
                                           he
the utmost care and diligence      rectify the tables  to the motions                  in of
of the heavens, and the places      the fixed stars,    of
                                                         order    find                                    to

           much desired   longitude       sea, for perfecting  the art
                                                               at
of navigation.” But such,        his time, was the state
                                                  in            Astro                                of
nomy,
    - that          in   some cases the place                      of   the moon       in   the heavens
                                                                                                           could

                                      of Nautical        Astronomy.                                325
could not be computed to within less than 10 or 12 minutes of
the truth;-an error which would sometimes have rendered the
longitude deduced from a lunar distance, uncertain to the extent
of eight degrees. Therefore, though this method of finding the
longitude at sea appeared the most eligible of any that presented
itself, it was at that time abandoned as altogether impracticable.
   When Dr. Maskelyne succeeded to the situation in 1765, such
advances had been made in astronomical science, that under his
auspices this method of finding the longitude (which in the                                         in
terval had never been lost sight of) was again brought forward;
and after devoting a great portion of his long and valuable life
to bring the method to perfection, he had the satisfaction of
seeing his meritorious exertions crowned with almost complete
success.
   One of the great obstacles to                           its
                                         introduction into general
practice, was the difficulty     making the necessary calculations
                                               in
from the tables and formulas which the labours of astronomers
had supplied.   But this formidable objection was completely
                by
                                                                                                        of on
obviated    the publication   the Nautical Almanac, which
                                                  of
Dr.  Maskelyne's suggestion was undertaken      the Board                      by
Longitude     1766, and
                    in      has ever since been continued an

tudes of the sun; and altitudes of the moon or stars for that
purpose are scarcely ever taken at all. The variation of the
compass is generally taken from charts; and of those navigators
employed in the leading branches of general commerce, who have
qualified themselves to determine the longitude by celestial ob
servations, the number is altogether trifling.
   It happens, in consequence, that in voyages of considerable
length the accumulated error in longitude amounts sometimes to
several degrees.   Ships bound from Greenland for the eastern
coast of England or Scotland, often make the coast of Norway
in the finest weather possible. When ships from Archangel reach
the latitude of Shetland, it frequently becomes a grave question,

aware that they are founded entirely on conjectural principles,
and that in applying them there is always a chance of increasing
the error which they are intended to correct. Yet the attention
of mariners is continually called to their republication under va
rious forms; and without being accompanied by a single hint
that any practicable method of finding the longitude at sea by
observation has yet been discovered.
    It has undoubtedly some relation to the peculiar views of such
persons, that among many ordinary seamen an opinion prevails,
that though the finding of the longitude by observation at sea is
a matter of great and obvious utility, yet the methods which have

   It will be observed, that out of the above fifty independent sets
of  observations, taken at different times during nearly six weeks,
the deviation of any one from the mean of the whole, in one                                                                                                          in
stance only, amounts to twelve miles; and that the average de
viation, either in excess or defect, is less than five miles. It will
be observed also, that the longitudes obtained by distances from
stars are quite as uniform as those deduced from distances of the
sun.    The observations comprise the whole that were taken in
the interval between the first and the last of the days of obser
vation; not one has been omitted. Their results may there
fore be considered as a fair specimen of what, under ordinary
circumstances, the method is capable of effecting; and making
every reasonable allowance, we may infer from them with consi
derable confidence, that a practised observer will generally de
termine his longitude by one set of lunar distances to within less
than ten miles; and that it is quite improbable that the error of
any one set will ever considerably exceed a quarter of a degree.
The mean result of a number of independent sets, will of course
reduce the probable error within still narrower limits.
   The following distances, measured on the 8th and 9th of May,
were taken under extremely favourable circumstances; and the
two observations made on June 26th were made, when, from the
situation of the School with respect to the smoke of the town,
and the smallness of the moon's illumined disk, she could not
be seen with the naked eye.   It will be observed that the devia
  ..
tions from the mean are here very considerably  -
                                                    smaller than
those in the former series.

    lf we suppose that only ten such observations could be obtained
on a voyage from America to Europe, the distance would then be
divided into parts of two or three hundred miles in length, at the

probably greater exactness than the geographical situation of
Tinmouth was till towards the close of the last century.                     And
if the mariner were provided with a chronometer to connect his
lunar observations with each other, he would at                      times have              all

to be examined whether the ship's place had been determined
by appropriate observations on every suitable occasion; whether,
when observations of the sun for the latitude could not be ob
tained,  their place had been supplied by observations of the
moon or some other celestial object; whether the variation of
the ship's compass had been determined by actual observation;
and whether such observations as had been made for the longi
tude, appeared to have been made in a satisfactory manner.
   If the log of every ship were thus subjected to review, we should
soon see the masters of British merchantmen as much distin
guished for their science as they are now for their seamanship.

 consequently, the excess of the expansion of 40 inches of the
 scale, above 40 inches of the bar, for each degree above 54° will
 be .0001657 of an inch; and this quantity has been used in
computing the corrections for temperature.
    The comparison of both scales with the bar was made at the
same time; but to avoid confusion, I have given the results in
separate tables. The scales and the 40-inch bar were laid                             to

shorter than the 40-inch bar 001698; to which adding .000034,
the quantity by which Ramsden's bar exceeds the 40-inch bar,
we have '001732 of an inch for the difference in defect between
General Roy's scale and the standard used in the Trigonometrical
Survey, with which           it was supposed to       be identical.

  If to the above mean "000034 be added as before, we have
•00273 of an inch, by which the distance from zero to 40 inches
of Sir George Shuckburgh's scale is shorter than one sixth part
of Ramsden's bar.
  The very great difference between Ramsden's bar and General
Roy's scale, made me desirous of comparing this last with the
Royal Society's standard; and as I was aware of the existence of
other standards of considerable importance, I resolved to ex
amine them at the same time.
   The Royal Society's scale has been described by Sir George
Shuckburgh : it is of brass, and about the same dimensions as
General Roy's scale, which is already well known.       It has three
parallel lines drawn upon it lengthwise.      On one of the exterior
lines marked E, are two dots expressing the length of the Tower
yard. This is the yard which has been heretofore called, and
which I shall still call, the Royal Society's standard. The mid
dle line has the Exchequer yard marked upon it; and the other
exterior line has dots, at precisely the same distance as those of
the Royal Society's standard.
    Knowing that Mr. Cary had made for Lieutenant-Colonel
Lambton a standard scale, which forms the basis of the Trigo
nometrical Survey carried on by him in India, and aware of the
importance of ascertaining the value of this in parts of other
known standards, I inquired of Mr. Cary whence it was derived,
and was informed that it had been copied from a scale then in
the possession of Alexander Aubert, Esq., and which, after his
death, was purchased by Mr. Jones, of Holborn.          On applica
tion being made by the Commissioners of Weights and Measures
to Mr. Jones for the loan of        it,
                                     their request was readily and
obligingly complied with.                 -
   This scale   is  plate brass, strengthened
                     of                               by   an

contains   61 inches, and has the name         of
                                            Bird  upon            it.
                                                           Two dots
upon two gold pins designate the yard, from which the divisions
of  the scale have evidently been derived.      There    also is third   a
dot, marking, believe, the length
                I                        the French half toise. The
                                          of
dots indicating the yard are those    I employed.      shall call this

   Bird's Parliamentary standard yard     1758 had already been

 by myself, and found     to
                          exceed   about two ten-thousandths
                                    it                                        of

 fect.
    As it was possible that this standard yard of 1760 might coin
 cide with 36 inches of Sir George Shuckburgh's scale, I was
 anxious to compare them together, and by the exertions of Davies
 Gilbert, Esq., M.P., the standard of 1760 was found in the cus
 tody of the House of Commons, and confided to my care.                                      It is
 (as Sir George Shuckburgh observed) precisely similar in form to
 the standard of 1758, the yard being marked by two dots upon
 gold pins, which, though very large, are in tolerable preservation.
    The five standard scales which I have just described, were
 placed together on the 15th of June 1820, and arranged so that
 those of least bulk should be furthest from me during the obser
 vations, as they would be more readily affected by the proximity
 of the person of the observer.
    As I was desirous that comparisons of such importance should
 not rest wholly on my own authority, I requested Dr.Wollaston
 to take two series of measurements, which, together with my
 own, are contained in the following table.

   Adding to the mean thus obtained '000034, the excess of
one sixth of Ramsden's bar above the forty-inch bar, we have
-001849 of an inch for the excess of 40 inches of the standard
used in the Trigonometrical Survey, above General Roy's scale,
differing from the result given by the former comparisons con
tained in Table I. only .000117 of an inch, a difference which
Inay be attributed to uncertainty of temperature.   The mean of
both 00179, is probably very near the truth.

340     Comparison            of British Standards of linear Measures.
sures proposed in their Second Report, that Bird's Parliamentary
standard of 1760 should be considered as the foundation of all
legal weights and measures.
    It may be seen, that the standard thus selected, differs so               lit
tle, if at all, from that of Sir George Shuckburgh, that they may,
for every purpose, be considered as perfectly identical; and this
agreement is particularly convenient, because the length of the mé
tre having been determined by comparisons with Sir Geo Shuck
burgh's scale, and a facsimile of it made by Mr. Troughton, for
Professor Pictet, all measures on the Continent are converted
into English measure, by a reference to Sir George Shuckburgh's
standard.
   In determining the figure of the earth, by means of the mea
surement of distant portions of the same meridian, many ano
malies have been remarked, which may, in some instances, be
attributed to the difference of the standards employed in such
measurements.     As an example of the importance of this consi
deration, I shall examine the results deduced by Lieutenant
Colonel Lambton, from a comparison of three sections of the
great arc measured by him in India, with the lengths of the
French, the English, and the Swedish degrees.    The abridge
ment of Lieutenant-Colonel Lambton's very important   operations
may be found in the Philosophical Transactions      lS18.               for

   In order to reduce the preceding measurements to the English
national standard, we have to multiply the fathoms of the lndian
degree by —-000018, and of the English by +100007, to ob
tain the correction to be applied, with      proper sign,     the              its                           to

 It is not essentially different from the other rules which astrono
 mers have deduced from the hypothesis which, next to the sup
 position of a constant density, suggests itself as the most sim
 ple; namely, that of a density decreasing uniformly as the height
 above the earth's surface increases: but it is distinguished from
 all the other rules     the manner      by

         The most simple hypothesis is that of Cassini, who supposed
       an atmosphere of the same uniform density throughout. Let
       a denote the radius of the earth; and l, the height of the homo
      geneous atmosphere.       It is to be observed, that l will be of the
      same length, so long as the temperature at the earth's surface
      remains constant, although the pressure vary. This will be ob
      vious, if it be considered that the weight of a column of air of
      the length l will change in the same proportion as           density;                                    its

           Account of the Native Copper on Lake Superior.            349
reserving as the subject of a future communication, the facts I
have collected on the mineralogy of the country explored gene
rally.
    The first striking change in the mineral aspect of the country
north of Lake Huron, is presented near the head of the island of
St. Joseph in the river St. Mary, where the calcareous strata of
secondary rocks are succeeded by a formation of red sand-stone,
which extends northward to the head of that river at Point Iro
quois, producing the falls called the Sault de St. Marie fifteen
miles below, and thence stretching northwest along the whole
southern shore of Lake Superior to the Fond du Lac, and into
 the regions beyond. This extensive stratum is perforated at
 various points by up-heaved masses of granite and hornblende,
 which appear in elevated banks on the margin of the lake be
 tween Dead river and Presque Isle, and from the Porcupine
 mountains ten leagues to the west of the Ontonagon river. It is
 overlayed in other parts by a stratum of grey sand-stone, resem
 bling certain varieties of grauwacke, of uncommon thickness,
 which appears in various promontories along the shore, and, t
  the distance of ninety miles from Point Iroquois, constitutes a
 lofty perpendicular wall upon the water's edge called the Pictured
  Rocks, which is one of the most commanding objects in nature.
  So obvious a change in the geological character of the rock strata,
  in passing from Lake Huron to Lake Superior, prepares us to
  expect a corresponding one in the imbedded minerals and other
  natural associations,—an expectation which is realized during
the first eighty leagues, in the discovery of red hematite, prehnite,
opal, jasper, sardonyx, carnelion, agate, and zeolite.                -
   The first appearances of copper are seen on the head of the
portage across Keweena point, two hundred and seventy miles
beyond the Sault de St. Marie, where the pebbles along the shore
of the lake contain native copper disseminated in particles vary
ing in size from a grain of sand to a lump of two pounds weight.
Many of the detached stones at this place are also coloured green
by the carbonate of copper, and the rock strata in the vicinity
exhibit traces of the same ore. These indications continue to
the river Ontonagon, which has long been noted for the large
masses of native copper found upon       banks, and about the con
                                              its

 lisadoe rocks upon the Hudson. There is an island nearly in the
 centre of the river, which serves to throw the current against the
 west bank where the copper reposes, and which, as it is the only
 wooded island noticed in the river, may serve to indicate the lo
 cality of this mineral treasure to the future inquirer.
     Several other masses of native copper have been found on this
river at various periods since it has been known to Europeans,
and taken into different parts of the United States and of Eu
rope, and a recent analysis of one of these specimens, at the Uni
versity of Leyden, proves it to be native copper in a state of un
common purity, and uncombined with any notable portion either

any use of them.       They say that formerly a huge rock of this
metal was to be seen elevated a considerable height above the
surface of the water, and as it has now disappeared, they pretend
that the gods have carried it elsewhere; but there is great rea
son to believe that in process of time the waves of the lake have
covered it entirely with sand and slime; and it is certain that in
several places pretty large quantities of this metal have been dis
covered without being obliged to dig very deep.            During the
 course of my first voyage to this country, I was acquainted with
one of our order (Jesuits), who had been formerly a goldsmith,
and who while he was at the mission of Sault de St. Marie used
to search for this metal, and made candlesticks, crosses, and

354                        Account         of the Native             Copper
pended,    first,-in exploringthe northern shore of the lake, and
the island of Maripeaux,  and afterwards,-in the mining opera
tions which were authorized upon the banks of the Ontonagon.
These transactions will be best illustrated by a quotation from
the narrative account which Henry has himself published. After
returning from the Canadian shore of the lake, and passing Point
Iroquois, where the silver ore was found, he observes,—“Hence
we coasted westward, but found nothing till we reached                                   the      On
tonagon, where, besides the detached masses of copper                                    formerly
mentioned, we saw much of the same metal imbedded                                        in stone.
Proposing to ourselves to make a trial on the hill, till                                 we were
better able to go to work upon the   solid rock, we built a house
and sent to the Sault de St. Marie   for provisions.   At the spot
pitched upon for the commencement    of our preparations, a green
coloured water which tinges iron of  a copper colour, issued from
the hill, and this the miners called a leader.     In digging they
found  frequent masses of copper,  some of which were of three
pounds weight.    Having arranged every thing for the accom
modation of the miners, during the winter, we returned to the
Sault.
   “Early in the spring of 1772 we sent a boat load of provi
sions, but it came back on the 20th day of June, bringing with
it,    our surprise, the whole establishment
      to                                        miners.  They               of

    ing people to work the mine.     Indeed, it might be well worthy
    the attention of the British subjects to work the mines on the
    north coast, though they are not supposed to be so rich as those
    on the south *.”
         The attention of the United States government        appears first
  to have been turned toward the subject during the administration
  of President Adams, when the sudden augmentation of the navy
  rendered the employment of domestic copper in the equipment
  of ships, an object of political as well as pecuniary moment; and
  a mission was authorized to proceed to Lake Superior.              Of the
  success of this mission, as it has not been communicated to the
  public, nothing can with certainty be stated; but from the                                              in
  quiries which have been instituted during the recent expedition,
  it is rendered probable, that the actual state of our Indian rela
  tions at that period arrested the advance of the commissioners into
  the regions where the most valuable beds of copper were sup
  posed to lie, and that the specimens transmitted to Government
 were procured through the instrumentality of some friendly

356                    Account of the Native Copper
copper rock, full of rapids and difficult of ascent.    At the                                               di
stance of three or four  leagues  from the  lake, it is skirted on
either side by a chain of hills whose extreme elevation above the
bed of the Ontonagon may be estimated at from three to four
hundred feet. These hills appear to be composed of a nucleus
of granite, arising through a stratum of red sand-stone, and co
vered by a very heavy deposit of alluvial soil full of water-worn
fragments of stones and pebbles, and imbedding occasional masses
of native copper. Such is the character of the country in the
immediate vicinity of the copper rock, and the latter is mani
festly one of those imbedded substances, which has been for
tuitously exposed to the powerful action of the river against an
alluvial bank.
    During our continuance upon this stream we found, or rather
procured from the Indians, another mass of native copper weigh
 ing nine pounds (Troy) nearly; which will be forwarded to the
 War Department.      This specimen is partially enveloped by a
 crust of green carbonate of copper, which is in some places.
fibrous, and on the under side mixed with a small portion of ad
 hering sand, and some angular fragments of quartz, upon which
 it appears to have fallen in a liquid state. There is also an ap
pearance of crystallization upon one side of     and     portion       it,           a                        of

opinions of mineralogical                writers can be collected on this point,
they teach,--that large veins of native copper are seldom found,
but that it is frequently disseminated in masses of various size in
the rocks, and among the spars and ores of copper and other
mines; and when found in scattered masses upon the surface, is
rather to be considered as a token of the existence of the sul
phuret, the carbonate, and other ores of copper, within the cir
cle of country where it occurs, than as the precursor to conti
guous bodies of the same metal.       “Native copper,” says Cleve
land, “is found chiefly in primitive rocks, through which it is
sometimes disseminated, or more frequently it enters into the
composition of metallic veins, which traverse these rocks. It is
thus connected with granite, gneiss, micaceous and argillaceous
slates, granular limestone, chlorite, serpentine, porphyry, &c.
It also occurs in transition and secondary rocks. It accompanies
 other ores of copper, as the red oxide, the carbonate and sul
phuret of copper, pyritous and gray copper, also the red and
brown oxides of iron, oxide of tin, &c.       Its usual gangues are
quartz, the fluate and carbonate of lime, and sulphate of barytes.
 At Oberstein it occurs in prehnite; and in the Faroe islands it
accompanies zeolite.
    “Native copper is not rare, nor is it found in sufficient quan
 tity to be explored by itself.   It sometimes occurs in loose,                                     in
sulated masses of considerable size".”
    From all the facts which I have been able to collect on Lake
 Superior, and after a deliberation upon them since my return, I
 have drawn the following conclusions:
     lst. That the alluvial soil along the banks of the Ontonagon
river, extending to    source, and embracing the contiguous re

and    tothe Ousconsing, Chippeway and St. Croix rivers       the                              of
Mississippi, contains very frequent, and some most extraordinary
                       native copper; but that                                           it,

 be greatly enhanced by occasional masses and veins of native
 metal.   This deduction is rendered probable by the general ap
 pearance of the country, and the concurrent discoveries of tra
 vellers,  by the green-coloured waters which issue in several
 places from the earth,--by the bodies of native copper found,
 —by the cupreous tinge which is presented in the crevices of
 rocks and loose stones, by the geological character of the - coun
 try, and by other amalogous considerations.  . . .”             *
    These deductions embrace all I have to submit on the minera
  geography of the country, so far as regards the copper mines.
  Other considerations arise from the facilities which that section
  of country may present for mining operations,—its adaptation
  to the purposes of agriculture, the state and dispositions of the
  Indian tribes, and other topics, which a design to commence
  metallurgical operations at the present period would suggest.
  But I am not aware that any such views are entertained by Go
  vernment, and have not considered it incumbent upon me in this
  communication to enter into details on these subjects.          It may
  be proper, however, to remark, that the remote situation of the
  country containing the most valuable mines, does not, at the pre
 sent period, favour the pursuit of mining.        It would require the
 employment not only of the artificers and labourers necessary to
 conduct time working of mines, but also of a military force to
 protect their operations,—first, while engaged in exploring the
 country, and afterwards, in their regular labours.          For, what
 ever may be their professions, the Indian tribes of the north
 possess strong natural jealousies, and, in situations so remote, are
 to be restrained from an indulgence in the most malignant pas
 sions, only by the fear of a prompt military chastisement.           In
 looking upon the southern shore of Lake Superior, the period
 appears distant, when the advantages flowing from a military post
upon that frontier will be produced by the ordinary progress of
our settlement;-for it presents few enticements to the agricul
turist. A considerable portion of the shore is rocky; and                                           its
alluvions are      general

people, to institute mineralogical surveys of the country, no doubt
can be entertained but such researches will eventuate in disco
veries of a highly interesting character, and such as cannot fail
both to augment our sources of profitable industry, and to pro
mote our commercial independence.         In the event of such opera
tions, the facilities of a ready transportation, either in vessels or
barges, of the crude ore to the Sault de St. Marie, will point out
that place as uniting with a commanding geographical position,
superior advantages for the reduction of the ores, and for the
subsequent conversion of the metal either into ordnance or other
articles.  At this place a fall of twenty-two feet in the river in
the distance of half a mile, creates a sufficient power to drive hy
draulic works to any extent; while the surrounding country is
such as to admit of an agricultural settlement.
   I accompany this report with a geological chart    of a vertical
section of the left bank of the Mississippi at St. Peter's, embra
cing a formation of native copper, and in which the superposition
of the layers of rock, and the several subdeposites forming the
alluvial stratum, exhibit a remarkable order. The curvatures in
the lines of the alluvial stratum, represent a natural mound or

attention of naturalists, and in times of ignorance has given rise
to many superstitious notions.                                Some time ago                 I had     an      oppor
tunity of examining two specimens of this plant, which have been
deposited for several years among other rarities, natural and
artificial, which adorn the elegant museum of the late Mr. John
Thomson, merchant, in Edinburgh; and having been permitted
through his liberality to make experiments on these specimens,
I now state the result. The specimens alluded to were examined
by many naturalists in Edinburgh, and by some strangers, both
in their state of contraction and expansion; and, as far as I could
learn from Mr. Thomson, none of them had ever seen anything
of the kind; so that such plants are rare in this country. Mr.
Thomson received one of the specimens from a friend in Aber
deenshire, in whose possession it had long remained, but the
precise time could not be ascertained; and he purchased the
other in Holland, without knowing            peculiar property, and    its                                           it

teenth or   beginning  of the sixteenth century, wrote a book on the
Rose of   Jericho,  which is said to be full of superstitious details of

    to imbibe a larger    portion of water.  But here it must be recol
    lected   that no expansion took place, and perhaps the absorption
    of the   liquid was confined to the stems.
      Erp. 2.-In     a second experiment both specimens were again
     immersed in  water, which rose so high as to cover the lower                                                   di
    visions of the ramifications.  In five hours the expansion was
    complete.    But when the level of the water was diminished by
     the absorption and evaporation,    contraction of the branches
    immediately commenced; and when the vessels were again filled
    up, both specimens were restored to a state of full expansion.
    During the period of immersion, which was continued forty-two
    hours, the alternate expansion and contraction were several times
    repeated. At the conclusion of this period, when both specimens
    were fully expanded, they were weighed, and it was found that
    the augmentation of weight acquired by the short-stemmed spe
 cimen amounted to 37 grains, and therefore it weighed 147 grs.
 The weight gained by the long-stemmed specimen was equal to
 28 grains, for it weighed 118 grains.—Fig. 1, Pl. V. is a view

sin–I     Must apologize to your readers for recalling their at
tention, after an interval of four or five months, to a question
which they perhaps were rather pleased than sorry to think not
likely to be revived. But I have some concessions to make to

is, are not    at to

                                Concessions to               Mr. Ivory.                                    365
nearer to               own, than that of Laplace, which he says
                 Mr. Ivory's
has been         “       ” in the article CoH Esion. The author
                       sneered at
of that article does indeed observe, that Mr. Laplace has had re
course to “the awkward contrivance of building up a curve, like
the arch of a bridge, with fourteen blocks on each side: ” the
same contrivance having been originally employed in this coun
try, and then abandoned for the series: and Mr. Ivory's own
table appears fully to justify this abandonment: nor is it easy to
conceive why he persists in dragging forwards the most illustrious
of the French mathematicians into a comparison, which, with
respect to the present investigation, cannot but be highly disad.
vantageous to him.

      Bouvard (Conn. de T. 1S21, p. 292) makes it +0", 147 in

     *...* With reference to what is stated at page 127 of the pre
 sent volume, it may be proper to mention, that the Zodiacal Stars
 of Wollaston's Catalogue, which are omitted in this, consist of
 such as are not now to be seen in the heavens, and which there
 is good reason to suppose never to have existed, but to have been
 inserted in the original catalogues through miscalculation.         The
 list of such stars is deferred until the completion of the present
 Catalogue,
     P. S.     The compiler takes the liberty of mentioning, that
 should     any    person be in possession of unpublished materials
 which     may  serve to enrich this Zodiacal Catalogue, although not
 of sufficient importance for separate publication; he shall be
 happy to avail himself of them, on their -being communicated

 LXXVIII.          on the Decomposition      of Metallic Salts    by the
                      Magnet.    By  Mr. J. MURRAY.
 IN my Paper “on the decomposition of metallic salts by the
 magnet” transmitted to the Royal Society of Edinburgh I re
ferred to experiments which seemed to me unequivocally to prove
the influence of magnetism in the decomposition of metallic salts
—I continue to receive renewed evidence of the truth of my con
clusions—I shall here take leave to select a few of the numerous
experiments repeated in the course of my researches, and it would,
methinks, be difficult to summon any objection to them ; I con
fess that they appear to me quite satisfactory.
    A solution of permuriate of mercury was by the magnet soon
reduced into running or metallic mercury, and the supernatant
fluid was not affected by the albumen of the egg.
                                                                 IIence,

                  Metallic Salts by the Magnet.                    3Sl
   Hence,   fine steel filings magnetized and administered in sirup
will be   an admirable   antidote to corrosive sublimate.
   Nitromuriate of platinum was decomposed with a brisk effer
vescence distinctly audible and with a visible spray between the
eye and light.
   Fine Dutch steel wire was selected, and proved to be non-mag
netic.—It was thrown into nitrate of silver where it remained for
 14 hours without being affected, part of this was made the unit
ing wire between the N. and S. poles of 2 bar magnets; when,
it became speedily plumed with crystals of silver.
   A portion of the same wire was snapped in twain and the mag
net passed over one of the fragments and both projected into so
lution of nitrate of silver—that which was magnetised reduced
the silver, while the other remained inert.
   The magnetic bar was coated with copal varnish and placed
into solution of muriate of mercury, but reduction took place as
if no such film had interposed.
   Two magnetic bars were left for 2 days in phosporous acid. The
acid was decomposed—the         north pole of one of the bars was
scarcely affected, but the south pole of the other was corroded #
inch deep, and developed the fasciculated structure described by
Mr. Daniel.
   The two magnetic poles (N. and S.) of two bar magnets im
mersed in nitrate of silver were united about 4 inch from their
extremities by a thread of steel; a precipitation of crystals of
reduced silver took place about the uniting wire (very few below)
and the uniting wire itself became so invested.
   I have succeeded in decomposing every metallic salt in this
way to which I have applied the magnet; and I have yet to be
informed that steel, simply as a carburet of iron, will attract all
acids whatever from every metal whatsoever.
   A portion of platinum wire that suffered no change in nitrate
of silver, in solution, was made the uniting wire between the
poles of a powerful horse-shoe magnet (that supported 12lbs.
weight). When this was immersed into nitrate of silver it soon
became discoloured and acted upon.
   When a magnetic bar is plunged into solution of nitrate of
silver it accomplishes   its  complete reduction, however conside
rable the  quantity,  the surface   of the magnet in  contact with the
solution  isnot abraded,  but the surface above the solution  is much
corroded from the escape       ofthe acid vapour, the consequence   of
decomposition.
   When    in the nitrate  of   silver theN.    pole hecame instantly
studded with brilliant    pallets   ofsilver, and formed more rapidly
and more    copiously  round   it than round the south pole. These

   When the magnet is plunged into a solution of muriate of
mercury, and the decomposition takes place which yields globules
of fluid metallie mercury, it will be seen that the action is most
intense at the angles and base of the bar, and the reduction there
more copious and prompt.     This phenomenon is manifested when
a magnetic bar is rolled in iron filings; for it will then be per
ceived that the quantity of adhering particles is much greater in
these places than in other parts of the surface.
   It is an interesting spectacle to witness the reduction of mi
nute metallic balls around the poles, particularly the north and
its base, with a square floor reflecting the form or impress of the
inclined bar—the reduction commences at the edges, and is
striking and beautiful.

The Imperial Almanack ; or, Annual Compendium of Astrono
  mical, Statistical, Scientific, and Interesting Information, for
   the Year    of our Lord 1822.
WE      conceive it to be quite within the scope of our duty as
journalists of science, to notice an Almanack which comes forth
with any pretensions to the character of scientific. Most of the
Almanacks published in this country are sad indications of the
ignorance which still prevails auong our peasantry, ignorance
which can find gratification in the perusal of astrological pre
dictions, and which can tremble or rejoice in the expectation of
events pretended to depend upon the inutual aspects of the moon
and planets. Among the Almanacks published by the Stationers’
Company, there are a few exceptions to this censure; especially
those widely-circulated productions the Ladies' Diary, the Gen
tleman’s Diary, and White's Ephemeris ; the latter of which,
we are glad to observe, has lately received some valuable       im
                                           -
provements.
   The Imperial Almanack, to whose first number we now beg
leave to draw the attention of our readers, presents several new
and interesting features.    The calendar part, which occupies
24  pages, two to each  month,   exhibits    all
                                            the usual matter   ofanº

  The Editor of this Almanack states, in       a concise preface,
that    “hehas been desirous to draw into a narrow compass much
useful information on several topics of general interest amongst
well-informed men of all classes.    He has aimed at correctness
as well as utility, and hopes that, to a considerable extent, both
objects have been attained.     In our judgement his attempt is
completely successful; and we the more cordially recommend
his production to our readers in general.
   We have heard it rumoured that this Almanack has been com
posed by Dr. Gregory, Professor of Mathematics in the Royal
Military Academy: in this case we know not why he should
withhold his name, as so useful a compendium is not likely to
deduct anything from that gentleman's well-earned reputation.

A  letter was read, from Dr. Pearson, announcing some observa
tions of the occultations of the Pleiades by the Moon on July 23
and October 13.           A communication was also made from
M. Piazzi, relative to the late solar eclipse, and detailing the re
sult of his observations.      A paper from Mr. Herschel was read,
giving an account of the mode of dividing astronomical instru
ments as practised by M. Schenck of Berne in Switzerland, one
of the pupils of the celebrated Reichenbach.         The present state
of peace has afforded opportunities of witnessing several of the
productions of these distinguished artists: and they are found

“    Rabies    canna—At   page 311 of your October Number, you
state, on the authority of a correspondent in the Medical and
Physical Journal, that the rabies canina invariably affects the
male dog, and never the female. This assertion, however,                                                  al
low me to state, is false. I have, myself, been recently con

pointer bitch, and the other a pointer dog bitten by the former.

   Phosphorus in Ether.—I had thrown a number of chips of
phosphorus into ether, in order to form phosphorized ether.
After a considerable lapse of time, I found these chips curiously
incrusted with transparent acicular crystals bearing a remarkable
resemblance to the incipient germination of the barley-corn in
the process of malting. Incidental agitation unfortunately de
stroyed them.
   Magnetism.—A small bar magnet being allowed to remain
immersed in tincture of cabbage for two or three days, com
pletely destroyed the blue colour, and the same thing occurred
with that of litmus.                                                                    -
   The  two legsof a horse-shoe magnet (about 3-4ths inch apart)
were placed separately in small cylinders, each containing solu
tion of nitrate of silver—around one of the poles thus separated
a dark cloud collected, and a few solitary crystals studded the
other on the side nearest to that of       adjunct.—Little alteration

   Steam Drying Rooms.--Dr. Ure has stated          his   Nichol       in     “

rapids and falls.     The rapids are generally more navigable near
the   banks,   but  they  frequently extend across the stream, and
then the labour of the boat's crew becomes excessive, every
man being obliged to turn into the water and assist in carrying
the boat sometimes to the distance of half a mile before they
gain the head of one of those terrible impediments.      The Com
pany’s men, upon turning one of the points of the river, observed
the officers of the expedition      making desperate efforts to get
 through the mud along the banks; some of them were up to
 their knees, others up to their waists, while the men were hand
 ing the boats over a most violent rapid, which, though but half a
 foot deep, rendered it necessary that those who stood in the water
 should hold fast by the boat, the impetuosity of the stream being
 so extraordinary as not unfrequently to overturn a man in an                                        in
 stant, and dash him to pieces against the rocks and huge stones
  which      lie
             scattered along the bed      the river.  Indeed, before

be transported to the interior in spite of such frightful obstruc
tions. His men were fatigued in the extreme, and he found it
indispensably necessary to request that the officers of the Hud
son's Bay Company would lighten his boat of the greater part
of the luxuries and instruments.    This accommodation was rea
dily given; and after the most laborious efforts, the expedition
reached the Rock depôt, one of the Company's posts, having
devoted seven days to the exhausting toil of working up thirty
miles of their journey.   Upon arriving at the depôt, the expedi
tion were treated with  great hospitality by Mr. Bunn, the officer
in charge, who entertained them with the tittimeg, a fish which
they admitted was the most delicious they had ever tasted, and
which was caught in God’s Lake (an immense piece of water, so
named from the abundance and excellence of its inhabitants).
   Mr. Hood, who is one of the draftsmen of the expedition, took
 a sketch of the Rock Fall and the Post, which presented one of
the most beautiful objects in these desolate regions, and intro
duced a distant view of a wigwam (an Indian tent) with                                      its   in
mates.    Five days after the expedition left the Rock depôt,
they reached another post, having encountered numberless dif
ficulties similar to those which have been described.  There

which they entered upon Lake Winnipic,            the further side     at                          of

   The expedition passed several other rapids and falls along a
flat, woody, and swampy country, across five miles of which no
eye could see. At length they reached the White Fall, where
an accident took place which had nearly deprived the expedition
of their commander.    While the men were employed in carrying

Franklin walked down alone to view the rapid, the roaring of
which could be heard at the distance of several miles. He had
the boldness to venture along the banks with English shoes upon
his feet, a most dangerous experiment where the banks are flint
stones and as smooth as glass.         He was approaching the spot
from which he could have taken the most accurate observation,
when he slipped from the bank into the water.               Fortunately the
water into which he was       precipitated    was still water.      Had he
lost his footing ten yards lower down, he would have been hur
ried into a current which ran with amazing impetuosity over a
precipice presenting one of the most terrific objects his eyes had
yet fixed upon amidst               all

 ber 1819, after an escape from shipwreck.        It proceeded from
 thence to Cumberland House, one of the Hudson's Bay Com
 pany's settlements, nearly half way aross the continent, this being
 considered the best route in order to reach the sea at the mouth
 of the Copper Mine River. Here the winter of 1819 was passed.
 The depth of snow, and the severity of the cold, during the      al
most interminable winter in this country, precluded the possibi
lity of conveying heavy stores, as only one-third of the year can
be employed with any advantage by the traveller.
    “The time, however, was not lost; we employed it in mak
ing drawings of animals, birds, &c. charts, meteorological ob
servations, and collections of specimens, which we transmitted
to England in the ensuing spring.
    “In  June 1820 we set forward in canoes manned by Cana
dians.    The extreme heat of the short summer, the persecutions
of noxious insects, and occasional want of food, are the usual
concomitants of these voyages; obstacles insignificant in compa
rison with the formidable difficulties which we have yet to over
come.     On the 29th July we arrived at the north side of the
Slave Lake. A party of Copper Indians were engaged to accom
pany us, and we commenced the work of discovery.         On the 1st
of Sept. we reached the banks of the Copper Mine River, in lat.
55. 15. N., long. l 13. W., a magnificent body of water two
miles wide.
   “We had penetrated into a country destitute of wood, and
our men were exhausted with the labours of carrying canoes,
cargoes &c. amounting to three tons, from lake to lake.        Their
broken   spirits were revived  by  our success; but the season was
too far advanced to make any further progress. We returned
to a small wood of pines, and erected our winter residence of
mud and timber, which we have named Fort Enterprise.
    By Indian report this river runs into the Northern Sea, in
West. longitude l 10, and, we suppose, in lat. 72. In June 1821
we shall embark, and the river will enable us to reach the sea
in a fortnight.    If the shore is encumbered with ice, which is
most   probable,  we must then leave our canoes, and trace the
coast on foot to Hudson's Bay; or, if no North-West passage
exists, to the shore which forms the boundary of Baffin's Bay. I
think we are capable of executing this plan.      Our chief dread
was the hostile disposition of the Esquimaux. This danger is
now almost obviated by the arrival of two Esquimaux interpreters,
who have been provided at Churchill, and with great diligence
sent after us.
   “We are not so desolate, perhaps, in our exile, as our friends
may suppose. The rein-deer are numerous about us, and we
live on the most delicate venison.     We find pleasure in the exa
mination of a new and amiable race of people.”

   “We saw on the slope of the Cerra Dnida,” says M. Hum
holdt, “shirt trees fifty feet high. The Indians cut off cylindri
cal pieces two feet in diameter, from which they peel the red and
fibrous bark, without making any iongitudinal incision.         This
bark affords them a sort of garment, which resembles sacks of a
very coarse texture, and without a seam.        The upper opening
serves for the head, and two lateral holes are cut to admit the
arms. The natives wear these shirts of marima in the rainy sea
son : they have the form of the ponchos and ruanos of cotton,
which are so common in New Granada, at Quito, and in Peru.
As in these climates the riches and beneficence of nature are re
garded as the primary causes of the indolence of the inhabitants,
the Missionaries do not fail to say in showing the shirts of marima,
* In the forests of the Oroonoko, garments are found ready made
on the trees.” We may add to this tale of the shirts, the pointed
caps, which the spathes of certain palm trees furnish, and which
resemble coarse network.”

                              -                                        Nottingham, Nov. 16, 1821.
SiR,          E great danger attendant upon the burning the ex
plosive mixture of oxygen and hydrogen in Brookes's Gas Blow
pipe (even with Cumming's Safety Cylinder) has for some time
been a source of regret to the votaries of science.     Those who
have witnessed the beautiful and brilliant effects produced by the
gas blowpipe, and have considered the interesting nature of the
facts that have been thereby developed, and the probable im
portance of the result of future experiments, must lament that
any one should be debarred from using that powerful agent.
The interposition of a screen may indeed prevent the fatal effects
attending the explosion of the gases; but when the operator
hears the alarming crash that announces the destruction of his
apparatus, he must experience considerable disappointment at
the loss of his blowpipe, and the disagreeable interruption of his
experiments. The screen itself is an inconvenience, as it confines
the operator to one particular spot, and requires much compli
cated apparatus, in order to allow the condensing syringe to be
worked by a person on the outside of the screen.             A desire to
obviate these inconveniences led me some time since to contrive
the safety appendages of which I now send you a description, as
adapted to the improved hydraulic blowpipe described in No. 6,

and also to prevent any water entering the pipe when the box
is filled with water above the level of the division B. D. When
air or gas is introduced into the chamber F, previously filled with
water through the pipe G, the air rises to the surface of the
chamber, and expels the water through the cylinder E. The air
cannot return through the pipe G, as the bottom of the pipe is
closed by the water.     There is a small cock or plug at L, in or

   P. S. As it is frequently desirable to have                                  some means of pre
serving the products of experiment unexposed to the action of
the atmosphere, the operator should procure some small glass
tubes, open at one end but hermetically sealed at the other :
when wanted for use, nothing more is necessary than to heat
the tube over a spirit-lamp so as to expel the air, and then                                                in
troducing the product of experiment, immediately to close the
open end of the tube by hermetically sealing                                     it.

     Properties of electrifted Bodies in their Relations to conducting

      P.R.S.*
      I. INmy letter to Dr. Wollaston on the new facts discovered
by  M. Oersted,   which the Society has done me the honour to
publish, I mentioned, that I was not able to render a bar of steel
magnetic by transmitting the electrical discharge across it through
a tube filled with sulphuric acid; and I have likewise mentioned,
that the electrical discharge passed across a piece of steel through
air, rendered it less magnetic than when passed through a me
tallic wire; and I attributed the first circumstance to the sul
phuric acid being too bad a conductor, to transmit a sufficient
quantity of electricity for the effect; and the second, to the elec
                                           air
tricity passing through            more diffused state than through

                               to                         electricity,                 by                       I       in

        I found that the magnetic phaenomena were precisely the
same, whether the electricity was small             quantity, and passing    in
through good conductors           considerableofmagnitude;       or, whether
the conductors were                 so

        of                      both cases they were neither attractive

    IV. Metals, it is well known, readily transmit large quantities
of electricity; and the obvious limit to the quantity which they
are capable of transmitting seems to be their fusibility, or vola
tilization by the heat which electricity produces in        passage                             its

were found to be very great, and the quantity of iron filings that
it attracted, was such  as to form a cylinder round it of nearly
the tenth of an inch in diameter.
   To ascertain whether short lengths of fine wire, prevented from
fusing by being kept cool, transmitted the whole electricity of
powerful Woltaic batteries, I made a second independent circuit
from the ends of the battery with silver wires in water, so that
the chemical decomposition of the water indicated a residuum
of electricity in the battery.   Operating in this way, I found that
an inch of wire of platinum of rºw, kept cool by water, left a
great residual charge of electricity in a combination of twelve
batteries of the same kind as those above mentioned; and after
making several trials, I found that it was barely adequate to dis
charge six batteries.
   W. Having determined that there was a limit to the quantity
of electricity which wires were capable of transmitting, it became
easy to institute experiments on the different conducting powers
of different metallic substances, and on the relation of this power
to the temperature, mass, surface, or length of the conducting
body, and to the conditions of electro-magnetic action.
   These experiments were made as nearly as possible under the
same circumstances, the same connecting copper wires being
used in     all
              cases, their diameter being more than one-tenth                                 of
an  inch, and the contact being always preserved perfect; and
parts  of  the same solutions      acid and water were employed

the different   batteries, and the same silver wires and broken cir
cuit with water were employed         the different trials; and when
                                               in
no globules       gas were observed upon the negative silver wire
                   of
of  the second circuit,        was concluded that the metallic con

or of twenty double plates; but when suffered to be heated by
exposure in the air, it barely discharged one battery.
   Whether the heat was occasioned by the electricity, or applied
to it from some other source, the effect was the same.            Thus, a
wire of platinum, of such length and diameter as to discharge a
combination without being considerably heated, when the flame
of a spirit lamp was applied to it so as to make a part of it red
hot, lost      powerits     discharging the whole electricity

proached very near each other.     When the batteries were highly
charged, so that the intensity of the electricity was higher, the
differences were less between the best and worst conductors, and
they were greater when the charge was extremely feeble. Thus,
with a fresh charge of about one part of nitric acid, and nine
parts of water, wires of                   ºr
                               of silver and platinum five inches
long, discharged respectively the electricity of 30, and seven
double plates.
    Finding that when different portions of the same wire plunged
in a non-conducting fluid were connected with different parts
of the same battery equally charged, their conducting powers
appeared in the inverse ratio of their lengths; so, when six inches
of wire of platinum of sºn discharged the electricity of ten
double plates, three inches discharged that of 20, 14 inch that
of 40, and one inch that of 60; it occurred to me that the con
ducting powers of the different metals might be more easily com
pared in this way, as it would be possible to make the contacts
in less time than when the batteries were changed, and conse
quently with less variation in the charge.
   Operating in this way, I ascertained that in discharging the
electricity of 60 pairs of plates, one inch of platinum was equal
to about six inches of silver, to 54 inches of copper, to four of
gold, to 3-8 of lead, to about ºr of palladium, and ºr of iron,
all the metals being         cooling fluid medium.
                                  in   a

    414        On the magnetic Phaenomena produced by Electricity.
    which itpasses, or in which it is generated,                            contains        a greater
    number of alternations of bad conductors 2
       Mr. Children, in his account of the experiments made with
   his battery of large plates, has ingeniously referred the heat pro
   duced by the passage of electricity through conductors, to the
   resistance it meets with, and has supposed, what proves to be
   the fact, that the heat is in some inverse ratio to the conducting
   power.     The greatest heat however is produced in air, where
   there is reason to suppose the least resistance; and as the pre
   sence of heat renders bodies worse conductors, another view may
  be taken, namely, that the excitation of heat occasions the im
  perfection of the conducting power.           But till the causes of heat
  and of electricity are known, and of that peculiar constitution of
  matter which excites the one, and transmits or propagates the
  other, our reasoning on this subject must be inconclusive.
      I found that when equal portions of wires of the same diame
  ter, but of different metals, were connected together in the cir
  cuit of a powerful Voltaic battery, acting as two surfaces, the
  metals were heated in the following order: iron most, then pal
 ladium, then platinum, then tin, then zinc, then gold, then lead,
  then copper, and silver least of all. And from one experiment,
 in which similar wires of platinum and silver joined in the same
 circuit were placed in equal portions of oil, it appeared that the
 generation of heat was nearly inversely as their conducting power.
 Thus, the silver raised the temperature of the               only four de       oil
 grees, whilst the platinum raised           twenty-two.     The same re

 electricity; thus, circuits                     of
                                    wires placed under water, and acted
    on   by
          the common electrical discharge, were heated             the same            in
 order        as      by
                 the Voltaic battery,       was shown       astheir relative     by
 fusion; thus, iron fusing before platinum, platinum before gold,
 and so on.

         The magnetism produced by electricity, though with the
same conductors it increases with the heat, as I mentioned in
my last paper; yet with different conductors I find it follows
a very different law. Thus, when a chain is made of different
conducting wires, and they are placed in the same circuit, they

highly powerful Voltaic battery, wires                               of

through it (when the syphon was charged) in a direction parallel
to the vessel, which instantly began to move with accelerated ve
locity in an opposite course.        In a few seconds a maximum was
attained, and the future progress exhibited that beautiful, conti
nuous movement which can only find an adequate comparison
in the silent gliding of the heavenly spheres. The idea instan
taneously impressed me, and has been subsequently embodied
with the most encouraging success in the novel machine above
mentioned.
   At present I have applied the principle, under appropriate
modifications, no further than to the sun, the earth, and the
moon, whose circuits, obliquities, parallelisms, and rotations, are
displayed in apparently spontaneous movements on an area of
five feet diameter.     To effect these, four floating syphons are
so combinedin succession, that a quantity of water equal to the
discharge of a single stream about 1-6th of an inch diameter,
with a head of seven inches, elicits every action.             Each motion,
as in   nature, is perfectly  independent;       any  one   may   be checked
without impeding another; and when the hydraulic orrery com
mences      its
             operations,     practically illustrates those incipient and

                                  Fragments of Papyri in 1818.
    In examining, chemically, some fragments of a roll of papyrus
 found at Herculaneum, the leaves of which adhered very strongly
 together, I found that it afforded, by exposure to heat, a consi
 derable quantity of gaseous matter, which was principally                                                 in
 flammable gas, and when acted on by muriatic or nitric ether,                                                    º
 it coloured them; and when it was exposed to heat after the
 action of these fluids, there was an evident separation of the
 leaves of the MS.
    Chlorine and iodine, it is well known, have no action upon
pure carbonaceous substances, and a strong attraction for hydro
gen; and it occurred to me, that these bodies might with pro
priety be used in attempting to destroy the matter which caused
the adhesion of the leaves, without the possibility of injuring the
letters on the papyri, the ink of the ancients, as it is well known,
being composed of charcoal.
   Having through the polite assistance of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt
procured some fragments of papyri on which Dr. Sickler, and
some on which Dr. Hayter had operated, and by the kindness
of Dr. Young a small portion of a MS. which he had himself un
successfully tried to unroll, I made some experiments upon them,
by exposing them to the action of chlorine and the vapour of
iodine, heating them gently after the process. These trials                                               of
afforded more      less hopes
                           or     success. When     of fragment                a                          a all
brown MS.         which the layers were strongly adherent, was
                       in
placed        in      an
                atmosphere       chlorine, there was
                                                  of       immediate                   an
action, the papyrus smoked and became yellow, and the letters,
appeared much more distinct; and          the application     by
                                                                                        of of

layers separated from each other, giving off fumes            muriatic

greatly assisted the separation         the leaves, and  of  smaller de            a

                                                               found the               I
success absolutely depended upon the manner              which the tem       in
                                                                 perature

                       found in the Ruins of Herculaneum.                                            423
perature was regulated.       When the fragment was too rapidly
heated, the elastic fluid disengaged usually burst the folds of the
MS.; and when the heat was lowered too suddenly, the layers
sometimes split in irregular parts, probably from the sudden con
traction consequent on quick cooling.
    From the products of the distillation of these fragments, which
were water, acetous acid, ammonia, carbonic acid, and much                                            in
flammable gas, I inferred that the papyri to which they belonged
must contain much undecomposed vegetable matter, and could
not be purely carbonaceous; but as there were great differences
in the appearances even of the few papyri in England, which
had been presented to His Majesty George IV. when Prince of
Wales, an opinion on this subject was more likely to be correct
when formed after an examination not only of         the MSS. found             all
at  Herculaneum, but likewise                      of

nearly in as large a proportion as the vegetable matter, and they
were light, and the layers easily separated from each other.                                                  A
number of darker brown ones, which, from a few characters dis
covered in opening them, appeared to be Latin MSS., were ag
glutinated as it were into one mass; and when they were opened
by introducing a needle between the layers, spots or lines of
charcoal appeared where the folds had been, as if the letters
had been washed out by water, and the matter of which they
were composed deposited on the folds.       Amongst the black
MSS. a very few fragments presented leaves which separated from
each other with considerable facility, and such had been for the
most part operated upon ; but in general the MSS. of this class
were hard, heavy, and coherent, and contained fine volcanic dust
within their folds. Some few of the black and darker brown
MSS., which were loose in their texture, were almost entirely
decayed, and exhibited on their surface a quantity of brown
powder.
   The persons to whom the care of these MSS. is confided, or
who have worked upon them, have always attributed these dif
ferent appearances to the action of fire, more or less intense, ac
cording to the proximity of the lava, which has been imagined to
have covered the part of the city in which they were found: but
this idea is entirely erroneous, that part of Herculaneum being,
as I satisfied myself by repeated examinations, under a bed of
tufa formed of sand, volcanic ashes, stones, and dust, cemented
by the operation of water (probably at the time of             action                             its             in

                                                       is                       to

altered by heat, are perfectly fresh, and where papyri have been
found in these houses, they have appeared in the form of white
ashes, as of burnt paper; an effect produced by the slow action
of the air penetrating through the loose ashes, and which has
been impeded or prevented in Herculaneum by the tufa, which,
as it were, has hermetically sealed up the town, and prevented
any decay, except such as occurs in the spontaneous decomposi
tion of vegetable substances exposed to the limited operation of
                                                                   -

   The results of the action of heat upon the different specimens
of the papyri, proved likewise, that they had never before been
exposed to any considerable degree of temperature.
   Various specimens of papyri were heated to dull redness in a
small covered crucible of platinum to which air had no access.
Some of the chesnut and most perfect specimens lost nearly half
their weight, and the very black ones, and those containing the
largest quantity of white ashes,     lost more than one-third,  all                                                  as

   Only one method, and that a very simple mechanical one, has
been adopted for unrolling the MSS.      It was invented by Padre
Piaggi, a Roman, and consists in attaching thin animal mem
brane by a solution of glue to the back of the MSS. and carefully
elevating the layers by silk threads when the glue is dry.
   In considering this method in        general application, some         its
circumstances occurred to me which afforded an immediate im
provement.                 A             glue had been used, which,

papyri was performed in the common way, the result obtained
appeared, till it was examined minutely, a perfect column; but
was in fact made up of the letters of different words.   I endea
voured to obtain the fragments of a single leaf attached to a
layer of membrane by applying a solution of caoutchouc in ether
to the surface of a MS., so as to supply the parts of the leaf de
stroyed; but operating in this way, I obtained only a few cha
racters, and never an entire word; so that, after various unsuc
cessful trials, I was obliged to give up the MSS. of this descrip

being always destroyed, and that in so irregular a way as to leave
no entire sentences, or even words.               -

separate by common means, I tried the experiment of heating,
after they had absorbed a small quantity of chlorine; and I found
that in both cases the leaves detached themselves from each
other, and were easily unrolled; but these MSS. had been so
penetrated by water, that there were only a few folds which con
tained words, and the letters were generally erased, and the
charcoal which had composed them was deposited     - on the folds

tained, and in examining about 120 others, which afforded no
hopes of success; and I should gladly have gone on with the
undertaking, from the mere prospect of a possibility of discover
ing some better results, had not the labour, in itself difficult and
unpleasant, been made more so by the conduct of the persons
at the head of this department in the Museum. At first, every
disposition was shown to promote my researches; for the papyri
remaining unrolled were considered by them as incapable of af
fording any thing legible by the former methods, or, to use their
own word, disperati; and the efficacy and use of the new pro
cesses were fully allowed by the Svolgatori or unrollers of the
Museum; and I was for some time permitted to choose and
operate upon the specimens at my own pleasure.        When, how
ever, the Reverend Peter Elmsley, whose zeal for the promotion
of ancient literature brought him to Naples for the purpose of
assisting in the undertaking, began to examine the fragments
unrolled, a jealousy, with regard to his assistance, was imme
diately manifested; and obstacles, which the kind interference
of Sir William A'Court was not always capable of removing, were
soon opposed to the progress of our inquiries; and these obsta
cles were so multiplied, and made so vexatious towards the end
of February, that we conceived it would   be both a waste of the
public money, and a compromise of our own characters, to pro
ceed.
                 4thly. Some general Observations.
   The Roman MSS. found in the Museum, are in general com
posed of papyrus of a much thicker texture than the Greek ones,
and the Roman characters are usually larger, and the rolls much
more voluminous; the characters of the Greek MSS., likewise,
with a few exceptions, are more perfect than those of the Latin
ones.
   From the mixture of Greek characters in several fragments of
Latin MSS., and from the form of the letters and the state of
decomposition in which they are found, it is extremely probable
that they were of a very ancient date when buried.
    I looked in vain amongst the MSS. and on the animal char
 coal surrounding them, for vestiges of letters in oxide of iron ;
and it would seem from these circumstances, as well as from the
omission of any mention of such a substance by Pliny, that the
Romans, up to his period, never used the ink of galls and iron
for writing: and it is very probable, that the adoption of this
ink, and the use of parchment, took place at the same time. For
the ink composed of charcoal and solution of glue can scarcely
be made to adhere to skin; whereas the frce acid of the chemi
                                                                  cal
                        z

430     Observations,  &c. on the  Papyri found at Herculaneum.
cal ink partly dissolves the gelatine of the MSS., and the whole
substance adheres as a mordant; and in some old parchments, the
ink of which must have contained much free acid, the letters have,
as it were, eaten through the skin, the effect being always most
violent on the side of the parchment containing no animal oil.
   The earliest MSS. probably in existence on parchment, are
those codices rescripti, discovered by Monsignore Mai, in the
libraries of Milan and Rome.        Through his politeness I have
examined these    MSS.,   particularly that containing some of the
books of Cicero de    Republica, and which he refers to the second
or third century.     From the form of the columns, it is very pro
bable that they were copied from a papyrus.          The vegetable
matter which rendered the oxide of iron black, is entirely de
stroyed, but the peroxide of iron remains ; and where it is not
covered by the modern MSS., the form of the letter is sufficiently
distinct. Monsignore Mai uses solution of galls for reviving the
blackness.    I have tried several substances for restoring colour
to the letters in ancient MSS. The triple prussiate of potash,
used in the manner recommended by the late Sir Charles Blag
den, with the alternation of acid, I have found successful; but
by making a weak solution of it with a small quantity of muriatic
acid, and by applying them to the letters in their state of mix
ture with a camel's hair pencil, the results are still better.
    It is remarkable, that no fragments of Greek, and very few
only of Latin poetry, have been found in the whole collection of
the MSS. of Herculaneum; and the sentences in the specimens
we unrolled, in which Mr. Elmsley was able to find a sufficient
number of words to infer their meaning, show that the works,
of which they are the remains, were of the same kind as those
before examined, and belonged to the schools of the Greek Epi
curean philosophers and sophists.
    Nearly 1000 columns of different works, a great part unrolled
under the superintendance of Mr. Hayter, and at the expense of
His present Majesty George IV., have been copied and engraved
by the artists employed in the Museum; but from the characters
of the persons charged with their publication, there is very little
probability of their being, for many years, offered to the world;
which is much to be regretted; for, though not interesting from
their perfection as literary works, they would unquestionably
throw much light upon the state of civilization, letters and
science, of the age and country to which they belonged.
   Should discoveries of MSS. at any future time be made at
IIerculaneum, it is to be hoped that the papyri will be imme
diately excluded from the atmosphere, by being put into air-tight
cases, filled with carbonic acid after their introduction. There
                                                               call

can be no doubt that the specimens now in the Museum were
in a much better state when they were first discovered; and the
most perfect even, and those the coarsest in their texture, must
have been greatly injured during the 69 years that they have been
exposed to the atmosphere.     I found that a fragment of a browu
MS. kept for a few weeks in a portion of air confined by mer
cury, had caused the disappearance of a considerable part of the
oxygen, and the formation of much carbonic acid.

the surface of the water, the reflected image that was seen when
the glass was placed above, would appear quite confused and                                                 in
distinct, on account of the great dispersion of the reflected rays,
while the other seen with the glass held below the eye would be
comparatively little affected.     Now this, which is explained in
the most    satisfactory manner by the laws of reflection and re
fraction, is quite irreconcileable with Dr. R.'s hypothesis; and it
would be easy to point out abundance of other examples where
it is equally inconsistent.    What Dr. R. has observed with re
                                                         j.
gard to the appearances of the two images, is nothing more than
one of the many analogical relations that may be observed be
tween the laws of refraction and reflection, but furnishes not the
slightest proof of their identity.
   As to what follows in the remaining part of the paper, it is
merely an extension of the same             which he deduces from
the above experiment: consequently I do not, at present, consi
der it entitled to any further consideration.

The first rain that falls, fills the pores: the    seeds drink up the
moisture.    They  germ, and   put  forth their tender piles to receive
strength and vigour from the solar rays, and prepare themselves
to sip the dews of the evening, or drink deep of the next suc
ceeding shower; while the roots indent deeper, and draw nourish
ment from the surface dust of this calcareous mass. The Guinea
grass in time acquires strength and body sufficient for the planter's
object.    He then sets fire to the field and burns it down, reduces
the whole dry foliage to ashes, which not only creates a quantity
of vegetable earth, but at the same time produces a quantity of
stimulating and fertilizing manure; while the fire calcines the
exposed parts of the calcareous fragments, which pulverized by
succeeding damps, and mixing with the ashes of the grass, adds
to the accumulation of this newly created field. This operation
is continued, and the burning repeated by the planter, till he
has acquired a sufficient depth of soil for more profitable cropping.
In like manner does the hardy Norwegian select patches to raise
a little corn for his scanty pittance of bread.      When nature has
shed over the shelves and flats of his bleak inhospitable rocks, a
quantity of the leaves or needles of the fir, sufficiently thick to
retain moisture for the germination of seeds that fall in promis
cuous profusion, the young firs spring forth thick as the matted
turf. When these have attained a few years growth, in the
autumn, preceding the corn crop, they are burnt down. The
winter snows prepare the ashes for receiving the seed: on the first
return of spring, the corn grows up, is cut down when ready,
 and the patch left for a succeeding crop of young firs, and again
 burnt, in regular rotation.
    To be satisfied that quartz is not absolutely unfruitful, we have
 only to take a view of the sands along the sea-beaten shore,
 raised originally from the depths of the ocean and dashed on the
 beach by the surging waves, blown by stormy winds till imbanked
 beyond the rise of the highest tides.       These sands are scarcely
 dried in the sun and washed      by  the vernal rains, when a race of
 vegetables peculiar to themselves bud forth and flourish, from
 seeds that may also have come from the ocean.           These plants,
 by producing seed, propagate their species, and die.         Their re
 mains produce the first germs of vegetable mould, which in
 process of time accumulate, and may then be enriched by plants
 of a more luxuriant kind, and the soil become too effeminate for
 the coarse-grained aboriginal, whose existence may not now be
 traced, but whose seed lies safely imbedded and gone to rest.
  Disdaining the soil of the effeminate and voluptuous, they claim
 their primitive sand as a dormitory, ready to assume new life the
  moment they are left to the enjoyment of their native

       In this manner soils gradually accumulate, and new vegetables
    appear, not by creation, nor the spontaneous effects of any ad
    mixture of the primitive earths, but from seeds the produce of

    Many of my observations and ideas may appear prolix and
trifling, yet I cannot resist bringing forward whatever may assist
in elucidating a subject I consider so very interesting... Well
may we say with the Spectator, “that to enjoy the world is to
know it; and to have just conceptions of our Almighty Creator
and Preserver, is to trace the infinite greatness and wisdom of
creative power, and the unbounded intelligence and design so
conspicuously displayed in protecting and preserving the work
of his grace.”

SiR,    -I AM a man fond of science, but, having received only a
plain education, have been obliged to work my way by my own
exertions, and such helps as I have been fortunate enough to meet
with.
    Ishall ever remember with gratitude the obligations I am un
der to your and other periodical works, by whose kind assistance
I have been enabled to ask, and have generally received, such infor
mation as I at times stood in need of, and without which I never
could have surmounted the many difficulties which opposed my
progress.    Believe me, it is only persons like me, who have been
obliged to fight their way through the difficult paths that lead to
mathematical knowledge, it is only such, I say,+that can ap
preciate the utility of such publications.     But, my gratitude is
leading me from my object, which, as aforetime, is to ask as
sistance.   Chance, some time ago, threw in my way a Catalogue
of Double Stars, presented by J. South, Esq. to the Astronomical
Society. Their places, as the learned author informs us, are taken
from Bode's Catalogue, but reduced by him from the year 1801
to that of 1821.      I was acquainted (at least I thought so) with
 the method of    making   these reductions; but as I had never at
 tempted     it,

as well as I could, the object to be obtained.    All this he per
fectly well understood, except the reducing the seconds of a de
gree into seconds and tenths of time (the right ascension being
given in space by Bode, but in time by Mr. South). This I told
him he must leave for me, as it required some little knowledge of
decimals, which he had not yet learned.        My boy was much
flattered in being thought worthy to attempt what he had seen
his father so long puzzling at in vain; but I can never forget his
exultation and triumph, when he put into my hand his calcula
tions,      all
           agreeing with Mr. South's Catalogue.     “Why how,”
   exclaimed,     have you done it?” “Done                replied:                                  he

“Why, those plaguing seconds          degree which

 founded exultation,                  by

    Nov. 22. Read a Paper on some Alvine Concretions; by
 J. G. Children, Esq.
       —  30. This being St. Andrew's day, the Anniversary of
 the Royal Society, the President announced that the Council
 had awarded the two Copley Medals; one to John Fred. Her
 schel, Esq., for his mathematical and optical Papers published
 in the Transactions; the other to Captain E. Sabine, R.A., for
 his Experiments on the Pendulum, and on Magnetism, made
 during two Expeditions of 1818 and 1819 to the Arctic Regions.
    In his discourse, the learned President said, he was sure the
 Society would regard this decision of their Council with peculiar
 pleasure, as the labours for which the medals were awarded be
 longed to members of their own body, who were still actively
 engaged in the pursuit of science.       In speaking of the pa
pers of Mr. Herschel, Sir Humphry said, that he had not only
distinguished himself by profound mathematical investigations,
but had likewise made applications of the science of Quantity to
physical researches of considerable extent and importance, prov
ing himself as an analyst worthy to be associated with a Brink
ley, an Ivory, a Woodhouse, and a Young, who in late times
have redeemed the character of British Mathematics; entering
those noble paths of investigation opened by the genius of New
ton, and too long travelled in almost exclusively by illustrious
foreigners.    In Physical inquiry, he had, by his optical papers,
                                                                                        i
added to the obligations already owing to the name of Herschel,
in everything connected with modern astronomy and the know
 ledge of the celestial spaces.    The President then proceeded to
 point out at considerable length the object and nature of his                     re
 searches, and gave an analysis of his papers.         In delivering the
 medal to Mr.   Herschel,    the President   begged    him to receive it
 as a mark of respect of the Royal Society, and to preserve it as a
pledge of future labours in their cause and that of science.           He
exhorted Mr.Herschel to employ his various talents with the same
industry and zeal in the progress, as he had shown in the com
mencement of his career; and to recollect, that no pursuits were
more useful, more dignified, and more honourable, at            periods all        of
life. Of this        he
                   had    striking example
                           a                      his illustrious father,
                                                         in
who, full    of
              years and     glory, must,
                             of                said, view his exertions
                                                    he
               delight, and,  looking
                                                          in to
with infinite                          forward       the time when his
own imperishable name would                be
                                      recorded      the same annals                of
philosophy with that       his son, must enjoy
                            of                            wereas  it anti     by
cipation double immortality.
            a                            discussing Captain Sabine's
                                               In
labours, the President paid many compliments                       to
                                                          the manner               in
which the Arctic expeditions had been planned and conducted.
Active courage,       he
                     said, was         so
                                    innate      the British character,
                                                     in
that   it   hardly    required
                           -      praise   :    but there was       a   fortitude  in
                                                                             meeting

                               Royal Society.                                         449
meeting danger and difficulty, and a steadiness and patience in
bearing privations, which demanded the highest commendation.
These had been shown in a remarkable manner by Capt. Sabine,
who in the Polar ice, and almost in darkness, had conducted his
observations with as much precision as if he had enjoyed the re
pose and conveniences of the happiest climate and situation.
   Sir Humphry entered into a historical view of the progress of
experiments made upon the pendulum ; and did ample justice
to the accuracy and beauty of Captain Kater's invention, which
Captain Sabine employed in his experiments: these seem to have
been conducted with equal address and industry, and give a
compression of about      rif
                          for the polar diameter of the earth.
    “Captain Sabine (Sir Humphry said) is not here to receive the
mark of your approbation; for, after braving the long night and
almost perpetual winter of the Pole, he is now gone,with the same
laudable object, to expose himself to the burning sunshine and
perpetual summer of the equator.” After expressing his warm
hopes that he would return from these new and dangerous ex
peditions, after having accomplished                   his
                                                 objects, Sir Humphry
                                               all
presented the medal       to Mr. Sabine, assuring him           the deep        of
interest taken  by   the Royal   Society     his brother's
                                              in            pursuits and
success. The President dwelt             glowing terms
                                         in                            on
                                                            his disinter
                                                                  he
                                 of of
estedness and genuine love          science, which       said made him
consider the good opinion           the Royal Society        the highest   as
reward he could receive for his scientific labours.          He had no
doubt,   he  said, that       pleased Providence      grant him health
                                                                 to
                      he if
                          it
and  a   safe return,      would not only establish fresh claims                        to
                                                   of of
their   admiration,   but likewise       to
                                        that               all
                                                   his countrymen who
were lovers either   of  useful science       orbold and hardy enter
p rise.

    as given by Strabo and Eratosthenes.   The positions laid down
    by Bruce, in his map, are tolerably accurate, but he has traced
    the limits of the ruins too much to the south.    M. Cailliaud
    proposed to remain during the rainy season at Sennaar, with
    the expedition, to take up his residence in the Fazuelo, and to
    proceed afterwards up the Bahr-el-Aliad, or the White River,
    which he will ascend to a certain distance, in order to pro
    cure information respecting the course of the Niger.   The ther
    mometer was constantly during the month of April as high as
    45 degrees and upwards, and even as high as 48 degrees (43 de
    grees of Reaumur, exposed no doubt to the sun). M. Cailliaud
    could not discover any remains of the tradition of Queen Can
    dace, whose dynasty, according to Bruce, were in his time still
    on the throne of Chendy.      For a long time our traveller has
    not taken the meridian altitudes of the sun, which is too close
    to the zenith, and he can only determine the latitudes of places
    by means of the moon and stars.

been brought in.

different parties of the natives, from Longsor and from Karnack.
The former were the most fortunate, discovering a tomb that
had never been opened, and where they found, on the third day,
a mummy with five cases; they asked for this 6000 piastres of
Egypt (133l.), which was paid them.       The fellahs of Karnack,
thus disappointed, and having had three days toil for nothing,
had warm disputes with those of Longsor ; and mischievous con
sequences might have ensued, as their villagers took a part in the
quarrel, if the possessor of the mummy had not given 1000                                         pi
astres (22l.) extra to the Arabs of Karnack, to whom also some

class struck the ship, and knocked part of the false keel    just                                               off
abreast of the main channels.   The animal then remained for

of  five knots; but such was the force when she struck the ship,
which was under the cat-head, that the vessel had stern-way                                                            at

and went               on
                her beam ends.     By cutting away the masts, the
vessel righted; the upper deck was then scuttled; and some
water and bread were procured for the two boats,          which the                               in

affording hardly any nourishment, they resolved                  venturing                        on
for the continent, leaving behind three men. The two boats, soon
after leaving the island, parted.       One       them, containing only      of

     Itwas some time ago stated in the accounts received from
New    Granada,  that the whole, or the greatest part, of the results
of the botanical researches of the celebrated Mutis, carried on
at the expense of the Spanish Government for more than forty
years, in one of the finest regions of South America, had been
recently destroyed amidst the conflicts of contending armies, and
considerable regret was excited in the breasts of scientific men
on account of so irreparable a loss. We have, however, the sa
tisfaction to announce, that the whole, with the exception of a
few indices and partial descriptive catalogues, have arrived safe
at Madrid, and are now deposited at the Botanical Garden, in
charge of Professor Gasca, who very kindly showed the series of
drawings to a gentleman lately arrived from Spain. They were
executed in the most beautiful style, on the spot, chiefly by South
Americans, who, it is acknowledged, have a peculiar taste for
design and painting, and they exceed 4000. The specimens
were collected in wide and secluded districts, in a tropical clime,
and       all
         copied the moment each plant was gathered.       This gives
to  the drawings     brilliancy and nature almost unequalled, and
                             a
among them are some hundreds           plants never before known
                                                  of                                     in

                             SOUTH AMERICAN            POTATOE.
     Some time last year,                    Mr. Thomas Lorimer, residing near
Rockhall, the seat               of   Sir Robert Grierson, Bart., received from
an   acquaintance,           a   single potatoe which had been brought from
                                                                    Spanish

       Spade and Plough Husbandry.—Animal          Sagacity.     461
 Spanish Town, South America. This potatoe he kept till spring,
when cutting it in two, he planted the pieces at a trifling distance
from one another, in a corner of his garden.       These plants, or
slips, speedily sprung up, and in due time put forth blooms and
apples like any other potatoe; and there was nothing either in
the colour or luxuriance of the shaws that excited particular no
tice; but on raising the said exotics, Mr. Lorimer found to his
surprise, that they had produced no fewer than 41 potatoes; 30
of which are of an uncommon size. Two of the largest of these
were brought to this office a few days ago, one of which weighed
2lb. 20z., and the other llb. 14oz, while both measured nearly
 18 inches in circumference.     From the size and appearance of
the  thumping    roots, we were inclined to set them down as a spe
cies of the  yam:   but on this point Mr. L. completely undeceived
us, by declaring that the residue of the produce, which cannot
weigh much less than 30lbs., is rather of a round shape, and in
other respects bears a pretty close resemblance to the common
potatoe.—Dumfries Courier.
     -            SPADE AND PLOUGH H USBANDRY.
   In the neighbourhood of Hamilton an experiment was made
this year to try the difference between the spade and the plough.
A field was taken, which was in beans last year, and oats the
year before; two ridges were dug and two ploughed alternately,
and the whole was sown on the same day; a part both on the
ploughed and dug being drilled with the garden hoe; the whole
was reaped the same day; and being thrashed out, the result was,
that the dug sown broadcast was to the ploughed sown broad
cast as 55 to 42. The dug and drilled was as 204 to 12}, upon
the ploughed and drilled. The additional grain is not the only
beneficial result gained by digging, as in this instance there was
also a great deal more straw. The land is free of weeds, and will -
be more easily fallowed next year.
                         ANIMAL SAGACITY.
   We do not think the records of instinct ever contained a more
extraordinary   instance than we are now about to relate, and for
the truth whereof we pledge ourselves. A few days since, Mr.
Joseph Lane, of Fascombe, in the parish of Ashelworth, in this
county, on his return home, turned his horse into a field in which
it had been accustomed to graze. A few days before this, the
horse had been shod all-fours, but unluckily had been pinched in
the shoeing of one foot. In the morning, Mr. Lane missed the
horse, and caused an active search to be made in the vicinity,
when the-
           following singular circumstance transpired:—The ani
                                                                mal,

mal,   as   it may be supposed, feeling lame, made his way out of
the field by unhanging the gate with his mouth, and went straight
to the same farrier's shop, a distance of a mile and a half. The
farrier had no sooner opened his shed, than the horse, which had
been evidently standing there some time, advanced to the forge,
and held up his ailing foot.     The farrier instantly began to ex
amine the    hoof, discovered the injury, took off the shoe, and re
placed it inore carefully; on which the horse immediately turned
about, and set off at a merry pace for his well-known pasture.
Whilst Mr. Lane's servants were on the search, they chanced to
pass by the forge ; and on mentioning their supposed loss, the
farrier replied, “Oh he has been here and shod and gone home
again;” which on their return they found to be actually the case.

    SiR,--I      herewith send you descriptions of an Anthelion, a Me

have recently seen here.
    Anthelion.            An Anthelion of several colours appeared in the
forenoon of the 26th ultimo, for two minutes only, in a narrow
cirrocumulative cloud that was passing slowly to the eastward.
It was about 125° distant from, opposite to, and of the same
altitude as the real Sun, and 2-3rds of a degree in diameter. It
certainly was different, both in colour and distance, from any I
have hitherto seen; as it had much the appearance of a beau
tifully coloured parhelion rather irregular in shape, the prismatic
colours not having exhibited a circular form. The anthelia that
 I  have formerly seen have been formed on the surfaces of dense
                                                                                       \

         Alarge Meteor. —On the evening of the llth instant, at 20
    minutes before 10 o'clock (mean time) I observed a luminous
    Meteor, apparently 6 or 7 inches in diameter, descend from an
    altitude of about 15° between the Dragon and Bootes.          It ap
    peared quite circular, of a silvery colour, and to a considerable
    distance around spread out a light far brighter than that reflected
    from the Moon, notwithstanding she then shone brilliantly in a
    cloudless space.                   Its
                           motion was slow, compared       that    mid                            to       of
