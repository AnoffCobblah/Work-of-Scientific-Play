                I. On Alpha- and Beta-Orcine.
               By John STENHouse, Esq., Ph.D.”
A     PAPER on the lichens, read before the Royal Society
       about three months ago, contained among other matters
some observations upon orcine, and described an easy method
of procuring that interesting substance in a perfectly colourless
state. In the present notice, I purpose narrating a few obser
vations I have subsequently made, and to describe a new
species of orcine derived from usnic acid, to which I have
given the provisional name of beta-orcine.
   The usual mode of preparing alpha-orcine is by boiling
lecanoric, erythric, or any of the similar principles of the
lichens, with an excess of lime or baryta. The orcine obtained
in this way is always more or less coloured. Without enter
ing into the minute details of the process for preparing the
colourless orcine, which are fully given in the paper already
referred to, I only remark in passing, that it may be readily
procured by boiling the alpha- and beta-orsellesic, or the ery
threlesic acids, in pure water from half an hour to an hour,
when a great deal of carbonic acid is given off; and on the
solutions being concentrated and set aside, abundance of cry
stals of colourless orcine are deposited. If a little animal char
coal is kept in the solution while it is being concentrated, it
will be found useful in preventing any tendency to oxidation.
   A quantity of colourless orcine prepared in this way was
dried at the ordinary temperature, and analysed with chro
mate of lead. 0.332 grn. substance dried at 60° F. gave
0.717 carbonic acid and 0.204 water.

     It will be observed that this analysis agrees pretty closely
 with Mr. Schunck's, and that the small amount of colouring
 matter remaining in orcine prepared by the old method has
 no perceptible effect upon the result of the analysis.
     Orcine is a body which retains its water of crystallization
 with great tenacity. It may be rendered anhydrous, however,
 in several ways, as when it is distilled, when it is heated to
 212° F., and, as I have recently found, when it has been re
 peatedly crystallized out of aether, or even when it has been
 dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid.
     The last-mentioned mode of rendering orcine anhydrous,
 though tedious, requiring from three to six weeks, is by far
 the best and safest, as the orcine remains perfectly colourless,
 and all risk of decomposition is avoided. The following are
 the results of several analyses of colourless orcine, prepared
 from alpha-orsellesic acid at four different times, and dried in
 7)(IC!!0.
     I. 0.264 grim. substance gave 0.6610 CO2 and 0.1570 water.
     II. 0.349 grim. substance gave 0-8675 CO2 and 0.205 water.
     III. 0.324 grim. substance gave 0.8085 CO" and 0.1985
 Water.
     IV. O'2064 old orcine, also dried in vacuo, gave 0.515 CO%
 and 0 130 water.

    I. and II. analyses were made with chromate of lead, and
the heat strongly raised towards the close of the combustion.
No. III. was burned with pure oxide of copper, assisted with
a current of oxygen gas. No. IV. was orcine prepared by the
old process, and also dried in vacuo: it too was burned with
oxide of copper, assisted by a current of oxygen. It is ob
servable, that the quantity of hydrogen in the two last analyses
is too high: the reason of this is, that from fear of decompo
sing the orcine, I did not venture to heat the mixture of the

          Dr. J. Stenhouse on Alpha- and Beta-Orcine.                    3
substance and oxide of copper in the tube, and then to dry it
with an exhausting syringe, as is usually done.
   It is plain from the result of these analyses, that anhydrous
orcine has lost three atoms of water, and that its probable
formula is Cal His Og, that of hydrated orcine being Cal HisO3.
   I subjoin the results of previous experimenters on anhydrous
orcine, with which it will be seen that these analyses agree
pretty closely.

   In order to corroborate this determination of the atomic
weight of orcine, which, it must be confessed, still remains
somewhat doubtful, I made repeated attempts to prepare the
lead salt previously described both by Dumas and Schunck,
but I am sorry to say with by no means satisfactory results.
This perhaps is not to be wondered at, when we consider how
easily alterable orcine is. In my first trials, I treated an
aqueous solution of orcine with a very slight excess of sub
acetate of lead. The precipitate in the course of a few minutes
assumed a deep red colour, and the compound appeared so
unstable, that much of the orcine was removed by the wash
water; so that the more the precipitate was washed, the greater
was the amount of oxide of lead it contained.             In some sub
sequent trials, when the quantity of subacetate of lead which
was added was not sufficient to precipitate the whole of the
orcine in the solution, the precipitate, though reddish-coloured,
was not nearly so deeply coloured as when a slight excess of
base had been employed. The amount of oxide of lead in
these precipitates was however greatly diminished; and though
frequently repeated, I never could get the results of the various
trials to agree in a satisfactory manner. Mr. Schunck admits
that his experiments were somewhat similar. I subjoin the
results of a few of my experiments.
   I. Orcine precipitated by a slight excess of subacetate of
lead, 1-305 grim. salt gave 0.467 PbO and 0.525 Pb= 1.081
PbO-82-83 PbO per cent.
   II. Where part of the orcine remained in solution, 0-773
salt gave 0.1383 PbO and 0.371 Pb = 0.5379 PbO3=69-58
PbO per cent.
   III. Prepared in the same way, but at a different time,
0.667 salt gave 0:200 PbO and 0.231Pb=0.4488 PbO-67:28
per cent. .

          Eramination of the Crystalline Form of Orcine.

                              Beta- Orcine.
    The substance to which I have given the name of beta
 orcine is obtained from usnic acid, which is perhaps the most
 widely diffused of all the known proximate principles of the
 lichens. Knop found usnic acid in several species of Usnea,
 such as Usnea florida, U. hirta, and U. plicata. Messrs.
 Rochleder and Heldt extracted it from the lichen Rangéferinus,
 Usnea barbata, and Ramalinea calicaris. In addition to these
 sources, I have found it in the Evernia Prunastri and in Ra
 malinea Frawinia. The best mode of extracting usnic acid,
 as I have fully detailed in the paper already referred to, is by
 macerating the lichens in milk of lime, and precipitating the
 filtered solution by muriatic acid.
     Beta-orcine may be obtained from usnic acid by several
 processes. The method which I have found most convenient
 is by subjecting the crude usnic acid, previously dried, to de
 structive distillation. The beta-orcine sublimes, and is depo
 sited in long yellow crystals, partly on the neck and sides of
 the retort; but by much the larger portion of it is dissolved
 in a brownish-coloured resinous liquid which passes into the
 receiver. A very large quantity of a bulky porous charcoal
 remains in the retort.
     The resinous fluid which has passed into the receiver must
 be repeatedly treated with considerable quantities of boiling
 water to dissolve out the orcine, which is retained by the resin
 with great pertinacity. The solutions containing the impure
 orcine should be concentrated to the consistence of a syrup,
 and left standing for some time in a flat open vessel. In the

          Dr. J. Stenhouse on Alpha- and Beta-Orcine.            5
course of a day or two the liquid becomes filled with a mass
of brownish-coloured crystals, which must be collected and
º         between folds of blotting-paper to free them from ad
  ering resin and colouring matter.
    The crystals must be further purified by digestion with
animal charcoal, and by being repeatedly crystallized out of
water: they then form hard, slender, brittle prisms, which
still retain a faintish yellow shade, and are about half an inch
long. In order to obtain beta-orcine perfectly white, it must .
be crystallized out of weak spirits, assisted, as before, by a
little animal charcoal. So soon as the crystals are all deposited,
they should be removed from the solution and dried on blotting
paper, as the mother-liquor, on standing for some time, becomes
reddish-coloured. Beta-orcine crystallizes out of weak spirits
in larger and more regular crystals than those obtained from
its aqueous solutions. It forms four-sided prisms, surmounted
at either end by well-defined four-sided pyramids. These
crystals are hard and brittle, have a brilliant lustre, and are
from an inch to three-quarters of an inch long. I am indebted
to Professor W. H. Miller of Cambridge for the subjoined
measurement of their angles.

    Beta-orcine, like ordinary orcine, to which in so many re
 spects it bears a very close analogy, may be also obtained by
 boiling usnic acid with an excess either of caustic potash or
 of lime or baryta. By none of these methods, however, is it
 so readily procured as by destructive distillation. By much
 the larger portion of the usnic acid is converted by the potash
 into an acid resin, with which the alkali combines; the free
 alkali is also apt to destroy most of the orcine as it is formed.

6        Dr. J. Stenhouse on Alpha- and Beta-Orcine.
When usnic acid is boiled with lime or baryta, the excess of
base is removed by a current of carbonic acid gas, and the
clear liquor evaporated to dryness on the water-bath. The
dried mass is then to be agitated with aether; and on the eva
poration of the aether, the beta-orcine is deposited in nearly
colourless crystals.
    Beta-orcine is tolerably soluble in cold water, though not
nearly so much so as alpha-orcine, but very soluble in boiling
water. It is very soluble in alcohol and in aether. It has a
faint but distinctly sweetish taste. It has no reaction upon
test-paper, and is a perfectly neutral body. When heated, it
sublimes without leaving any residue. The smell of its vapours
is suffocating. It inflames readily, and burns with a strong
smoky flame.
    In the course of a few minutes it assumes, with ammonia,
a beautiful blood-red colour, which on standing becomes
deeper. Beta-orcine is much more rapidly acted on by am
monia than alpha-orcine. The colour which alpha-orcine
yields with ammonia is reddish-brown. When left in contact
with caustic or carbonate of potash, beta-orcine yields a beau
tiful reddish-purple dye stuff. This appears to be the same
amorphous red body which Knop observed when preparing
usnate of potash, without, however, his remarking the source
 which produced it. The smallest portion of beta-orcine in
 stantly strikes a bright blood-red colour, with a solution of
hypochlorite of lime; just as alpha- and beta-orsellic and ery
thric acids do with the same reagent. Alpha-orcine, on the
other hand, yields a purple violet colour with hypochlorite of
lime.
    The crystals of beta-orcine, when dried in the air and then
in vacuo over sulphuric acid, do not lose any water. The four
following analyses were made with beta-orcine prepared on
four different occasions: they were all dried in vacuo:—
    I. O-317 grm. orcine burnt with chromate of lead, gave
0-8002 CO2 and O-209 water.
    II. 0.391 grim. orcine burnt with chromate of lead, gave
 O'985 CO2 and 0.254 water.
    III. 0.2608 grim. orcine burnt with chromate of lead, gave
 O-657 CO2 and O' 173 water.

      These analyses give Cas, H2A, Olo as the formula for beta
  orcine: it is, however, perfectly empirical. When beta-orcine,
  previously dried in vacuo, was heated in the water-bath to
  212° F., it parted with a considerable amount of water. The
  orcine did not become in the least degree coloured, neither
  did it melt, though the temperature was raised to 230° F.
  Alpha-orcine melts and becomes coloured at 212° F. A
  quantity of beta-orcine, which had been kept four weeks in
  the water-bath at 212° F., had lost nearly 30 per cent. in
  weight, and was still continuing to lose weight. This how
  ever did not arise merely from the loss of water, but because
  a considerable portion of the orcine itself had volatilized even
  at the comparatively low temperature of 212°F. The quantity
  of water which beta-orcine contains cannot therefore be deter
  mined by drying it on the water-bath.
     I have been unable to determine the atomic weight of beta
 orcine. It gives no precipitate with nitrate or ammonio
 nitrate of silver, with the salts of iron, baryta and copper, or
 with neutral acetate of lead. It yields a pretty abundant
 whitish precipitate with subacetate of lead, which is soluble in
 an excess of the precipitant. This precipitate is exceedingly
 alterable, and immediately becomes deep red-coloured, even
 more rapidly than is the case with alpha-orcine in similar cir
 Cumstances.

 NoHº            first pointed out the possibility of applying the
         coloured films (apparenze elettro-chimice) which he dis
covered, to determine the diffusion of the current in nonpris
 matic conductorst. But with his unacquaintance of Ohm's
law of the motion of electricity, even according to one dimen
sion, he was unable to give proper evolution to this idea. . In
a treatise entitled Note sur les anneaux produits par le dépôt
des orydes métalliques sur les métaurf, M. Edmond Becquerel
attempted to subject the simplest form of Nobili’s rings to a
rigid investigation, both in an optical and electrical point of view.
#. rings were obtained by a method given by M. Becquerel,
senior, viz. by pouring a thin layer of a solution of oxide of

8       M.M. E. du Bois-Reymond and W. Beetz on the
lead in caustic potash upon a plate of German silver (? “Mail
lechort”); the free extremity of an extremely fine platinum
wire drawn out by Wollaston's method, and fused in a glass
tube, is dipped into the liquid opposite the middle of the plate,
the wire is  |. connected with the negative and the plate with
the positive pole of a battery composed of eight or ten pairs.
A delicate film of peroxide of lead is deposited upon the
plate, and as the current is stronger in the direct line from
the point towards the plate than in the lateral directions, this
film diminishes in thickness from the centre to the circum<U+017F>er
ence, and hence exhibits Newton's rings most splendidly. M.
Becquerel remarks, that as the index of refraction of the
peroxide of lead lies between that of the air and that of the
metal, the rings in the present instance should be compared
to those appearing in transmitted light rather than to those
obtained by reflexion. In fact it appears that the arrange
ment of the series of colours in Nobili's rings from without
inwards, very accurately corresponds to that from within out
wards in Newton's rings by transmitted light. The next point
 is to prove that the relative thicknesses of the film, which may
be ascertained from the laws of diffusion of the electric current,
in conjunction with the law of electrolysis, agree with those
 which, as regards the light and dark parts of the rings, are
readily deduced from optical considerations.
     Speaking of the law according to which the thickness of
 the rings varies, M. Becquerel, says, “It is easy to find the
 value of the curve formed by the upper surface of the film of
 oride, in a plane perpendicular to the metallic plate and passing
 through its centre. Let BX... (see Pl. I. fig. 1) be the metallic
plate, B its centre, A the extremity of the negative point of the
pole, and let us suppose that the electricity escapes by that point
 only. Let C be any point; when the current passes, the thickness
 of the layer of oride deposited at the point C will dependentirely
 upon the intensity of the current and the distance AC. Ad
 mitting that this intensity is in inverse proportion to the distance
 AC, we should have

 as the equation of the curve which limits the upper part of the
Jilm of oride, m being the distance A B, and A a coefficient de
 pending upon the conducting power of the solution and the power
  of the battery. If care be taken to place the point A very near
  B, within a half-millimetre, m* may be omitted before aº, and
 the equation becomes

i.e. the thickness of the films of oxide is evidently in inverse
proportion to the diameters of the rings.”
    If the thickness of the rings is inversely proportionate to
their diameter, it is evident that if we multiply the relative
thicknesses at certain spots derived from optical considerations,
by the distances of these spots from the central point, we must
obtain a constant product. Becquerel based his theory upon
this test as applied to two selected plates, and found as per
fect an agreement of the twofold results as could be expected
in admeasurements of this kind.
    On account of the beautiful idea of this experiment, I regret
to be obliged to remark that the accordance of observation
with calculation found by M. Becquerel can scarcely have
depended upon anything more than a somewhat inexplicable
result of chance.
    First, it may be remarked, that in the present arrangement
the electricity is not propagated in straight lines. In the
 case of the diffusion of the electric current in non-prismatic con
 ductors, as is well known, we have first sought for iso-electric
 surfaces, or surfaces of equal tension. If the electrodes are
 metallic, but the conductor, in which the diffusion of the cur
 rent takes place, one of Volta’s second class, the tension at
 all points in it may be regarded as the same*; consequently
 the surface of every electrode represents the first iso-electric
 surface. At the margins of the conductor the iso-electric sur
 faces are situated perpendicularly. A system of curves inter
 secting them at right angles, which thus lie close to the mar
 gins of the conductor, and are at right angles to the surfaces
 of the electrodes, form the lines of the current, in which the
 motion of the electricity occurs.
     If the curves of the current in the above arrangement coin
 cided with the lines of conduction drawn from the point to the
 plate, the iso-electric surfaces would form spherical cups.
  Such of these spherical cups as were in contact with the plate
 when the projection of the point towards it was perpendicular,
 would then possess a degree of tension common to all points of
 the plate, and therefore all cause of further currents between
  the latter and the former would vanish.
     It must remain for the superior analysis of those ingenious
  philosophers who have lately engaged in the solution of so
  many important problems in which the diffusion of the cur
    * G. S. Ohm, The Galvanic Circuit investigated mathematically. Taylor's
  Scientific Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 401. The procedure recommended by M. Bec
  querel, to conduct the current to the centre of the back of the plate, must
  therefore have arisen from misunderstanding. It could hardly produce the
  slightest perceptible distortion of the rings, if the current terminated at the
  circumference of the plate instead of the spot above mentioned.

   10 MM. E. du Bois-Reymond and W. Beetz on the
  rent in non-prismatic conductors is concerned, to ascertain
  the true course of the electricity under the present circum
  stances. Although M. Smaasen has already extended the
  fundamental equation of the dynamic equilibrium of electricity
  to the three dimensions, nevertheless we have no instance of
  one of these, however simple, being susceptible of mathematical
  treatment. But in this case, by means of mere inspection, we
  may ascertain with tolerable certainty, the probable manner
  in which the curves of the current are arranged. Let us first
  determine the terms of the phaenomenon.
     Imagine an indefinite flat plate XX", the resistance of which
  vanishes in comparison with that of a uniform layer of a liquid
                                                    ::::::FER= r

 conductor covering it everywhere of equal thickness. The
 other electrode in the form of a hemisphere dips into this to
 such an extent, that the surface f" of the layer passes through
 its centre O. We have no concern with what takes place in
 the immediate vicinity of the centre O' of the plate, perpen
 dicularly beneath that of the electrode; for we cannot make any
 observations here, because those rings which are fit for inves
 tigation do not commence until some distance from the centre.
 It is thus easily seen that the curves of the current, which pass
 to the more distant points of the plate, must proceed almost
 rectilinearly for a very long time; they then curve inwards
 towards the plate, so as to reach it at right angles. Moreover,
if we conceive two curves formed by the current lying near
each other, in a plane falling perpendicularly upon the plate
through the point from which the current issues, we also
see, that in the rectilinear portion of their course they will
remain very near each other; but that they tend to separate
from each other, when, having arrived near the point at which
they reach the plate, they curve inwards towards it (Ors,
Or's').
    The curves formed by the current at every point of the
conductor through which it has passed, indicate the direction
of the motion of the electricity; but the consideration of their
mere length is by no means sufficient to determine the inten
sity of the current, i. e. the resistance divided by the elec
tromotive force, for each spot of the conductor. M. Bec

               Theory of Nobili's Coloured Rings.                 lI
querel overlooked this in making his formula, when he re
garded the intensity of the current for each point of the plate
as inversely proportional simply to the length of the line of
conduction.
    To find the intensity of the current at a given infinitely
small point of the conductor, we have first to calculate the
resistance which the space between the curves of the current
circularly bounding this spot offers to the current. ... In the
present instance, however, the resistance of the curvilinearly
bounded portion of this space in comparison with that of the
part rectilinearly bounded may probably be neglected, be
cause, as we have mentioned, in the former, which of itself
is much shorter, the curves of the current also separate from
each other, so that the section of the path of the current is
here much greater. Thus, according to M. Becquerel's no
longer justified process, the conducting rays Os, Os' may be re
placed by Ors, Ors', the true curves of the current; or, neglect
ing the resistance of the portion rs, r's', the triangle Oss' by the
triangle Orr', with tolerable accuracy, but then, although
starting from the same point of view, we must alter the ex
pression of the resistance, which a partial current has to over
COme,
    We must then consider here as the partial path of the cur
 rent, the space between two conical envelopes, the axis and
apex of which coincide with each other, as also with the centre
 O of the point from which the current escapes, and its perpen
 dicular distance OO' from the plate, which latter forms the
 common basal surface of the cone, and the very obtuse angles
 of which are separated at the apex by an infinitely small angle
 24. The resistance of such a space is easily determined. If
we denote the distance of any point of the conical envelope from
 Obya, the angle at the surface of the base by y, and the inverse
 value of the resistance for the unit, the length and the section
 of the path by o, the element of this becomes

 The integration may be completed between the limits #=5=

 #=p, any small, but finally constant quantity, as the lower
 boundary. . Thus by p we must understand the diameter of
 the hemispherical point from which the current escapes, for
 if we neglected it, as in M. Becquerel's process, the resistance
 would become infinite.     We have                -

   If this expression be multiplied by a further constant quantity
a, as the atomic weight of the product of decomposition pre
cipitated, its density, &c., we shall obtain a measure of the
absolute quantity of the product of decomposition which is
precipitated in a unit of time by the partial current upon the
ring of the plate from which the conical envelopes arise, but by
no means, as Becquerel appears to think, of the relative thick
ness of the film, in which this quantity is deposited. To
determine this, it is clear that we must take into consideration
the extent of the surface upon which the deposition occurs.
This is readily found by differentiating the expression of the
basal surface of the cone as a function of the semidiameter,
and consequently the approximative law of the diminishing
thickness of the rings, when dI is divided by 2x.adw. This
law therefore takes the form—

                                    (*4 m”).
if, again, as in Becquerel's example, m* be supposed to vanish
in comparison with a”, and the constants be included under
the sign A, we get simply
                                   A
                               &=75.
Hence the thickness of the ring would not be, as M. Becquerel

               Theory of Nobili's Coloured Rings.               13
thinks, inversely proportional to the first power of the radius,
.    what is partly evident, even from simple inspection, to its
Ct/06.
   It is not easy to comprehend how M. Becquerel's observa
tions correspond with considerable accuracy to the first power.
It is however possible that a kind of polarization produced by
the electromotive reaction of the products of decomposition may
have been concerned in it. This cannot be supposed to be
owing to the oxygen, because, even where the plate is difficultly
oxidizable, it is applied to the higher oxidation of the oxide
of lead; but the unequal film of the peroxide of lead itself
may be taken into account, by which perhaps the nearer points
of the plate become negative to the more remote parts, which
may have produced an increased thickness of the film upon the
latter in comparison to the former. And in fact, e.g. copper,
which becomes oxidized when exposed to the influence of a
powerful current, became negative to that which formed the
positive electrode when a weaker current was used.
    M. Becquerel also calculated the form of the curve which
limits the film of the product of decomposition in that case
in which, instead of the mere point, a shorter or longer piece
AE of the wire formed the positive electrode. According to
him, this form would be given by the definite integral
                            *n  Adz
in which m and a retain their former signification; z represents
the perpendicular variable distance of the point P of the wire
from the plate, the action of which upon the point C should
be exactly observed, and n the distance EB (see the figure).
   But this formula is not really based upon true notions, be
cause, e.g. dz, in the manner in which it enters into it, cannot
well represent anything more than a constant section perpen
dicular to the direction of the current, whilst, when measured
at 2, it forms a variable angle with this direction, which only
becomes a right angle when z=0, and whilst partial currents
flow in a four-sided pyramid from the surface of the base to
the apex, yet every instant pass over a different section. Lastly,
that in this case in determining the partial path of the current,
the object has again been attempted in a perfectly arbitrary
manner, and with the omission of the most essential conditions,
after the above remarks, does not require further illustration.

14     MM. E. du Bois-Reymond and W. Beetz on the
                                II.
  The observations above communicated by Dr. du Bois-Rey
mond on the law according to which a substance separated
by electrolysis is deposited upon an electrode to form Nobili's
coloured rings, induced me to make some experiments upon
this point, the results of which I shall detail in the following
remarks.
   In my experiments I generally used the same electrolyte as
M. Becquerel, a solution of oxide of lead in a concentrated
solution of potash, sometimes, but more rarely, a solution of
the acetate of lead. A plate of one of the noble metals served
as the anode to receive the film of peroxide of lead; the readily
oxidizable metals appeared but little adapted to form receivers
of the coloured rings, probably because they themselves are
acted upon, partly by oxidation, partly by the transference of
particles of their surface to the cathode. ... Even silver was not
sufficiently free from this objection to allow of its being re
commended for this purpose, so that I used either Daguerreo
type plates covered with gold by voltaic electricity, or a plate
of platinum. The cathode consisted of a thin platinum wire
fused into a glass-tube, and was connected with Grove’s zinco
platinum battery, consisting of from three to sixteen elements
(each presenting about 1.5 square inches of active platinum
surface). According to the composition of the solution, the
surface of the plate, and the battery used, from three to eight
systems of rings were formed, which were always of a paler
colour towards the centre, and ultimately passed into the
brown colour of the peroxide of lead. To determine the radii
of these rings, the diameter of the darkest and of the lightest
spots of the rings was measured by monochromatic illumina
tion. When any ring was irregularly formed on one side,
the radius of the other was directly measured. By the former
procedure the errors of the admeasurements are halved, and
thus slight errors in the determination of the central point are
not of so much importance.
   The next point was to determine whether the thickness of
the films really diminishes from the centre according to the
law of the cubes of the radius, as should occur according to
the above calculation. It is evidently most advantageous for
this investigation, to calculate the lengths of the undulations
of the colours employed each time, from the radii of the same
system of rings, measured with differently coloured illumina
tions, and to compare them with the known values for these
lengths as ascertained by other experiments. We thus incur
no risk of being deeeived either by anomalies in the intensity

 of the current, as where the differences of the radii are great,
or by a defective determination of the film of peroxide of lead,
as when different systems of rings are used, which will be
mentioned more in detail below.                          A line was drawn from the
centre upon the plate covered with the coloured rings, and this
radius successively placed in the portions of a prismatic solar
spectrum, which are indicated by the lines B, D, E, and F.
The following table contains the results of the experiments
with two different plates. The second system of rings was used
in each, this being the most perfectly formed. To render the
table intelligible, it need only be remarked, that r denotes the
radius in each case, and r, the radius of the ring, which was

The length of the waves of the various colours was deter
mined by assuming as a basis for the red at the line B, the
length given by Schwerd, viz. 0.000688 millimetres; this num
ber was multiplied by the proportion of the thickness, i. e.
by the inverse cubic proportion of the radii for the ring of
the red, and that of the colour observed each time.                                          The
numbers used by M. E. Becquerel, deduced from Fresnel's
experiments, differ considerably from those of Schwerd,
as 0.000645 millim. is given as the length of the waves in
the red at the line B, which however corresponds to a red
between C and D. The results obtained show unequivo

16      M.M. E. du Bois-Reymond and W. Beetz on the
cally, that the thickness of the ring is in inverse propor
tion to the cube of the radii; in the second table, for the
sake of comparison, a calculation is given of the length of the
undulations, as found from my admeasurements, but following
Becquerel's principle, that the thicknesses are inversely pro
portional to the first powers of the radii. The difference is
so great, that in the first series of experiments, in which the
radius of the line B was = 13">1, that for the line F would
be = 18"1 instead of 14".7, to allow of 0.000486 being ob
tained as the required length of the undulations, a difference
which cannot in any way be attributed to an error of ob
servation.                     -
    To allow of our comparing the different systems of rings
with each other, a question must first be answered which M.
Becquerel considered as already determined. Thus, if the
index of refraction of the peroxide of lead lies between that of
the subjacent metallic plate and that of the air, the incident
ray in each case is reflected from a denser into a rarer medium,
and thus the minima of the effects of the light when mono
chromatic illumination is used, will occur when the thicknesses
of the reflecting films are as the even numbers; if however
the film of peroxide of lead is more highly refractive than the
metallic plate, the relative thicknesses are as the uneven
numbers. I have not succeeded in finding the peroxide of
lead among those substances, the refractive indices of which
have been given by any experimenters; and as M. Becquerel
does not state whether he was led to the assumption that the
refractive index of the peroxide of lead lies between that of
the air and the metal, by earlier experiments, his own admea
surements, or mere suppositions, and as such an assumption
can by no means be made à priori, I endeavoured to determine
this value myself. A film of peroxide of lead was precipi
tated upon a gilt plate of silver until it had assumed a uni
form brown colour.      It was then capable of taking a tolerable
polish. The substance polarized a ray of light reflected from
its surface, so nearly rectilinearly, that the angle of polariza
tion could be determined with tolerable accuracy. To control
it, a beam polarized at an azimuth of 45° was made to fall
upon such a surface of peroxide of lead, the reflected beam
was again reflected by a second surface of the same kind, and
the angle of incidence at which the elliptic polarization most
completely passed into the linear sought for. Both methods
gave very nearly the same result, i. e. the mean for the angle
of incidence at which the maximum of polarization occurs
was 63°. Hence the refractive index of the peroxide of lead
is =tang 63°= 1964, which is nearly equal to that of the

                      Theory of Nobili's Coloured Rings.                                 17
sulphate and carbonate of lead, and is much less than that of
the metal.
    If therefore the radii of the dark and light rings, when
monochromatic illumination is used, are measured, the even
products of the cubes of the radii in the case of the dark rings,
and the uneven products in the light rings should yield nearly
constant values. To produce monochromatic illumination I
used the flame of alcohol, into the wick of which common
salt had been rubbed. This light is undoubtedly more pure
than the red light which is produced by coloured glass. The
following tables will show how far experiment approximates
to calculation:—

   In these Tables we find an undoubted agreement of the
values n.1%; the radii of the external rings alone give different
results, and are not therefore made use of in calculating the
mean. These rings are denoted in the Tables by a star. Even
at the second light ring complete confirmation of the law of
the inverse cubic proportion of the radii commences. The
cause of the difference in the breadth of the above most exter
nal rings is twofold. First, the entire calculation upon which
it is based depends upon the assumption that the anode is
an infinite plane. If this assumption is not satisfied, the curves
of the current deviate further from the rectilinear form, their
concave sides being turned towards the anode; thus the film
of peroxide of lead must evidently be of sufficient thickness,
even at a less distance than is expected from calculation, to
correspond to the required multiple of the quarters of the
length of the undulations of the yellow light, i. e. the radius
 of the ring will be less. Secondly, the charge which the
plates acquire is not uniform throughout, but in the middle,

                Theory of Nobili's Coloured Rings.                    21
where the intensity of the current is greatest, it also is
greater than at the margins of the plate. Hence the preci
pitate is relatively more copious at the margins, and conse
quently the radii of the rings are, from this cause, smaller
than we should anticipate from calculation. However, since
the charges” are not in direct proportion to the intensities of
the current, but increase asymptotically from a certain intensity,
this influence may be made to disappear in proportion as the
intensity of the battery used is increased. For this reason
the experiments in the above Tables are arranged according
to the number of elements of which the battery used on each
occasion consisted.       It is at once seen, that, with few ex
ceptions, the greater the number of active elements the more
the experiments approximate to calculation. In the first se
ries of experiments, where the unessential resistance is some
what considerable in proportion to the essential, the influence
of the charge becomes so evident, that the differences of the
values found for nr” from the mean, evidently follow a definite
law. In the subsequent series of experiments this conformity
to a law ceases to be perceptible.
   M. du Bois-Reymond has already observed, that the charge
upon the plates is less to be ascribed to a deposition of
oxygen than to the greater or less thickness of the film of
peroxide of lead. It might appear inconsistent with the prin
ciples of the contact-theory, that a greater electromotive ac
tivity should be ascribed to a thicker than to a thinner film.
But this is not really the case. When, for instance, a plate
of gold is connected, as the anode, with the platinum plate of
a Grove's battery, and the deposition of the peroxide of
lead commences, this substance will not form a coherent
film, but its particles will be arranged in a more diffused
manner the less the intensity of the current is at this part of
the plate. Hence the electrolyte serves in some parts to con
nect the zinc and platinum circuit (which is composed of the
zinc of the Grove's battery and the platinum point forming
the cathode) with the gold and platinum circuit, sometimes
to connect the former with a circuit of platinum and peroxide
of lead. The latter action, which opposes the direction of the
battery originally used in the same manner as a charge, will
become more evident the nearer the particles of the per
oxide of lead are situated as regards each other, i. e. the
thicker the film is which is already deposited.
    For the purpose of investigating which of the two sources
   * By charge (Ladung) the author evidently means the cause of that elec
tromotive reaction to which the term polarization is more frequently ap
plied.—ED. Phil. Mag.

22        MM. E. du Bois-Reymond and W. Beetz on the
of error, the finiteness of the plate or the charge, exerts
 most influence upon the result of the experiment, I had a cir
cular disc of brass, a foot in diameter, thickly gilt and polished.
 The rings which I obtained upon it j so as to form a
 radius of more than three inches, but then exhibited almost
 the same irregularities in the proportions of the radii as those
on the smaller plates. The influence of the charge is thus far
greater than that of the finiteness.
    As M. Becquerel in his experiments made use of German
 silver as the receptacle of his coloured rings, it appeared to
 me desirable to compare my admeasurements on plates of the
 noble metals with some made under exactly the same circum
 stances as those of the French philosopher; for in these
 plates of German silver we should not expect the same dis
 turbing influence of the polarization as in surfaces of gold
 and platinum, which receive the charge to a far greater ex
 tent. The coloured rings which I procured upon plates of
 German silver, appeared at first of a very brilliant colour.
 This however, on account of the oxidizability of the metals, did
not continue long; the surfaces became spotted, and the rings,
on monochromatic illumination, were marked with curves,
differing from the circular form by numerous indentations.
 The German silver plates, like the other ignoble metals, were .
not well-calculated for the present object, so that I made no
further use of them; however, the experiments made with
them convinced me that here also the law of the cubes as the
proportion of the radii is correct, and on account of the slight
influence exerted by the charge, it is attained in this case
with greater accuracy than with plates of the noble metals.
An example will serve as a proof of this:

   Lastly, a third cause might urge the outermost rings nearer
to the centre. Thus, when the point forming the cathode is
not approximated so closely to the anode that this distance

(m) is infinitely small compared with the radii, we do not
have nºr”= const., but n(r” +m”)*= const.                       In the above
experiments the distance m is entirely neglected. I therefore
made some experiments in which the point of the cathode was
first placed in immediate contact with the anode, and then
by a support, the clamp which supported the anode was
moved, and the elevation measured. In these experiments
the rings augmented in breadth as m increased, and conse
  uently were less numerous. In the case of the value m = o
the plates obtained must naturally be of one perfectly uniform
colour, and in fact, by removing the cathode quite away from
them, we can cover small plates with a tolerably equal coating.
These colours are still better obtained when the point is
placed at a considerable distance above the plate; it is not
advisable to replace it by a plate, because the precipitate is
then formed very violently and with the colour of the peroxide
of lead itself, whilst with a less intensity of the current used
we can regulate its formation.
    With regard to m I obtained the following results with two
plates:—

    Both in these and in the previous series of experiments, I
have detailed, in the last column, those values which would
be equal to a constant quantity, if the radii were really in
 inverse proportion to the thickness of the deposited films.
 Each of the tables shows how little this law is confirmed by
 my experiments; the progress of one value to another is in
 fact so considerable, that e.g. in Table VII. the numbers vary
from 17:4 to 129-75.      To decide what circumstances could
have exerted so remarkable an influence upon the experiments
 of M. E. Becquerel, that when taken into consideration his
 experiments might be made to accord with those just detailed,
 is a problem for the solution of which I do not feel myself
adequate.

               III. On the Attraction of Spheroids.
                  By HENRY HENNEssy, Esq.”
 1. TN the mathematical theory of the attractions of sphe
         roids, a well-known theorem occurs, which was first
pointed out by Laplace, and of which he has given demon
strations in the third book of the Mécanique Céleste, and in
the Connaissance des Temps for 1820.         The remarkable cha
racter, as well as the fundamental importance of this theorem,
excited several eminent geometers to thoroughly examine the
demonstrations given by its discoverer. The result was, that
not only were these demonstrations considered defective, but
also, according to Lagrange and Ivory, the generality of the
theorem was thought incapable of being established.
    Notwithstanding these objections, the truth of the theorem
in question seems never to have been doubted by its illustrious
discoverer; and similar views appear to be entertained by
some of his successors. . Among the rest, M. de Pontécoulant
presents, in the twentieth article of the fifth book of his Théorie
Analytique du Système du Monde, a demonstration of this
theorem, which he considers free from any serious objection.
On closely examining his investigation I perceived two errors,
which in the end compensate each other; and it also appeared
that some points in it were capable of being more rigorously
established. I hope, therefore, that the following demonstra
tion, which is free from the defects alluded to, will not be
considered useless.
   To render this improved form of M. De Pontécoulant's
                 * Communicated by the Author.

       Mr. H. Hennessy on the Attraction of Spheroids.                25
demonstration more easily comparable with that which he has
given, I shall adopt the same notation. Hence if

V is a function, the differential coefficient of which with re
spect to r, the radius drawn from the origin of the co-ordi
nates to an attracted point, would represent the attraction of
any spheroidal mass on that point in the direction of r. The
distance from the origin of an elementary parallelopiped of
the spheroid is represented by r", and the density of this pa
rallelopiped by p': 3' represents the angle between r" and any
one of the co-ordinate axes, and w' the angle comprised be
tween the projection of r on the plane of the other two axes,
and the direction of either of them. The angles 6 and a refer
to r in the same      way   that 6' and w' refer to r".        The limit
ºr refers to 3', 2x to w!, and R, the radius of any point on the
surface of the spheroid, to r".
   2. The theorem to be proved may be thus stated.
   If a material point be situated on any part of the surface of
a spheroid having the radius r at that point, and if the sphe
roid differ so little from a sphere having the radius a, that
r= a(1 + ay), y being a rational function of P. and w, and & a
constant so small that any terms in the development of r mul
tiplied by its second power may be neglected, then for the
point in question,

 would be infinite for any finite value of h. If p < 1, p +h

 second term would be again infinite for any finite value of h.

 IV. On a Function of the Red Corpuscles of the Blood, and on
    the Process of Arterialization.       By G. Owen REEs, M.D.,
    FIR.S..t
A<U+017F>ºº                    it has been long known that the contact of
        oxygen is necessary in order to bring about the change
from venous to arterial blood, we are not yet in possession of
evidence calculated to explain satisfactorily the manner in
which that change is effected.
    The experiments of Dr. Stevens, published some years ago,
proved that another cause than oxygenation was sufficient for
the production of a bright arterial tint in venous blood; and
it is now universally admitted, in accordance with those expe
riments, that neutral salts possess that power even when the
contact of air is carefully avoided.
    Notwithstanding the similarity of effect which they were
capable of producing, it appeared doubtful that any connexion
would ever be traced between these two causes apparently of
so opposite a character.
    The absorption of oxygen was known as necessary to the
preservation of animal life; and it seemed, therefore, that
neutral salts ought more properly to be regarded as merely
simulating by their action an effect indispensable to existence,
rather than as indicating a function necessary to its main
tenance.                                                      -

                  Red Corpuscles of the Blood.                29
   The experiments I am about to detail are, however, I believe,
sufficient to prove that the two causes referred to bear the
closest relation to each other; for the action of oxygen will
be shown to be the more remote cause of the phaenomenon,
while the immediate cause for the production of the bright
arterial colour consists in the action of a neutral salt, formed
by the contact of oxygen during the process of respiration.
    When experimenting on venous blood some few months
ago, I was struck with a peculiar garlic odour evolved by
the corpuscles when they were burst by the sudden addition
of water. Reasoning on this fact, and being aware of the
existence of phosphorized fat as a constituent of the blood, I
resolved if possible to ascertain at some future period the more
exact conditions of its presence, and the relation it might bear
to the function of respiration. It was not difficult to imagine
that the exposure of venous blood to the action of the atmo
sphere at a temperature of 98°, and, as occurs during respira
tion, over an enormously diffuse surface, would completely
effect the combustion of any phosphorus it might contain;
and, moreover, that this elementary body, if existing dissolved
in fatty matters, would consume together with its solvent, and
thus afford as the result of combustion three compounds,
known both in the characters of excretions and constituents of
animal bodies, viz. carbonic acid, water, and phosphoric acid.
    Knowing that carbonic acid and water were excreted by the
 lungs, and also that it was now very generally admitted that
 more oxygen was absorbed during respiration than could be
 accounted for by the carbonic acid expired, I was greatly en
 couraged to prosecute my inquiries, and put the theory to the
 teSt.
    Now if it were true that during respiration phosphorized
 fats are consumed in the venous blood-globules, the phos
 phoric acid formed by the contact of oxygen must unite with
 the blood, for none of this acid is expired; and as the globules
 or corpuscles float in an alkaline liquor, this result ought to
 be brought about with the formation of an alkaline phosphate
 in the liquor sanguinis of arterial blood.
    Thus, while the venous blood-globules should contain the
 phosphorized fats in quantity, the serum of venous blood should
 contain far less alkaline phosphate than that from the blood
 of the arteries.
     The type of the venous blood would then be—
     1. A globule containing phosphorized fat.
     2. A liquor sanguinis deficient in alkaline phosphate.
     The type of the arterial blood would be—
     1. A globule containing no phosphorized fat.

30           I)r. G. O. Rees on a Function of the
   2. A liquor sanguinis containing a large proportion of alka
line phosphate.
   The proof consisted therefore in the examination of these
separate parts of the blood. The serum of course would suf
fice for the examination of the liquor sanguinis, as it would
contain all the alkaline salts.   The clot would serve for the
examination of the fats.
   Exp. 1. A quantity of venous blood was obtained from the
external jugular vein of a cur dog, and subsequently arterial
blood was drawn from the carotid artery of the same animal.
These specimens were allowed to coagulate. The serum which
separated was in both cases evaporated to dryness, and then
incinerated in a platinum dish. Distilled water was poured
upon the ashes (which were not completely decarbonized), and
the solution so formed poured off and evaporated. Dilute
nitric acid was next added to the dry residues, when lively
effervescence occurred in both cases.    The acid solution, after
being gently warmed, was now tested for phosphoric acid as
follows.
   Nitrate of silver was added, which caused an immediate and
copious precipitate of chloride of silver. When the solution
was no longer affected by the further addition of this reagent,
the precipitate was allowed to subside.
   The supernatant clear liquid was next poured off and neu
tralized by the addition of a solution of caustic ammonia;
when, in the case of the arterial blood, a plentiful precipitate
of the yellow phosphate of silver was observed, while the so
lution obtained from venous blood yielded no evidence of the
presence of phosphoric acid, though tested in precisely the same
manner.                                    -
   Exp. 2. Blood was drawn from the external jugular vein of
a cat while under the influence of aether.   Half this blood was
set aside, the other half was arterialized by exposure over the
surface of several dishes. On separately treating the serum
of these two portions of blood, and testing them for phosphoric
and carbonic acids, as described in Exp. 1, both proved to
contain an alkaline carbonate; but the serum from the blood
which had not been exposed to air gave no evidence of phos
phate, while that which had been arterialized by exposure
yielded a copious precipitate of yellow phosphate of silver on
the addition of the nitrate and caustic ammonia.
   Exp. 3. Blood was drawn from the median cephalic vein
of a man, the subject of epilepsy. He had dined about half
an hour. On coagulation, the serum of this blood was milky,
owing to the presence of chyle. I obtained evidence of the
existence of an alkaline phosphate in this serum. The car

                      Red Corpuscles of the Blood.                         31
bonate was abundant in the ashes.              I now digested a portion
of the clot of this blood in aether, and found that the fats so
extracted yielded an ash on incineration, having a very pow
erful acid reaction. The fats obtained from the serum by
means of aether yielded an alkaline ash.
    Exp. 4. Blood was drawn from the temporal artery of a
man suffering from a disease of the eyes. It was brightly
arterial, and did not buff or cup on coagulation. On exami
nation, the serum of this blood gave no evidence of the pre
sence of an alkaline carbonate, but the alkaline phosphate was
in abundance.
    The fats extracted from the clot by means of aether afforded
an ash possessing a very alkaline reaction. The fats obtained
from the serum also yielded an alkaline ash.
    Exp. 5. A spaniel dog was bled from the jugular vein.
Half this blood was immediately corked up in a bottle, the
other half was arterialized by passing air through it, by means
of a glass tube affixed to a pair of common bellows. On
examining the serum from these specimens, that obtained from
the portion of blood which had been arterialized, as above de
scribed, gave plentiful indications of an alkaline phosphate,
and none whatever of an alkaline carbonate; while that from
the other portion gave no indications of an alkaline phosphate,
but very satisfactory evidence of the presence of an alkaline
carbonate in the ashes.
    Exp. 6. A portion of blood was drawn from the jugular
vein of the same dog that had served for Exp. 5. Half this
blood was immediately shaken up with an equal bulk of recti
fied aether.
    The mixture was set aside for twenty-four hours, and the
aether which had collected on the surface was then poured off.
The mass of blood below was now subjected to the action of
a current of air passed briskly through it. No brightening of
colour took place now that the aether had removed the fatty
mattel'S.
    Exp. 7. The serum was poured off from the other half of
the blood drawn for Exp. 6, and the crassamentum broken up
in a dry basin. Distilled water was now added; and a large
quantity of corpuscles being thus burst, a solution of red co
louring matter was obtained,
    This mixture was filtered through blotting-paper, and the
clear solution placed in a vessel containing plates of metallic
zinc *. The metal precipitated the colouring matter after a
    * In order to effect this precipitation, it is necessary either largely to
 dilute the solution, or to use a very large surface of zinc, otherwise the
 precipitate will adhere to the zinc, and prevent further action. A piece of
 platinum affixed to the zinc assists the action greatly.          -

precipitate falling composed of the haematosine combined with
oxide of zinc. This precipitate was collected and digested
with aether. On evaporating the aethereal solution, fatty mat
ter was obtained in considerable quantity.
   Exp. 8. Venous blood was drawn from the external jugular
of a large poodle, and subsequently arterial blood from the
carotid of the same animal. The serum was full of chyle in
both specimens.
   The presence of an alkaline carbonate in the ashes of the
serum was ascertained in both cases, but in larger quantity
in the venous than arterial serum.     The reverse was the case
with regard to the alkaline phosphate, which, though present,
existed in smaller proportion in the venous than the arterial
Serum.
   The fats of the arterial crassamentum yielded an alkaline
ash. That obtained from the venous crassamentum gave an
acid reaction.
   In the experiments on serum which I have described above,
I have generally used a very small quantity of the fluid. My
principal object having been to show the difference in propor
tion of alkaline phosphate existing between venous and arte
rialized blood, I always took care to use a larger quantity of
the former than of the latter in these comparative experiments,
in order that my theory, which presumed an excess in arterial
serum, might be the more severely tested, and that the alka
line phosphate might be prominently shown in the venous
serum if it had happened to be present, even in proportion
approaching that in which it existed in arterial serum. When
larger quantities of venous serum are operated upon, an alka
line phosphate may be detected. I however obtained no evi
dence from the quantity I used, viz. from twenty-five to forty
grains.
   The results now stated appear sufficiently to prove the cor
rectness of the theory I have advanced. Thus, not only does
arterial serum prove to contain more alkaline phosphate than
that from the venous blood, but we are able, by artificially
arterializing a portion of blood, to remove the phosphorus of
the corpuscles into the liquor sanguinis by forming phosphoric
acid, which is absorbed by the alkali contained in the fluid.
   The fatty matter from the corpuscles of venous blood proves
to contain phosphorus, yielding an acid ash on incineration.

fatty matter of the corpuscles exists in close combination with

adjunct (vide Exp. 7); which goes far to prove the intimate
chemical union of the two substances, inasmuch as the combi
nation of zinc with haematosine yielded fatty matter to aether.
   Exp. 6 would seem to prove, that when the phosphorized
fatty matters of the venous blood are removed, it no longer
admits of being arterialized by contact with oxygen. I am
not inclined however to argue much on this experiment, find
ing that aether, when agitated with blood, possesses the power
of effecting its complete disintegration; so much so, that blood
which has been thus treated appears under the microscope as
a congeries of crystals of well-defined form, and is entirely
divested of its organic and corpuscular character.
   The change which takes place in order to produce the arte
rial tint in the dark-coloured blood propelled into the lungs,
may then be stated thus.
   The vesicular corpuscles of the dark venous blood contain
within their cases, and in combination with haematosine, a
fatty matter charged with phosphorus. The venous blood on
reaching the air-cells is exposed to the action of atmospheric
oxygen. This gas now combines with the phosphorized fat,
forming carbonic acid and water, which are exhaled, and
phosphoric acid, which unites with the alkaline liquor san
guinis.
   The liquor sanguinis forms tribasic phosphate of soda with
this acid, a salt possessing an alkaline reaction. This union
most probably occurs principally at the expense of the albu
minate of soda, and is attended with results which it is not my
intention now to consider. Suffice it to say, that phosphoric
acid may be added to venous serum in quantity insufficient
quite to neutralize its alkaline reaction, without any immediate
obvious effect being produced.
   The formation of tribasic phosphate of soda as a substitute
for a corresponding proportion of the alkali in combination
either with albumen or lactic acid, is a sufficient explanation
of the bright colour of arterial blood as compared with
that of the veins, as that basic salt possesses the power of
brightening blood in a marked degree; and it is not improbable
that the destruction of the phosphorus in the venous globules
also contributes to the effect.
   I have not had recourse to any quantitative examinations on
this occasion, for several reasons.
   Thus it is obvious that venous and arterial blood, though
differing in colour, owing to the action of tribasic phosphate
formed during respiration, are always more or less approaching
each other in quality under varying conditions of the organism.

34        Dr. G. O. Rees’s additional Observations on the
phate into the general circulation, which has not been pro
duced by the respiratory act, and which will be only eliminated
slowly from the blood; and thus, immediately after food, this
salt will be readily found in the veins as well as the arteries,
though not to the same amount (vide Exp. 3); while, on the
other hand, the alkaline lactate and albuminate of chyle (yield
ing an excess of alkaline carbonate as the result of the incine
ration of the serum of arterial blood) will be only gradually
converted into basic phosphate as the respiratory act proceeds.
 This approach in character on the part of the two kinds of
blood may be observed after repletion, when the blood of the
large arterial trunks is darker than usual, and becomes sensibly
 brightened by exposure to air. Again, in animals kept with
 out food, the blood drawn from the veins will be preternatu
 rally bright, for the reason that respiration has been long
 carried on without access of chyle, and the alkaline phosphate
 is affecting the venous blood as the result of respiration.
    An approach to the arterial tint has been observed by phy
 siologists in the venous blood of animals kept long without
 food. The darkened colour of arterial blood, as produced by
 repletion, I have myself remarked, and have been enabled to
 produce a very obvious brightening by exposing it to air.

     Note.—The ash obtained from the serum of venous blood
 contains an alkaline carbonate; but if the crassamentum be
 incinerated with the serum, a carbonate is not necessarily
 present, because the phosphorized fats produce phosphoric
 acid during their combustion, and this will form a phosphate
 with the alkali to the exclusion of carbonic acid.          It was in
 consequence probably of these conditions that Enderlin did
  not observe an alkaline carbonate in the ashes of blood.         The
  deduction from his observations, that no albuminate or lactate
  of an alkali exists in the blood, is erroneous.
 V. Additional Observations on the subject of the foregoing
           Memoir.    By G. Owen REEs, M.D., F.R.S.

        MY DEAR MR. PHILLIPs,                    June 8, 1848.
  THE novelty of the view which I have put forward in the
        foregoing paper with reference to the respiratory function,
  induces me to address these few lines to you, in order that
  they may be published should you consider them to contain
  matter of sufficient interest.

                 subject of the foregoing Memoir. .            35
   It is not my wish or intention to argue upon differences of
result between my own observations and those of previous
experimenters, but merely to refer to one or two points con
tained in my paper, in order to prevent the occurrence of
such misconceptions as some of my friends have already fallen
into with respect to my views.
   In the first place, then, I do not consider the serum or any
part of the blood to contain an alkaline carbonate, but only to
gield such salt by incineration. My theory for the production
of the arterial tint has no reference to the decomposition of a
carbonate in the venous blood, but to the production of the
phosphate of soda, by the decomposition of animal organic
salts.
   Secondly, the analyses which have been made of arterial
and venous blood, showing identity, or nearly so, of the ash
obtained, are in no way opposed to my observations; for the
reason that, when the whole blood (clot and serum) is incine
rated, the process of ignition does just what respiration would
do, and produces phosphoric acid from the phosphorized fats
of the venous blood-corpuscles. The difference between the
two kinds of blood is shown by the incineration of the serum
only of the two kinds of blood; for then no corpuscles are
present to afford phosphorus to the venous serum for the pro
duction of phosphoric acid.
   I took great care, when making my comparative experi
ments, to guard against all fallacy which might arise from
resolution of precipitates by excess either of acid or ammonia,
&c. in testing with the silver salt. It is an experiment which
I have been much accustomed to make when examining animal
matters, and with the uses and peculiarities of which I have
been long familiarized.
   The very marked degree of difference which I have detected
between venous and arterial serum, leads me to believe that
the quantity of blood circulating is far less than is generally
supposed.              -
   It is much to be regretted that we have as yet no correct
means of ascertaining this interesting point, and that it is
scarcely possible, in the present state of our knowledge, even
to propose a plan which is not replete with practical difficulties
and theoretical objections.
           Believe me to be, my dear Mr. Phillips,
                                         Yours most truly,

VI. On certain Phaenomena of Capillary Attraction erhibited
   by Chloroform, the Fired Oils, and other Liquids: with an
   inquiry into some of the causes which modify the form of the
   mutual surface of two immiscible liquids in contact with the
   walls of the vessel in which they are contained. By WILLIAM
   Swan, F.R.S.E., Teacher of Mathematics, Edinburgh *.
Dº;       GEORGE WILSON has recently noticed a curious
       class of phaenomena depending upon capillary attraction,
which he has described in a paper which will appear in the
Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London for July
1848. The following are the principal facts he has observed.
   When chloroform, bisulphuret of carbon, Dutch liquid
(C, H, Cl2), bromine, and several of the volatile oils whose
specific gravity is above 1°000, are placed in glass vessels
under water or acids, they assume a highly convex surface;
while, on the other hand, under solutions of potash, soda or
ammonia, their surface is sensibly flat. The object of this
paper is to describe some results of a similar nature which I
 have obtained with other liquids, and also to inquire into the
probable cause of the phaenomena which have been observed.
    Before attempting any explanation of the flattened surface
of chloroform under alkaline solutions, it was natural to ascer
tain whether its surface might be considered as absolutely flat,
or only apparently so; and at Dr. Wilson's request I under
took the examination of this point. Perfect flatness was
 scarcely to be expected; for among all possible relations of
 the mutually attractive forces of the two liquids and the walls
 of the containing vessel, the chance was evidently small that
 the particular relation necessary to produce a perfectly flat
 surface should actually exist; and even supposing the requi
 site conditions to be fulfilled, the slightest particle of foreign
 matter adhering to the glass might vitiate the result.
    In order to avoid any fallacious appearances which might
 arise from the irregular transmission of light through ordinary
 glass vessels, I ground the ends of a tube of glass, about an
 inch in length and half an inch in internal diameter, and ce
 mented to them pieces of parallel plate glass by means of
 Canada balsam. The axis of the tube being placed horizon
 tally, it was half-filled with chloroform, and solution of caustic
 potash was added. On looking through the glass plates, the
 surface of the chloroform was seen to be sensibly flat, except
 close to the glass, where it was convex. At the points of
 contact of the tube with the glass plates the surface was con
 cave; but this reversal of its curvature was evidently due to
                   * Communicated by the Author.

         On certain Phaenomena of Capillary Attraction.          37
the presence of the Canada balsam, for which the chloroform
manifests a strong affinity, and which it dissolves rapidly. I
have since observed the surface of the chloroform in a tube,
having plates of glass held in contact with its ends by means
of vulcanized India-rubber bands. In this case the eye was
assisted by a lens magnifying about eight times, and the sur
face of the chloroform was again seen to be slightly depressed
at its contact with the tube; but as the plates were attached
without cement, there was no reversal of the surface of the
chloroform at their junction with the tube.       From these ex
periments it would seem that the effect of the alkali is not so
much to alter the form of the curved surface, as to produce a
curve on a smaller scale, and thus to diminish the distance to
which the curvature extends from the sides of the vessel: so
that a deep depression at the sides is so much reduced as only
to be perceptible by minute inspection; and consequently the
curvature, which formerly extended to a distance over the
liquid, is now confined to such narrow limits as to leave the
greater part of the surface sensibly flat.
   As potash has a chemical affinity for chloroform which is
not possessed by hydrochloric acid, it occurred to me to try
whether, in other cases besides those observed by Dr.Wilson,
a flat surface would be formed by liquids having a strong affi
nity for each other, and a curved surface by liquids having a
feeble affinity.
   The following are the principal results I have obtained:—
   1. Olive oil floating on the surface of water or of hydrochloric
acid, has its under surface convex, but with solution of potash
its surface is apparently flat. It has also, in contact with
alcohol or sulphuric aether, a much flatter surface than with
Water.
   2. Spermaceti oil also exhibits a convex surface in contact
with water and hydrochloric acid, and a flat surface with solu
tion of potash.
   3. Oil of cloves sinks in water, and has a highly convex
surface, which becomes nearly flat on the addition of alcohol
         surface but
to the water;

                               well defined.                   e
   4. Oil of cassia sinks in water; and its surface, which is
very convex, is considerably flattened by adding potash or
alcohol to the water.      The addition of acid in the former case,
or of water in the latter, restores the convexity of the surface.
   5. Oil of lavender floats on water, with its under surface
convex. If alcohol is poured upon it, its upper surface is
nearly flat.
   In all the instances now enumerated, as well as in those

38            Mr. W. Swan on certain Phaenomena of
given in Dr. Wilson's paper, it will be observed, that when
the liquids have a decided chemical affinity for each other,
their mutual surface is flat, as in the case of the fixed oils with
solution of potash, and the essential oils with alcohol; while
the curved surface is assumed by liquids whose chemical affi
nity is either extremely feeble or entirely wanting, as is the
case with the oils in contact with water or acids. The expe
riments therefore confirm Dr. Wilson's opinion, that the flat
mess of the surface results from the chemical affinity of the
liquids; and it is therefore probable that this effect is due to
a strong mutual attraction of their particles.
    But before coming to this conclusion, it will be proper to
examine other explanations of the phaenomenon which may
suggest themselves. It might be supposed that the liquid
which possesses the highest attraction for glass, or wets it
most readily, will, in contact with a liquid whose attraction
 for glass is not so great, have the effect of rendering the sur
 face of the less wetting fluid convex, by forcing itself between
 it and the walls of the containing vessel. On this supposition,
 the greater the difference between the attractive powers of the
 two liquids for glass, the greater will be the curvature of their
 mutual surface; while a surface nearly flat will indicate a
 nearly equal attraction of the two liquids for glass. As the
 addition of hydrochloric acid renders the flat surface of chlo
 roform under an alkaline solution convex, the recession of
the chloroform from the walls of the vessel, which is necessary
 to its becoming convex, would be attributed to the attraction
of the acid for the glass enabling it to insinuate itself between
the glass and the chloroform to a greater extent than the
alkali; and it would necessarily follow, that the attraction of
 the acid for glass is stronger than that of the solution of pot
 ash. But it will be seen from the following experiments that
 the contrary is the case.
    Having carefully ascertained the specific gravities of the
solution of potash, the hydrochloric acid, and the chloroform
I had used in my experiments, I observed the heights at which
they stood in a thermometer-tube 0:014 of an inch in diameter.
The following table exhibits the mean of six observations with
each liquid.

   * This number, obtained by multiplying the diameter of the tube by
the height to which the liquid rises, is always the same for the same liquid,
and is given here in order to check the accuracy of the experiments.

        Capillary Attraction exhibited by Chloroform, &c.                           39
    It thus appears that the attraction of the alkaline solution
for glass is greater than that of the acid; for it is capable of
supporting a column of 2.9 inches, while that of the acid,
although it is a lighter fluid than the solution of potash, can
only support a column of 2:7 inches.                       In order to remove
any doubt as to the superiority of the alkaline solution to the
acid in attraction for glass, I made a weaker solution of
potash, and repeated the experiments on chloroform with it
and another sample of hydrochloric acid. The following
table shows the heights at which these liquids stood in two
different thermometer-tubes, as                 iºniº            by the mean of
three observations.
                           Spec.   Diam. | Height | Con- || Diam. | Height | Con

  |Solution of potash. •105 wº 177 |007| 0010 461 0046
    It will be observed in the second set of experiments, that
the alkaline solution is lighter than the acid, so that it is not
obvious by inspection of the table which has the strongest
attraction for glass. But supposing the attractions the same,
the heights of the columns should be inversely as the specific
gravities; so that, taking the acid as the standard, the height
of the column of solution of potash in the tubes should be 1:60
and 3.94, instead of which the observed heights are 1.77 and
4-61, showing that in this case also the alkaline solution has a
stronger attraction for glass than the acid. We have thus
the remarkable fact, that solution of potash, which has a much
stronger attraction for glass than that possessed by hydro
chloric acid, is actually less able to wet it in the presence of
chloroform. It follows also, that we cannot explain the flat
tened surface of the chloroform in the presence of the solution
of potash, on the supposition of a nearly equal attraction of
the liquids for glass; for those liquids obviously differ greatly
in this respect, as the one rises in a capillary tube to nearly
four times the height of the other. According to this view,
as the attractions of chloroform and acid for glass differ less
than those of chloroform and alkaline solution, the surface of
chloroform in contact with acid in glass vessels should be less
curved than when it is in contact with an alkaline solution;
but precisely the reverse of this is the case.
it may be proper to mention, that, having carefully ascertained the specific
gravities of five different specimens of rectified chloroform, I have found
them to vary from 1:493 to 1497.

40          Mr. W. Swan on certain Phaenomena of
   Another mode of accounting for the difference of the cur
vatures in the two cases would be, to suppose a strong cohesive
attraction of the particles of the chloroform in comparison with
that of the particles of water or acids, and a nearly equal co
hesive attraction in the particles of chloroform and alkaline
solutions. It is obvious that the more cohesive liquid would
tend to assume a spherical form; but in the case of liquids of
nearly equal cohesive power, it might be supposed that the
attracting forces, being nearly balanced, the resulting action
would be so small that their mutual surface would be nearly
flat.                               -
   In order to estimate the cohesion of the liquids, I suspended
a glass disc an inch in diameter from one arm of a balance
capable of indicating 0-1 grain; and I found, by the mean of
several experiments, that it required 34’3 grains placed in the
opposite scale to detach the disc from the surface of hydro
chloric acid; while 33.1 grains detached it from the surface
of solution of potash, 38 grains from water, and 28.3 from
chloroform.
   As the disc separates from the surface wetted by the liquid,
it is obvious the separation must have taken place, not at the
surface of the glass, but in the body of the liquid, and hence the
cohesion of its particles must have been overcome by the weight
required to detach the disc. It would therefore appear that
the cohesive force of the particles of solution of potash and of
hydrochloric acid are nearly equal, while that of the particles
of chloroform is inferior to that of either of these liquids. A
similar result was also obtained by weighing a given number
of drops of those liquids. Twenty drops of solution of potash,
hydrochloric acid, and chloroform, weighed respectively 14-6,
16-9, and 11.3 grains. Since, then, the cohesive attraction
of chloroform is inferior to that of hydrochloric acid, it will
not account for its convexity in contact with that liquid; while
the nearly equal cohesive powers of the acid and alkaline so
lutions will as little explain the diversity of their action in the
presence of chloroform.
   As the flatness of the surface of the chloroform seems to
depend neither on the equality of the attractions of the liquids
for glass nor upon the equality of their cohesive attractions, it
next occurred to me to try whether the result was modified
by altering the nature of the containing vessel. I have found
that on immersing a slip of recently-ignited platina foil, or
clean iron or brass wire in the liquids, the surface of the
chloroform is highly convex in contact with them under water
or hydrochloric acid, but apparently flat under solution of
potash. If the metal is not perfectly clean, the surface of the

       Capillary Attraction exhibited by Chloroform, &c.        41
chloroform is apt to become concave in contact with it under
water or acid. On lining a glass tube with a thin coating of
wax, I found that chloroform placed in it under hydrochloric
acid had a very concave surface, while on supersaturating the
acid with solution of potash the surface became sensibly flat.
Similarly, chloroform under water in a quill has a very concave
surface, which becomes sensibly flat on the addition of potash,
and the concavity is restored by adding a sufficient quantity
of hydrochloric acid. It will be observed that the coating of
wax, or the substitution of a tube of quill for one of glass,
while it completely reverses the curvature of the chloroform
in contact with water and acids, exerts apparently no influence
on the power of the alkali to flatten its surface; and the con
clusion seems inevitable, that this effect depends upon a mutual
action of the liquids, and is quite independent of the nature of
the containing vessel, for it takes place equally in contact with
surfaces of glass, platina, iron, wax, or quill.
   Having thus endeavoured to show that the flatness of the
surface of chloroform under alkaline solutions is independent
of the equality of the attractions of the liquids for the walls of
the vessel, of the equality of their cohesive powers, and of the
nature of the containing vessel, it only remains to inquire how
it may be explained on the supposition of an attractive force
 between the liquids themselves.
   The form of the surface of the liquids in contact with the
 walls of the containing vessel will evidently depend,—1, on the
mutual attractions of the particles of each fluid; 2, on the
attractions of the particles of one fluid upon those of the other;
and 3, upon the attraction of the walls of the vessel for both
fluids. Considering the second of these forces, we may suppose
it to act upon an indefinitely small element of the surface of the
liquids, at its contact with the walls of the vessel, consisting of
equal small contiguous volumes of solution of potash and chloro
form. All the molecules of chloroform it contains will then be
attracted by all the molecules of the solution of potash within
the sphere of sensible attraction, while all the atoms of solution
of potash it contains will be solicited by a similar attraction
of the molecules of chloroform. Now since the attracting
forces are identical in both cases, each individual attraction
being that of a molecule of solution of potash to a molecule of
chloroform, the sphere of sensible attraction will evidently
extend to the same distance on both sides, and comprehend
equal volumes of both liquids. But as the attracted particle
also contains equal small volumes of chloroform and solution
of potash, it is evident that the number of the attracting mo
lecules of solution of potash will have, to that of the molecules

42          Mr. W. Swan on certain Phaenomena of
of chloroform, the same ratio as the number of particles of
potash in the elementary portion of the surface has to the
number of particles of chloroform contained by it. Now the
fluids are symmetrically situated in contact with the wall of
the vessel, and the attracting molecules are therefore similarly
situated on both sides; hence whatever law of attraction exists,
the resultant force of all the individual attractions will in both
cases be simply proportional to the products of the numbers
of the mutually attracting molecules. But this product is
evidently the same in both cases; hence the resultant attrac
tions of both liquids upon their mutual surface will also be equal.
This perhaps may be rendered more evident by the following
considerations. Let r represent the ratio of the number of
attracting molecules in a given volume of solution of potash to
that of the attracting molecules in an equal volume of chloro
form. Then, since the sphere of sensible attraction evidently
extends to the same distance in both liquids, we may suppose
it in both to be divided into an equal number of corresponding
thin concentric spherical surfaces. If n be the number of
attracting molecules in one of these attracting spherical layers
of chloroform, rn will be the number in the corresponding
layer of solution of potash; and, on the other hand, if n' be
the number of molecules of chloroform in the small element
of the mutual surface of the liquids, rn' will be the number of
molecules of solution of potash which it contains. Now as
the distances of the attracting molecules in the corresponding
spherical layers from the attracted element of the surface is
the same in both liquids, the attraction of a single pair of mo
lecules will be the same in both cases; and therefore the ratio
of the attractions of the two spherical surfaces to the elementary
particle will be that of the products of the numbers of the
mutually attracting molecules. The one force will therefore
be that of rn molecules of potash attracting n' molecules of
chloroform, and will be represented by rmn'; the other force
will be that of n molecules of chloroform attracting rn' mole
cules of solution of potash, and will therefore be also repre
sented by rnn'. Since then the attractions of the corresponding
spherical layers of the liquids upon the elementary particle of
the surface are equal, the whole attractions on either side will
also be equal.
   The resultants of those attractions will then evidently be two
equal forces, inclined at an angle of 45° to the mutual surface
of the liquid at the point of its junction with the wall of the
containing vessel; and these again will have for their resultant
a single horizontal force perpendicular to the wall of the vessel,
and therefore tending directly to counteract its attraction for

       Capillary Attraction exhibited by Chloroform, &c.         43
the liquids. Even although this reasoning be not considered
sufficient to prove the perfect equality of the attractions of the
liquids for each other, yet if they be only nearly equal, their
resultant will still evidently act in opposition to the attraction
of the containing wall. And it obviously follows from this,
that the stronger the mutual attraction of the fluids, the less
will be the effective attraction of the walls of the vessel.    We
have next then to consider the curvature of the surface of the
liquids as depending upon the resultant of the attractions of
the walls of the vessel, and the attractions of the particles of
each liquid among themselves. Now Clairaut has shown,
that when the attraction of the walls of the vessel is more than
half that of the molecules of the liquid for each other, it will
rise towards the solid; and therefore the greater the excess
of the attractive power of the solid above this limit, the greater
will be the rise of the liquid, and the extent of the curvature
of its surface. The effect of the mutual attraction of the liquids
in diminishing the attraction of the walls of the vessel will
therefore evidently tend to reduce the curvature within nar
rower limits, and thus to produce a flat surface. In other
words, the greater the mutual attraction of the liquids, the less
will be the effective attraction of the walls of the vessel; and,
consequently, the smaller will be the tendency to curvature
due to the superior attraction of the solid for one liquid over
the other, enabling it to insinuate itself between the walls of
the vessel and the other liquid.
   It was already observed, that the effect of potash in flatten
ing the surface of chloroform does not consist in the absolute
removal of its curvature, but only in reducing it within very
narrow limits; and this is precisely what might be expected;
for while the mutual attraction of the liquids counteracts
their attractions to the walls of the vessel, it cannot remove
any previous inequality between those attractions. The most
wetting liquid will therefore still rise towards the solid; but
the effective attraction being diminished, it will rise to a smaller
extent, and the curvature will thus be reduced within much
narrower limits than if there had been no force to counteract
the attraction to the solid. The attraction of the liquids is
also an obvious explanation of the flattening of the surface of
chloroform, observed by Dr. Wilson, where it is not in con
tact with the walls of the vessel; and it likewise accounts for
the diffuse and irregular form of the globules of chloroform in
alkaline solutions observed by him. For it is evident that the
attraction of the potash must counteract that of the particles
of the chloroform for each other, and thus render it virtually

a less cohesive liquid in contact with alkaline solutions than
in contact with acids.
   As the flattening of the surface seems to be sufficiently ex
plained by the hypothesis of a powerful attraction between the
molecules of the liquids, and as in all observed instances of a
flat surface there has been a decided chemical affinity between
them, it is difficult to avoid supposing some connexion between
the hypothetical attracting force and the actually existing che
mical affinity. If we suppose them to be identical, the attract
ing molecules of the liquids will then be their chemically equi
valent atoms. When chloroform is decomposed by solution of
potash, I understand that an atom of chloroform with three
atoms of potash produces three equivalents of chloride of po
tassium and one equivalent of formic acid; which thereafter
combines with a fourth atom of potash to form formiate of
potash, as expressed by the following equation:
           C., H Cla--4KO-3K Cl4 KO, C.H.O.
Supposing, then, the attractions of the liquids to be the same
forces which ultimately tend to produce this decomposition,
the attracting molecule of potash might be regarded as 4KO,
and that of chloroform as C., H Cla: or we may suppose two
sets of attracting molecules; the one 3Cl attracting 3K, and
the other C., H attracting KO-H 3O. But I state this merel
to point out what may perhaps have already suggested j:
to the reader, that whatever view is taken of this molecular
action, the ratio of the number of attracting molecules in the
two liquids must still be inversely as the number of molecules
in the infinitesimal element of the surface of the liquids sub
jected to that attraction; and thus the result which has already
been arrived at will remain entirely unaffected.
   In conclusion it may be remarked, that if the phaeno
menon of the flattened surface of two immiscible liquids has
received a correct explanation on the hypothesis of a strong
mutual attraction of their molecules, and if this phaenomenon
is found to appear only in cases where the liquids have a de
cided chemical affinity for each other, an interesting connexion
is thereby established between chemical affinity and the me
chanical force of adhesion, tending to prove that they are
modifications of the same force; while the whole subject of
the mutual attraction of two liquids opens up an interesting,
and,  so far as I am aware, a new field of inquiry in capillary
attraction.

VII. On some Forms of Quadratic Moduli. By Prof. Young *.
             In a Letter to Prof. De Morgan, &c.
      MY DEAR SIR,
     HAVE read with much interest your paper from the
      Cambridge Transactions, On Triple Algebra. You are
aware that I had no access to it till last week, and therefore
may not as yet be fully in possession of all your views. It
has occurred to me, however, that your system, or rather that
particular system upon which you have more especially dwelt,
may be arrived at in a manner somewhat more simple, by a
process analogous to that which was employed by Euler and
Lagrange for finding algebraic functions whose products are
similar functions, and which process is nearly the inverse of
that adopted in your paper. It is this: since
                     (r--ay--2°z)(a +6/-i-3°2)
    =a^+ (2+3)ay+(2*-i- 6°)az+239°4-(2°3+3°2)yz+2°3°z”,
it follows that if a. and b are the coefficients of v and v' in that
quadratic equation, vº–av-Fb-0, whose roots are 2 and 3,
we shall have
etwº-ºº-º-º-)

and similarly for
                 (a'+ay'+2°8')(a'+6/+6°2').
But, as well-known (see Additions to Euler’s Algebra),
      (a + 2y+ 2**)(w' + 2y'+ 2*z)=X +&Y + 2*Z                  (2.)
      (a +6/-3°2)(a/+3/+3°2')=X +3Y,+3*Z_<U+017F>                      \"
These products being of the same form as the original factors,
it follows that the product of the four factors on the left of (2.)
will give a resilt of the form (1.); that is to say, we shall
have
    {*+aay H (a”–2b)wz+by”--alyz-bºx”)
       x (a"+ary-H (a”–2b)a's +ly”--aby'2' 4 bºx”) -. (3.)
      =X24-axY +(a”–2b)XZ+by?--abyZ +b^7°
   Lagrange, in discussing the quadratic forms of reproducing
functions, confines himself to those involving only two arbi
trary quantities, w and y; and when three enter, he considers
them exclusively in reference to forms of three dimensions,
and so on. "From these the inferior forms may no doubt be

 in the above instance.
    If in the general formula (3.) we put a = –1, and b-1,
 the first of your modular equations will result, viz.
                    (a^+y^+ z*—ay-as-yz)

                    = X?-- Yº H-Z”—XY-XZ–YZ.
 Now with these values for a and b, our quadratic vº–av-Hö=0
 becomes
                 w”-H v + 1 = 0.". v = -li V-8.
                                          2
Substituting these values of v, or either of them, for a or for
6, we have, for our linear factors, the form
             ... (-,+,+.
                   —1 +    v=) 3y + (–14=lly-º),

and the imaginary coefficients may be taken as interpretations
of your n and . . Although only a quadratic has been em
ployed to determine these, yet they are evidently the imagi
nary cube roots of plus unity. You have taken those of minus
unity; so that, in multiplying two such forms together, the
functions of w, y, z in our results would differ, as to signs,
in some of the combinations. If, however, the signs of y and
z in the factors here proposed be changed, which change is
equivalent to changing the signs of their coefficients, these
coefficients will then be converted into the imaginary cube
roots of minus unity, and we shall both agree.
   The second of your modular equations really requires a
cubic. The general cubic formula Lagrange has investigated,
and given in the Additions referred to. Each factor of this
formula is of the form                            -
           a"+ax+y+(a”–2b)a”z + bay” + (ab–3c)ayz

the cubic which leads to it being
                        s”—as°-H bs—c-0;
and from this form, if we suppose a and b to be zero, and c
to be unit, your second equation results, viz.
            (a8+ y^+2°–3ayz)(a"+y”--2"–34'y'2')

and, as before, we may, if we please, change the roots of + 1
to those of –1, which is equivalent to changing the sign of c.

tions, I have said, in reference to the expression aaºº-H balays

cancelled by a part of brays+ cys”; from which it follows that
a's must be divisible by a, and (bara-i-cys)/s by a”; so that ys

   In the paper here referred to, the following eight-square
formula has been obtained. It differs from that previously
arrived at by Mr. J. T. Graves, only by the introduction of
the general coefficients; that is to say, it differs from Graves's

the signs. And if from this partial coincidence we were led

 VIII. On Diamagnetism. By M. Plucker.                In a Letter to
                            Mr. Faraday.
       SIR,
 I   HAVE the honour to send you two small memoirs, which
       on account of political circumstances have reached me
 later than usual. I have already mentioned to you the first.
 The second relates especially to diamagnetic polarity, which
 is now placed beyond doubt. You will find, among others, the
 curious fact, that the intensity of the diamagnetic force increases
 more rapidly when the force of the electro-magnets is increased
 than that of the magnetic force. The increase of the force of
 the electro-magnet imparts to a piece of charcoal, having first
 the position of a magnetic body, that of a diamagnetic body.
 I have subsequently proved this law in different ways. The
 following experiment is striking. If by means of a counter
 poise, any body containing at the same time magnetic and
 diamagnetic substances (for instance mercury in a brass vessel,
 this last being magnetic) is held in equilibrium, this body is
 repelled by the magnet when brought near it, and attracted
when it is removed.
    I have devised a method which allows of my comparing
exactly the intensity of the diamagnetism of the different
bodies, solid and liquid, and at the same time I arrived at a
number of curious results concerning magnetic induction, and
especially the relation between the chemical constitution of
bodies and their magnetism. The difficulty of obtaining che
mically pure substances presented the greatest obstacles. Thus,
for example, # per cent. of protoxide of iron mixed with a mass
of peroxide, ought at least to double the magnetism. The
magnetism of the oxides is increased by the acids which unite
with them to form salts. Supposing the magnetism of the iron
 = 100000, I find that of a similar weight of oxide of nickel
(Ni) equal to 85, that of the same oxide in the state of hydrate
(Ni4-H) equal to 142. The yellow ferrocyanide of potash is
diamagnetic; the red ferridcyanide, on the contrary (whether
in crystal or in powder, or in solution), is decidedly magnetic.
 [A crystal of this last salt shows very clearly the repulsion of
the optical axes by the magnet; without paying attention to it
one might easily take it for a diamagnetic body, &c.] I have
examined equally the influence of heat. For mercury, sul
phur, stearine, I have not observed the least difference, either
at a high or low temperature, whether in the liquid or solid state.
But bismuth gave very different results. In one of my expe
riments, it required, at the ordinary temperature, 1.67 gramme
to counterbalance the diamagnetic repulsion of a mass of 144
grammes. At an elevated temperature, 0.28 grm., that is to

The Rev. Dr. Callan on a new form of Galvanic Battery. 49
say, nearly a sixth, was necessary for this. I see in this a new
analogy between magnetism and diamagnetism. They both
diminish if the temperature augments, &c. It appears, more
over, that the diamagnetism of bismuth has its limit (its mini
mum) like the magnetism of iron and of nickel, &c.
    I shall take the liberty to send you my new memoir, which
is now in the hands of M. Poggendorff, as soon as it shall
appear. Perhaps I shall have the pleasure of bringing it
myself to London. Accept, Sir, the assurance of my deep
respect.

IX. On the Construction and Power of a new form of Galvanic
   Battery. By the Rev. Nicholas CALLAN, D.D., Professor
   of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College 4.
IN a paper published in the August Number of the London
       Philosophical Magazine, I described several experiments,
which clearly prove that, as a negative element of the nitric
acid battery, lead coated with chloride of gold or platina, or
with borax dissolved in dilute acid, is superior to platina, and
that cast iron is fully as powerful as platina. I have since
compared, in various ways, the power of a cast-iron battery
with that of a Grove's of equal size. The cast iron was ex
cited by a mixture consisting of about four parts of sulphuric
acid, two of nitric acid, and two of nitre dissolved in water.
The platina was excited by equal parts of concentrated nitric
and sulphuric acid. The zinc plates of both batteries were
excited by dilute sulphuric acid of the same strength. The
cast-iron battery was considerably superior to Grove's, in its
magnetic power, in its heating power, and in its power of
producing decomposition. The magnetic effects of the two
batteries were compared by means of a galvanometer and of
 a small magnetic machine. Grove’s produced a deflection of
 82°; the cast iron caused a deflection of 85°. When the vol
 taic currents of the two batteries were sent simultaneously in
 opposite directions through the helix of the galvanometer, the
 current from the cast-iron battery destroyed the deflection
 caused by Grove's, and produced an opposite deflection of 60°.
 In the magnetic machine the cast-iron battery produced fifty
 revolutions in a minute; Grove’s produced only thirty-five in
 the same time.
     The superiority of the heating power of the cast-iron bat
 tery was shown by its fusing a steel wire, which Grove's only

 50     The Rev. Dr. Callan on the Construction and Power
 raised to a dull red heat. I have been told by persons who
 tried the two batteries, that they found the heating power of
 the cast-iron battery to be twice as great as that of Grove's.
    The decomposing powers of the two batteries were com
 pared by the quantities of the mixed gases which they pro
 duced during the space of three minutes. The result clearly
 established the superiority of the cast-iron battery.
    I have tried various kinds of cast iron, and have found them
 all to possess nearly equal power. I have got cast-iron plates
 containing oxide of chromium : they did not appear to have
 any advantage over common cast iron.         Perhaps, by mixing
 with cast iron some of the more negative elements, an increase
 of power may be obtained.
    Soon after I had discovered the great electromotive power
 of platinized lead and cast iron, when excited by nitric or
 nitro-sulphuric acid, I proposed to the trustees of the College
 to change our Wollaston batteries into a platinized lead or
 cast iron one. They readily authorised me to expend the
 sum required for the change. After weighing well the relative
 advantages of platinized lead and cast iron, I resolved on the
 latter, principally because I found that it did not require to be
platinized. In one of our Wollaston batteries there were 300
 zinc plates, each four inches square, and in the other 20
 plates, each 2 feet square. In the two batteries the surface
 of the zinc plates was something more than 113 square feet;
 the copper surface was twice as great as the zinc surface.
 After mature reflection on the best form for the new battery,
 and on the most convenient size of the zinc plates, I resolved
to get water-tight, cast-iron cells, rather than plates; to retain
the 300 4-inch plates; and to divide the 20 large plates into
320 small ones, each 6 inches square. I therefore ordered
300 porous cells, each 4} inches high, 4} inches broad, and
# an inch wide, for the 4-inch plates; and 320 porous cells,
each 6% inches high, 6% broad, and about an inch wide, for
the 6-inch plates. I also ordered 300 cast-iron, water-tight
cells, each about 4} inches high, 5 inches broad, and an inch
wide, to hold the small porous cells; and 320 cast-iron cells,
each about 6% inches high, 74 broad, and 1; wide, to contain
the large porous cells. The new battery then was to consist
of 620 voltaic circles, in which the entire zinc surface would
be l l 3 square feet, and the surface of cast iron would exceed
226 square feet; but on account of several disappointments
I have been obliged to be content for the present with 577
voltaic circles, containing 96 square feet of zinc, and about
200 square feet of cast iron. In this battery, which was ex
hibited in the College on the 7th of the last month, there were

               of a new form of Galvanic Battery.              51
800 cast-iron, water-tight cells, each containing a porous cell
and zinc plate 4 inches square; 110 cast-iron cells, each hold
ing a porous cell and zinc plate 6 inches by 4; and 177 cast
iron cells, each containing a porous cell and a zinc plate 6
inches square. The zinc plate of each circle was placed in a
porous cell, and the latter in a cast-iron cell.  The inside of
each cast-iron cell was about a quarter of an inch wider than
the exterior of its porous cell. Slips of sheet copper about an
inch broad and 24 inches long, were soldered to each cast
iron cell, and to each of the 3206-inch zinc plates. The 4-inch
plates were already furnished with screws and nuts. Each
iron cell was connected by a binding-screw with the next zinc
plate. The iron cells were kept in an upright position in nine
wooden frames, which were placed on wooden supports nearly
3 feet high. The battery was charged by pouring into each
cast-iron cell a mixture containing about twelve parts by mea
sure of concentrated nitric acid, and eleven and a half parts
of double rectified sulphuric acid; and by filling to the proper
height each porous cell with dilute nitro-sulphuric acid, con
sisting of about five parts of sulphuric acid, two of nitric, and
forty-five of water. In charging the entire battery we used
about fourteen gallons of nitric and sixteen of sulphuric acid.
I abstained from using the solution of nitre through an appre
hension that it would cause the exciting mixture in the cast
iron cells to boil over. I know not whether this apprehension
is well-founded ; but I know that when ten er more cells are
employed, the exciting fluid in the cast-iron cells will soon
boil over, and produce nitrous fumes, if it does not contain
one quarter of its bulk of nitric acid.
   I have found by experiment that a cast-iron battery is about
fifteen times as powerful as a Wollaston battery of the same
size, and nearly as powerful and a half as Grove's. Hence
our new cast-iron battery, in which there are 96 square feet
of zinc, is equal in power to a Wollaston battery containing
more than 1400 square feet of zinc, or more than 13,000 four
inch plates, and to a Grove's containing 140 square feet of
platina. Now the battery made by order of Napoleon for the
Polytechnic School, which was the largest zinc and copper
battery ever constructed, contained only about 600 square
feet of zinc.; and the most powerful Grove's of which I have
seen an account did not contain 20 square feet of platina.
Hence the cast-iron battery belonging to the College is more
than twice as powerfnl as the largest Wollaston, and seven
times as powerful as the largest Grove's ever constructed.
   I shall now describe a few of the experiments which were
made with our large cast-iron battery on the 7th of the last

square, was placed under each wing along the sides of the
turkey, which were previously stripped of their feathers, and
moistened with dilute acid. The tin-foil was kept in close
contact with the skin by pressing the wings against the sides.
The person who held the turkey had a very thick cloth be
tween each hand and the wing, in order to save him from the
shock. As soon as the wire from the zinc end of the battery
was put in contact with the tin-foil under one wing, sparks
were given by the tin-foil, and shocks received by the turkey,
before the connexion was made between the negative end of
the battery and the tin-foil under the other wing, although
the negative and positive ends of the battery were on tables
nearly 3 feet high, and 3 feet asunder.
   When a copper wire in connexion with the negative end
was put in contact with a brass ring connected with the zinc
end of the battery, a brilliant light was instantly produced.
The copper wire was gradually separated from the brass rin
until the arc of light was broken. The greatest length of the
arc was about 5 inches.        As soon as the connexion was
made between the opposite ends of the battery by the copper
wire, which was 3 of an inch thick, and about 5 feet long,
a loud noise was produced by the combustion of the solder
which fastened some of the copper slips to the zinc plates. I
immediately went to the part of the battery from which the
noise proceeded, in order to try whether the connexion be
tween the cast-iron cells and zinc plates was broken; I found
one slip of copper detached from the zinc plate to which it
had been soldered. There were probably others disconnected
with their zinc plates, but I did not find them. The result of
this experiment showed that the turkey conducted only a part
of the current circulated by the battery, for the current which
killed the turkey produced no combustion of the solder by
which the copper slips were attached to the zinc plates.
   We next tried the ignition of charcoal points. We were
not able to determine the length of the arc of light between
them; for before Sir Robert Kane had time to separate them,
they were burned away. The light was, of course, most bril
liant:  the charcoal scintillated like steel or iron.   I never
before observed these scintillations in the combustion of char
coal. Coke points were also ignited, and a most intense light
produced; but during the experiments with the coke points

               Dr. J. Stenhouse on Chloropicrine.              53
the circuit was interrupted in consequence of the fracture of
one of the porous cells, which caused the dilute and concen
trated acids to mingle together, and, consequently, to boil
over, until the porous and cast-iron cells were nearly emptied.
Notwithstanding this interruption of the circuit, the arc of
light between the coke points was about an inch long, and the
heat of the flame deflagrated a file. "      . ..
  “I had arrangements made for a long series of experiments
on the decomposing power of the voltaic current, and of vol
taic heat, and on the illuminating power of the various kinds
of voltaic light; but these experiments I was obliged to omit,
through fatigue, exhaustion, and bad health. I have since
tried the illuminating power of the light produced by the
ignition of coke points; and for the gas microscope and pola
riscope have found it far superior to the oxyhydrogen lime
light." With good coke points, abundant light for the micro
scope and polariscope may be obtained from a battery con
taining 25 cast-iron cells, and as many zinc plates, each 2
inches by 4: if the coke be not very good, 40 plates will be
required. When an iron cell, 2% inches wide and 4 inches
high, is large enough to contain between it and the porous
cell nearly a wº               of the concentrated acids, the bat
tery will work with undiminished power for about three hours
without any additional acid. If the cell containing the zinc
plates be small, it will be necessary to pour in a little dilute
acid every half-hour. I have got the lime light by igniting
the mixed gases as they were produced by the decomposition
of water, and throwing the flame on lime.

X. On Chloropicrine.        By John STENHouse, Esq., Ph.D.”
 \ \ WHEN      an aqueous solution of nitropicric acid is poured
        into a retort containing a great excess of hypochlorite
of lime, the mixture heats spontaneously, and an aromatic
pungent vapour, which affects the eyes very powerfully, is
immediately evolved. If heat is applied to the retort so soon
as the mixture begins to boil, a very large quantity of a co
lourless heavy oil comes over along with the vapours of water,
and condenses in the receiver. To this oil I purpose giving
the name of chloropicrine. When the mixture has boiled for
a quarter of an hour or so, the whole of the oil has usually
passed over; and if the liquid in the retort is perfectly colour
                  * Communicated by the Author.

less, the whole of the nitropicric acid has been decomposed;
but if the solution retains a yellow colour, this indicates that
it still contains undecomposed nitropicric acid; and on the
addition of a fresh quantity of hypochlorite of lime, more
chloropicrine is obtained. When nitropicric acid is boiled
with a filtered solution of hypochlorite of lime, the oil is gene
rated in the way already described, and it becomes apparent
that a quantity of carbonate of lime is precipitated at the same
time; and as the residue in the retort is found to contain not
a trace of organic matter, carbonic acid, muriatic acid, and
chloropicrine appear to be the only products of this decom
position. The oil which had passed into the receiver was
separated from the acid liquid which surrounded it, and was
 repeatedly washed with water containing a little carbonate of
 magnesia. It was then deprived of any adhering moisture by
 being allowed to stand for some days over fused chloride of
 calcium. On being transferred into a small retort, it was
 cautiously rectified on the sand-bath, when pure chloropicrine
 distilled over as a colourless neutral oil possessing a very con
 siderable refractive power.
    When nitropicric acid is boiled with a mixture of chlorate
 of potassa and muriatic acid, it is converted into chloranile,
 which chiefly remains in the retort, and into chloropicrine,
 which passes into the receiver. The chloropicrine obtained
 by this process is always impure, and contains some crystals
 of chloranile which have been carried over into the receiver
 along with the oil and watery vapours; but from these the
 chloropicrine may be easily purified by careful rectification
 with water.
    When nitropicric acid is boiled with aqua regia, it is also
 resolved into chloropicrine and chloranile; but the quantit
 of the oil is much larger, and that of the chloranile .
 smaller than when chlorate of potash and muriatic acid are
 employed. The same products, viz. chloropicrine and chlo
ranile, are also formed when a stream of chlorine gas is sent
through a hot aqueous solution of nitropicric acid. The ni
 tropicric acid is but slowly acted on by the chlorine, and three
or four days’ treatment with chlorine is required to effect its
 complete decomposition. Chloropicrine is also generated
 when charbazotate of potash is heated with a solution of hy
pochlorite of lime.    Chloranile cannot be converted into chlo
ropicrine by being boiled either with nitric acid, aqua regia,
or hypochlorite of lime.
    The nitropicric acid which I employed for these experi
ments was prepared partly from indigo, but by far the larger
portion of it from the yellow gum-resin of Botany Bay. This

                Dr. J. Stenhouse on Chloropicrine.             55
resin isthe produce of the Xanthoraea hastilis. It can be pur
chased in London for a shilling the pound. It yields half its
weight of nitropicric acid: eight ounces gave four ounces of
acid, which was much more easily purified than that prepared
from indigo; it contained, however, some oxalic and a very
little nitrobenzoic acid. This yellow gum-resin, as I showed
in a paper published in this Journal nearly three years ago,
is therefore by far the most oeconomical source of nitropicric
acid.
    The resinous portion of gum-benzoin, after all the benzoic
acid it contains has been extracted by boiling it with alkalies,
when digested with nitric acid also yields a great deal of char
bazotic acid. This, in fact, is the most advantageous way in
which this otherwise useless product can be employed. I have
found that the resinous portion of balsam of Peru is also con
verted into charbazotic acid when boiled with nitric acid; but
 I could not procure charbazotic acid from balsam of Tolu.
    When the chrysammic acid of M. Schunck is boiled with
hypochlorite of lime, it yields abundance of chloropicrine;
and, as might almost have been expected, the same is the case
with the styphnic acid of Messrs. Will and Boettger, or the
oxypicric acid of Erdmann. With chlorate of potassa and
muriatic acid these acids are also transformed into chloranile
and chloropicrine.
   Chloropicrine prepared from any of these sources has the
following properties. It forms a transparent colourless oil
which refracts the light pretty strongly. Its specific gravity
is 1.6657. Its smell when diluted is aromatic and very peculiar;
when undiluted, it affects the nose and eyes as strongly as
chloride of cyanogen or oil of mustard, only its effects are not
so permanent. Chloropicrine is perfectly neutral to test-paper.
It is nearly insoluble in water, but dissolves very readily in
alcohol and in aether. It is not acted on by sulphuric, muriatic,
or nitric acids in the cold; and when boiled along with these
acids it distils over unchanged. When a small bit of potassium
is dropt into a quantity of the oil and a gentle heat is applied,
the chloropicrine is decomposed by a most violent explosion.
If the potassium is put into the oil at the ordinary temperature
no explosion takes place, and in the course of a day or two it
is converted into a mixture of chloride of potassium and nitre.
   These salts, when tested by sulphuric acid, gave no trace of
nitrous gas. Aqueous solutions of the alkalies may be kept
in contact with chloropicrine for a considerable time without
producing any perceptible effect upon it; but when an alco
holic solution of potassa or soda is employed, the chloropicrine
is slowly decomposed, and crystals of chloride of potassium

56              Dr. J. Stenhouse ou Chloropicrine.
and nitre are deposited. . When the oil is saturated with dry
ammoniacal gas or an alcoholic solution, of ammonia, it is
converted into sal-ammoniac and nitrate of ammonia; but
an aqueous solution of ammonia produces scarcely any effect
upon it.     .    ... . . . . . .    . .                    -

as 150° & without being decomposed. It is uot inflammable.
When the oil is passed in vapour through a glass tube heated
to considerably under low redness, it is completely decomposed.
Much chlorine and deutoxide of nitrogen are evolved, and a
quantity of the solid perchloride of carbon C" C." sublimes
into the colder portion of the tube. Several precautions must
be observed in subjecting chloropicrine to analysis.                  A very
long tube must be employed, the fore part of which must be
filled to the extent of seven, or eight inches with a mixture of
reduced oxide of copper and copper turnings. The combus
tion must also be conducted as slowly as possible, so that none
of the deutoxide of azote may escape decomposition.                           - -

these analyses was prepared at several different times. When
these experiments on chloropicrine were pretty far advanced, I.
was struck with the resemblance which it presented in its ele
mentary composition and properties to the nitro-chlorinated
oil, obtained by Marignac by acting on hydrochlorate of chlo
ronaphthalese with boiling nitric acid. The formula of Ma
rignac's oil is C, Cl, N, O4, and its per cent. composition—

         * *   -                        1096-00
      It is obvious, therefore, that though the elements are the
 same, the per cent, composition is widely different. I pre
 pared a small quantity of Marignac's oil by sending a stream
 of chlorine gas for three days over melted naphthaline, and then
 treating the chloro-naphthalese thus formed by nitric acid. The
 oil was very slowly generated, the chloronaphthalese requiring
 to be boiled with nitric acid for more than twelve hours. The
 quantity of the oil I obtained was very small. Its smell was
 quite different from that of chloropicrine, and not nearly so
 pungent. I also prepared a quantity of nitronaphthalese by
 treating naphthaline with hot nitric acid. When this nitro
 naphthalese was boiled with hypochlorite of lime, it yielded
 little more than a trace of chloropicrine, and with aqua regia
 no oily body whatever.
      The most remarkable circumstance in regard to chloro
 picrine, is the very large number of organic bodies from which
 it may be procured.             -
      1. All the substances which yield nitropicric acid. These
 are indigo and its derivatives, salicine and its derivatives, cou
 marine, hydrate of phenyle, creosote, Botany Bay yellow resin,
 liquid storax, gum-benzoin, balsam of Peru, &c.
      2. All the substances yielding the styphnic acid of Will
 and Boettger, the oxypicric acid of Erdmann. These are gum
  assafoetida, galbanum, ammoniacum, sagapenum, purree or
  Indian yellow, the watery extracts of Brazil wood, red sanders
  wood, logwood, fustic, &c.
       3. M. Schunck's chrysammic acid, and consequently aloes.
       I have also procured chloropicrine by boiling Dammara
  resin with nitric acid and then treating it with hypochlorite
  of lime; and I have also obtained it by digesting in nitric acid
  the resinous compound which chlorine forms with usnic acid.

 whence, by the meanings of the signs employed, the two follow
 ing mutually connected constructions may be derived, for geo
 metrically generating an ellipsoid from a rhombus of constant
 perimeter, or for geometrically describing an arbitrary curve
 on the surface of such an ellipsoid by the motion of a corner
 of such a rhombus, which the writer supposes to be new.
    1st Generation. Let a rhombus LEM'E', of which each side
 preserves constantly a fixed length =b, but of which the angles
 vary, move so that the two opposite corners L, M' traverse two
 fixed and mutually intersecting straight lines AB, AB', (the point
 L moving along the line AB, and the point M'along AB,) while
 the diagonal LM', connecting these two opposite corners of the
 rhombus, remains constantly parallel to a third fixed right
 line, Ac (in the plane of the two former right lines); then,
 according to whatever arbitrary law the plane of the rhombus
 may turn, during this motion, its two remaining corners E, E!
 will describe curves upon the surface of a fired ellipsoid; which
 surface is thus the locus of all the pairs of curves that can be
 described by this first mode of generation.
    2nd Generation. Let now another rhombus, L'E"ME", with
 the same constant perimeter = 4 b, move so that its opposite
 corners L', M traverse the same two fired lines AB, AB', as before,
 but in such a manner that the diagonal L'M, connecting these
 two corners, remains parallel (not to the third fixed line Ac,
 but) to a fourth fived line Ac'; then, whatever may be the
 arbitrary law according to which the plane of this new rhombus
 turns, provided that the angles BAB', cAc', between the first
 and second, and between the third and fourth fixed lines, have
 one common bisector, the two remaining corners E", E" of this
 second rhombus will describe curves upon the surface of the same
jºred ellipsoid, as that determined by the former generation:
 which surface is thus the locus of all the new pairs of curves,
 described in this second mode, as it was just now seen to be

            Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.                   59
the locus of all the old pairs of curves, obtained in the first
mode of description.
    63. The ellipsoid (with three unequal axes), thus generated,
is therefore the common locus of the four curves, described by
the four points E E! E" E"; of which four curves, the first and
third may be made to coincide with any arbitrary curves on
that ellipsoid; but the second and fourth become determined,
when the first and third have been chosen.          And in this new
system of two connected constructions for generating an ellipsoid,
as well as in that other construction* which was given in ar
ticle 61 for a system of two reciprocal ellipsoids, the two former
fixed lines, AB, AB', are the awes of two cylinders of revolution,
circumscribed about the ellipsoid which is the locus of the
point E.; while the two latter fixed lines, Ac, Ac', are the two
cyclic normals (or the normals to the two planes of circular
section) of that ellipsoid. The common (internal and external)
bisectors, at the centre A, of the angles BAB, CAc', made by
the first and second, and by the third and fourth fixed lines,
coincide in direction with the greatest and least awes of the
ellipsoid; and the constant length b, of the side of either
rhombus, is the length of the mean semiaris. The diagonal
LM' of the first rhombus is the aris of a first circle on the ellip
soid, of which circle a diameter coincides with the second
diagonal EE' of the same rhombus; and, in like manner, the
diagonal LM of the second rhombus is the aris of a second
circle on the same ellipsoid, belonging to the second (or sub
contrary) system of circular sections of that surface: while the
other diagonal E"E", of the same second rhombus, is a dia
meter of the same second circle. In the quaternion analysis
employed, the first of these two circular sections of the ellip
soid corresponds to the equations (113.); and the second cir
 cular section is represented by the equations (114.), of the
 foregoing article.
    64. We may also present the interpretation of those qua
 ternion equations, or the recent double construction of the
 ellipsoid, in the following other way, which also appears to be
 new ; although the writer is aware that there would be no
 difficulty in proving its correctness, or in deducing it anew,
 either by the method of co-ordinates, or in a more purely geo
 metrical mode. Conceive two equal spheres to slide within two
 cylinders (of revolution, whose axes intersect each other, and of
 which each touches its own sphere along a great circle of con
 tact), in such a manner that the right line joining the centres of
 the spheres shall be parallel to a fived right line; then the locus

of the varying circle in which the two spheres intersect each other
will be an ellipsoid, inscribed at once in both, the cylinders, so
as to touch one cylinder along one ellipse of contact, and the
other cylinder along another such ellipse. And the same ellip
soid may be generated as the locus of another varying circle,
which shäll be the intersection of two other equal spheres sliding
within the same two cylinders of revolution, but with a connect
ing line of centres which now moves parallel to another fired
right line; provided that the angle between these two fixed
lines, and the angle between the axes of the two cylinders,
have both one common pair of (internal and external) bisec
tors, which will then coincide in direction with the greatest
and least axes of the ellipsoid, while the diameter of each of
the four sliding spheres is equal to the mean axis. In fact,
we have only to conceive (with the recent significations of the
letters), that four spheres, with the same common radius =b,
are described about the points L, M', and 1/, M, as centres;
for then the first pair of spheres will cross each other in that
circular section of the ellipsoid which has EE' for a diameter;
and the second pair of spheres will cross in the circle of which
the diameter is E"E"; after which the other conclusions above
stated will follow, from principles already laid down.

genus—the Belemnoteuthis.          .     . . .     .    .    .
 - #. author describes and figures several perfect examples of the
phragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis, and institutes a comparison be
tween them and a beautiful example of the phragmocone of a belem
nite occupying the alveolus of the guard; and defines the essential dif
ferences observable in the form and structure of these chambered cal
careous cones. He especially points out as distinctive characters of
the phragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis, two flat longitudinal ridges
which extend upwards from the apical extremity, and the granulated
and striated external surface of the epidermis. The phragmocone
of the Belemnite, has a smooth surface, is destitute of any lon
gitudinal ridges, and terminates at the apex in a very fine point, the
axis being in an oblique direction.
   The author next describes a remarkable specimen of a Belemnite,
twenty-two inches in length, in which the osselet or guard, phrag
mocone, and capsule or receptacle, are preserved in connexion. In
this fossil is demonstrated, for the first time, the upper or basal ter
mination of the phragmocone, with two elongated calcareous pro
cesses extending upwards from the margin : these are analogous in
form and position to the prolongations from the peristome of the
outer chamber of certain Ammonites, as for example, in A. Jasoni.
In the phragmocone of the Belemmoteuthis the peristome is entire.
   Another interesting part of the structure of the Belemnite, not
previously detected, is also shown in the same specimen, as well as
in many other examples found in the Oxford clay near Trowbridge;
namely, a calcareous shelly periosteum or capsule, which invests the
guard, and expands upwards into a horny sheath or receptacle, that
surrounds the basal chamber of the phragmocone in which the viscera
were probably contained. This receptacle was formerly supposed to
originate from within the alveolus of the guard. Mr. Miller, many
years ago, inferred the existence of a vascular integument around
the guard from the meandring impressions of blood-vessels obser
vable on the surface of some specimens; but the presence of a cal
careo-corneous capsule or sheath investing the guard, and expanding
into a horny receptacle, has not till now been demonstrated.
   The author considers the facts described as proving that the ce
phalopod of the Belemnite was entirely distinct from the Belemno
teuthis; and that the muscular mantle, cephalic arms, and other
parts referred by Professor Owen to the former, exclusively belong
to the latter genus.
   He concludes that the remains of at least three genera of naked

Cephalopoda occur in the argillaceous deposits of the oolite in Wilt
shire; namely, the first or true Calamary, with a horny dorsal gla
dius or pen; the second, the Belemnoteuthis, or a decapod with unci
nated cephalic arms, ink-bag, pallial fins, and a corneo-calcareous
phragmocone; and the third, the Belemnite, which possessed a phrag
mocone having the apical part implanted in the cavity or alveolus of
a guard or osselet, which in its original state resembled in substance
the sepiostaire of the Cuttle-fish, but is generally found mineralized
by calcareous spar; and the peristome, possessing two or more elon       !
gated shelly processes; both the guard and the phragmocone being
invested with a corneo-calcareous capsule or receptacle. He observes,
lastly, that the body and other soft parts of the cephalopod of the
Belemnite are at present unknown. The author's communication

   March 30.-" Chemical Researches on the Nature of Wax.” By
Benjamin Collins Brodie, Esq.        Communicated by Sir Benjamin
Collins Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
   It is known that bees’-wax is separable, by means of boiling alcohol,
into two portions: to the one, which is more soluble in alcohol than
the other portion, the name of Cerine has been given: the residuary
portion, which does not dissolve, has been termed Mycicine. In this
paper the author gives an account of his investigation of the proper
ties of the former of these substances, namely Cerine.
   This substance has been represented by certain chemists in France,
M. Lewy and M. Gerhardt, as being convertible by oxidation into
stearic acid, and as being a substance which stands with respect
to that acid in the remarkable relation of an aldehyde. These views
the author believes are incorrect; and he states that no pure chemical
substance was procured by these chemists from cerine, and that the
substance of which the greater part of the cerine consists is no alde
hyde, but a hydrated acid, existing as such in bees'-wax.
   The acid is best prepared by precipitation from the alcoholic solu
tion of the cerine by an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, and sub
sequent separation and precipitation of the acid by methods described
in the present paper. When purified, the acid is a white brittle
body, of a crystalline appearance, melting at from 79° to 80°C.
The formula of the acid is C, H, O, a formula which was deter
mined by the analysis of the silver salt having the constitution C,
Has Os + AgO, and of the compound ether Cas H, O, = C, H, O,
 + C, H, O. The acid is volatile : it was analysed after distilla
tion; and it was also procured from the wax itself in a pure state by
                                                                         t
simple processes of crystallization. To this acid the author gives
the name of Cerotic acid.
   By the action of chlorine, the wax acid is converted into a sub
stance having all the appearance of a gum-resin; a change analogous
to which may be effected in various other wax substances examined
by the author. It has still the characters of an acid, and has the
formula C,   {{#.12
                    O, a formula which is confirmed by that of the

                               Royal Society.                        63

                                    The analyses of these substances are
  lven.
9. When distilled in a pure state, the cerotic acid is volatile. When
mixed with other waxy matters, however, it passes by distillation
entirely into volatile oils, a circumstance which accounts for the fact
that it has never been found dissolved in the wax distillate. By
precipitating a weighed quantity of wax by acetate of lead, the
quantity per cent. of the cerotic acid in the bees'-wax, namely 22,
was determined.
   This acid was present in all the European bees’-wax examined by
the author; but suspecting that its quantity might vary in other in
stances, he procured bees’-wax from Ceylon, formed under different
conditions of climate and vegetation, and found on examination that
there was a total absence of the acid in that specimen. The author
draws attention to this curious variation in the nature of an animal
secretion under different conditions of life, a variation of which we
have another example in that of the volatile acid of butter, discovered
by Lerch”; namely, that the butyric and caproic acid of one season
were, in another, replaced by vaccinic acid, differing from the former
acids in the amount of oxygen alone.
   “A statement of the working of the Compasses on board the
Honorable East India Company's Iron Steamer Pluto, from Septem
ber 1841, on her passage from England to China, and during her
service in those seas, until her arrival at Calcutta in January 1843.”
By John Tudor, Commander R.N.             Communicated by S. Hunter
Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
   The author states that the compasses of the Pluto were adjusted
by Mr. Sims, of the firm of Troughton and Sims, by order of Mr.
Pencoote of the East India House, under whose directions that ship
was fitted out; and it is to the great pains taken by Mr. Sims in
placing the magnets employed for counteracting the local attraction
that the author attributes the undeviating accuracy of those com
passes during the whole time the Pluto was under his command in
both hemispheres. He observes that, in the first place, much care is
required in securing the magnets, and protecting them from wet,
after their proper position has been ascertained. In the case of the
Pluto, two magnets were placed under the deck in the author's cabin;
one of them eighteen inches below the deck, being, it is true, an eye
sore, but one of trifling consideration, when compared with the great
importance of the well-working of the compass. The next point to
be attended to is that the cards, or needles, should be all of the same
size, and exactly corresponding with that of the compass used at the
placing of the magnets for counteracting the local attraction. The
bittacles should all be of the same make and height, and the compass
boxes of the same size; so that whenever a new compass or a fresh
bittacle is wanted, the circle in which the needle moves may remain
at the same angle from the magnet as at the first adjustment. On
a strict attention to these precautions will depend the well-working
of the compass in all iron vessels, and also in wooden vessels when
                     * [Chem, Gazette, vol. ii. p. 377.]

ever the quantity of iron they contain creates the necessity of mea
sures being taken for counteracting local attraction.
   It has been alleged that the adjustments for local attraction made
in northern latitudes are not correct when the ship is south of the
equator; but the author states that, in the Pluto, he observed no dif
ference; that ship having made, while under his command, passages
of many thousand miles, comprising 94 degrees of latitude, namely
from 51° North to 43° South, and 153 degrees of longitude, namely
from 30° West to 123° East, during the whole of which he never
found any other correction for the compasses necessary excepting that
required for the magnetic variation, the local attraction having been
completely neutralized.

magnets with relation to the compass.

   This paper is entirely occupied with practical details relating to
the art of annealing flint-glass and depriving it of colour, the author
stating that he leaves the rationale of these facts to be explained by
philosophers. He thinks, however, that they are reconcileable with
the theory of Scheele, as explained by Bergman, and detailed by
Murray in his work on Chemistry.

    May 11.—“On the Chemical Nature of a Wax from China.” By
Benjamin Collins Brodie, Esq. Communicated by Sir Benjamin Col
lins Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
    The wax which is the subject of this investigation, is a substance
 imported into this country from China. It has the general appear
 ance of spermaceti, but is harder than that body. The author gives
 reasons for believing that this wax, like bees’-wax, is a secretion from
 an insect.
    The wax may be decomposed by fusion with hydrate of potash, by
 which process two substances are procured; namely, a wax acid,
 which, combined with the potash, forms a soap; and another body
 which is dissolved in the soap solution. By precipitation with chlo
 ride of barium and washing out the dried baryta salt with ether, or
 other suitable solvents, the two substances may be separated.

language to express the nature of the combination. By the action

matter, one of those substances which, in the opinion of the author,
have been indiscriminately classed together under the general name
of paraffine. This substance, to which he gives the name of cerotine,
contains equal equivalents of hydrogen and carbon, and has the for
mula C, H, This formula is determined with precision by the ac

     Observations of Mimas, the closest and most interior satellite of
  Saturn. By Mr. Lassell.
     It is to be regretted that, owing to the discovery of the closest
  two satellites of Saturn having been made at a period long after the
  five others became known, it is difficult, in referring to the indivi
  duals, to quote them by numerals which shall, explicitly and without
  ambiguity, point out which satellites are meant.
     Sir John Herschel, seeing this difficulty, has invented and pub
  lished in his Cape Observations a nomenclature which completely
  removes it, and moreover will retain its precision should any more
  satellites hereafter be discovered. He gives a proper name to each
  of them ; and beginning with that nearest to Saturn, designates
  them thus: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione Rhea, Titan, and
  Japetus. I cannot but think this nomenclature a great improve
  ment, and worthy of general adoption.
     Of Mimas, the satellite I now refer to, I have obtained in all five
 observations.                 -
     1846, Aug. 25. About 11% P.M. mean time the satellite appeared
 at its greatest elongation westward. Aug. 30. The satellite appeared
 a little short of its greatest elongation eastward; and again, on the
  1st of September at 10 P.M., the satellite appeared a little beyond
 its greatest eastern elongation.
    During the late opposition of Saturn, although I have been very
 watchful of opportunities, I have been able to see it certainly but
 twice, viz. on the 16th of October and 18th of November.
    On the 16th of October at 8° 35" mean time, Mimas was, as
 nearly as I could estimate, exactly at its greatest western elongation,
 appearing to be five or six-tenths of the length of the preceding arm
 of the ring distant from its extremity. This evening the satellite
 was better seen than on any other occasion.
    On the 18th of November, at about 8% hours, the satellite again
 appeared as nearly as possible in the same situation as on the 16th
of October. The power with which Mimas was generally best seen
is a Coddington lens magnifying 567 times. The difference of visi
bility between Mimas and Enceladus is almost incomparable; the
latter being instantly seen in my telescope, under all tolerable cir
cumstances, when within 40° or 50° of its greatest elongation; whilst
in any but the very finest circumstances, Mimas is an object of great
difficulty.

   Observations by Mr. Lassell.
   These observations are principally of the two brightest, those first
observed by Sir W. Herschel, or I. and II., with estimations of two
others, presumed to be his inferior and middle satellites, or 1 and 2.
I have not been able to obtain an undoubted observation of any sa
tellite exterior to II.
   The observations are made in position and distance, like those of
a double star. The positions are reckoned from the north point, as
zero, round by the following side.
   The results here presented are generally the means of two or three
measures. The observations of the I. and II., graphically projected,
show apparently elliptic orbits, having their transverse axes very
nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic and the proportions
of the axes, roughly as 10 to 6.
   The results marked e are careful estimations only.                      a
   As to the single observation of the satellite 2, there was unques
tionably a point of light at the place indicated, which kept its rela
tive position to the planet for about two hours. Moreover, that part
of the sky in which Uranus was seen on November 6 was carefully
scrutinized on November 8, without my being able to detect any
stars in the places where the four satellites had been seen.

   Note on the Satellites of Uranus. By M. Otto Struve.
   The satellites of Uranus were first seen by Sir W. Herschel on
January 11, 1787, six years after his discovery of the primary planet.
By a continued series of observations that year he established the
undoubted existence and the approximate distance and periodic times
of two principal satellites.       In a second memoir (Phil. Trans. 1798)
he announced the discovery of four new supplementary satellites;
and in a third memoir (Phil. Trans., 1815) he presented the results
of his observations to that date. The faintness of the objects ob

served and the mounting of his telescope.* sufficiently account for
discrepancies in Sir William's results.         The measures in distance
were, with his means, exceedingly difficult: hence we have only two
such measures of the interior of the two principal satellites, and none
at all of the supplementary satellites.       There are, however, several
measures of the exterior principal satellite II.
   In the memoir of 1788, Sir William gives 44"-23 as the greatest
elongation of II. from Uranus at his mean distance from the earth,
and calculates the similar greatest elongation of I. to be 33", i. e.
from the periodic time and Kepler's law.         He considers these to be
approximate only. In the memoir of 1815 he uses in round numbers,
and for numerical convenience, 48" and 36" for the elongations;
and he adds a list of selected observations from which more certain
values may be deduced; but it does not appear that he performed
this calculation.    The other elements of the orbits of the two satel
lites are pretty exact; the position of the planet was very favourable
for these determinations. In 1797 the apparent orbits of the satel
lites were nearly right lines.                                -
    As to the supplementary satellites and their orbits, it would appear
from both Memoirs that Sir William did not affect to speak of them
with confidence. Though he had no doubt of their existence gene
rally, yet he avowed that “to determine their numbers and situation
would probably require an increase of illuminating power.” The
precision with which their periodic times, &c. are stated by various
authorities must not be supposed to rest on any certain foundation,
but on Sir William's approximations and shrewd guesses.
   Sir John Herschel directed his attention to the satellites of Uranus
in 1828–1832, and the results are to be found in our Memoirs,
vol. viii. The situation of Uranus was unfavourable, the planet
having considerable southern declination. From his own observa
tions, combined with those of his father, Sir John deduced the fol
lowing periodic times:—
            I. – 84 16.h 56” 31°-3       II. = 13, 11h 7" 12.6;
but “ of other satellites,” he says, “than these two I have no evi
dence.”
   M. Lamont, Director of the Observatory of Munich, commenced
his observations of the satellites of Uranus in 1837.          His memoir is
printed in our Transactions, vol. xi. They relate to the principal
satellites, I. and II.   M. Lamont believes that he once saw what he
takes to be 4, the most distant of the supplementary satellites.
   The mass of Uranus has been found to be,
        wº, the Sun = 1, by Sir W. Herschel's observations.

   M. Lamont does not consider his results as very certain, since I.
and II. gave somewhat discordant results; but he is of opinion that
Bouvard's mass is certainly too large.
   The determination of the mass of Uranus has become of great and
pressing interest, since the theoretical researches of MM. Le Verrier
and Adams into the apparently irregular motion of the planet, have
led to the memorable discovery of Neptune.
   If we suppose the two planets to be equal, it is clear that the effect
of Uranus to perturb the motion of Neptune will be more sensible
than the reciprocal effect of Neptune upon Uranus, on account of
the greater distance of Neptune from the sun. The theory of Nep
tune, therefore, must continue imperfect until a correct value of the
mass of Uranus can be assigned. With this object in view, M. Otto
Struve has undertaken a series of micrometrical measurements of the
two principal satellites, which he hopes to complete about the be
ginning of February 1848. But though the planet is now 5° or 6°
north of the equator, and therefore far more favourably placed than
when Sir J. Herschel pursued his investigations, still the observa
tions are very difficult, requiring steady images and a perfectly trans
parent sky. In this unfavourable autumn only fourteen nights have
hitherto been sufficiently fine. Generally speaking, the distances of
II. have been measured as satisfactorily as the angles of position,
and only twice or thrice has the object been too faint to be well
observed. The reduction is delayed until the series is completed.
   When M. Struve had become familiarly acquainted with these two
satellites, he turned his attention to their supplementary companions.
After being twice deceived in measuring a small star instead of a
satellite, he saw on October 8 an object, of which he made the fol.
lowing measures in position :-

   These observations do not, indeed, prove the object to have been a
satellite; but the difference between the first and last angles of po

have been 9°. The following observations leave no doubt that a

              seen by glimpses.
       10. The satellite as well seen as II., but fainter than I.
    The observations of Nov. 28 show clearly enough that the object was a
 satellite: the position angle of a fixed star would have been altered 10°.
    It may at first sight seem odd, that all the observations are made
 on the same side of the planet. There are, however, many analogous
 cases among the satellites, if this should always occur. The satel
lites I. and II., for instance, are found to alternate in brightness.
There has been, however, no really fine observing night after Oc
 tober 8, on which the satellite could have been observed on the other
 side.
    The observations of this inferior satellite are not sufficiently nu
 merous to yield an accurate orbit. It may, however, be assumed
 pretty safely, that it has been observed near its greatest elongation,
 i. e. that the apparent semiaxis is between 17" and 18"; in which
 case it must have a period somewhere about three or four days.
    Now the satellite has, approximately at least, always been observed
 at the same part of its orbit, and hence the intervals of twenty-four,
twenty-seven, and twelve days must, approximately, be multiples of
the periodic time. The hypothesis of a period of three days, which
first presents itself (or more accurately, from the observations
of October 8 and December 10, 2d 23h 45m), M. Struve finds wholly
incompatible with the observation of December 9, and he prefers a
period of four days (more accurately 3° 22' 10"), which, admitting
a slight error on Nov. 1, agrees equally well with the observations.
This result also accords better with the presumed mass of the planet;
for the first period and greatest distance, 17"'5, gives the mass rººm
larger than Bouvard's, while the second period assigns wºrn to the
mass, somewhat less than Lamont's, but yet a tolerable approxima
tion to it.
    The difference between M. O. Struve's period for this satellite,
and that of 5° 21' 25", assigned to Sir W. Herschel's, is considered
by M. O. Struve to be due to an erroneous estimate of the semiaxis.
He has no doubt of the identity of the two objects.
    After remarking that the foregoing observations completely prove
the existence of Herschel's first supplementary satellite, M. Struve
remarks that the visibility of this satellite depends less upon the
aperture of the telescope employed than on the sharpness of the
image shown. All the telescopes, in his opinion, which will show
I. and II., are large enough to show I. if they are good enough. It
is not fainter than the other two, but, from its greater proximity
to Uranus, requires better defining power and freedom from stray
light.
   * . O. Struve has not hitherto seen any other supplementary sa
tellite, but he remarks that the position of Uranus is every year
becoming more favourable for this inquiry; and there can be little
doubt of their speedy rediscovery, so far as they actually exist.

   A Method of Calculating the Orbit of a Planet or Comet from
Three observed Places. By Professor Challis.
   This method resembles in principle that of Laplace, of which it
may be regarded an extension, the object of the author being to in
clude in the calculation differential coefficients of the third and fourth
orders, for the purpose of ensuring greater accuracy in the final results.
The equations by which the problem is solved are formed as follows.
If a and 3 be the observed right ascension and north polar distance
of the body at one of the given times, corrected to a given equinox
and given position of the earth's equator, and ar, y, z be its co-ordi
nates at the same time, having their origin at the place of the ob
 server, these quantities are related to each other by the two equations
                     w-y cot a, w=2 cos & tan 3.
   Each observed place furnishes two such equations. To include
parallax, the origin of co-ordinates is transferred to the earth's centre.
If p be the distance of the body from the earth, and q be the aberra
tion constant, the effect of aberration is taken into account by chan
ging w, y, z respectively into
                  *—“.           —ºne, 2– 4:
                      #12, y-jºº,                i<U+017F> 78.
The origin of co-ordinates is then transferred to the centre of the
sun, by calculating exactly the sun's co-ordinates at the three times
of observation.    Thus six equations are formed in which the unknown
quantities are the heliocentric co-ordinates of the body. The co
ordinates at the first and last times of observation are expressed in
terms of the co-ordinates at the intermediate time, by series including
differential coefficients of the fourth order of the latter co-ordinates.
The six unknown quantities to be found are, then, the heliocentric
co-ordinates wo, y, z, at the middle time, and their first differential

   For solving this equation, a graphical method given by I. I. Wa
terston, Esq., in the Monthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical
Society for December 1845, is recommended. The value of r, being
found, those of ro, y, z, and their first differential coefficients, are
readily derived, the equations for determining them being linear.
   By means of the first approximate values of the unknown quanti
ties, the second order of approximation is proceeded with so as to
include differential coefficients of the third order and the more im
portant aberration terms.     The third approximation included diffe

72                  Royal Astronomical Society.
rential coefficients of the fourth order, and some small additional
aberration terms. These approximations are so conducted, that the
quantities obtained are corrections to the first obtained values, and it
isconsequently not necessary to calculate with seven-figure logarithms.
    The values of rº, y, zº, #. #. #. being thus obtained as ac
curately as possible, the elements of the orbit are readily derived by
known formulae. As the observed right ascension and north polar
 distance were not corrected into latitudes and longitudes, the ele
ments are by this calculation referred to a plane through the sun's
centre parallel to the earth's equator in a given position. By a
simple computation they may be transferred to the plane of the eclip
tic.   But the original form is the most convenient for obtaining
geocentric co-ordinates in terms of the eccentric anomaly, for the
purpose of calculating an ephemeris, and also for deriving equations
of condition by which the elements may be corrected by future ob
servations. The method of doing this the author proposes to describe
at another opportunity.
    A brief Notice of the Imperial Observatory of Poulkova.         By the
Astronomer Royal”.
    The observatory of Poulkova was built on the plans furnished by
its director, M. Struve; the instruments are, for the most part,
constructed according to his special instructions. The peculiar
scope of this noble establishment is sidereal astronomy in its widest
sense; and Mr. Airy strongly expresses his admiration of the defi
niteness of the purpose which M. Struve had in his mind, and of the
thorough manner in which it has been carried into effect. He says
that “no astronomer can feel himself perfectly acquainted with mo
dern astronomy in its most highly cultivated form, whether as regards
the personal establishment, the preparation of the buildings, the
selection or construction of the instruments, or the delicacy of using
them, who has not well-studied the observatory of Poulkova. To
this excellence many antecedent circumstances have materially con
tributed. The first of these is the personal character of M. Struve;
his mature experience obtained before the intention of building the
new observatory had been formed; his vigour in arranging the plans
on a large scale, and in superintending constructions even to the
minutest point, and his perseverance and skill in arranging the sub
sequent proceedings of the observatory.” The liberality of the
emperor, the freedom of choice as to site, instruments, &c., have been
admirably employed by the director. The character of the buildings,
in addition to their perfect suitability to their design, is that of splen
dour without extravagance. The foundations are most carefully
laid, and solid beyond any former examplet.
   The large equatoreal, by Merz and Mahler, is the instrument which
has principally extended the fame of the Poulkova Observatory.
   * The Astronomer Royal visited Poulkova last summer, and gave orally
as account of the Observatory at the meeting of the Society in November,
the substance of which was communicated in a letter to Professor Schu
macher, and printed in the Astronomische Nachrichten.
   # The Observatory and its instruments may be well understood from the

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                        73
The optical part is doubtless admirable, though, perhaps, more con
 trol over the adjustment of the object-glass would be desirable;
but Mr. Airy was far from satisfied with the rest of the instrument.
 It did not obey its slow motions in right ascension and declination
 with promptitude or accuracy, and the clock movement was deficient
in power. In short, though in the delicate and experienced hands
of M. Otto Struve the telescope is made to yield the utmost of its
powers, Mr. Airy does not consider the instrument, as he saw it, a
 good specimen of mechanism.
    The heliometer, by the same artists, met with much greater ad
miration; and, indeed, Mr. Airy seems to have been very much im
 pressed with the beauty and excellence of all the other instruments.
 He goes so far as to say, that he considers the meridional observa
 tions at Poulkova to be greatly superior to those of any other obser
 vatory with which he is acquainted.       The transit and vertical circle
 of Ertel, the meridian circle and prime vertical telescope of Repsold,
 are praised, with some critical remarks, but no serious drawback.
 Some doubt is expressed whether the prime vertical telescope would,
 in other hands than those of M. Struve himself, give quite such
 marvellous results as he obtains from it: still, in Mr. Airy's judge
 ment, a prime vertical telescope is far superior to any zenith sector
 yet contrived for the investigation of aberration, parallax, &c., or
small differences of latitude ; and he considers the Poulkova results
as leaving all competition far behind.
    Mr. Airy “had the pleasure of witnessing complete observations
made by M. Struve with the prime vertical telescope, and pays the
tribute of his admiration to the caution, the delicacy, the steadily
waiting till the proper time, the promptitude at the proper time,
which distinguish the director's mode of observing.”
    The excellence of the levels attached to the instruments at Poul
kova, and the successful precautions constantly practised there to
avoid error in their use, are particularly noticed. The construction
of the standard barometer is pronounced to be “admirable,” and the
noble library” considered “to be probably the most complete in the
world in reference to its peculiar subjects.”
   On the Transit Instrument at the Bombay Observatory. By
Captain Shortrede.
   Captain Shortrede gives a short account of the instrument, its
mounting, &c., before he became acquainted with it. Such mistakes
as he relates can scarcely occur a second time, and therefore they
may be passed over in silence.
   When Captain Shortrede visited the Bombay Observatory during
his trigonometrical operations, he learned that the instrument was
considered incurably defective. A full consideration, however, led
him to a different opinion; and as he is himself a workman, and
beautiful work published by M. Struve, Déscription de l'Observatoire Astro
nomique Central de Poulkova, St. Pétersbourg, 1845, 4to, with a volume of
plates, which has been distributed most liberally among astronomers.

 from his former connexion with the Mint as assistant-engineer, had
 great facilities for procuring the best assistance which the country
 afforded, he undertook the re-erection of the instrument, which, his
 own services being gratuitous, would not exceed 300 rupees. This
 offer being communicated to the governor, the sum specified was
 readily advanced.
    The stone pillars are two feet square : the upper part of one had
 been greatly split and shaken by unskilful perforations, and Captain
 Shortrede directed the upper fifteen inches of each to be taken off.
 These he replaced by two blocks of Puna stone, which are eighteen
 inches square at bottom, sloping to twelve inches square at top. This
 size seemed sufficient for steadiness, and was as large as could well
 be procured at Puna or transported to Bombay. Due care was taken
 to attach the blocks perfectly to the piers.
    The new Y plates were of bell-metal, cast at the Mint, and well
 and truly worked; particular care was taken that the plate bore truly
 on the stone near the screw-holes.
    The pivots of the axis are supported throughout their length;
the motions for every adjustment were found free and without shake.
 Instead of the usual Y, Captain Shortrede adopted a collar bearing,
which he intended should exactly fit the pivots. The workman,
however, made them somewhat large, and, as he finished them by
grinding, not quite true. Having no time to get new collars made,
 Captain Shortrede had a groove cut out at the bottom of the bearing
 and at the top of the covering-piece, in each of which a slip of wash
leather was secured by lac-varnish. These do not interfere with the
bearing, and they stop the dust before it comes to the bearing. The
constant daily shower of sand from the sea-breeze and neighbouring
 shore would soon destroy any pivot working in the ordinary way;
 and this consideration suggested the collar mounting, which was
intended to be as close fitting as possible. No iron was used in the
work, the liability to rust in such a situation makes the material
unsuitable.
   The instrument thus fitted up continues to work satisfactorily.
There are no counterpoises, Captain Shortrede (luckily perhaps) not
having had time to procure them before quitting Bombay.
   Self-luminous Spot in the Moon.
   On the 11th of December last, at 6 P.M., while Mr. Hodgson, of
Fir Grove, Eversley, was observing the dark body of the moon, “a
bright spot, about one-fourth the angular diameter of Saturn, was
perceived, which, though it varied in intensity like an intermitting
light, was at all times visible.” On this occasion Mr. H. used an
achromatic telescope of five foot focal length, and powers 50 and
80. The bright spot was best seen by the higher power, probably,
as he suggests, because the field was smaller and darker, but it was
instantly visible to the most uninitiated eye when the bright part of
the moon was excluded from the field.
   On the following day glimpses of the same spot were caught be
tween passing clouds with a Newtonian reflector; power 40.
   From Mr. Hodgson's sketch, the bright spot is about 5' below the
real northern point and near the following limb.

        ON THE FORMATION OF HYPONITRITE OF SILVER.
M        PERSOZ found that by heating nitrate of silver so as to
      • expel a portion of its oxygen, the residue, when treated with
sufficient water at 40°F. to dissolve the nitrate remaining undecom
posed, yielded a gray residue, which was insoluble in cold but solu
ble in hot water; and the solution on cooling deposited long acicu
lar crystals, possessing all the properties of hyponitrite of silver.
   Being satisfied from this experiment that hyponitrite of silver re
sults from the decomposition of the nitrate by heat, it appeared
natural to conclude, that by cautiously heating the mitrate it might
be totally converted into hyponitrite. All attempts to produce this
effect were however unsuccessful. It was found not only to be im
possible so to convert the whole of a given portion of the salt, but even
to increase the quantity of hyponitrite beyond a certain proportion,
because it decomposes much sooner than the nitrate. Its formation
and existence, under the circumstances described, can be explained
only by supposing that it acquires, by the presence of the nitrate of
silver, a degree of stability which it does not possess when isolated.
If this be the case, the nitrate of silver ought to be capable of being
replaced by a more stable nitrate, and in point of fact this actually
 occurs; for by fusing and calcining a mixture of equal parts of ni
trate of silver and nitrate of potash, a much larger quantity of hypo
nitrite is obtained and less silver is set free. This process of pre
 paring the hyponitrite appears to be the most certain. The fine
 crystalline needles obtained by dissolving the salt in hot water, have
 a fatty and cotton-like appearance, and seem colourless in the liquid
 in which they form; whereas when taken from it, they always pos
 sess a greenish tint of greater or less intensity. When heated in a
 small glass tube by a spirit-lamp, these crystals are immediately
decomposed into nitrous vapour and silver, which retains the form of
 the hyponitrite; when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, they
 decompose instantly with the production of nitrous vapour and sul
 phate of silver.
    One hundred parts of the crystallized hyponitrite yielded 69.87 of
 silver, showing that it is composed of

   This result agrees with the previous determination of Mitscherlich,
 who found the salt to yield 70,082 per cent. of silver.
    From the above-mentioned facts M. Persoz concludes,—
    1. That nitrate of silver behaves up to a certain point similarly to
 the alkaline nitrates, being, like them, partially converted by heat into
 hyponitrite.
    2. That this hyponitrite is formed only in the presence of nitrates
 which give it stability, such as the mitrates of silver, potash, soda and
 other alkaline nitrates.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Mai 1848.

       OECONOMICAL Plt. EPARATION OF OXIDE OF ANTIMONY.
                         BY M. E. G. HORN UNG.
    The author states, that M. Froderking having published a process
 for the preparation of oxide of antimony by means of sulphuric acid,
 he tried whether the same process would not succeed with replacing
 antimony by the sulphuret. He mixed in an iron vessel fifteen parts
 of sulphuret of antimony, in very fine powder, with thirty-six parts
 of sulphuric acid, and exposed the mixture during a whole night to
 a gentle heat. The mixture at first thickened, and being frequently
 stirred, it afterwards became liquid on raising the temperature.
    Eventually the mass became whitish, some sulphur fused and se
 parated, and a large quantity of sulphurous acid was disengaged;
 the mixture was heated, and stirred frequently as long as the disen
 gagement of sulphurous acid and the combustion of the sulphur con
 tinued. When no other vapour than that of sulphuric acid was
 formed, water was gradually added, and the mass was washed to
remove the free sulphuric acid. The subsulphate of antimony was
 decomposed by carbonate of soda, and the oxide obtained washed:
fifteen parts of sulphate [sulphuret?] of antimony yielded thirteen
parts of oxide of a greenish-white colour, which, with the exception
of some impurity, dissolved in tartaric acid. This process is the most
 oeconomical for the oxide intended for the preparation of emetic
 tartar.—Journ. de Ph. et de Ch., Mai 1848.
    [I may remark, that the use of antimony and sulphuric acid for
preparing the oxide of antimony was proposed and published by me
in 1811, in my Experimental Examination of the Pharmacopoeia Lon
 dinensis. The late Dr. Babington suggested soon afterwards to me
 to try as an improvement (and it is a great one) the use of sulphuret
 instead of metallic antimony. Although I did not at the time try
 the proposed alteration, I know it has since been adopted on a con
siderable scale, it having occurred as an improvement to two other
parties with whom I am acquainted. I will only add, that there is no
use in gently heating the mixture for a long time; it may be boiled
to dryness at once, and the residue is fit for preparing tartarized an
timony when merely washed with water, and without using any car
bonate of soda.-R. P.]
    ON THE CHRYSOTIL FROM THE WOSGES.              BY M. DELESSE.
   The serpentine of the Vosges, and especially that of Goujot near
Eloyes, is intersected by a great number of veins which penetrate the
rock in every direction. These veins are frequently microscopic, and
generally are at most only from one to two centimetres in thickness;
they are filled by an asbestiform substance, and which is generally
called asbestus, but according to M. Delesse it ought to be referred
to the chrysotil of M. Kobell.
   It is formed of very fine parallel fibres, which may be easily se
parated. When in mass it is translucent, and the fibres are trans
lucent when isolated; by exposure to the air they become opake

and whitish. This substance is usually of a brightish oil-green
colour, passing to olive-green; it has a characteristic pearly and
silky lustre. Its density is 2:219. M. Delesse found it to consist of

   The chemical composition of chrysotil is identical with that of the
picrolite of Stromeyer, with the different noble serpentines recently
analysed by M. Lychnell, and especially with the crystallized ser
pentine of Snarum. The density of chrysotil is, however, less than
that of serpentine, which seems to indicate that it is a dimorphous
variety of serpentine.—Ibid.
   ON CHLORIDE OF GOLD AS A TEST OF ORGANIC MATTER IN
                              COMMON WATER.
   M. A. Dupasquier states, that after having found by numerous
experiments that nitrate of silver was an uncertain test of the pre
sence of organic matter in waters, he tried other processes, and at
last found that chloride of gold might be successfully employed.
The method of employing it is to put from twenty-five to thirty
grammes of the water to be examined into a flask, and to add to it
sufficient solution of perfectly neutral chloride of gold to render it
slightly yellow, and afterwards to boilit. If the water contains only
the usual quantity of organic matter found in drinkable waters, it
retains its yellow colour; if, on the contrary, it contains an undue
proportion of organic matter, it immediately becomes brown, then
assumes a violet or bluish tint, which indicates the decomposition of
 the chloride of gold by the organic matter. By continuing the ebul
lition, the violet or bluish tint becomes deeper, if the proportion of
 organic matter be considerable; but if the liquid becomes slightly
brownish or greenish, it is sufficient to prove that the water contains
 an unusual quantity of organic matter. The solution of gold must
 contain no excess of hydrochloric acid, as that would prevent the
 decomposing action of the organic matter.
    It sometimes occurs, when the ebullition has been long continued,
 that the solution is rendered colourless by the precipitation of oxide
 of gold by the carbonate of lime in the water, unless the chloride
 has been used slightly in excess; and when it is so, the yellow tint
 may be modified by the liquid being rendered slightly turbid. To
 distinguish these effects from those of the decomposing reaction
 produced by the organic matter, a drop or two of hydrochloric acid
 is to be added, which will immediately dissolve the oxide of gold,
 and the liquid will assume its original appearance, unless the salt of
 gold has been decomposed by the organic matter. When, however,
 the chloride has been once reduced to the metallic state by the or.

ganic matter, it is not, like the oxide of gold, soluble in hydrochloric
acid; and the liquor remains violet, bluish violet, or brownish or
greenish violet, when there is great excess of chloride of gold. If,
however, the water contains a trace of any nitrate, and it be again
boiled, the gold becomes dissolved.
   It has been objected, that all organic matters do not possess equal
decomposing power with respect to the salt of gold. This objection
is, however, groundless, when it is considered that the process is
proposed for natural waters, the organic matter of which is always
of the nature of ulmin or gein, and evidently derived from the wash
ing of vegetable or animal matter, more or less decomposed, and
frequently in the state of humus ; and that these occur in lands into
which rain-water filters, or in the soil of cities bathed by rivers which
supply their wells and fountains. Under all these circumstances,
and also in the cases of water which has filtered from cesspools, &c.,
the organic matter resulting from the spontaneous decomposition of
animal and vegetable products, always decomposes the salt of gold.
   M. Dupasquier made numerous experiments with distilled water,
to which recent urine, gelatine, or crumb of bread had been added,
and also some other organic matters which had not been altered by
putrefaction.    These substances generally decomposed the salt of
gold, after long-continued ebullition ; the effect was rapidly pro
duced in water to which a small portion of peat or vegetable earth
had been added, a violet or bluish colour appearing very quickly.
Distilled waters which contain essential oils also decompose the chlo
ride of gold.
   It follows, then, from comparative trials, that chloride of gold may
be decomposed by unaltered organic matter, but in general with
greater difficulty than by that which results from the spontaneous
decomposition of animal and vegetable remains, and consequently
analogous to the organic matter held in solution by common or
natural waters.-Journ. de Ph. et de Ch., Mars 1848.

    M. Laurence Smith has announced to the Academy of Sciences
 the discovery of two new minerals. The first, to which he has given
the name Medjidite, is a double sulphate of lime and uranium, U2O3

 XIV. On OEnanthal, its Compounds, and the Products of its
     Decomposition. By THoMAs GeoRGE TILLEY, Esq.”
      HE volatile liquid obtained when the oil of Ricinus com
        munis is distilled, consists, as was shown by Bussy, of a
substance analogous to aldehyde, bearing the same relation to
oenanthylic acid which aldehyde bears to acetic acid. Bussy
analysed oenanthal, and described the method employed by
him in its preparation, but did not further investigate the
matter. It is easily prepared in a pure state and in large
quantities by simple distillation of castor-oil. The oil which
passes over is mixed with a large quantity of water, and, with
it, distilled again. This process separates the oenanthal from
certain fatty acids not volatile with water; but it is still impure
from admixture of acroleine and other substances of unknown
nature. To expel the acroleine, which is exceedingly volatile,
the fluid is heated in a water-bath to 100°, and a stream of
carbonic acid passed through it until it has lost the well-known
and intensely powerful odour of that substance. The tempe
rature is then raised in an oil-bath to 155°, when the fluid
commences to boil, and continues in ebullition until more than
two-thirds are distilled. The product of this distillation is
pure oenanthal, containing traces of water which it dissolves
in considerable quantities, and from which it may be separated
by chloride of calcium.                     -
   Thus obtained, oenanthal possessed all the properties
ascribed to it by Bussy; and the analyses made by me agree
with those of that chemist.                 -
   0.2570 gave carbonic acid 0.6795, and water 0:2940, giving

    CEnanthal boils at 155° Centigrade, but is somewhat de
 composed by long ebullition, its colour becoming brown and
 its reaction acid, while its boiling-point rises. This takes
 place to a slight extent even in an atmosphere of carbonic
 acid gas. Bussy found the boiling-point to be 155°-158°,
 which difference is explained by the above observation.
           ACTION of NITRic Acid on CENANTHAL.
    Nitracrol, Nitracholic Acid, Cholacrol, CEnanthylic Acid,
                  Caproic Acid, and Oralic Acid.
    CEnanthal purified by distillation in a stream of carbonic
acid, as above described, is allowed to fall drop by drop into
a retort containing strong nitric acid. The action is very
violent, and the oxidation quickly established. In the receiver
is found a mixture of oenanthylic and caproic acids, and nitra
crol, and there remain in the retort, dissolved in the strong
nitric acid, oenanthylic, caproic and oxalic acids.
    Nitracrol.—This substance was discovered by Redtenbacher
among the products of the action of nitric acid on choloidinic
acid. It seems to be frequently produced in actions of a similar
nature, and to account for the yellow colour observed on neu
tralising by an alkali the acid products obtained. When
oenanthal is distilled with nitric acid, nitracrol is found in the
receiver mixed with the fatty acids and dissolved in nitric acid.
When this is diluted with water, a stratum of oil separates
which swims on the surface, and heavy oily drops sink to the
bottom of the fluid. These heavy drops when washed con
stitute a colourless fluid very sparingly soluble in water, and
possessing a most penetrating and powerful odour; so powerful
indeed, that the mucous membrane of the nose is frequently
inflamed after smelling it.                -
    Heated to 100° with water it is decomposed, nitrous acid
passing over with another body which Redtenbacher has
called cholacrol. Mixed with caustic potash, it assumes im
mediately a yellow colour, and in a short time crystals appear,
while an oil heavier than water remains undissolved.        These
crystals are beyond all doubt the nitrocholate of potash obtained
by Redtenbacher, and found by him to have the following
formula:—
                        C, HN, O,--KO.

                and the Products of its Decomposition.                     83
    Cholacrol.-This is a product of the decomposition of ni
tracrol by alkalies, and remains in the form of a heavy oil when
the nitracrol is mixed with caustic potash. It is a clear,
somewhat yellow, heavy fluid, with a smell, when concentrated,
scarcely less intense than that of nitracrol; but when diluted,
possessing an odour like cinnamon.                           -
    Its formula was found by Redtenbacher to be—
                               Cs Hs N, Ols.
    Too small quantities of these substances were obtained by
me to permit of my making analyses; but their properties are
so marked, and their smell so characteristic, that no doubt
 remains in my mind as to their nature.
     CEnanthylic Acid.—The oily acids which separate on dilu
 tion of the nitric acid used for oxidation with water, are a
 mixture of oenanthylic and caproic acids. They are purified
 by distillation with water, and neutralized with baryta. On
 neutralization the liquid becomes yellow, owing to the presence
 of the nitrocholate of the base used for saturation. The baryta
 salts are purified by repeated crystallizations in water, and
 then dissolved in that fluid, and evaporated until a slight film
 appears on the surface; they are then allowed to crystallize
 spontaneously. The oenanthylate of baryta appears in the
 form of lancet-shaped plates, sometimes thick and hard, and
 at others in groups of silky vegetations. As long as crystals
  of this character continue to be deposited, the liquid is allowed
  to evaporate; and as soon as small clusters appear, is decanted.
      The oenanthylate of baryta is purified by several crystalli
  zations; and thus obtained, the crystals were analysed, and
  found to have the composition assigned to this salt by me in
  a former memoir, and since authenticated by the analyses of
  Redtenbacher, Bussy and Williamson.
      I. O-2950 salt gave 0-145 carbonate of baryta.
      II. 0.2255 salt gave 0.112 carbonate of baryta.
      III. O’4430 salt gave, when burned with chromate of lead,
  0.6910 carbonic acid and 0.2680 water.

   It is therefore pure oenanthylate of baryta”.
      * OEnanthylate of Silver.—In a former publication on Cenanthylic acid,
   it was stated that oenanthylate of silver, subjected to distillation, gave as
   products an oil and a crystalline substance. This statement must have been
                                       G 2

84       Mr. T. G. Tilley on CEnanthal, its Compounds,
   Caproic Acid.—When oenanthylate of baryta is no longer
deposited from the solution of the mixed salts, the clusters of
prismatic crystals which appear are separated and purified by
crystallization. They were analysed.
   0.2790 salt gave 0.1500 carbonate of baryta.
   0.4110 salt gave 0.5855 carbonic acid and 0.2180 water.
Therefore,
                             Found.       Atoms.    Calculation.
         Carbon        .  .  38'83          12         39-22
         Hydrogen . 5'89                    11           5°99

         Baryta . . . 41'82                   1        41 '80
   It is evident, then, that these crystals are caproate of baryta.
   With regard to the formation of caproic acid in this oxida
tion, I at first thought that “capronal’ was contained among
the products of the distillation of castor-oil. I looked for it
in vain among the products boiling at about 135° Cent. ; and
many analyses made only led to the result, that the more vo
latile portions of the oil were rendered so by admixtures of
acroleine, and probably by the bicarburet of hydrogen of
 Faraday. The formation of one atom of oxalic acid and one
atom of water explains the presence of caproic acid among the
products of the oxidation of oenanthal:
        Cia Hla O2+7O—(C., O, H+ HO)= Cha Hla O,
one atom of caproic acid.
   Oxalic acid is found in the retort dissolved in the nitric acid
liquid.
               Action of melted Potash on OEnanthal.
   OEnanthylic Acid.—CEnanthal is allowed to fall from a pi
pette into a retort containing fused hydrate of potash. Hy
drogen gas is evolved, and oenanthylate of potash is formed.
This is decomposed by an acid, the oily acid neutralized with
baryta, and the salt formed is oenanthylate of baryta.
   0.281 salt gave 0.1395 carbonate of baryta, which is equi
valent to 38.57 per cent of baryta, theory requiring 8875.
       Action of Caustic Potash on CEnanthal in the cold.
   Hydruret of OEnanthyle.—It was observed by Bussy and
Williamson, that oenanthal, when mixed with a strong solu
tion of caustic potash, underwent a peculiar change; but they
came to no results which explain the nature of this change.
the result of error; for on carefully making a new trial, the products of
the process were oenanthylic acid and a small quantity of a brown tarry
matter.

              and the Products of its Decomposition.           85
    One part of oenanthal is poured on five or six parts of hy
 drate of potash, and the mixture allowed to stand in a closed
 vessel. Heat up to 120° Cent. is produced, and the fluid be
 comes thick. After twenty-four hours a large quantity of water
 is added, and all that is soluble in that fluid removed.    The
 oil which remains is mixed with a fresh quantity of water, and
 with it distilled: it passes over exceedingly slowly with the
 watery vapour; and only after several days, and the evapora
tion of large quantities of water, is the distillation completed.
 The oil which passes over with the water is colourless, fluid,
and smells slightly like lemons. Its boiling-point is 220°, at
which temperature, however, it is quickly decomposed, turning
 brown and smelling differently. It is slightly soluble in water,
 and dissolves small quantities of that liquid; it burns with a
clear flame, giving little smoke. It is soluble in alcohol and
aether in all proportions.
    To determine its composition, several precautions are ne
cessary to ensure its perfect conversion into carbonic acid and
water. In the ordinary manner, with oxide of copper no re
sults which agree with each other can be obtained; and only
by means of free oxygen, and the simultaneous use of chlorate
of potash in the bulb, can the whole of the carbon be obtained
as carbonic acid. The same specimen analysed gave in three
separate experiments incompatible results.

numbers which are too diverse to permit of their use in cal
culating a formula. Traces of carbon are also found in the
bulbs; and to obviate this occurrence, the substance is intro
duced into the combustion-tube in a double bulb having the
annexed form.
   Into a is introduced a small piece of melted chlorate of
potash, and the bulb b being warmed, the air is driven out
without heating the salt. When introduced into the combus
tion-tube, the bulb is filed at c, and thus the fluid allowed to
escape into the oxide of copper before the combustion is com
menced. Towards the end of the analysis a stream of dry
oxygen is passed through the apparatus. By these means

    The formula for this new body is then Cia Hla O; and the
nature of the change is explained by supposing three atoms
 of oenanthal decomposed by potash into one atom of oenan
 thylic acid and two atoms of the new body; as—
      3 atoms of oenanthal         . = C, H, O,
   – l atom oenanthylic hydrate = Cha Hla O,
      2 atoms of the new substance = Cas Has O,
     On examining the alkaline liquid washed from the mixture
 of potash with oenanthal, as described above, it will be found
 to contain oenanthylate of that base; and on the addition of
 one of the strong acids, oenanthylic acid is evolved, and in such
 proportion as would be expected from the above change in
 oenanthal, the oenanthylic acid amounting to about one-third
 of the oenanthal employed.
     This is a parallel change to that which takesplace when moist
 chlorine gas is passed through the oil of bitter almonds, and
 the compound BzOHO +2BzH, or the benzoate of the hy
 druret of benzoyle formed. In the present case, however, the
 body formed is decomposed by the greater attraction of the
 potash for the oenanthylic acid, and the compound above de
 scribed, which I shall now call hydruret of oenanthyle, Cia His
  O+H, is set free. Or oenanthal may be considered as a
 compound of oenanthylic acid and hydruret of oenanthyle.
     When I had almost finished the examination of this sub
  stance, a memoir by Mr. Williamson (Ann, der Chemie, vol. lxi.
  p. 38) on the same subject fell into my hands. There is suf
  ficient similarity between the results found by that gentleman
  and the numbers here published. The deficiency in carbon
  and the irregularity of the substance produced, arise partly
  from the difficulty of combustion of, and partly from the pre
  sence of potash in, the substance analysed by him. For it is

                and the Products of its Decomposition.          87
  almost impossible to separate entirely that body from the oil
  by washing; nay, even after many days’ boiling with water,
  the oil still contained traces of potash.
     The formation of the oenanthylate of potash was, however,
  also observed by Mr. Williamson.
           Hydruret of CEnanthyle with oridizing agents.
     To render more certain the view as to the true nature
  of the hydruret of oenanthyle, it was oxidized in two several
º ways; and, as might have been supposed from the analogy
  of the hydruret of benzoyle, oenanthylic acid was the product
  of the operation. Mixed drop by drop with strong nitric acid,
  hydruret of oenanthyle is dissolved and oxidation proceeds
  rapidly, though more slowly than in the case of oenanthal;
  but Oenanthylic acid is the sole product of the action.
     Heated with potash, hydruret of oenanthyle is decomposed
  with the evolution of hydrogen, and the production of oenan
  thylic acid and a tarry substance. The action however pro
  ceeds slowly and with difficulty.
     The acid formed in both cases was neutralized by baryta;
  and the properties of the salt formed agreed entirely with
  those of oenanthylate of baryta.
     0.223 of the salt of the acid formed by oxidation with nitric
  acid gave 0-1 105 carbonate of baryta; and it therefore con
  tains 38'50 per cent. baryta, theory requiring 38:75.
     The compounds of Oenanthyle may probably be considered
  as thus constituted:—
        CEnanthyle . . . . . C14 His O
        Hydruret of oenanthyle . Cia His O-H-H
        Oxide of oenanthyle . . Cia His O-HO (or anhydrous
          oenanthylous acid, that of Liebig and Pelouze).
        CEnanthal . . . . . Cia His O-H HO
        Hydrated oenanthylic acid Cia His O--O,4-HO
  Or the nomenclature may be adopted until our views on this
  subject are rendered more clear by the addition of new facts.
                  Action of Ammonia on CEnanthal.
     GEnanthylammon.—When ammoniacal gas is passed into
  oenanthal, as was observed by Bussy, it is absorbed in large
  quantities, heat is developed, and the liquid becomes thick;
  by the continued action of the gas it however resumes its former
  degree of fluidity.
     Eisulphate of OEnanthylammon.—This substance has the
  composition of taurine, with the elements of oenanthal substi
  tuted for those of aldehyde. When oenanthylammon is dis

  88            Mr. T. G. Tilley on CEnanthal, &c.
  solved in strong spirits of wine, and a stream of sulphurous
  acid passed through the solution, a crystalline powder falls in
  considerable quantities. If the alcoholic solution be not too
  concentrated, the salt is deposited more slowly and in a more
  decidedly crystalline form. These crystals are small prisms,
  which glitter in the sun and are brilliantly white. They are
  slightly soluble in alcohol and water, but more so in the former
  than in the latter; and may partly be obtained again by eva
  poration, but they are in a great measure decomposed. When
  mixed with water in the cold they are slowly decomposed,
                                                                    :
 but when heated in this fluid the decomposition takes place
 more rapidly, oenanthal being evolved and the fluid containing
 bisulphite of ammonia. In the presence of strong acids de
 composition proceeds still more quickly. Heated on a plate
 of platinum this salt melts, white fumes are given off, it
 blackens, and lastly burns with a flame, the vapours smelling
 of oenanthal.
     To estimate the sulphur, the bisulphite of oenanthylammon
 was warmed in a large platinum vessel with strong caustic
 potash free from sulphate, the water evaporated, and the mass
 ignited with pure nitrate of potash. This method is attended
 with no difficulties, provided the platinum vessel be sufficiently
 large to prevent loss by particles being scattered on the appli
 cation of heat. The nitrogen was determined as the double
 chloride of platinum and ammonia."
        0.2770 substance gave 0.340 sulphate of baryta
        0.2210 substance gave 0-2400 chlor. pt. amm.,
which numbers lead to the following rational formula:—
                         Found. Atoms.
         Carbon .      .          14 = 1050-0        43°08

         Nitrogen     . 6-8        I      175-0       7.1
         Sulphur      . 16-8       2      400°O      16°4.
                                        2437.5
Or its rational formula is—
                  Cia His O, SO, +SO, NH, O:
and it may be considered as a double salt of the sulphite of
Oenanthal, and the sulphite of the oxide of ammonium.
    The analogy between this substance and taurine is interest
ing; for the substance described in this section is the body
isomeric with taurine found by Redtenbacher,
                   C, HsO SO2+SO, NH, O,
with the elements of oenanthal substituted for those of aldehyde.

     I did not think it necessary to determine the carbon and
 hydrogen in this compound, as the sulphur calculated as sul
 phurous acid, and the nitrogen as the oxide of ammonium,
 immediately determine the nature of the substance formed, and
 the near approach of the quantities of these elements found
 by experiment to the numbers required by theory, leave no
 doubt as to the correctness of the above formula.
     I was in the act of making further investigations on this
 subject, and had prepared compounds of a most interesting
 nature, by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphuret
 of carbon on onanthylammon, when the town in which I was
 residing became the prey of one of those political convulsions
 which mark the present aera. The laboratory in which I
 worked was stormed, being in an exposed position, and every
 thing it contained destroyed amidst the uproar. Instruments
 and the substances under investigation were alike scattered in
 fragments around,-only , with difficulty I myself escaped.
 Such must be my excuse for the imperfectness of the present
 paper, but as soon as possible I purpose continuing this in

146.    Rºlº                 and conductibility are the only two
              modes known by which imponderable fluids are
propagated. The first, possessed in common by heat and
light, has furnished theorists with more than one occasion of
discussing the relative value of the systems of emission and
undulation. Conductibility is a second form of propagation
peculiar to heat, and which light does not present. What
is the true character of transmission of electricity? This is
an important question, the solution of which requires direct
experiments.
    147. Analogy furnishes no data which can inspire any con
fidence. It is generally agreed that the imponderable agents
form two distinct groups. Light and radiant caloric are

governed by such similar laws, that M. Melloniº and other
philosophers admit the identity of their nature. The same
has been the case, since Ampère, with electricity and mag
netism, the analogous properties of which are comprised in
phaenomena of attraction, repulsion, and induction. The only
manifestations common to the four fluids are their impondera
bility, their property of mutually engendering themselves in
matter, and of reacting in various cases upon one another,
their incapacity of passing freely through certain bodies,
(opake, athermanous, isolating); lastly, their extreme velo
city of propagation. But these resemblances do not admit of
our deciding whether electricity is transmitted by radiation,
as might be conjectured from its more rapid motion than that
of light, or by conductibility, in the manner of the caloric of
contact, as has been supposed by a sort of universal conven
tion, to which scientific language gives faith. The expressions
of conducting bodies and isolating bodies have only acquired a
theoretical importance from the remarkable works of Ampère
on the propagation of electricityt, and of Mr. Faraday on the
induction of contiguous particlesf.
    148. In his Itecherches sur quelques points de l’Electricité
voltaïque, M. Vorsselman de Heer has given his opinion that
the velocity of the current depends only on the matter of the
conductor, just as the rapidity of sound is modified only by
the nature of the medium in which it is transmitted S. If
this was the case, the proposed hypotheses on the mode of
propagation and on the nature of the electric fluid would be
very much simplified. But the phaenomenon is probably more
complicated; and M. Poggendorff has recently shown º the
rapidity of transmission of the current of the battery seems to
be proportioned to the product of the conductibility of the
medium by its section ||.
    149. The object of this memoir is to establish the fact ex
perimentally, that rectilinear propagation, a fundamental con
dition of all radiation, is not verified for dynamic electricity,
which consequently does not possess the property of being

proceed to describe were made at the invitation and with the
assistance of my friend M. Ch. Cellérier. They are in a man
ner well-timed from the recent publication of Prof. Maas *.
     150. The apparatus employed is represented in plan in
Plate I. fig. 1, and a section of it in fig. 2. AB is a glass tube
one metre in length, perforated by a small internal canal, and
arranged horizontally. One end terminates at the bottom of
a vertical chamber C, of the same substance, and the other at
 the centre of a cylindrical earthen vessel DD, into which it
penetrates by an aperture which is closed by means of a stopper
a. The vessel is divided into two equal chambers, isolated by
 the plate of glass bb, cemented in a perpendicular position to
 the axis of the tube.        All the sides of these two chambers
 were covered with several layers of varnish of gum-lac. On
 the middle of the plate was fixed a piece figured in detail in
 fig. 3. It is composed of a large copper cylinder, the foot
 of which is slit at e. The excentricity of this slit allowed
 of the vertical axis, to which it is parallel, being made to co
 incide exactly with the mouthpiece v of the tube AB. Higher
  up is seen a diametral aperture,f, into which is fixed, by the
  screw g, the extremity of the wire aa. Lastly, the upper part
  of the cylinder dd is pierced in the direction of the axis for
  the length of Om'035, with a slightly conical aperture, in
  which the piece h turns with gentle friction. This piece is
  furnished with a support which regulates its insertion. At its
  extremity, this piece has a square hole which receives the stem
  i held tight by the screw k. The arm i is itself pierced so as
  to receive the copper wire l, the serviceable length of which is
  regulated by the screw n, and the lower part of which, isolated
  in a glass tube m, is exposed only at the base of the latter,
      151. The experiment is made with a voltaic element P, the
  nature of which varies according to the sensibility of the rheo
  meter G. The first experiments were performed with a pair
  formed of two square plates, copper and zinc, of 0”035 thick
  ness; the others with a copper and an iron wire immersed in
  pure water. The polar extremities terminate in the mercury
  contained in the glasses p and q.
       152. These glasses communicate with two other similar
  cups E, F, by means of the metallic branches r and s, in fig. 4.
   The first, r, is a large copper wire curved twice, and the hori
   zontal portion of which is inclosed in a glass tube; the other,
   s, is a wire of the same diameter with three bends: its central

 portion is isolated in a coating of wax. These two pieces have
 their extremities amalgamated: they constitute a very simple
 rheotrope, which has proved very useful to me in a great
 number of researches”.
    153. The reservoir C, the tube AB, and the two compart
 ments D, D'are filled with purified mercury up to the general
 level o O O" O". C is then connected with the cup E by the
 metallic wire 8. The current then follows the mercury of the
 channel AB.       To conduct it back from D into F, two ways
 are presented, the resistances of which are equal, or nearly so.
 One is the wire a, which terminates at the aperture f of the
 piece represented in figs. 2 and 3; an excellent Gourgon's
 multiplicating rheometer G, the needles of which only make a
 simple oscillation in twenty-six seconds, was interposed in its
 development. The other way is furnished by the wire 3 of
 determined dimensions, and which is immersed at 2 in the
 mercury of the chamber D: it communicates with this liquid
 only by its lower point, and is isolated for a sufficient length,
 by means of a covering of glass. This arrangement is analo
 gous to those which I have described in employing the method
 of derivations (74 to 79.).
    154. The principle on which this mode of experimenting is
 founded is easily understood. Let us suppose that the wires
a and 3 exert an equal resistance, and that the second termi
nating in 8, at a distance Bz from the extremity of the chan
nel AB, any suitable lengthening of the stem i causes the first
to terminate in 2', the length B2 being equal and symmetrical
to Bº.       Each of them will then afford a passage for a current
of the same intensity, and that intensity will behalf that which
flowed off by the channel AB. Now the pair Pbeing of small
dimensions and feebly excited, whilst the wires 2 and 3 are
thick and good conductors, any one of the latter, taken singly,
would suffice for the discharge. If the electricity is propa
gated by radiation, the portions of the total current transmitted
by each of the circuits will vary with the respective positions
of the points of contact of the wires with the mercury. The
extremity of 3 being constantly immersed in 2, let us bring
that of 2 into 2". Thus placed in the prolongation of the
axis of the tube, and in the course of the electric rays which
issue from it in a parallel bundle, this wire & will be traversed
by a stronger current, and the rheometric deviation will in
crease. The quantity of the fluid which will run off by the
wire 3 will be proportionately diminished.
    155. This inequality in the distribution of the parts of the

          Prof. E. Wartmann's Fifth Memoir on Induction. 93
  total current between the two circuits may be increased by
  shortening the arm kw, and thus approaching the point :" to
  the opening v. We have even inserted the end of the wire &
  Om'025 into the channel AB, the diameter of which was larger,
  so that there still remained a thin ring of mercury around
  the wire.
     156. The position of the extremity of the wire 3 may be
  changed at will, and all possible arcs be described around the
  point v, by the terminal surface of the wire 2, giving any value
  to the ray of rotation kr: the deviation of the rheometer re
  mains absolutely constant. This is due to the great con
  ducting property of the mercury; for if a saturated solu
  tion of sulphate of copper is substituted for it, differences are
  found in the position of the index. But these differences are
  produced by the variations of resistance of the filaments of
  liquid interposed between the aperture of the tube AB and
  the extremities of the circuits.
      157. The same constancy in the rheometric indication con
  tinues when the depths of immersion of the wires a and 3 are
  modified in a successive or simultaneous manner.
      158. The result of these experiments cannot be attributed
  to a phaenomenon of internal reflexions. Admitting a perfect
  cylindricity of the vessel DD', all the electric radii would have
   been brought, by lateral reflexions, toward the aperture v of
   the tube AB which occupies its centre. Although the vessel
   does not present exactly this geometric form, it differs so little
   from it that we may admit that a very small number of reflected
   rays reached the wire 3 immersed in 2 at 0” 13 of the aperture.
      159. I also wished to demonstrate, that the relative distri
   bution of electricity between the two wires a and 3 is not due
   to a total reflexion of the fluid on the surface of the mercury;
   and with this view I constructed the apparatus represented in
   fig. 5. A large copper wire ttt is curved so that its extremities
   become parallel and not far apart: they are moreover encased
   in glass tubes un, which leave only the terminal surfaces of the
   wire exposed. The latter is fixed between two pieces of
   wood H, one of which is pressed against the other by means
   of a clamp w. A slit y permits of establishing this forked
   system on the glass plate bb, and extending it over the entire
   length right and left of the cylinder d. The extremity of the
   wire 3 is then introduced into the compartment D'. Expe
   rience proves that the deviation of the rheometer is in no de
   gree affected by the diversities of position and immersion of
w  the wires 3 and t, whether they are or are not accompanied
   by analogous changes in the place and depth of immersion of
   the other wire l, the extremity of 2.

   160. The tube AB was arranged in the centre of another,
upon which was wound four metres of a copper wire covered
with silk. In this wire the current of ten powerful Grove's
elements was excited (189.), and rendered intermittent by
means of the commutator described (122.).         The rheometer
was sheltered from the electro-magnetic influence of this long
bobbin. The induction produced in the mercury contained in
AB in no degree changed the constancy of indication of the
1nStrument,
   161. The same result was obtained by inserting into the
inductor cylinder the portion of the wire a which joins the
rheometer with the cup F. These two experiments confirm
the conclusions detailed in § XIII.
   162. Care was taken to alternate the direction of the cur
rent of the battery P in each of the preceding experiments, by
placing the pieces r and s one while parallel, at another cross
ways; that is to say, by putting the cup p in communication
with E, then with F, and joining the cup q with F, then with
E. These changes in the direction of the current caused in
it corresponding ones in the direction of the deviation of the
needle of the rheometer, but did not alter the magnitude of
that deviation.
   163. Thus the fundamental fact is established, that electri
city in the form of a current is not transmitted by rectilinear
radiation. Does its propagation result from section to section
in the bodies called conductors, as is admitted in the case of
caloric by contact? This daily appears more probable, not
withstanding the extreme velocity with which it is effected.
I propose very soon to examine the electricity of tension in
the same point of view.
   164. I may observe, that the conclusions of the present in
vestigation confirm those of my second memoir. It may have
been objected, that if electricity is propagated by undulations,
comparable from their extreme minuteness to those which
constitute light, none of the three methods which I have em
ployed is sufficiently precise to testify for or against the inter
ference. I shall not appeal to the probability that this latter
would be shown, at least once, in the hundreds of repetitions
which have been made of each experiment: it is sufficient for
me to observe, that as rectilinear propagation does not exist,
 interference is impossible.

    In estimating the effect of the higher powers of the disturb
ing force, we must take account of the powers of p and z which
have been neglected. And in expanding R, we must make
r=p(1 +p), v=mu, and substitute for p and u their known
values in functions of r. But for the first power of the dis
turbing force, we must put t for t, and make p-0. And for
this first power, we may change du into Tºls’ operating on s,
the epocha, only where it stands alone without ar. And we
may also change dR into * **, or into             dR

theorem, and to put for p and z their approximate values as
they arise.
    We might have made v-u--ant instead of v-mu, and have
transformed (a.) in exactly the same manner; and this is Han

how to determine the constants 6 and m, or 2.          These would
give the progression of the apse.

    To compare these with the equations before found, we may
observe that (3.) is more simple than (5.), but (4.) is consider
ably more complex than (6). The higher powers of the dis
turbing force are more easy to develope (by the method
suggested) in the former set, and are attended with some dif
ficulty in the latter, on account of the dR in 2<U+017F>dR relating
only to the co-ordinates of the disturbed body. Upon the
whole, therefore, perhaps (3.) and (4.) may be quite as easily
solved as (5.) and (6).
    I shall not enter upon the determination of the latitude and
reduction, as these must be found by some of the ordinary
methods.
Reply to Mr. Boole's paper in the last Number of this Journal.
   Mr. Boole says that the example which I adduced by way
of illustration is not analogous to his. I know it. It was
given as one instance in which the supernumerary arbitraries
must be determined by substitution. It appeared to me that
he did not consider it necessary to retain them in any case.
I might form this opinion on insufficient grounds, but I do
not yet see how I could come to any other conclusion. In
the Number of this Journal for January 1847, and in the
seventh Number of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, he
made assertions which implied that the supernumerary arbi
traries might be rejected. In neither case did he allege the
peculiar nature of the example or process, or say that his as
sertions might be proved. And moreover these examples are
not analogous. If in certain cases it can be proved that the
arbitraries in question will go out, of course in those cases
they may be at once rejected. And now he has only given
the proof in one particular case or interpretation of his equa
tion; and the completeness of the solution is only proved in
this particular case. I pass over the various other points
contained in his paper, believing that I may safely leave them
to the consideration of the candid reader.

XVII. Additional Analytical Considerations respecting the Ve
    locity of Sound. By the Rev. J. CHALLis, M.A., F.R.S.,
    F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experi
    mental Philosophy in the University of Cambridge*.
      PROPOSE in this communication to resume the inquiry
       respecting the mathematical determination of the velocity
of sound, at the point where it was left (Phil. Mag. Supple
mentary number, p. 498) in my reply to the remarks made by
the Astronomer Royal on my communication in the Number
of the Philosophical Magazine for April.
     After proving (Phil. Mag. for April, p. 277) that the expres:
sion uda-H way--wdz must be made integrable in a general
manner, it was shown (Supplement, pp. 496 and 497) that on
satisfying this condition by supposing the velocity to be a
function of the distance either from a plane or from a centre,
contradictory results were arrived at, which necessarily led to
the inference that neither plane-waves nor spherical waves are
physically possible. A third supposition, according to which
the above expression is the differential of the product of a
function (p) of 2 and t, and a function (f) of a and y, involved
no contradiction, the reasoning being confined to the first
order of approximation. To complete the consideration of
this third case, which for the sake of distinction may be called
that of non-divergent waves, it will be necessary to inquire
whether any contradiction is met with when the reasoning is
conducted by exact equations, which I now proceed to do.
     The reasoning by which it was concluded that uda +vdy
 +wdz must be made integrable in a general manner, went on
the supposition of small vibratory motions, and quantities of
a higher order than the first were neglected. I have elsewhere
urged (Camb. Phil. Trans., vol. viii. part 1, p. 35; and Phil.
 Mag. S. 3. vol. xxi. p. 426) that in this process of reasoning
the equations
                 du de du-dº do dº
                 dr T dy' dº. T de' dz T dy
are approximate, whereas the inference of integrability requires
 that they should be identical equations. With reference to
 this point, Mr. Stokes, in his Report on Hydrodynamics (Re
 port of the British Association for 1846, p. 2), has correctly
 remarked, that the reasoning proves the quantity in question
 to be approa'imately an exact differential, which implies that
 there exists an expression ujda. --vidy--widz which is accu
 rately an exact differential, u, vi, w, differing from u, v, w

I am about to treat of small vibratory motion by making use
of exact equations, I shall assume, in accordance with the
principle stated by Mr. Stokes, that udz-H vay--wdz is accu
rately an exact differential. Let, therefore, udz--vdy--wdz

    Here it is to be remarked, that if to should contain t, fis
not independent of t, and our result is at variance with the
hypothesis by which udr H way--wdz was rendered integrable.
    To ascertain the actual value of po the equation (B.) must
be integrated, which may be done by successive approximation.
I have already shown (Phil. Mag. for April, p. 279), by
taking account of the three first terms of (B.), which are the
principal terms, that the only integral applicable to the pre
sent inquiry is                  27
                      •=mcos; (2–a't).
Setting out with this for a first approximation, it may be
readily shown that the equation (B.) is satisfied by a series of
the form                                                        -

ºp =mcos#2 —alt)+m,cos *(2-a') + m.cosº. —a't)+&c.
Hence it is clear that the value of z—alt, which causes    #    to
vanish, gives a value of to independent of z and t. Thus the
hypothesis of non-divergent waves is entirely consistent with
the exact hydrodynamical equations.
    It is worthy of remark, that the above series accounts for
the harmonics which are observed to accompany loud notes.
   Another criterion may be applied to the hypothesis of non
divergent waves. Let V be the velocity at a certain point of
the fluid at the time t, and W" be the velocity at the time t +8t
at a point of the fluid in advance of the other by 8s in the di
rection of the line of motion.     Then
                                dV         dV

                                -   L-- -  -
Hence if V-V, we have

the integral of which is V= }(s—alt). In the same way it may
be shown that the density (p) must be a function of s—all in
the case of a constant rate of propagation.
    Now these criteria of uniform propagation are not satisfied
by the hypothesis of plane waves, because on that hypothesis
we have            V=a Nap. log p = f(s—(a + V)t).
Still less are they satisfied by the hypothesis of spherical waves.
    But they are fully satisfied on the hypothesis of non-diver
gent waves, because the above value of p shows that in this
CaSe   #    is a function of z—alt; and from the known general

it follows that p is also a function of z—alt.
    I have thus shown, by reasoning with exact equations, the
entire compatibility of the hypothesis of non-divergent waves
with the hydrodynamical equations. Having at the same time
demonstrated the incompatibility of plane-waves and spherical
waves, I consider that the theorems of capital importance, to
which the reasoning in this and the two former communica
tions has been directed, are established; viz. that non-diver
gence is the normal character of acrial waves, and that the
velocity of propagation is 'greater than a. I propose in a fu
ture communication to draw some inferences from the equa
tions (B.) and (C.)

      XVIII. On the Magic Square of the Knight's March.
                       By WILLIAM BEveRLEY.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
     INCLOSE for insertion in the Philosophical Magazine
       a very interesting MAGIC SQUARE, formed by numbering
consecutively the moves of the KNIGHT in the grand tour of the
chess-board. The knight's march has engaged the ingenuity
of many eminent philosophers and mathematicians; but I
believe that Mr. W. Beverley is the first who has solved the
difficult problem of converting it into a magic square. The
principle upon which he has effected it, seems to be somewhat
akin to that invented by Dr. Roget, S.R.S., as explained in
his paper on the Knight's Move in vol. xvi. of the Philoso
phical Magazine.
                                 Yours very faithfully,

  These figures show the successive moves of the knight over
the chess-board, every square being numbered in the order
of the knight's march; so that the numbers in each vertical
and horizontal column, added together, shall be equal; the
sum of the eight numbers in each column being =260.
   These figures also present many other peculiarities.
   1. The chess-board (see fig. 1) is divided into four equal
parts by the lines ab and cd. These parts are marked A, B,
C and D, and consist each of sixteen squares,-four squares
in height and four in width; and if the columns of any of
these parts be added up, both vertically and horizontally, each
column will give the same addition, 130.
                     e.g. the part marked C.
                      33     62    15     20   | 130

                      130   130    130    130
   2. The figure is divided into sixteen equal parts by the lines
ab, ef, gh, ca, i<U+017F>, kl: each of these parts consists of four squares;
and if the four numbers in the four squares which compose
any one of these parts be added together, they will make 130.
                 e.g.                       or
              15      20                55       42
            —|—| > = 130              |—|—| > = 130
              34      61                26        7
   3. The figure is divided, by the vertical line ab, and the ho
rizontal column 1 is also divided by the same line, into two
equal parts.      Each part consists of four squares, in two of
which the numbers are even, and in the others odd. Take
the even numbers in the left division of the column, and the
º
thus :
      numbers in the right division, and add them together,

104.        Mr. W. Beverley on the Magic Square
                 in column 1, 30+52 = 82
                 in column 1, 5 + 43 = 48
                    and they will make 130
   Or take the odd numbers in the left division,     1 + 47–48
   and the even numbers in the right division, 28--54=82
                                      and they will make 130
This will be found the case with all the horizontal columns 1
to 8.
   The figure is divided, by the horizontal line ca, and the ver
tical column 16 is also divided by the same line, into two equal
parts. Each part consists of four squares, two of whose num
bers are even and the others odd.      Take the even numbers
above the line cd, and add them to the odd numbers below
the line, thus:
                  in column 16, 54 + 42 = 96
                  in column 16, 23 + 1 1 = 34
                   and they will produce 130
      Or take the odd numbers above the line, 27+ 7=34
      and the even numbers below the line,      58+38=96
                             and they will also produce 130
   This will be found the case with the columns 10, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16; that is to say, all the vertical columns except
Nos. 9 and 11, which are †† in consequence of a peculiar
movement of the knight in these columns.
      Take the odd numbers in the upper half
        of column 9,                               1 + 31 = 32
      and the even numbers in the lower half
        of column 11,                          }34463-98
                                     and they will make 130
      Or the even numbers in the upper half       48 + 50=98
        of column 9,
      and the odd numbers in the lower half
        of column 11,                          }15417-32
                                     and they will make 130
   Or the even numbers in the lower half of column 9
   and the odd numbers in the upper half of column
   Or the odd numbers in the lower half of column 9
                                                         h)}
   and the even numbers in the upper hal<U+017F> of column 11
         will, added together, produce the same amount, 130

                         of the Knight's March.                                105
    4. The top and bottom numbers of the same vertical column
        the 2nd and 7th                    do.                    do.
        the 3rd and 6th                     do.                   do.
        the 4th and 5th                     do.                   do.
added together, will produce the same amount, 65.
       Thus in column 16, the top No. 54 and the bottom No. 11 make 65
                       13, ... 2nd ... 44       ...        7th     ... 21  ...  65
                       15, ... 3rd ... 55       ...        6th     ... 10  ...  65
                       10, ... 4th ...    3     ...        5th     ... 62 ...   65
But the columns 9 and 11 are different from the others in this
respect, which arises from the peculiar movement of the knight
in these columns already alluded to.
    In these columns—
The top No.of the col.9 and the bottom No. of the col. 11, 1+64 make 65
 ... 2nd         ---    9     ...   7th          ---          11,  48+ 1.7 ...  65
 ... 3rd         ---    9     ...   6th          - - -        11,  31 +34  ...  65
 ... 4th         ---    9     ...   5th         ---           11,  50+ 15  ...  65
or the top       ---   ll     ...  bottom        ---           9,  47+18   ...  65
and so with the rest.
    5. It will be observed that every number in the figure is
in apposition in six different ways. For example, No. 54 is
    1st, in apposition in the same vertical column with 65
          No. 11, making
    2nd, in conjunction with No. 28 it is in apposition). I 30
          with Nos. 1 and 47, making
    3rd, in conjunction with No. 42 it is in apposition).                      30
          with Nos. 23 and 11, making
    4th, in apposition with the numbers in the same sub-                     130
          division 43, 6 and 27, making
    5th, in apposition with Nos. 5, 28 and 43, forming a
              -                   -   - - -  -               -               130
          horizontal column in division B, makin
    6th, in apposition with Nos. 27, 42 and 7, forming a
               -               -                  -    - -          -        130
          vertical column in the same division, making
    6. The knight's march may be commenced at the square
marked 64, in fig. 1, and so backwards, until the 64th move
terminates on the square marked 1. This will produce fig. 2,
which answers to the first figure in all its peculiarities.
    It will be easily observed that the march can be commenced
from any of the corner or rooks' squares of the board; from

IN the following methods of developing any function of sines and
      cosines by means of particular values of the function, the artifice
by which the coefficients are successively eliminated is taken from
Le Verrier’s “Dévéloppements surplusieurs points de la Théorie des
Perturbations des Planètes,” No. I.t That illustrious philosopher
has not yet given the values of the numerical constants which are
requisite when the method is practically employed.

     If this expression be compared with the expression for R, it will
be seen that one of the new factors of Bi, which I call the variable
factor, is cos (i+A i), the coefficient of B; in the expression for
R,+t; the other factor, which I call the constant factor,

   Le Verrier has given expressions by means of which A, B, are
determined, the A's and B's having lower indices, being obtained
successively from these, by means of the particular values which the
series assumes when the arbitrary angle which I have taken equal
to unity becomes successively 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.

   I have thus endeavoured to furnish expressions for obtaining the
coefficients in the development of any series of sines and cosines by
eliminating successively all the coefficients of sufficient magnitude
to be sensible except the one sought. I feel strongly impressed
with the truth of the opinion+ of Le Verrier, and I think that, if
not altogether impracticable, it is at least exceedingly difficult in
the case of the smaller planets and comets to obtain the coeffi
cients in the functions which occur in the theory of the perturbations
by any method which is not founded upon particular values of the
function, that is either by the methods here treated, or by the
method of mechanical quadratures. If the former are employed,
the tables of logarithms of particular values of certain quantities
 which I have described elsewhere, due to particular values of the
eccentric anomalies of the planets, would be useful, and would reduce
somewhat the labour of calculation of the perturbations, the par
ticular values of the eccentric anomaly being multiples of the
arbitrary angle, which I have for simplicity made equal to unity;
or if the method of quadratures is to be used, the particular values
of the eccentric anomaly being multiples of 10°, or other part of

  * L'interpolation parait donc seule susceptible de fournir les coefficients correspondants
à des multiples élevés des longitudes moyennes. Les calculs sont encore assurement très
longs; mais ils ne sont pas impracticables comme ceux qui résultent des dévéloppements

    XX. On the existence of Lactic Acid in Living Bodies.
                         By M. BERzELIUs”.
 M       LIEBIG addressed a letter to the Academy of Sciences
      • of Paris, which was read on the 17th of January 1847,
in which he said, “It has been long known that the flesh of
fresh-killed animals possesses, very appreciably, the reaction
of a free acid.     M. Berzelius has attributed this reaction to
the presence of lactic acid, but without the fact having been
hitherto ascertained by analytic results in an unquestionable
manner. Many chemists have admitted that lactic acid exists
in urine, the gastric juice, and in milk; but they have sup
ported this opinion by uncertain reactions. The opinion,
even, that lactic acid prevents the precipitation of oxide of
copper by milk of lime is founded on error. M. Strecker has
lately shown that pure lactate of copper is entirely decomposed
by milk of lime, so completely that no reagent whatever indicates
a trace of oxide of copper in the liquor after precipitation. It
is true that pure lactate of lime dissolves a little oxide of cop
per, but a slight excess of lime precipitates it again. The
intention of my experiments was to dispel the uncertainty
which enveloped the non-volatile organic acid contained in
the fluids of living bodiest.”
   M. Liebig afterwards announces, in the same letter, of which
there will be occasion again to speak, that he has found this
acid is the lactic acid. After having thus endeavoured to an
nihilate the labours of his predecessors on this acid which
exists in the animal organization, and even the experiments on
lactic acid by M. Pelouze, it is then to M. Liebig that science
owes a debt of gratitude for having taught us that living bodies
contain lactic acid.
   I have myself too great a share in the discovery of lactic
acid in living bodies, not to feel particular interest that the
history of lactic acid in the animal organization should be stated
with perfect truth.
   In 1807f I analysed the flesh of animals recently killed,
and I found lactic acid in the fluids which I extracted from it.
The question as to the nature of this acid was to be determined
by experiment. The fluid, coagulated by heat and filtered, was
evaporated to the consistence of a thick syrup, which was
treated with alcohol.       The alcoholic solution was mixed with
dilute sulphuric acid as long as a sulphate was precipitated.
The precipitate was separated by the filter and the liquor was

      On the existence of Lactic Acid in Living Bodies.          129
digested with carbonate of lead, till it contained oxide of lead
in solution. After having separated the sulphate and chloride
of lead by filtration, the fluid was treated with sulphuretted
hydrogen and evaporated: it was strongly acid, but yellow.
 Supposing it might contain foreign matters, it was again treated
with water and digested with oxide of lead, which swelled and
produced a bulky basic salt. After this the acid was again
evaporated. It deposited no crystals, but remained in the
form of an acid syrup, which I did not succeed in rendering
colourless. I prepared some salts, and found that it produced,
with lime and magnesia, granular crystalline masses. To
satisfy myself as to the nature of the acid which I had obtained,
I compared it with other acids known at this period; and I
found that it most strongly resembled the acid found by
Scheele in sour milk, and this I prepared on the occasion. I
convinced myself of their perfect identity, and that the latter
could not be better prepared in a state of perfect purity than
that from flesh.    I then asserted that the acid was lactic acid,
precisely as M. Liebig now asserts, forty years afterwards. It
appeared evident to me that lactic acid in the animal body
ought to be considered as a product resulting from the use
of the elements of flesh,-a product which circulated in the
system, and which consequently would be found in the blood,
and be finally evacuated with the urine. In my analysis of
blood, which I undertook immediately afterwards, I also dis
covered the presence of lactic acid by an analogous process;
but as the quantity which is found in it is but very small, I had
some difficulty at first in acquiring complete certainty of its
identity. The successive analyses which I performed, by de
grees, of fresh milk, urine, tears, saliva, bile, &c., all furnished
me with lactic acid: the alkaline fluids in minute quantity, the
acid ones, such as urine, milk and sweat, in larger quantity.
   Confidence was generally placed in my statements, until
L. Gmelin and    ºff. in 1826, in their excellent work on
the act of digestion, asserted that this acid was the acetic. It
could not have been difficult to distinguish a volatile acid
from an acid which is not so; but M. Gmelin thought that
the acetic acid lost its volatility by combination with animal
matter. This property, described by this chemist, obtained
confidence; and in all works which were published after this
date, the acid in question was generally considered as acetic
acid.
   This event occasioned me to undertake a new series of re
searches on lactic acid, which was published in my Treatise
on Chemistry, vol. iv. p. 577–585 (Dresden, 1831), in which
I demonstrated that it was impossible to confound lactic with

130               M. Berzelius on the existence of
acetic acid, unless it be supposed that it is with respect to
acetic acid, what sulphovinic acid is with respect to sulphuric
acid; and that even on this supposition it ought to be consi
dered as a peculiar acid.
    I then employed tartaric acid to precipitate the alkali; and
after having separated, by means of carbonate of lead, all the
acids contained in the alcoholic solution, except the lactic acid,
 I precipitated the lead by sulphuretted hydrogen. The alcohol
having been evaporated, and the solution decolorized by pure
animal charcoal, I precipitated the lactic acid from it by di
gesting in it an excess of hydrate of tin. After having washed
 the precipitate and decomposed it in water by sulphuretted
hydrogen, I obtained the acid in a much greater degree of
purity.
    The first article of the first volume of M. Liebig's Annalen
der Pharmacie, 1832, is an extract from the above memoir.
 M. Mitscherlich discovered afterwards, in 1834, that the lactate
 of zinc is a slightly soluble salt, which crystallizes readily, and
 from which lactic acid may be obtained in a state of perfect
 purity.
    During these discussions on lactic acid, which continued
 for several years, a scientific renown was acquired, founded on
 numerous brilliant discoveries, which was not slow in indi
 cating that it would attain celebrity,+it was that of M. Liebig.
 In 1842 M. Liebig”. openly proclaimed that he combined in
 his person so great an extent of knowledge acquired by innu
 merable experiments and practical results, that no person
 could in future, probably, amass so much (wie sie sich viel
 leicht nie in einem Individuum wieder vereinigen diir<U+017F>ten); and
 he undertook to initiate the human race in the chemical phae
 nomena of living nature. This essay was entirely premature;
 science did not then, nor does it yet possess, sufficient positive
 knowledge to lead to results worthy of reliance.
    Since 1821 I have been called upon, in consequence of the
 duty which devolves upon me on account of the station which
 I occupy in the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, to make
 an annual report respecting all the branches of chemistry,
 and I considered it as my duty to use every effort to exercise
 a sound and rigorous judgement. I have shown that in this
 essay M. Liebig stated probabilities, and often even some
 things which could not be so estimated, as demonstrated and
 incontestable truths. I therefore put myself in opposition to
 this unrestrained chemical authority. Considering the height to
 which M. Liebig thought himself raised, an apology would
 have been superfluous; any one who had the audacity to dare

                      Lactic Acid in Living Bodies.                          131
 to make an objection was considered as guilty; and the punish
 ment consisted in entirely censuring his labours on other sub
jects, of which the school of Giessen endeavoured to nullify
 the results, in order to diminish the reputation of the author.
 This is the motive which determined M. Liebig to cause several
 of my labours to be refuted by his pupils in the laboratory of
 Giessen.
    The existence of lactic acid in the animal fluids was one of
 these labours.       The refutation of it was committed to M. En
 derlin, who stated formally, that it was on the invitation of
 M. Liebig that he had undertaken it. The following are the
 terms in which he discloses the fact that he had been called
 to demonstrate by his experiments”: “It is absolutely impos
 sible to admit of the existence of lactic acid in the bodies of
 these animals (Carnivora), for this acid has not yet been found,
 and their food does not contain any substance which can give
 rise to itt.”
    It is evident that the results of his experiments were to
 agree with the commission which he had undertaken. He
 demonstrated that he found none. Up to this point the master
 might, apparently at least, defend himself, if the result should
 be found to be inexact, by saying that the pupil had committed
a mistake; but he appears to have thought that M. Enderlin's
process was not sufficiently decisive, and he undertook the
 demonstration himself. M. Liebig has declaredf that the
 experiments of M. Enderlin had proved that no animal fluid
contained lactic acid, that he had himself sought to confirm and
corroborate this result by the analysis of fresh and putrified
urine, and that he had not succeeded in finding it. He took
all possible pains to show to what extent my experiments were
unsatisfactory, and he expresses himself in this respect as fol
lows $: “Wenn man die von Berzelius angestellten Versuche,
   * Ann, der Chem. und Pharm., xlvi. 166.
   t “Es ist durchaus unmöglich das Vorhandensein der Milchsâure in dem
Körper dieser Thiere (Carnivora) vorauszusetzen, da sie bis jetzt noch nicht
darin gefunden worden ist, und die Nahrung keine Substanz enthalt aus
der sie enstehen könnte.”
   f Ann. der Chem. und Pharm., l. 163.
   § “When the experiments by which Berzelius has ascertained the pre
sence of lactic acid in urine are closely examined, we arrive at the conclu
sion that no one of them offers a proof that this acid is a constituent of fresh
urine.”
   It is not uninteresting to give here, with respect to these data, the terms
employed by M. Liebig on the 21st December, 1846, in announcing to the
Chemical Society of London that he had discovered lactic acid in living
bodies: “After overcoming more difficulties than I have ever experienced
in any investigation, I have for the first time indisputably proved that free
lactic and phosphoric acid exist in the whole organism wherever muscle is
                                         2

aus denen er die Gegenwart der Milchsâure im Harn er
schlossen hat, näher beachtet, so ergiebt sich aus keinem der
selben ein Beweis, dass sie einen           ‘....            des frischen
 Harns ausmacht.”
    In the two papers of MM. Enderlin and Liebig which have
been cited, lactic acid was merely a pretext. All the experi
ments were directed to the purpose of not finding lactic acid;
and the principal intention was evidently that of showing that
the data which I had published were inexact. Did they wish
simply to revenge themselves for the opposition which I offered;
or did they hope that by treating one of my labours in this
way, that I should be induced to make a kind of confession in
order to avoid the censure of the Giessen school with respect
to my other labours? I shall not decide this question.
    M. Liebig attained his end, that of causing it to be believed
for some years that living bodies contained no lactic acid.
And who could have imagined that this scientific farce would
have terminated by M. Liebig himself discovering that lactic
acid exists in the animal fluids, when I had proved it forty
years before him?
    M. Pelouze had indicated a reaction, by means of oxide of
copper and hydrate of lime, by which the presence of lactic
acid might be discovered. M. Boussingault employed this
reaction to prove that an acid which he found in urine was
lactic acid. But for the purpose of also destroying this reac
tion, before having ascertained the presence of lactic acid,
M. Liebig caused it to be proved by M. Schlieper, one of his
pupils in the Giessen laboratory, that M. Pelouze had deceived
himself, and that his method was inapplicable. I have satisfied
myself that the reaction described by M. Pelouze for the de
tection of lactic acid is perfectly correct; but I have at the
same time found, that if proper precautions be not adopted,
the end may be completely missed.
   After M. Liebig was convinced by his own experiments
that living bodies contain lactic acid, he did not endeavour to
excuse the errors which he and his pupils had committed re
specting the existence of this acid. Instead of this, he did all
that he could to reduce the labours of his predecessors to mere
attempts of insufficient reactions and unfounded hypotheses,
in order to appropriate the whole of the discovery to himself.
This mode of acting is unprecedented in the annals of science.
M. Liebig has endeavoured not to be surpassed in this respect.
found. How curious, that in the absence of all proofs on the part of the
opponents of lactic acid, I should now demonstrate to them its existence
in the flesh of oxen, fowls, calves and sheep.”--Phil. Mag., vol. xxx. 1807,
p. 412.

        Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder. 133
     In former annual reports I have mentioned the attempts
 made by M. Liebig to annul the results at which I had arrived
 with regard to lactic acid by long and laborious researches,
 submitted to frequent fresh examinations. On these different
occasions no expression of discontent escaped me, for I never
 felt it; and the less so, because I was thoroughly convinced
 that what is true remains so, although sometimes for a certain
period success may attend attempts to prove that it is not so.
 The reasons for which I have now entered upon the question
 in a more serious point of view, are, on one hand, the circum
 stances which have occurred in stating the question by M.
 Liebig’s manner of proceeding, and on the other hand, the
 position taken up by M. Mulder, for an analogous cause,
 against M. Liebig. After M. Mulder felt himself compelled
 to enter the lists against the adherent of peace in science, it
 would be pusillanimous to leave him alone in this noble com
 bat, in which his arms were an ardent desire for the right and
for truth, –arms which all those ought to bear seriously who
 cultivate science, and which they ought not to put off till re
spected by those against whom they were employed. It is
 my conviction that it is the duty of all true friends of science
to unite their efforts for the extirpation of the root of this moral
tare, which has begun to invade and domineer in the peaceful
domain of science.
       XXI. On Colouring Matters.           By Dr. Schunck”.
A".      the meeting of the British Association at Southampton I gave
       a short account of my experiments on the colouring matters
of maddert. I have continued this investigation, and have found
the extent of the subject too great to allow me to devote my atten
tion to any other of the colouring matters. I shall therefore, with
out any further preface, state the new results which I have arrived
at in regard to the chemical constituents of this root.
    On treating finely-ground madder roots with boiling water, a
brown fluid is obtained having a taste between bitter and sweet. In
order to extract all the substances capable of solution in water, about
sixteen quarts of water are required for every pound of madder. To
this fluid any strong acid, such as sulphuric or muriatic acid, is added
in slight excess. Nitric acid must not be used for the purpose.
Oxalic acid is best adapted for the purpose, as it can afterwards be
completely removed by chalk. The acid produces a dark brown
precipitate, which is separated by filtration and washed with water
until the excess of acid is removed. The percolating fluid is yellow.
This brown precipitate consists of six vegetable substances, viz. two
            * From the Report of British Association for 1847.

colouring matters, two kinds of fat, pectic acid and a substance of
an intensely bitter taste, which I am as yet unable to refer to any
known class of bodies. The whole quantity of colouring matter con
tained in the aqueous extract of madder is precipitated by the addi
tion of a strong acid. In proof of this I took a quantity of the aque
ous extract, added sulphuric acid, separated the brown precipitate by
filtration and removed the excess of acid with cold water, and then
boiled it with water, into which a small piece of mordanted cloth
was introduced. The cloth assumed the same colours which it would
have done with madder. To the fluid to which acid had been added
I put chalk until all the acid was saturated, and I then found after
filtering that it communicated no colour whatever to mordanted
cloth.
   Of the two colouring matters, one is Robiquet's Alizarin, and the
other I shall call Rubiacin.   Both are contained in the brown pre
cipitate produced by acids in the aqueous extract of madder. In
order to obtain them, this brown precipitate is first treated with
boiling alcohol until nothing more is dissolved. A dark brownish
purple, somewhat gelatinous mass is left behind, consisting principally
of pectic acid. The alcoholic fluid, which contains the two colouring
matters together with the fats, has a dark brownish-yellow colour.
 After being distilled and then evaporated to dryness, a residue of a
dirty orange colour remains. This residue is placed on a filter
and washed with cold water, until the percolating fluid, which is at
first yellow, becomes colourless. On evaporation this fluid leaves a
transparent yellow substance with a bitter taste, mentioned above.
This substance is soluble in pure water, but insoluble in water con
taining acids, and hence it is precipitated on adding acid to the
 aqueous extract of madder; but on washing the precipitate with
water, after the acid has been removed it begins to dissolve. In
order to obtain it, therefore, the brown precipitate must only be
washed so long as it still contains free acid. I shall call this sub
stance Rubian. The mass left undissolved by cold water is then
treated with boiling water, and the fluid is filtered boiling hot. On
cooling it deposits a quantity of red flocks, which consist of alizarin
mixed with fat. This process must be repeated until the boiling
fluid deposits nothing more on cooling. If any rubian be still left
in the mass on treating with boiling water, the filtration of the boiling
fluid is very much impeded, and it is therefore advisable to remove
this substance completely with cold water previously to treating with
hot water. The whole of the alizarin dissolved in the boiling water
is deposited on cooling, but mingled with fat, which probably ac
companies it through the filter in a state of suspension produced by
the heat of the boiling fluid. This fat disguises its properties very
much, and has been the cause, in all previous investigations, of ali
zarin never having been obtained in a state of purity except through
the agency of heat, which has always left it doubtful whether it ex
isted in the plant as such, or was formed by the action of heat from
 some other substance. I hope to establish satisfactorily its existence
 as a constituent of the madder root, and also the fact of its being a

pure colouring matter, a circumstance which has likewise been
doubted. In order to obtain it in a state of purity, the red flocks
which are deposited by the boiling watery solution are separated by
filtration and dissolved in boiling alcohol. To the boiling solution,
which has a brownish-yellow colour, hydrate of alumina is added,
and the boiling is continued for some time. The alizarin combines
with the alumina, forming a dark-red compound, while the fluid loses
its colour. Fresh alumina is added, until no more colouring matter
can be thereby separated. A great part of the fat remains dissolved
in the alcohol, while a part combines with the alumina. The coloured
alumina is separated by filtration and washed with alcohol for some
time. It is then treated with a weak boiling solution of caustic potash,
which dissolves the excess of alumina and all the fat which may
have combined with the alumina, but leaves the compound of ali
zarin and alumina undissolved, merely changing its colour from red
to dark purple.     This process is repeated several times, until the
alkaline fluid is no longer red, but of a pure purple colour. The
residue is treated with muriatic acid, which dissolves the alumina
and leaves the alizarin behind in crystalline flocks of an orange colour,
which are washed with water to remove the acid and then dissolved
in alcohol. The alcoholic solution on evaporation gives shining,
prismatic, orange-coloured crystals of alizarin, which may, if neces
sary, be purified by a second crystallization from alcohol.
   The mass left undissolved by boiling water consists of rubiacin
and two distinct kinds of fat. I have only been able to discover
one method of extracting the rubiacin from this mixture. This
method is founded on the solubility of rubiacin in perchloride and
pernitrate of iron. It is immaterial which of these two salts be
taken. Persulphate of iron would not answer the purpose. If the
 mixture of rubiacin with the two fats be treated with a somewhat
 concentrated boiling solution of perchloride or pernitrate of iron, a
solution of a deep reddish-brown colour is obtained, while a brown
 residue remains insoluble in an excess of the iron salt solution,
consisting of one of the two fats in combination with oxide of iron.
 The fluid is filtered, and on the addition to it of muriatic acid, a
yellow flocculent precipitate is obtained, which is separated by filtra
tion and washed until all the iron salt and the excess of acid are
removed.     This precipitate consists of rubiacin, the second of the
two fats, and of a new body which I shall call rubiacic acid. The
latter substance does not exist ready-formed in madder, but is pro
duced by the action of the persalt of iron on rubiacin. This action
consists in the rubiacin taking up a certain number of atoms of
 oxygen from the persalt of iron, and the acid which is thus formed
combines with peroxide of iron, producing a compound soluble in
water with a reddish-brown colour, and decomposable by any strong
acid. Part of the rubiacin however escapes this action, and is pre
 cipitated together with the rubiacic acid and fat on the addition of
 muriatic acid. The precipitate is treated with boiling alcohol, which
 dissolves the rubiacin and the fat, and leaves behind the rubiacic
 acid in the shape of a yellow powder. This process is repeated

  136 Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder.
  until nothing more is dissolved by the alcohol. The boiling alcohol,
  after being filtered, deposits on cooling rubiacin in small shining
  yellow crystals, which must be purified by recrystallization. The
  fluid has a yellowish-red colour. On evaporation it gives a quantity
  of an easily fusible dark reddish-brown fat, which by repeated fusion
  in boiling water and agitation with the fluid while in a melted state,
  may be separated from the rubiacin which adheres to it. The ru
  biacic acid which is left by the boiling alcohol is treated with a weak
  boiling solution of carbonate of potash, in which it dissolves with a
  dark brown colour. The solution after cooling and standing some
  time deposits a mass of brick-red needle-shaped crystals of rubiacate
  of potash, which are easily purified by recrystallization. By dissol
  ving this salt in boiling water and adding any strong acid, rubiacic
  acid in a state of purity is precipitated as a bright lemon-yellow
  powder.    The dark solution from which the rubiacate of potash has
  crystallized contains a quantity of the brown fat dissolved in the
  potash.
    The brown substance left undissolved by the perchloride or per
 nitrate of iron is, as I stated above, a compound of one of the two
 fats with oxide of iron. On being treated with muriatic acid the
 oxide of iron is dissolved, leaving behind the fat, which, after being
 washed with water, is dissolved in boiling alcohol. From this it is
 deposited on cooling as a light brown powder.
    I mentioned above that the residue which is left on treating the
 brown precipitate with boiling alcohol, consists principally of pectic
 acid.   It is treated with boiling water until nothing more is dis
 solved. The solution, which has a light brown colour, and is some
 what mucilaginous, gives a brown, transparent substance, which
 easily separates in scales from the sides and bottom of the vessel.
 After treating the residue with water until nothing more is dissolved,
 there still remains a dark brown substance undissolved, which I
suppose to be a compound of some of the preceding substances with
 oxide of iron, as it leaves a considerable quantity of ash, consisting
 of peroxide of iron, on being burnt.
    To the aqueous extract of madder, in which the brown precipi
tate had been produced by oxalic acid, I added chalk until all the
excess of acid was saturated, and after filtration I evaporated it. It
left a dark brown syrup, which may be separated by means of
alcohol into two substances.      That which is dissolved seems to be
grape-sugar, and that which is left behind is a species of extractive
matter, which agrees in its properties with aranthin, as described by
Kuhlmann. It has a brown colour.         During evaporation in contact
with the air it deposits a brown substance or apothegma, like all ex
tractive matters. But it is distinguished from all other extractive
matters which I know, by being converted into a green insoluble
substance when its solution is boiled with dilute sulphuric or mu
riatic acid. I have not examined it further, but I may mention that
it is probably this body which exerts such a deleterious influence
during the process of madder-dyeing, rendering the red and purple
brown and unsightly.

   I shall now proceed to give a more detailed account of the pro
perties of some of the substances, the methods of obtaining which I
have just described.                                              **
   Alizarin.—It is necessary to state that the substance which I
called alizarin in the paper read by me on this subject at the South
ampton meeting of the British Association, I now call rubiacin. I
am of opinion that the substance discovered by Robiquet, and called
by him alizarin, does not agree in its properties with that which I
call rubiacin; but after carefully comparing his account with the
results obtained by myself, I have come to the conclusion that the
substance to which I have applied the name of alizarin is identical
with his.
   Alizarin has the following properties:—When heated on platinum
foil it melts and burns with a bright flame. When heated in a glass
tube closed at one end it melts and gives yellow fumes, which con
dense on the colder parts of the glass, forming an oil, which soon
congeals to a mass of orange-coloured crystals possessing consider
able lustre, which are unchanged alizarin.      A carbonaceous residue
is usually left in this case, but I have no doubt that by carefully
heating it might be entirely volatilized. Alizarin is slightly soluble
in boiling water. The solution has a yellow colour, but so small is
the quantity dissolved, that the alkali or earth usually contained in
filtering paper is sufficient to render the solution pink, on being fil
tered to separate it from the excess of alizarin. Hence no doubt
arises the statement found in books, that alizarin dissolves in water
with a pink colour. The boiling solution deposits it on cooling in
yellow crystalline flocks. It is soluble in boiling alcohol. The
solution has a deep yellow colour and deposits nothing on cooling,
but on evaporation the alizarin is left in long needle-shaped or pris
matic orange-coloured crystals possessing a considerable lustre. The
colour of the crystals very much resembles that of bichromate of
potash.    Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves alizarin in the cold
with a blood-red colour. It is precipitated from this solution by water
in flocks of a dull orange colour. Dilute nitric acid decomposes it
on boiling with an evolution of nitrous acid. If it is still mixed with
fat, then the fat remains behind after the alizarin has been decom
posed and dissolved by the nitric acid. It is not affected by muriatic
or acetic acid. On passing chlorine into water in which alizarin is
suspended, the colour of the latter is changed to yellow, but it is
seemingly not destroyed. It is decomposed by bichromate of potash
and sulphuric acid. A boiling solution of perchloride or pernitrate
of iron decomposes it with a copious evolution of gas, a pungent smell
resembling that of aldehyde being at the same time given off. The
product of this decomposition I shall describe presently. Chloride
of gold is not reduced by it on boiling, but on the addition of cau
stic potash metallic gold is deposited in shining scales. It is soluble
in caustic and carbonated alkalies with a splendid purple colour, and
is reprecipitated by acids in flocks of a dull orange colour. The
solution in ammonia gives with the chlorides of barium and calcium
precipitates of a splendid purple colour, with sugar of lead a light
purple precipitate. The compound with alumina, produced by in

188 Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder.
troducing hydrate of alumina into an alcoholic solution of alizarin, is
not decomposed by a concentrated solution of caustic potash. The
alcoholic solution gives with acetate of iron a dark purple precipi
tate, with acetate of copper a light purple precipitate, with proto
chloride of tin no precipitate, except on the addition of ammonia,
when a light red precipitate is produced. If alizarin and a piece of
mordanted cloth be introduced into boiling water and the boiling be
continued for some time, the cloth becomes slowly dyed and the
mordants assume the tints peculiar to the so-called madder colours.
The alizarin slowly disappears in the same measure as the cloth
becomes dyed, even though less water had been taken than was suf
ficient to dissolve the whole quantity.     It is evident therefore that
in the process of dyeing, the alizarin, which is dissolved in the first
instance by the boiling water, is taken up by the mordants of the
cloth, that then a fresh quantity is dissolved by the water, which is
again absorbed, and so on, until all the alizarin has combined with
the cloth, or until the mordants can take up no more. Hence the
slowness with which madder dyeing is effected. No doubt can re
main then, I think, that alizarin plays a great part in the production
of madder colours. That it does not produce the whole effect in
dyeing with madder I shall show afterwards.
   The method of obtaining alizarin in a state of purity I have dis
covered so lately, that I have not yet been able to ascertain its com
position and atomic weight.
   Alizaric acid.—At one period of my investigation I imagined that
alizarin and rubiacin might be separated by boiling the mixture with
perchloride of iron, in which case I expected the rubiacinto dissolve
in the solution of the iron salt and the alizarin to remain behind in
combination with oxide of iron.       I was not aware at that time that
alizarin is decomposed by perchloride of iron. Before I had discovered
this, however, I had taken about one hundred weight of madder,
treated it with boiling water, added acid to the fluid, separated the
brown precipitate by filtration, and treated the whole quantity of
precipitate with perchloride of iron.     The fluid was, after the addi
tion of acid and filtration, evaporated to a syrup. After allowing
the syrup to stand for some days, I found it filled with white crystals
bearing a resemblance to oxalic acid. I added water to the syrup,
filtered and washed until the perchloride of iron was removed. I
found that the crystals bore washing with cold water without dis
solving in any considerable degree. I then dissolved them in hot
caustic alkali, filtered to separate some oxide of iron which remained.
behind, and added sulphuric acid to the fluid while still hot. On the
fluid cooling there separated a quantity of long shining white cry
stals, which were separated by filtration and washed. I now found
that they contained no oxalic acid, but that they bore a striking
resemblance to benzoic acid.       Indeed some of the reactions are the
same as those of benzoic acid, and it was only after having submitted
it to an elementary analysis that I became convinced that it was not
benzoic acid. I shall call it alizaric acid. It has the following pro
perties:—
   Its taste is acid. When heated on platinum foil it melts and burns

       Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder. 139
with a smoky flame, leaving no residue. When heated in a tube it
is completely volatilized, without leaving the least residue. The
vapours condense in the colder parts of the tube, forming long white
needles. This sublimate differs however in composition from the
acid itself, and I shall therefore call it pyroalizaric acid. When
heated in a tube with caustic lime it is decomposed and a yellow oil
distils over, having a smell very nearly resembling that of benzin. It
is soluble in boiling water; the solution has an acid taste and reddens
litmus paper. A concentrated boiling solution crystallizes on cool
ing. It is easily soluble in alcohol. Concentrated sulphuric acid
dissolves it in the cold. On boiling the solution no blackening takes
place, and the alizaric acid distils over and crystallizes on the cooler
parts of the tube. It is easily soluble in alkalies. A concentrated
alkaline solution gives crystals on the addition of a strong acid.
 The solution in ammonia gives no precipitates with the chlorides of
barium and calcium.      If to the solution in water chalk be added
until all effervescence has ceased, the solution gives a crystallized
lime salt on evaporation. This lime salt is decomposed on being
strongly heated in a tube, becomes black, and gives an oil with an
aromatic odour which on cooling crystallizes.     The aqueous solution
gives with perchloride of iron a yellowish-white precipitate, with
sugar of lead a white precipitate, with nitrate of silver alone no pre
cipitate, but on the addition of ammonia a white curdy precipitate,
which after some time becomes crystalline. The reaction with sugar
of lead distinguishes it from benzoic acid, which is not thereby
precipitated. Its greater solubility in water and its acid taste are
also distinguishing characteristics; but in most respects it will be
seen that the resemblance between the two is very striking. It is
very probable that this acid is also formed from alizarin by means
of nitric acid, but the small quantity of pure alizarin hitherto at my
disposal has prevented me from ascertaining whether this is the case.
    From some analyses which I have made of this acid, I infer that
its composition is expressed by the formula C1, H, O, and that the
formula for pyro-alizaric acid is C14H, O, in which case alizaric
acid contains one equivalent of hydrogen less and three equivalents
of oxygen more than benzoic acid, which is C, H, O,.
   Rubiacin.—This is the substance which I called alizarin in the
paper which I read on this subject last year. I have since discovered
that it is not identical with Robiquet's alizarin, and have therefore
given it a new name. Rubiacin is most easily obtained in a state
of purity from rubiacic acid. Rubiacin and rubiacic acid are mu
tually convertible, as they only differ from one another by a certain
number of atoms of oxygen. Rubiacin is converted into rubiacic
acid by the action of the persalts of iron, and rubiacic acid may be
reconverted into rubiacin by reducing agents, such as sulphuretted
hydrogen. In order then to obtain pure rubiacin, it is best to take
a solution of pure rubiacate of potash, to which a slight excess of
caustic potash has been added, and to pass sulphuretted hydrogen
gas through the solution for some time.     Chloride of barium is then
added, which produces a dark purple precipitate, consisting of rubi

  140 Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder.
 acin in combination with baryta. This is separated by filtration, and
 washed with cold water until the sulphuret of barium and hyposul
 phite of baryta are removed, and then decomposed with muriatic
 acid, which leaves the rubiacin behind. After being washed with
 water, it is dissolved in boiling alcohol, from which it crystallizes on
 the solution cooling.       It is obtained by these means in beautiful
 yellow crystalline plates and needles, having a strong lustre. The
 colour is a little darker than that of neutral chromate of potash, and
 inclines more to green than to red. If there is a tinge of red in it,
 it is impure, and must be recrystallized. It has the following pro
 perties:—
    It is a little soluble in boiling water, to which it communicates a
 reddish-yellow tinge. The solution deposits it on cooling in shining
 yellow scales. The alcoholic solution has a pure yellow colour,
 without a tinge of red. It is precipitated from its alcoholic solution
 by water in yellow flocks. When heated on platinum foil it melts,
 and burns with a smoky flame, leaving no fixed residue.            When
heated in a tube closed at one end, it melts and gives yellow fumes,
 which condense in the colder parts of the tube in yellow crystals.
 If it be heated gradually at a moderate temperature, it may be almost
 entirely volatilized, leaving only a film of charcoal. Concentrated
 sulphuric acid dissolves it with a yellow colour, and water precipitates
it again in yellow flocks. The solution in sulphuric acid may be
heated to the boiling-point without becoming in the least degree
 black, and water still precipitates it. Concentrated nitric acid slowly
decomposes it on boiling with an evolution of nitrous acid. Dilute
nitric acid dissolves it with a yellow colour on boiling, and on the
solution cooling, it crystallizes out again in shining needles. It
appears therefore that nitric acid does not convert it into rubiacic
acid. Boiling acetic acid dissolves it and deposits it again on cooling
in yellow flocks. It is not affected by chlorine. It dissolves in a
 concentrated solution of perchloride or pernitrate of iron, forming
a dark brownish-red solution, which on the addition of acid becomes
yellow, and deposits yellow flocks. These flocks are no longer un
changed rubiacin, but rubiacic acid.          It is a remarkable circum
stance, that though rubiacic acid differs from rubiacin merely in
containing a few atoms more oxygen, it is not formed from the
latter by the action of nitric acid either dilute or concentrated, but
is easily produced by the agency of the persalts of iron, which seems
to indicate that something besides the influence of oxygen is brought
into play during the process. Rubiacin is soluble in carbonate of
potash with a blood-red colour; the solution deposits after some time
red flocks. It dissolves in caustic alkalies with a reddish-purple colour,
and is reprecipitated by acids in yellow flocks. The solution in am
monia gives with the chlorides of calcium and barium dirty red pre
cipitates. The alcoholic solution gives with an alcoholic solution of
sugar of lead a dark red precipitate. If into the boiling alcoholic
solution hydrate of alumina be introduced, the alumina acquires an
orange colour, and the fluid is deprived of all its rubiacin. The com
pound with alumina thus formed dissolves entirely in caustic potash,

        Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder. 141
forming a purple solution, a characteristic which distinguishes it from
alizarin, the alumina compound of which, as mentioned above, is
insoluble in caustic potash.
    The aqueous and alcoholic solutions of rubiacin communicate a
slight tinge to mordanted cloth, the latter more than the former.
It seems to be incapable itself of dyeing, but in conjunction with
alizarin it assists in the process of madder-dyeing in a very essential
manner, as I shall afterwards show.
    Rubiacic Acid.—I have before described the method of obtaining
this acid through the instrumentality of the persalts of iron. There
is no reason for supposing that it exists as such in the plant. It is
doubtless a product of the oxidation of rubiacin. To obtain it in a
state of purity, pure crystallized rubiacate of potash is dissolved in
water, and muriatic acid or any strong acid is added, which precipi
tates the rubiacic acid in the shape of a yellow powder. It has a pure
 lemon-yellow colour. It cannot be obtained in a crystalline form.
 It is slightly soluble in boiling water, to which it imparts a yellow
 colour. It is also slightly soluble in boiling alcohol with a yellow
 colour. The solution deposits nothing on cooling, but water produces
 in it an iridescent appearance, caused by the deposition of minute
 crystals. When heated on platinum foil it melts and burns with a
bright flame, leaving no residue. When heated in a tube it melts,
 and gives fumes which condense on the colder parts of the tube to
 an oil which solidifies, but does not crystallize. Concentrated sul
phuric acid dissolves it with a yellow colour, and water precipitates
 it again in yellow flocks. On heating the solution in sulphuric acid
 it becomes darker, but no gas is given off; some decomposition seems
 however to have taken place in consequence of the heating, for water
 now produces no precipitate. Concentrated nitric acid dissolves it on
 boiling, and slowly decomposes it with an evolution of nitrous acid.
 It dissolves in a solution of perchloride of iron with a dark reddish
 brown colour, and is reprecipitated by acids in yellow flocks. It
 is not affected by bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid even on
 boiling.
    |. potash salt is the only salt of this acid which I have as yet
 been able to examine. It crystallizes from a hot concentrated solu
 tion in water in needles and prisms of a light brick-red colour. On
 being heated it is instantly decomposed, giving rise to a slight deto
 nation. The aqueous solution has a blood-red colour, but is quite
 transparent. The addition to it of caustic potash causes it to assume
 a beautiful dark purple colour, and a concentrated boiling solution
 does not crystallize on cooling after the addition of caustic potash.
 The watery solution gives with solutions of the earthy and metallic
 salts the following reactions. With chloride of calcium it gives an
 orange-coloured, crystalline precipitate; with chloride of barium a
 yellow precipitate; with sulphate of magnesia a yellow precipitate;
 with alum an orange-coloured precipitate; with protosulphate of iron
 a greenish-gray precipitate; with perchloride of iron a slight reddish
 brown precipitate, which is soluble in the boiling fluid; with sugar
 of lead a red precipitate; with sulphate of copper a dull red preci

pitate; with nitrate of silver a yellow precipitate, which is not changed
 by boiling; with protonitrate of mercury a yellow precipitate; with
perchloride of mercury a crystalline, yellow precipitate; with proto
chloride of tin a dirty yellow precipitate; with perchloride of tin a
light yellow precipitate; with chloride of gold a yellow precipitate,
not changed by boiling the fluid.
   I have analysed rubiacin, rubiacic acid, and rubiacate of potash,
and have obtained results which agree very well with one another.
These analyses give for rubiacin the formula C, H, Olo, for rubiacic
acid C, H, Oz, and for rubiacate of potash C, H, O, + KO. It
therefore appears that rubiacic acid contains seven atoms of oxygen
more than rubiacin, and the facility with which they may be converted
one into the other is easily conceivable.        In rubiacate of potash
two atoms of water existing in rubiacic acid are replaced by one atom
of potash, which is not usually the case with potash salts. I do not,
however, consider these formulae as completely established, since I
was obliged, from want of material, to operate on such extremely
small quantities.
   Rubian-This substance is obtained, as I mentioned above, by
treating the brown precipitate produced by an acid in an extract
of madder with cold water, after having removed the excess of acid.
It has the following properties:—
   In thin layers it is per<U+017F>ectly transparent and of a yellow colour.
When dry it is brittle. It is soluble in water; the solution has an
extremely bitter taste. A concentrated boiling solution forms a jelly
on cooling. It is precipitated from its aqueous solution by all acids,
in yellow flocks. It is decomposed by nitric acid. In the watery
solution lime and baryta water produce red flocculent precipitates,
perchloride of iron a dark reddish-brown colour, but no precipitate,
sugar of lead a brown flocculent precipitate, nitrate of silver a floccu
lent precipitate, corrosive sublimate no precipitate, tincture of galls
and solution of glue no precipitates. The solution imparts a slight
tinge to mordanted cloth, but so slight that this substance cannot
be considered as a colouring matter. The solution deposits nothing
during evaporation at all resembling apothem, and it therefore is
not extractive matter. It dissolves in alcohol with a yellow colour,
and in alkalies with a red colour.      It dissolves in concentrated sul
phuric acid with a red colour; the solution on being heated becomes
black, and gives off sulphurous acid. When heated on platinum
foil it melts, swells up immensely, and burns, leaving some ash.
When heated in a tube it melts and gives yellow fumes, which con
dense and form a crystalline sublimate very much resembling ru
biacin, so that I am induced to think that there is some relation
subsisting between these two substances.
   Pectic Acid.—There can hardly be a doubt, I think, that that part
of the brown precipitate which is insoluble in alcohol, but soluble in
water, is pectic acid, as will be seen from its behaviour towards re
agents, which is as follows:–It is soluble in water; the solution has
a light yellow colour, and reddens litmus paper slightly. In the
watery solution acids produce white flocculent precipitates, alcohol a

       Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder. 143
gelatinous white precipitate, lime and baryta water thick gelatinous
pink precipitates, common salt a flocculent precipitate, nitrate of
potash a flocculent precipitate, sugar of lead a gelatinous reddish pre
cipitate, sulphate of copper a gelatinous greenish precipitate, cor
rosive sublimate no precipitate. On evaporating the watery solution,
the substance separates on the surface of the fluid in the shape of a
pellicle, and is left at last as a brownish extract, which may easily
be detached from the sides of the vessel.         In solutions of caustic
and carbonated alkalies it first swells up, and on heating the fluid it
dissolves with a light red colour, forming slimy fluids, from which
it is precipitated by acids in flocks. Solutions of salts, even of
alkaline salts, produce precipitates in the alkaline solutions. It is
decomposed by boiling concentrated nitric acid. When heated on
platinum foil it burns without melting, leaving a considerable ash.
It seems that the pectic acid from madder retains in combination
with it a portion of colouring matter, from which it cannot be sepa
rated.   Hence the red colour with which it dissolves in alkalies.
   Concerning the two fats which I mentioned above as constituents
of the brown precipitate, I have little to say. They also retain in
combination a quantity of colouring matter, from which I have found
it impossible to separate them. They are both soluble in alcohol,
but one more so than the other.         One of them dissolves with ru
biacin in perchloride of iron, the other not. The former is more
easily fusible than the latter, but both melt below the temperature
of boiling water.
   I shall conclude this paper with some practical deductions which
I have made from the experiments detailed in the preceding.
   Few subjects connected with the arts have raised so much dis
cussion as the nature of the process of madder-dyeing. The inves
tigation of Robiquet on this subject, instead of clearing it up, seemed
only to add to its complexity. He considered his alizarin as the
substance mainly concerned in the production of madder colours.
This has been denied by others, though I think on insufficient
grounds. A remarkable discovery in regard to madder-dyeing, was
the fact that lime is very essential in this process. It was found that
madder, if not grown on calcareous soil, is incapable of producing
fast colours, but that if in this case chalk be added to the madder
during dyeing, or if calcareous water be employed, the desired effect
is produced. This again has given rise to endless discussions. It
was found by Persoz that the minutest quantity of lime added to
alizarin impaired its colouring power during dyeing, and the effect
of lime in madder-dyeing appeared to him an inexplicable mystery.
I will not enter further into the disputes on this subject, but shall
state at once my own views. It seems to me that former investiga
tors have erred in supposing that madder contained only one colour
ing matter, whereas I think I have proved that there are two, per
fectly distinct and definite, alizarin and rubiacin, which perform
distinct functions during the process of dyeing. I have found, as
I stated above, that of the two colouring matters, alizarin and ru
biacin, the former is the only one that is capable of dyeing when

in a free state, and further, that the brown precipitate produced by
acids in a watery extract of madder contains the whole of these two
colouring matters in a free state. If then a piece of mordanted
cloth be dyed with this brown precipitate, after being freed from all
excess of acid, the whole effect is produced by the alizarin contained
in the brown precipitate. If, however, a small quantity of lime,
chalk, soda, or any alkaline base, either caustic or carbonated, be
added to the brown precipitate before dyeing, then its power of
dyeing is very much increased. In order to prove this, I took six
pieces of mordanted cloth, all of the same size. Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were
mordanted in the usual way with acetate of alumina, and Nos. 4, 5
and 6 with acetate of iron. Nos.1 and 4 were dyed with a certain
quantity of the brown precipitate; Nos. 2 and 5 with the same
quantity of the brown precipitate, to which, however, there had
previously been added a very small quantity of lime water; Nos. 3
and 6, lastly, with the same quantity of brown precipitate, and a large
excess of lime water. The dyeing was performed each time in the
same vessel with the same quantity of water, and for the same length
of time.    Now I found at the conclusion that No. 2 exhibited a far
darker, fuller, and more brilliant shade of red than No. 1, and
No. 5 a much more intense purple colour than No. 4, whereas
Nos. 3 and 6 showed hardly any colour at all. Now I can offer only
one explanation of these differences. When a small quantity oflime
is added to the brown precipitate, it combines exclusively with the
rubiacin, or is transferred during the process of dyeing exclusively
to the rubiacin. The first effect of the dyeing is the combination
of the alizarin with the alumina and peroxide of iron of the mor
dants. These compounds then attract and combine with the lime
compound of rubiacin contained in the fluid, by which means a
greater intensity of colour is produced. I repeated this experiment
with the pure colouring matters. I took two pieces of mordanted
cloth of the same size, and dyed the one with pure alizarin, and the
other with the same quantity of alizarin to which rubiacin combined
with lime was added, and I found that the latter was much darker
than the former.      I therefore conclude that madder colours are
always double compounds of alizarin, rubiacin, alumina, and an alka
line base, or of alizarin, rubiacin, peroxide of iron, and an alkaline
base.
   It follows from this that the maximum of tinctorial power in
madder is produced when the alizarin is in a free state, and the ru
biacin is in combination with lime or some alkaline base.         If an
excess of lime be added then the alizarin also combines with it, and
is thus rendered incapable of attaching itself to the alumina and
peroxide of iron of the mordants. A slight excess of lime exists in
the root when grown on a calcareous soil; for if a quantity of mad
der which has dyed as much cloth as it is capable of doing and is
seemingly quite exhausted of colouring matter, be treated with sul
phuric acid, and the acid be carefully removed by washing, it is
found that after being so treated it is capable of again dyeing almost
as much mordanted cloth as it did before, a fact long known in

 practice. I may state in addition, that the colours produced by the
  brown precipitate to which a small quantity of lime has been added,
! resist the action of soap and acids, &c., to which all madder colours
  must be subjected in order to heighten them, much better than if no
flime had been added. I therefore conclude, that though the possi
  bility in general of dyeing with madder is due to alizarin, the solidity
  and brilliance of madder colours must be ascribed to rubiacin.

  Chap. III. Of Astrometry, or the Numerical Erpression of the Appa
                        rent Magnitudes of the Stars.
  THE author commences the present chapter by remarking, that
          “a method of determining the relative magnitudes of the fixed
  stars, that is, of assigning to each, at a given epoch, a number ex
 pressing on a certain scale the intensity of its light, has long been
  and still remains a desideratum in astronomy.” The inquiry is beset
  with numerous and great difficulties, which have only been partially
  met by any of the contrivances which have been applied to the pur
  pose. Some of the difficulties, indeed, would seem to be insuperable;
  for instance those which arise from a diversity of colour in the light
  of the stars, since it appears hardly possible to assign any precise
  meaning to the proportion of total brightness of two stars differing
  sensibly in colour. Instances indeed occur where there would be no
  hesitation in assigning the order of precedence; but there are many
 other cases in which different observers would probably always come
  to opposite conclusions; and “nothing short of a separate and inde
 pendent estimation of the total amount of the red, the yellow, and
 the blue rays in the spectrum of each star would suffice for the reso
 lution of the problem of astrometry in the strictness of its nume
  rical acceptation; and this the actual state of optical science leaves
 us destitute of the means even of attempting with the slightest
  prospect of success.” We must therefore for the present, so far at
  least as stars differing in colour are concerned, rest contented with
 a somewhat rude and coarse approximation in assigning numerically
  their places on a photometric scale; and even with respect to those
  which offer no marked peculiarity of colour, the results obtained by
 the application of instrumental methods are in many instances so
 strongly at variance with the plain judgement of the unaided eye, that
  little is to be hoped for from such methods. It is very important,
 however, to establish, if possible, by direct and extensive observa
 tions, a scale of magnitudes which shall be applicable, with some
     Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 33. No. 220. Aug. 1848.               L

 reasonable degree of exactness, to the actual state of the heavens, so
 as to serve as a record to future ages sufficiently correct to ensure the
 detection of changes “such as there is abundant reason to believe a
 great many stars have undergone within the period of astronomical
 history.”   The subject was long ago urged on the attention of astro
 nomers by Sir William Herschel, in his papers on the comparative
 brightness of the fixed stars published in the Philosophical Transac
 tions; and if anything could add force to his arguments, it would be
 the extraordinary phaenomena presented by the star m Argüs already
 mentioned, and of variable stars in general.
    Sir John states, that after having made trial of various instru
 mental contrivances, he is disposed to rely mainly, for the formation
 of a real scale of magnitudes, on the unassisted judgement of the
 naked eye. The method which he adopted, and calls the method of
 sequences, is an extension of Sir William Herschel's method of naked
 eye comparisons, so modified as to afford a means of educing from
 it a numerical scale of values of the magnitudes compared. Sir
 William Herschel's object in forming his catalogues of comparative
 brightness, was to identify the lustre of each star so as to enable a
 future observer to satisfy himself whether any change had taken
 place; and to this end each star was compared with one or at most
 two others judged to be equal to it (or very nearly so), so as to
 establish a system of binary or ternary sequences or equalities,
 Supposing this to be done for every visible star, it is clear that no
 change could take place without being detected. For the purpose
 proposed by Sir John, namely, the formation of a numerical scale of
 magnitudes, it was necessary to establish more extended sequences,
 in each of which a considerable interval of the scale should be in
 cluded ; and when many such sequences were accumulated, to de
vise a means of combining them into general sequences, including
all the stars observed. His method was, generally, as follows:—
    “Choosing perfectly clear nights (which for this purpose are quite
indispensable), a succession of stars was picked out by actual inspec
tion of the heavens from the largest above the horizon down to some
of considerably inferior magnitude, and noted down in a list, in a
vertical column—leaving blank intervals more or less considerable,
according as the steps of the skeleton scale so picked out were wider
or closer—but taking care that between the skeleton stars arranged
seriatim, there should always be an unequivocal descending step of
apparent lustre. The business of the night, then, was to fill in as
far as practicable the steps of this scale into an unbroken chain of
downward gradation, placing each newly-added star by actual
judgement and comparison with its immediate neighbours, in its
proper order, until the scale became so gradual in its declension that
it was no longer possible to insert fresh stars with certainty between
its members, in which case they were set down as equal to some of
those already noted down.”—P. 306.
   The charts referred to during the observations were those of Bode's
Atlas, or working copies made from them.            In consequence the
nomenclature was Bode's, which, faulty as it is, it was then necessary

                   Notices respecting New Books.                   147
to tolerate. On the publication of the Catalogue of the British
Association, in which a systematic reformation of sidereal nomencla
ture was carried out, it became a matter of consideration whether the
names used in the observed sequences should be altered to correspond
with that Catalogue; but as it was found that this could not be
done without causing great confusion, the nomenclature of Bode is
retained. Sir John observes that he regrets this the less, because
an entire remodelling of the whole system of constellations, both
northern and southern, is now necessary for this especial purpose—
without which the progress of this department of astronomy will of
necessity be slow and uncertain.
   The sequences or comparisons of apparent magnitude are given at
length. Their number is forty-six. They were observed at Feld
hausen between July 16, 1835, and Feb. 25, 1838, and on board the
H.E.I. Company's ship Windsor, at sea, from March 28 to April 15,
1838. The number of stars included in each sequence is very
unequal, but may be stated as varying from twenty or thirty to
seventy or eighty.
   The sequences observed in the manner above described formed, as
it were, the raw material out of which a regular progression of mag
nitudes was to be elaborated.     The author remarks that “if obser
vations of this nature could be made with perfect exactness, all
sequences in which the same stars occur should present them in the
same order of succession, in so far as it may not have been disturbed
by a real variability of the stars themselves. But as this is very far
indeed from being the case, owing to the many disturbing influences,
and the slight differences of magnitude between particular stars which
have to be discriminated, it is necessary to fix upon some criterion
by which the most probable order of arrangement can be discovered
among a number of discordant ones. Such a criterion is supplied
by an enumeration of cases.” Thus if two stars, A and B, occur in
a certain number of sequences, and A is set down sometimes as su
perior, sometimes as inferior to B, then the order of their arrange
ment will be determined by placing the one first which has been so
placed the greatest number of times in the observed sequences.
Again, if there be three stars, A, B, C, and the direct comparisons
of B and C leave it doubtful which of those two is superior, and it be
found on a revision of all the observations that A has been set down
as decidedly superior to C but not to B, then there will be reason
for placing B before C. It is needless to go into further details; the
general method of proceeding will be obvious.
   It might be supposed, both from the uncertainty which in a great
number of cases must attend the judgement formed from a naked
eye comparison, and the numerous discrepancies which occur in the
recorded observations, that the final result must be open to very con
siderable doubt. This, however, does not seem to be by any means
the case; on the contrary, to one who has not been in the habit of
making such comparisons, the precision will appear to be really
astonishing. “It might appear that so much is left to judgement
in such cases, as to induce uncertainty in the final results. But, in

fact, it is only in the case of stars which really are nearly equal that
doubts on such points ever arise. Push observation and reasoning
to what extent we will, there will always be shades of difference too
slight for certain discrimination; and practically speaking, I am dis
posed (from my experience in these reductions) to consider a misar
rangement to the extent of a tenth of a magnitude in one of our cor
rected sequences, arising from such causes of uncertainty, as a very
unlikely occurrence.”—P. 327.
   The different steps of the process of arrangement are explained at
considerable length; the author treating, 1st, “ of the formation of
corrected sequences by the collation of several observed sequences,
and of the elimination of discordant and contradictory observations;”
 2nd, “of the consilience of sequences, or the formation of normal
 sequences by the partial or entire combination of several corrected
ones, and of the assignment of a series of provisional magnitudes to
serve as a basis for those to be finally adopted; ” and 3rd, “ of the
 complete interpolation of the observed sequences, the conclusion of an
independent numerical result from each observation of each star, and
 the assemblage of their results for the final determination of its mag
 nitude.” The whole number of stars included in the final arrange
 ment, and to which magnitudes have now for the first time been
 assigned upon a systematic plan, is 452,-a number sufficiently
 considerable to serve as a fair specimen of the practical application
 of the method. The following intimation will be received with in
 terest:—“Since my return to England I have been, and still am,
 engaged in extending its application to the northern stars with some
perseverance, and I venture to hope not without some corresponding
degree of success. Sixty-one sequences, in addition to those above
recorded, have been observed and partially reduced, and where com
 pletely so, and brought into comparability with the southern se
 quences by means of the intertropical stars common to both series,
 will afford a uniform system of astrometrical nomenclature, on which
 I have every reason to believe considerable reliance may be placed.
 This work, however, besides that it is as yet incomplete, cannot pro
 perly find its place in a volume of Southern Observations.”—P.340.
    A comparison of the magnitudes finally deduced by this process
 with those which were provisionally assumed, gives the following
 results:—out of 118 stars, the cases of exact agreement are 22; of
 disagreement under one-twentieth of a magnitude, 64; of disagree
 ment above a twentieth but under a tenth, 26; of a tenth but under
 an eighth, 6. These results completely bear out the statement made
 above as to the precision with which the relative brightness of stars
 can be determined by the judgement of the naked eye.
    One of the principal uses of the determination of relative magni
 tudes, as has been already stated, is the means it gives of ascertain
 ing the existence of variable stars, a class of objects probably more
 numerous than has been suspected.        Several of those included in
 the sequences are marked as variable, or possibly so, and a Hydrae
 and 3 Ursae Minoris are instanced as two of the most remarkable.
 Sir John concludes some interesting remarks on this subject with

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   149
the following observations, which indicate a probability that the sun
itself belongs to the class of variable stars.
   “Ignorant as we are, however, both of the cause of solar and
stellar light, and of the conditions which may influence its amount
at different times, the law of regular periodicity is one which ought
not to be too hastily generalised, and at all events there is enough
of slow and gradual change of lustre in many stars, since the earlier
ages of astronomy, to refute all a priori assumption as to the possible
length of the cycle of variation of any particular star. The subject
is one of the utmost physical interest. The grand phaenomena of
geology afford, as it appears to me, the highest presumptive evidence
of changes in the general climate of the globe.      I cannot otherwise
understand alternations of heat and cold so extensive as at one epoch
to have clothed high northern latitudes with a more than tropical
luxuriance of vegetation; at another to have buried vast tracts of
middle Europe, now enjoying a genial climate, and smiling with fer
tility, under a glacier crust of enormous thickness. Such changes
seem to point to some cause more powerful than the mere local dis
tribution of land and water (according to Mr. Lyell's views) can well
be supposed to have been. In the slow secular variations of our
supply of light and heat from the sun, which in the immensity of
time past may have gone to any extent, and succeeded each other in
any order, without violating the analogy of sidereal phaenomena
which we know to have taken place, we have a cause, not indeed
established as a fact, but readily admissible as something beyond a
bare possibility,fully adequate to the utmost requirements of geology*.
A change of half a magnitude in the lustre of the sun, regarded
as a fixed star, spread over successive geological epochs, now pro
gressive, now receding, now stationary, according to the evidence of
warmer or colder general temperature which geological research has
disclosed, or may hereafter reveal,—is what no astronomer would
now hesitate to admit as in itself a perfectly reasonable and not im
probable supposition. Such a supposition has assuredly far less of
extravagance about it than the idea that the sun, by its own proper
motion, may, in indefinite ages past, have traversed regions so
crowded with stars as to affect the climate of our planet by the in
fluence of their radiation.    Nor can it be objected that the character
of a vera causa is wanting in such an hypothesis.        Of the exciting
cause of the radiant emanations from the sun and stars we know
nothing. It may consist, for aught we can tell, in vast currents of
electricity traversing space (according to cosmical laws), and which,
meeting in the higher regions of their atmospheres with matter pro
perly attenuated, and otherwise disposed to electric phosphorescence,
may render such matter radiant, after the manner of our own aurora
borealis, under the influence of terrestrial electric streams.     Or it
   * “Many phaenomena in natural history seem to point out some past
changes in our climates. Perhaps the easiest way of accounting for them
may be to surmise that our sun has formerly been sometimes more and
sometimes less bright than it is at present.”—W. Herschel on the Changes
that happen to the Fixed Stars. Phil. Trans., 1796, p. 186.

may result from actual combustion going on in the higher regions of
their atmospheres, the elements of which, so united, may be in a
constant course of separation and restoration to their actual state of
mutual combustibility, by vital processes of extreme activity going
on at their habitable surfaces, analogous to that by which vegetation
on our earth separates carbonic acid (a product of combustion) into
its elements, and so restores their combustibility. With specific
hypotheses as to the causes of solar and sidereal light we have how
ever no concern. It suffices that they must have a cause, and that
this cause, inscrutable as it may be, does in several cases, and there
fore may, in one more, determine the production of phaenomena of
the kind in question.”—P. 352.
    The last part of the chapter is devoted to an account of some
attempts to compare the intensities of light of the stars one with
another by the intervention of the moon, by the aid of an astro
meter, or instrument adapted to that purpose. “The process by
which these comparisons were made consists in deflecting the light
of the moon by total internal reflexion at the base of a prism, so as
 to emerge in a direction nearly coincident with that of the undeflected
light of one of the stars to be compared. It is then received upon
 a lens of short focus, by which an image of the sun is formed, which,
 viewed at a considerable distance by an observer placed in or near
the axis of the lens, will appear to him as a star. This artificial star
 is then to be approached to or removed from the eye until its light
 is judged to be exactly equal to the light of the real star, which,
lying in nearly the same direction from the observer, will be seen
 side by side with the artificial one with the same eye, or with both
 eyes at once, without the aid of a telescope in the ordinary mode of
 natural vision. The distance from the eye to the focus of the lens
 being then measured, the prism and lens are to be so placed as to
 form another similar artificial star, in a direction nearly coincident
 with that of the other star under comparison; and another equalisa
 tion being made, and distance measured, it is obvious that the intensi
 ties of the lights of the two stars, or at least their effects on the retina,
 under the circumstances of comparison, will be to each other in the
 inverse ratio of the squares of the distances so measured respectively.
 For no light being lost by total internal reflexion at the base of a
 prism, and the light lost at the ingress and egress of the moon's rays
 into and out of the prism, being at such moderate angles of incidence
 as it is ever necessary to employ in such comparisons, very nearly,
indeed, in an invariable ratio to the total incident light, the artificial
 star, or lunar image, will be equally luminous in both cases, and its
 effect on the eye will therefore be in the ratio of its apparent angular
 diameter, or inversely as the square of its distance.”—P. 353.
    The application of the principle explained in the above extract is
 effected by a very simple construction. An upright pole about 20
 feet high, firmly fixed in the ground as a standard, a staff consisting
 of a cylindrical rod about 23 inches in diameter and 12 feet long,
 and a slider consisting of a rectangular piece of deal about 15 inches
 long and 2% inches broad, form its principal parts. The slider

                     Notices respecting New Books.                     151
 carries the prism and lens, and the requisite motion is given by
 simple contrivances, into the details of which it is unnecessary
 to enter. In using the instrument, a star must be chosen not more
 than 102° 43', nor less than 60° or 70° from the moon, which ought
 not to be too near the full. The staff being first directed to the star
 is turned on its axis till the prism is brought into the proper position;
 and when the proper angle of reflexion is attained, the artificial star
 (or moon) is seen side by side with the real star under comparison.
 The slider is then approached to or removed from the eye, along the
 staff, until a perfect equality between the real and artificial star is
 obtained, when the distance of the slider from the eye is measured
 by means of a measuring-tape connected with the apparatus. A
 sufficient number of equalisations ought to be made to destroy the
 numerous sources of illusion to which the judgement of equality is
 subject, and give confidence in a mean of the readings. This done,
 the other star is treated in the same manner.
    Sir John states that the actual comparisons made with the instru
 ment were neither very numerous nor performed under the most fa
 vourable circumstances. In several of them the moon was nearly full;
 and though he had expected this to influence the results, he was by
 no means prepared for the enormous extent of that influence. In the
 original conception of the process, he had hoped that the image of
the moon, when reduced to that of a mean full moon, by allowing
for the phase and apparent diameter, would afford a definite standard
 of light; but the effect of the illumination of the sky destroys all
 possibility of obtaining absolute results in this manner, and renders
 it necessary to regard them as comparable only with those taken on
 the same night and under the same circumstances. All these diffi
 culties and objections, he adds, might be got over by using Jupiter
 instead of the moon as a standard luminary; but this idea did not
 occur to him when it might have been serviceable. He refers also
 to an instrument constructed on the same principle,_that is to say,
 in which a prism is made use of to deflect the light of a standard
 luminary by total reflexion at its base, invented by M. Steinheil,
 and communicated to the Gottingen Academy in 1835; but he had
 no knowledge of the existence of M. Steinheil's memoir till his return
 to Europe in 1838.
    The observations with the astrometer were made in the year 1836
 on nineteen different days, between March 28 and December 26. In
 each case the numerical result is obtained from the following formula:
 “Let A represent the moon's augmented semidiameter, in seconds, at

   In order to prepare the observations for reduction, all the measures
of each star taken on the same night must be collected, and the mean
taken. The results being then computed according to the formula
M+-dº, the influence exercised on the comparisons by the illumina
tion of the general surface of the sky on which the stars are seen
projected, becomes at once apparent on comparing the results for the
same star obtained from observations on different nights. Taking a
Centauri, for example, some of the results were as follows:–0'443,
0.259, 0-156, 0-505, 0.838, &c. “Such enormous differences show
clearly, that, as a formula of reduction, the above is utterly inappli
cable. Indeed, at first sight, it would almost appear from this that
absolutely no conclusion can be drawn from the observations or the
method in question. This, however, is very far from being a correct
view of the subject, since, if instead of comparing the results in this
manner for a single star, we take any two stars which occur together
in more than one series, and compare, not the absolute numbers result
ing from the formula in question, but the ratios of those numbers,
we shall find, not, indeed, a precise, but, with a few exceptions (such
as might be expected in the first trials of a new method) areasonably
good accordance.”—P. 363.                               -
   Each pair of stars occurring in the different series being thus
compared, and the mean of the results taken, a set of provisional or
temporary values is obtained, expressing the intrinsic light of each
star in a scale in which a Centauri is represented by 1. But these
numbers, though a process of considerable labour has already been
employed in obtaining them, are destined merely to afford a handle
for a complete and impartial reduction of the whole, which is accom
plished as follows:—Taking H--dº for the expression of the light of
the compared star, p. will be a coefficient which may be regarded
as constant throughout any single series.       The immediate object,
then, is to assign for each series such a value of p as shall give con
sistent results when the individual values of p--dº for any one star
deduced from different series are compared together. Now, calling
the provisional values obtained as described above S, S', S', &c.,
and denoting by d, d", d", &c. the distances of equalization of any
number of the stars observed in any series, we ought to have for that
series
                     p=Sdº=S'd'8–S"d"*=&c.
But this being only approximately true, a mean value of u is deter
mined for the series in question by taking a mean of all these values,
and with the mean value thus obtained the values of S, S', S', &c.
are recomputed by the formula S=p--dº for each star, and for every
series in which it occurs. In this manner, as many different values
are found for each star as there are series into which it enters, and
the means of these values being again taken, the results are finally
reduced so as to bring them again to a scale in which a Centauri is
(as originally proposed) represented by 1'000. By these successive

the results of the photometric determination of the comparative in
tensities of the light of sixty-nine stars. The following are a few

    Sir John then enters into a comparison of the values of the coeffi
cient p, computed in the manner above explained, with those of M,
which represents theabsolute quantity of moonlight, and on which the
former necessarily depend as their principal argument. The conclusion
at which he arrives is, that the value of p is as the cube of the quantity
of moonlight.       He also deduces this inference, namely, that “within
the limits of the experiments the effective impression of a star on the
retina is inversely as the square of the illumination of the ground of
the sky on which it is seen projected.”
   The present chapter concludes with a comparison of the photo
metric results with the conventional scale of naked eye magnitudes
adopted in the sequences.         For this purpose the two series of values
 (representing the conventional magnitudes on the one hand and the
 light on the other) are projected as the abscissa and ordinates of an
 interpolating curve; then, calling a the conventional magnitude of
 any star in both series, and y its light, the values of y corresponding
 to every decimal of a magnitude from w- 1 to was 6 are read off
 from the curve. This curve is found to approach very nearly to a
 cubic hyperbola, the equation of which is accordingly assumed; and
 the two constants which enter into the equation are determined from
 particular values of w. Having thus an equation between the mag
 nitude and the light, the magnitudes of the several stars whose light
 has been determined by the photometric observations are computed,
 and the resulting values compared with those assigned by the se
 quence observations.         A table is given, showing the magnitudes, as
 determined by both methods, of sixty-eight stars; but of these, the
 five largest,-Sirius, Canopus, a Centauri, Arcturus, Lyra—should
 be excluded from the comparison, the sequence magnitudes assigned
 to them being purely arbitrary. Out of the remaining sixty-three
 there are eighteen in which the disagreement of the assigned values
 exceeds one-fifth of a magnitude (a quantity respecting which, it is
 observed, the judgement of a practised eye cannot be deceived); but
 on the other hand there are forty in respect of which the results agree
 within an eighth of a magnitude. In respect of the cases of consi
 derable discordance, it is to be remarked, however, that in a majority
 of them the photometric determination rests on a single night's ob
 servation, and not unfrequently on a single equalisation. Subjoined

               “The Messrs. Chambers's Edition of Euclid.”
    The Messrs. Chambers have published extensively, under the above
 title, an “advertisement” in reply to the strictures which were made
 in the Philosophical Magazine for June, upon Mr. A. Bell's edition
 of the Elements of Euclid.
    Instead, however, of attempting to show that my censures were
 either false or unjust, or even more severe than the case actually de
 manded, they have attempted to divert public attention from those
 censures upon the work itself, by making it appear that it was not
 originally published in contemplation of its being adopted by the
 Committee of Council ' What answer this may be to the charge of
 a corrupted tert and geometrically-absurd interpolations, I leave to
 themselves to explain in a future advertisement: but I have to say,
 once for all, that till they offer some show of justification of their
work against these charges, I cannot lend myself to the kind of bye
play in which they are attempting to entangle me.
    As to the insinuation respecting the “animus ” of the Review
 (obviously only another form for the imputation of unworthy motives),
 I can only say that I have always given the Messrs. Chambers credit
for a degree of ingenuousness and discretion which could not stoop
to so common-place an artifice. But it seems I misjudged them.
I had no motives but those which I plainly avowed, and no personal
interests whatever to serve. As a geometer, however, I could not
stand by and see Geometry so mangled and mutilated as in the work
which the Messrs. Chambers had published (and see it also taken
under the patronage of the Government, and enforced upon us at
the public expense), without attempting to prove that their work
had no claims to such a distinction ; and as far as yet appears, my
proofs are unassailable on any legitimate principle. It will be time
enough for me to think of justifying my strictures when they are
met by argument, instead of being parried by merely irrelevant state
ments.

May 18,   “ON      a new case of the Interference of Light.”          By
 1848.           the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S. &c., Savilian
Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
  The principal experiment exhibiting the newly-observed case of
interference described by the author, is the following: into a hollow
prism or trough containing oil of Sassafras, anise, cassia, &c., a plate
of glass is dipped so as to intercept the light passing through the
upper or thicker half of the prism, and leave the lower half clear:
the spectrum of a line of light or narrow slit, is then immediately
seen to be covered with dark bands parallel to the slit or edge of the
   Some substances, as oil of turpentine, water, &c., give no bands
pr1Srn.
with this arrangement, but will give them, if a complementary
arrangement be adopted, viz. by placing a narrow slip of glass at
the bottom of the prism, or so as to intercept the light passing
through the thinner half.
   The production of the bands in general, and the reason of the dif
ference existing in the cases referred to, are fully accounted for on the
theory of waves and interference: whence the following formula is
deduced, giving the number of bands (n), when u, and p, the in
dices for any ray for the plate and for the medium, are known, of
which X is the wave length; and taking these quantities for any two
rays (1) and (2) of the spectrum, r being the thickness of the plate,
we have the number of bands between them expressed by
                n={(**)-(***).}.
The numbers thus calculated agree with observation for many
media. The distinction of the two cases alluded to depends on
whether n result positive or negative; that is, on the relative values
of the indices; also agreeing with observation.
   If doubly refracting media are used as plates, two sets of bands
are seen superimposed, which are easily shown to be due to the or
dinary and extraordinary rays respectively. But for some of these
crystals the data are as yet insufficient to give more than a general
accordance with theory.
   The method might be applied practically for determining the in
dices of many substances to which the ordinary method is inapplica
ble from the impossibility of forming them into prisms: n will also
exhibit palpably the most insensible degree of double refraction, and
may thus become useful to the mineralogist.
   There is a close analogy between these phenomena and those
observed by Baron von Wrede, and by Sir D. Brewster and Mr.
Fox Talbot, of which Mr. Airy has given a theory. A similar
theory is necessary for explaining some of the more minute details

   “On the Meteorology of the Lake District of Cumberland and
Westmoreland.” By John Fletcher Miller, Esq. Communicated by
Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
   The author has devoted nearly four years to the investigation of
the quantities of rain falling in the lake districts of Cumberland and
Westmoreland; and he commenced, two years ago, a set of experi
ments specially directed to ascertain the amount of rain deposited at
great elevations above the sea, such as the summits of our highest
English mountains. As the investigation proceeded, some remarka
ble results were obtained, which coming to the knowledge of the
Royal Society early in last year (1847), the Council contributed a
sum of money from the Donation Fund towards the current expenses
attending this inquiry, of which the results are given in the present
communication, comprising extensive tables of observations relative
to the quantity of rain in different situations within the above period
of time.
   May 25.—“On the structure of the Jaws and Teeth of the
Iguanodon.”      By Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.,
Vice-President of the Geological Society, &c.
   The recent discovery of the right dentary bone of the lower jaw
of an adult Iguanodon with teeth, having enabled the author, with
the aid afforded by other specimens, to determine the structure of the
maxillary organs of that gigantic herbivorous reptile, the result of
his investigations are embodied in the present communication.
   The first memoir of the author on the teeth of the Iguanodon was
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1825; but owing
to the fragmentary and water-worn condition in which the fossil re
mains of terrestrial vertebrated animals occur in fluviatile deposits,
in consequence of these strata consisting of materials transported from
far-distant lands, nearly a quarter of a century elapsed before any
portion of the jaw with teeth was discovered.
   The most important of the fossils described in this memoir con
sists of the anterior part of the right side of the lower jaw, which was
discovered a few weeks since, in a quarry in Tilgate Forest, by Capt.
Lambart Brickenden, F.G.S., who with great liberality placed it at
the disposal of the author as the original investigator of the fossils
of the Wealden.
   This dentary bone, which is eighteen inches long, is perfect in the
anterior part, but is broken at the hinder extremity, and retains five
or six inches of the coronoid bone: the length of the jaw to which it
belonged is estimated at four feet. It contains two successional teeth
in place, the fang of a third, and the alveoli or sockets for eighteen
or nineteen mature molars; the entire number of teeth on each side
the lower jaw was about twenty.
   The mature teeth, which, when abraded by use in mastication,
resemble the worn molars of herbivorous mammalia, appear to have

                             Royal Society.                         157
been arranged in a close-set series. The lower teeth had their ena
melled striated face parallel with the alveolar plate, and fronting the
inside of the mouth; but the upper were placed in a reverse position,
that is, with the enamelled facet of the crown external; and the
teeth in the upper and lower jaws were arranged subalternate or in
termediate in relation to each other, as is the case in the ruminants.
    But a still more remarkable character presented by this specimen
is the peculiar construction of the anterior part of the lower jaw,
which forms the symphysis. This process, instead of being con
tinued round the front of the mouth and beset with teeth, as in all
other saurians, is edentulous, and extends into a procumbent scoop
like expansion, very analogous to the symphysial portion of the
lower jaw in the Sloths, and especially to that of the colossal extinct
Edentata—the Mylodons. Along the external surface of this dentary
 bone there is a row of very large vascular foramina; and the sym
 physis also is perforated with numerous openings for the passage of
 blood-vessels and nerves sent off from the great dental canal. The
 unusual number and magnitude of these foramina indicate a great
 development of the integuments and soft parts with which the bone
 was invested, and also the large size of the under lip.
    The upper jaw, of which a considerable portion discovered by the
 author is in the British Museum, confirms the inferences deduced
 from the teeth and dentary bone of the lower maxilla.
     The author, with the able assistance of Dr.A.G. Melville, instituted
 a comparison between all the teeth of the Iguanodon to which he could
 obtain access, and those of recent saurians; and the result of the
 investigation is detailed. The new light shed on the structure and
 functions of the dental organs, confirms, in every essential particular,
 the inferences deduced by the author from the detached teeth alone,
 in his memoir of 1825; and it also reveals an extraordinary devia
 tion from all known types of reptilian organization, and which could
 not have been predicated; namely, that this colossal reptile, which
  equalled in bulk the gigantic Edentata of South America, and like
  them was destined to obtain support from comminuted vegetable sub
  stances, was also furnished with a large prehensile tongue and fleshy
  lips, to serve as instruments for seizing and cropping the foliage and
  branches of trees; while the arrangement of the teeth as in the ru
  minants, and their internal structure, which resembles that of the
  molars of the Sloth tribe in the vascularity of the dentine, indicate
  adaptations for the same purpose.
     Among the physiological phaenomena revealed by Palaeonto
  logy, there is not a more remarkable one than this modification
  of the type of organization peculiar to the class of reptiles, to meet
  the conditions required by the economy of a lizard placed under
  similar physical relations, and destined to effect the same general
  purpose in the scheme of nature, as the colossal Edentata of former
  ages, and the large herbivorous mammalia of our own times.
     From the facts detailed, the author is led to consider the specimen
   described in his memoir of 1841, as being probably the lower jaw of a
   young Iguanodon (but the true nature of which, from the absence of

 158                         Royal Society.
 the crowns of the teeth, was doubtful) belonging to the same family,
but referable to a distinct genus or subgenus; and he proposes the
name of Regnosaurus Northamptoni for that remarkable fossil saurian.
The communication was illustrated by several drawings of the speci
 mens described.
    “An Account of some Observations made on the Depth of Rain
 which falls in the same Localities at different altitudes in the hilly
 districts of Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire.” By S. C. Homer
 sham, C.E. Communicated by George Newport, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
    The author states, that having been present at a meeting of the
 Royal Society when a paper was read on the Meteorology of the
 Lake districts of Westmoreland and Cumberland, by J. Miller, Esq.
 of Kendal, in which it was stated that the quantity of rain falling in
 mountainous districts appears to increase from the valley upwards, to
 the altitude of about 2000 feet, and then rapidly to decrease, he
wishes to lay before the Royal Society the results of his own obser
vations, which lead him to a different conclusion. After stating that
he had been at some trouble to analyse Mr. Miller's observations
which have been communicated to him by that gentleman, he is of
opinion that they do not warrant the conclusion deduced from them,
and are also at variance with the recorded observations of Daines
Barrington, Dr. Dalton, Professor Daniell and others, as well as those
of Capt. Lefroy and Col. Sabine.
   The author then shows from observations very carefully made in
Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire, from January 1846 to March
1848, that more rain falls at the bottom than at the tops of hills of
a less elevation than 2000 feet in the same locality, and that the
quantity diminishes in a ratio almost precisely corresponding to the
height. The details are given in tables of monthly observations,
made near Whaley and Congleton in Cheshire, and Chapel-en-le
frith in Derbyshire, and also of other observations made for the Cor
poration of Liverpool at Rivington and in the valley of Roddlesworth
near Preston in Lancashire, which have been communicated to him.
The whole of these observations, carefully analysed and compared,
have led the author to a conclusion opposite to that arrived at by
Mr. Miller.
   The author then proceeds to show that the details of Mr. Miller's
own observations are in accordance with his, and that they fully bear
out his views, and not those of that gentleman. Some apparent dis
crepancies in the results are pointed out and their cause explained
by reference to peculiarities in the localities in which the observa
tions were made, as shown by reference to a map accompanying this
paper, and to the details given by Mr. Miller; so that the observa
tions of this gentleman, when examined with reference to locality,
fully confirm those of the author and of the authorities he has quoted,
and establish the proposition, that as a general law, the quantity of
rain deposited in the valleys and at the bottoms of hills is greater than
in more elevated situations in the same locality.

    Account of the Annular Eclipse of the 9th November, 1847. By
 Major Lysaght.
   Hingolee, at which station the following observations were made,
is situated in lat. 19° 43' 12", long. 77° 7' 5" E. The former may
 be depended upon as correct, but the latter is open to correction.
   The weather was very unpromising, and heavy clouds showed
 themselves in the forenoon; but a short time previous to the com
 mencement of the eclipse they cleared off towards the western horizon,
 and left the required part of the heavens beautifully clear and serene,
 with a light wind.
   The observations were made with a Dollond’s 33-foot refractor,
 2:7 inches aperture and power 25, with a coloured glass, which gave
 the sun a greenish-yellow colour.   A thermometer was placed against
a brick wall with the sun shining directly on its bulb, and a baro
meter and a spirit thermometer in the shade of an open verandah :
the times were noted by an assistant with a chronometer, adjusted
to mean time by an observation of the sun in the morning.
   The day was exceedingly hot for the season of the year, the ex
posed thermometer standing at 129°5 a short time before the com
mencement of the eclipse, but it fell immediately after the time of first
contact was given to 92°2.
   Before the commencement of the eclipse the spots on the sun
appeared fainter than usual, or than I had observed them a day or
two before with a smaller telescope; but the faculae were very bright.
As the moon advanced over the sun, the spots became much darker
and well-defined, and round the largest (near the centre) was a dark
fine ring, conforming to the shape of the spot, the intervening space
being of the same dull colour as the rest of the sun.
   The eye having been withdrawn for a little time from the telescope,
the ea'act time of first contact was lost by a few seconds.
   On nearing the solar spots, the moon, which up to this period
was well-defined, became undulating, and this undulation increased
until the annulus was about to form, when the lower limb again
became steady and well-defined, and the upper, first much serrated,
and then hillocky. At first this was attributed to the lunar moun
tains, but except in two or three places they all subsided. Imme
diately before the formation of the annulus, and on the western edge,
a dark line was seen to connect the limbs of the sun and moon, and
gave the idea of a post raised gradually from behind on one of the
hillocks, and extending to the sun's limb. This was followed by
another: both remained a few seconds, but the manner of their dis
appearance was not particularly observed; then appeared a thin
thread of light, which was noted as the formation of the annulus.
   As the ring increased in breadth, the southern limb of the moon
became pinnacled, and an instantaneous blaze of light was seen,
which had more the appearance of a fire suddenly breaking out on a
windy night in dry grass on the summit of a jungly hill (as often

160                   Royal Astronomical Society.
seen in this country), than of exploded gunpowder, or anything else
I can liken it to.
   The moon's limb again became smooth, leaving a hillock on the
eastern side, which, as she advanced, gradually elongated, and be
came pointed, when another post was erected like the former two,
but more slowly (so much so that I was nearly turning my eye in
another direction, not expecting to see the phaenomenon), and re
mained somewhat longer; this broke in the centre, and the two parts
shrunk slowly into the limbs of the sun and moon.
   The clouds which had at the commencement settled down to the
western horizon, had again risen, and now approached, and I gave
up the hopes of seeing the breaking of the annulus, or end of the
eclipse.
   There was not much apparent diminution of light during the ex
istence of the annulus, nor were any stars visible, but everything had
a light blue colour.
   At 3" 7" P.M. gunpowder was ignited in about two minutes with
a lens of three inches diameter; but at 3h 23m P.M. it could not be
exploded, although the lens was held over it for seven minutes, and
care was previously taken to dry the powder.

    Remarkable Appearances during the total Eclipse of the Moon on
 March 19, 1848.
   Extract of a letter from Mr. Forster, Bruges.
    “I wish to call your attention to the fact which I have clearly
 ascertained, that during the whole of the late lunar eclipse of March 19,
the shaded surface presented a luminosity quite unusual, probably
 about three times the intensity of the mean illumination ofan eclipsed
 lunar disc. The light was of a deep red colour. During the totality
 of the eclipse, the light and dark places on the face of the moon
 could be almost as well made out as in an ordinary dull moonlight
night, and the deep red colour, when the sky was clearest, was very
 remarkable from the contrasted whiteness of the stars.              My obser
vations were made with different telescopes, but all presented the
 same appearance, and the remarkable luminosity struck every one.
The British consul of Ghent, who did not know that there was an

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                   161
eclipse, wrote to me for an explanation of the blood-red colour of the
moon at 9 o'clock.
   “The sky was of unusual brilliancy, as often occurs between
showers; there was a bright aurora in the north, and a most magni
ficent meteor descended obliquely towards the north-west horizon
about the time of the central eclipse. The western margin of the
disc presented a rough uneven appearance at this time. What would
be the effect on the dark surface of the moon of extensive aurora
borealis on our earth P”
   Mr. Walkey, who observed the eclipse at Clyst St. Lawrence,
near Collumpton, says the appearances were as usual till 20 minutes
to 9. “At that period, and for the space of the next hour, instead
of an eclipse, or the umbra of the earth being the cause of the total
obscurity of the moon, the whole phase of that body became very
quickly and most beautifully illuminated, and assumed the appearance
of the glowing heat of fire from the furnace, rather tinged with a
deep red. The above description I gave to the editor of one of the
Exeter papers, and some one has attempted to solve the peculiarity
of the appearance by speaking of the umbra and penumbra, which
might have been the cause of it. But such a solution has nothing
to do with the appearance, the whole disc of the moon being as per
fect with light as if there had been no eclipse whatever.
   “Having spoken of this appearance, I was informed by one or
two individuals that they had seen, between twenty minutes to nine
and twenty minutes to ten, a very luminous appearance of the aurora
borealis. Now, it strikes me that the light reflected from this
northern effulgence might have caused the luminous appearance of
the moon in this part of the country at the time when it was under
 the perfect umbra of the earth in other portions of England.
   “Many more than threescore years have passed with myself, and
during that period I have several times beheld an eclipse of the moon,
but never before did my eyes behold the moon positively giving good
light from its disc during a total eclipse. The phases of the moon
perfectly corresponded with the authorized diagram up to the period
of 8" 40", and after 9h 40” to the end of the eclipse.”
   In a letter to Captain Smyth, Mr. Wallack suggests the utility of
adopting the binocular construction in astronomical telescopes, and
especially in Newtonian reflectors. He has himself fitted up two
mirrors on this principle, and finds a considerable superiority in the
pair over a single mirror. Mr. Vallack, if we understand him cor
rectly, proposes the following arrangement. The specula are fixed
in parallel tubes, and by raising the further mirror higher up in its
tube, and bringing the small mirror or prism nearer to the mirror,
an image is formed considerably in advance of the tube, which may
be brought so near the image formed by the nearer mirror, that each
may be viewed at the same time by its proper eye. The partition
between the tubes and also the outer tube must be pierced, to let
the rays of the more distant mirror pass out; by a little adjustment,
the distance between the images may be made to suit different eyes.

He remarks, as an objection to the binocular construction, that the
observation will not be convenient, if objects of very different alti
tudes are to be viewed, but still thinks that it would be worthy of
trial in certain cases.

       ON THE COMBINATIONS OF SILICIUM.            BY I. PIERRE.
      OUBTS are still entertained as to the formula which should be
       assigned to silicic acid, and consequently to the chloride of sili
cium. Some chemists admit that silicic acid should be represented by
the formula SiO3, and adopt the number 266.82 as the equivalent of
silicium; others prefer the formula SiO2, taking Si- 177-88. Lastly,
some are of opinion that the rational formula of silicic acid is SiO,
and the equivalent of silicium 88-94.
    The first of these formulae, admitted by the majority of mineralo
gists, has the imposing authority of Berzelius, Thenard, &c. The
 formula SiO2, adopted by a certain number of German chemists and
 mineralogists, among whom may be mentioned M. Gmelin, possesses
the advantage, according to M. Cahours, of making the volume of
 vapour representing the equivalent of the protosilicate of ethyle of
 M. Ebelmen enter within the ordinary conditions. Lastly, the for
 mula SiO seems at present to be generally admitted by the majority
 of French chemists; it was proposed long since by M. Dumas, when
 he published his beautiful investigation upon the specific gravities
 of vapours. M. Ebelmen, in his interesting memoir upon silicic
 aethers, has adopted this latter opinion after a very learned and pro
 found discussion.
    As the curious facts of the aetherification of silicic acid do not
 appear to have resolved the question completely in the eyes of a
 certain number of chemists, I proposed in the present investigation
 to ascertain whether it might not be possible to obtain, either by
 some facts of substitution or by the production of some double
 chlorides analogous to the double fluorides already known, or lastly,
 by the production of some new aether or amidogen compounds,
 results of such a nature as would allow chemists to base their selec
 tion upon more explicit and varied data.
    The difficulties encountered in the preparation of the majority of
 these various kinds of compounds, the long and tedious manipulations
 required by researches of this class, in which the chloride of silicium
 is the first indispensable material,—all these circumstances combined
 did not admit of my varying and multiplying the operations to the
 extent I desired; but imperfect and incomplete as they are, I think
 they deserve to fix for a moment the attention of chemists.
    I. Compounds derived by Substitution from the Chloride of Sili
 cium.—The facts exposed in this first part of my investigation may
 be resumed in the following propositions:—
     1. The chloride of silicium may be deprived, at a high tempera
 ture, by the action of hydrosulphuric acid, of the whole of its chlo
 rine, and the latter replaced by an equivalent quantity of sulphur,

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                163
passing through a series of intermediate compounds containing sili
cium, chlorine and sulphur.
    2. The first of these intermediate compounds, the body SiSCI”, is
readily isolated on account of its great stability.
   3. The sulphuret of silicium may likewise be obtained perfectly
pure.
   4. The existence of the compound SiSº Cl is rendered highly
probable from certain reactions which take place between alcohol
or wood-spirit and the intermediate chlorosulphuretted products.
    In concluding this short notice, it may perhaps not be uninteresting
to arrange in a comparative table the expressions representing these
different compounds, according to each of the three views of the
molecular constitution of the chloride of silicium:
                              Si = 266'82.    Si = 177-88.     Si = 88-94.

    Sulphuret........... ... SiS3               SiS*            SiS
    If regularity and simplicity deserve to be taken into consideration,
the preference will undoubtedly be given to the first series with

 ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PHOSPHATES OF THE ORGANIC
              ALKALIES.       BY DR. THOMAS ANDERSON.
    The author had been led to investigate the phosphates of the
 organic alkalies, with the view of determining the accuracy of an
 analysis of the phosphate of strychnia by Regnault, which gave
 results incomparable with the known constitution of the organic
 phosphates.     He alluded to the investigation of the phosphates of
 aniline by Nicholson, and proceeded to the statement of his own
 observations.
    Phosphate of Strychnia, with one equivalent of strychnia, was ob
 tained in long truncated needles, by digesting strychnia in tribasic
 phosphoric acid.    It dissolved readily in water, and was acid to test
 paper. By analysis it gave results corresponding to the formula
 (C++ H23 Nº O. HO)2HO POS.
     The crystallized salt was found to contain four equivalents of water
 of crystallization.
    Phosphate of Strychnia, with two equivalents of strychnia.—Bylong
 continued digestion of strychnia with the foregoing water in solu
 tion, an additional atom of the alkaloid is dissolved, and the solution
 on cooling deposits rectangular tables of a salt which is neutral to
 test-paper. It is less soluble in water than the acid phosphate, and
 its constitution was found to be represented by the formula 2(C*H**
 Nº O. HO) HOPO3.                                            -
    Phosphate of Brucia, with two equivalents of brucia, is obtained by
 the solution of brucia in phosphoric acid, and crystallizes from the
 concentrated solution in short prisms. The crystals are neutral to
 test-paper, and contain a large quantity of water of crystallization,
 which they lose by    *                The formula of the salt is 2(C44

H23N2 O7 HO)HO PO%.         A double phosphate of brucia and soda was
also formed, but could not be obtained perfectly pure.
   Phosphate of Quinine, with three equivalents of quinine.—Bydigesting
quinine with phosphoric acid, a solution of this salt is obtained which
becomes a solid mass of silky needles on cooling.          They are ex
tremely soluble in hot water, and are quite neutral to test-paper.
They gave by analysis a result corresponding with 3(C*H*NO”
HO)PO%. These results the author considered sufficient to establish
the fact, that the phosphates of the organic alkalies agree in their
constitution with the inorganic salts of that acid; and he concluded
his paper by observing, that the relation of these bases to phosphoric
acid might be made use of as a means of classifying them. Thus
quinine, which replaces three equivalents of water in phosphoric acid,
might be compared to oxide of lead and the oxides of the heavy
metals; brucia might represent the inorganic alkalies; while strych
nia, which under ordinary circumstances replaces only one equivalent
of water, belongs to a class which has no analogue among the series
of inorganic bases.—R. S. Edinburgh. Jameson's Journal, July 1848.
 ON THE PREPARATION of creatin E, &c. . By DR. GREGORY.
   After some remarks on the present state of animal chemistry, the
author commenced by giving a brief account of the recent discoveries
of Liebig in regard to the constituents of the “juice of flesh,” or the
liquid contained in the substance of the muscles, which is distin
guished from the blood by the large quantity of free acid which it
contains.    This remarkable animal fluid has been found by Liebig
to contain phosphoric and lactic acids in large quantity, inosinic acid
in small proportion, and some other acids not yet studied; also pot
ash in large quantity, with a little soda, a considerable proportion of
magnesia, and a little lime, chloride of potassium, with a little chlo
ride of sodium, and, besides some compounds of animal origin not
yet investigated, the new base Creatinine, and the very remarkable
substance Creatine, first discovered by Chevreul, but in vain sought
for by Berzelius and other chemists.
   He then described the process, essentially that of Liebig, by which
creatine is extracted from the flesh of quadrupeds, birds and fishes,
in all of which hitherto tried it has been found, although in small and
variable quantity. A table was exhibited, showing the per-centage
obtained from different kinds of flesh and fish; and the result was,
that this interesting substance may be most easily and cheaply pre
pared from fish, especially the cod, herring, salmon and mackerel, all
of which yielded much more than beef or horse-flesh, and nearly as
much as fowl, which was the most productive. The maximum pro
portion of creatine was 3.2 per 1000 parts of flesh; the average about
1.5 per 1000.
   The author stated that he had found inosinic acid only in the flesh
of fowl and turkey; and he is informed by Baron Liebig, that it is
quite possible that this acid may also have been confined to the flesh
of fowls in his experiments, as it was often absent, although he can
not now ascertain the cases in which it was present.

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             1.65
   He concluded by stating, that as creatine is found in the urine
along with creatinine, it appears to be, in part at least, a substance
intended for excretion.    Its crystalline character renders this pro
bable; and at all events, if it has any function to perform in the
body, that function is not yet known. It must be regarded, in the
mean time, as one of the numerous series of less complex products
derived from the decomposition, in the body, of the effete tissues;
and although we cannot yet produce it artificially, yet from the rapid
progress recently made in the study of the products of decomposition
of the albuminous substances, we may hope soon, not only to do
this, but also to discover, from these products, the true formulae of
the albuminous compound.—Ibid.
  RESEARCHES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE.
   M. Doyère having had particular occasion to examine the phae
nomena of respiration of man and animals exposed to the influence
of the vapour of aether, he was induced to try the protochloride of
copper as an absorbent of oxygen in gaseous mixtures. The favour
able results of the employment of this reagent having induced him
to pursue the study of eudiometry, he succeeded in effecting a com
bination of instruments with simple means of correction and easy
management, which gave the original volume of a gas, and that of the
residue which any absorbent leaves, within a ten-thousandth part.
   The author was surprised to find that his method indicated larger
proportions of oxygen than those generally admitted, and that even
among them considerable variations occurred.      M. Doyère continued
his operations for four months, and the results proved that the com
position of the air varies incessantly. In general the variation is
slight, and the proportions of oxygen varying between 208 and 210
parts in 1000; but this variation was found to go as low as 205, and
as high as 212. These great differences never occurred suddenly;
the quantity having diminished or increased as gradually as consists
with such a description of facts. M. Doyère shows that his results
harmonize perfectly with those of MM. Boussingault and Dumas
 obtained at Paris;–with those which were obtained by M. Stas at
Brussels, and with the great work achieved by M. Lewy with respect
to the air of the North Sea, and that of Guadaloupe. He also proves
 that Dr. Prout’s experiments on the weight of the air, and those
published by M. Regnault, agree with his view of the subject, and
prove that the air is continually varying.
   He shows also, that the densities of oxygen and nitrogen given by
M. Regnault do not agree with the composition of the air when
stated to contain only 209 of oxygen; and that they indicate 213
thousandths of oxygen if the mean density of nitrogen be adopted,
and 212 to 215 if the extreme densities resulting from the experi
ments of M. Regnault bepreferred.—Comptes Rendus, Février 14, 1848.
    RESEARCHES ON ESSENTIAL OILS.            BY M. C. GERHARDT,
   Oil of Chamomile (Anthemis nobilis).-This oil, like the greater
number of liquid essential oils, is a mixture of two principles, one

166            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
oxygenated, the other not. It begins to boil at about 338° F.; the
boiling remains long stationary at 356°, and then gradually rises
to 410° F.
   The oxygenated principle may be isolated by receiving only the
last distilled portions of the oil. It undergoes a remarkable meta
morphosis: when it is heated for a few minutes with an alcoholic
solution of potash, it is converted into a saline mixture, from which
the mineral acids separate an oily acid. This is a mixture of a liquid
acid, the valerianic and a solid acid, which is the angelicic.
   The identity of the liquid acid with the valerianic was rendered
unquestionable by the analysis of the salts of silver and of barium,
which gave C* H9 O*(Ag) and C*H" O'(Ba). As to angelicic acid,
it crystallizes from boiling water in magnificent crystals, which are
volatile, without decomposing, and are very fusible : they contain
C* H7 O2(H). This composition places angelicic acid in the homo
logous group nGH2+O*—H*, which contains anilic, pyroterebic,
campbolic, moringic and elaidic acids.               -
   Angelicic acid was discovered by MM. Meyer and Zenner, who
obtained it with valerianic acid by treating angelica root with milk
of lime; it is therefore probable that angelica root contains the
same essential oil as the chamomile.
   M. Deville obtained by the dry distillation of the resin ofguaiacum
an oil C* H8O, which oxidizes by exposure to the air, and is converted
into a substance which crystallizes in beautiful laminae.     This oil is
unquestionably angelicic aldehyde, belonging to the homologous series
nCH2+ O-H2.
   The author did not possess sufficient oil to determine the com
position of the oxygenated principle which the two acids described
yielded; it may, however, he thinks, be predicted that this substance
belongs to the échelon C19.
   As to the carburetted hydrogen of the oil of chamomile, it remains
in a pure state. After treating the oil with potash, it has a very
agreeable odour of lemons, boils at 347°F., and appears to be iden
tical with cumen C40H14, extracted by the author and M. Cahours
from cummin.
   Oil of Rue.—This substance was first analysed by M. Will; but
M. Gerhardt states he showed three years since that the conclusions
of M. Will were inadmissible, and that oil of rue must contain an
isomeric of oil of mint, so well analysed by M. Walter. The author
remarks that his recent analyses agree perfectly with his opinion.
   Oil of rue contains but a very small quantity of carburetted hy
drogen; it is composed almost entirely of an oil C10H20 O, to which
the author has given the name of caprol: it may be obtained pure
by collecting the last distilled portions of the oil. Caprol boils at
about 451°F.; it becomes resinous when heated with potashed lime,
and reduces ammoniacal nitrate of silver at a boiling heat. These
characters show that caprol is the capric aldehyde of the homologous
series nCH3+ O.
   The author has as yet been able so to regulate the oxidizement
of caprol as to obtain capric acid only.   In employing nitric acid of
different degrees of concentration, a homologue of capric acid, pelar

                        Meteorological Observations.                                                   167
gonic acid, was always produced, the same which M. Pless has re
cently extracted from the leaves of geranium. Repeated analyses
made of the salts of silver, barium and copper, of four different kinds,
all agreed with the formula C9H7 O*(Ag), C. H.7 O*(Ba), C'H'
O3(Cu).
     The barytic salt is obtained in fine pearly laminae, which are greasy
to the touch, and resemble cholesterine. The author succeeded once
only in obtaining a barytic salt, less soluble than the pelargonate,
and whose composition approached that of the caprate. Oil of rue
furnishes an excellent means of preparing pelargonic acid in large
quantity. , All that is requisite is to heat it for some minutes with
nitric acid diluted with an equal volume of water; the reaction then
goes on of itself; the product saponified by potash, decomposed by
a mineral acid, then rectified by desiccation, yields pelargonic acid.
     The author has also transformed caprol into a polymeric solid,
metacaprol, resembling metaenanthol and metaldehyde.—Comptes
 Rendus, Février 14, 1848.                                        -

      XXV. On the Influence of Temperature upon the Distribution of
         the Fauna of the Ægean Sea. By Lieut. SPRATT, R.N., F.G.S."
            HE publication by the British Association of the valuable
             and highly interesting report on the fauna of the Ægean .
      by Professor Forbes, induced me to make some observations
      on the temperature of that Sea at different depths, so as
      to ascertain how far temperature might act as an influencing
      agent, in the distribution of the fauna, throughout the several
      regions into which he has divided it.
          During the summer of 1844 and succeeding summers, I
       was employed on the survey of the shores of the Grecian
       Archipelago, and had opportunities of visiting several parts of
       the Ægean Sea. During favourable weather I made the ob
       servations alluded to. The following are some of the localities
       selected to show the comparative uniformity of the results at
      distant localities, as well as in different distances from the coast
      and sea-bottom.

170        Lieut. Spratt on the Influence of Temperature
   It will be seen by this table that the temperatures of the
upper zones are frequently two or three degrees higher near the
coast than the average temperature of the corresponding depth
at the distance of five or six miles, indicating apparently a
terrestrial influence.
   The average temperature of the air during summer in the
AEgean is 86°; and the above observations show that the sea
within the littoral zone, viz. under two fathoms, is from 73°
to 78°. In the three lower regions the temperature decreases
rapidly; so that in the fourth region, at the depth of 35 fa
thoms, the temperature of the sea is 20° lower than in the first
region, being about 60° or 62°. In the sixth region the
temperature is about its minimum, viz. 55° or 56°, only 4
or 5 degrees less than in the fourth region. I have not been
able to prove the temperature at a lower depth than 230
fathoms, at which it stood 55}*, as in the seventh region.
    It is necessary for me to mention the difficulties I experi
enced in making the observations at great depths correctly,
the labours of several hours having been often lost through
the motion of the vessel; the twisting and jerking of the line
 whilst hauling it up again, by which means the steel bar of the
 Six's thermometer was shaken down the tube; thus showing
a higher temperature than what the contents of the dredge
showed when brought up with it. I finally found the plan
of testing its temperature by the mud brought up more cer
tain than that of lowering the thermometer, when the contents
of the dredge was of a sufficient quantity to retain the lower
temperature, and the sea-bottom a soft mud, as it almost
always is in depths above 100 fathoms. Under that depth,
and in corally, gravelly and sandy bottoms, the thermometer
must be lowered.
   It may thus be doubted whether the mud when brought up
from such a depth really showed the temperature of the bot
tom ; the question being, whether it is not lower than the mud
indicated, owing to a gain of temperature by passing through
regions of a higher grade. I however have no reason to sup
pose that the temperature is lower than 55° at any depth under
 300 fathoms, having often tested the contents of a dredge after
it had been some time standing on the deck of the vessel in a
tub of water of the surface temperature. The certainty of
there being a temperature as low as 55}^ in the seventh and
eighth region of depth, is sufficient for the remarks I shall
 make upon its influence upon the distribution of marine fauna.
    I will now endeavour to show, by analysing Prof. Forbes's
report, that the key to the solution of that remarkable distri
bution of marine fauna into regions of depth is the decrease

  upon the Distribution of the Fauna of the AEgean Sea.        171
of temperature in those descending regions, corresponding to
the temperature of the parallel of latitude in which the species
are identical or analogous.
    I have before pointed out that between the littoral and fourth
or fifth region there is a difference of temperature amounting
to 25°, and sometimes even to 30°; the upper division of the
littoral zone ranging from 76° to 84° during seven or eight
months in the year; whilst in the lowest regions, there appears
to be a permanent temperature as low as 55}*. Thus we have
a region of depth of a temperature corresponding to the sum
mer temperature of a high northern latitude. It seems natural,
therefore, that in the fauna of one locality should be found
identical or analogous species with the other, considering how
great is the influence of temperature in governing the distri
bution of terrestrial fauna and flora. And I am of opinion,
that increased density from depth is not so great an antagonist
to the existence of animal life as is generally supposed. Air
breathing animals can soar to highly rarified regions without
inconvenience of respiration. The inhabitants of 100 feet
above the sea feel the same freedom of circulation that the
inhabitants of 10,000 feet feel. It is temperature, and local
conditions partially arising from it, that limits the ascent and
existence of life. So does the same law appear applicable to
marine animals which breathe the medium they inhabit.
When we examine the members of the lower regions of depth,
we find them as fragile and delicate, if not more so, than their
brethren above. I may mention that the Ophiuridae range
into all regions yet explored, one species being a traveller
from the highest to the lowest. At the depth of 320 fathoms
at about forty miles east of Malta, I recently procured a small
Sipunculus, which appeared however to be peculiarly adapted
to the conditions of that depth ; its density, it is said, tending
 to hold light bodies in suspension: the posterior extremity of
 the Sipunculus was truncated so as to form a circular disc, by
 which it secured itself to the bottom, or any solid body found
 there: whilst in my possession, it thus attached itself to the
 bottom of the glass of sea-water in which it was placed.
    I shall now proceed briefly to investigate the fauna of each
 region of depth, as marked out by Professor Forbes.
    The first or littoral zone he limits to two fathoms, or twelve
feet below the surface: but this, although of so small an amount,
 the Professor shows “has two well-marked subdivisions; viz.
 first, the upper or tidal zone of about two feet, between air
 and water, the inhabitants of which are remarkable, as being
 such as have a wide geographic range : eight out of the
 eleven species peculiar to it are widely distributed in the
                                N 2

 172       Lieut. Spratt on the Influence of Temperature
 Atlantic; and one species, the Littorina caerulescens, extend
 ing from Tristan d’Acunha to the shores of Norway.” It is
 evident that the inhabitants of this region are subject to great
 vicissitudes of temperature during the summer and winter
 changes to which they are exposed. Nature having adapted
 them to these conditions, we thus find that they are wanderers
 through every clime; their geographic range corresponding
 apparently to the local vicissitudes of temperature to which
 they are subject.
    The lower subdivision of this region, and the region below
 it reaching to the depth of 10 fathoms, is that in which the
 vicissitudes of seasons is less felt; and that, consequently, in
 which the average Mediterranean temperature has a more
 permanent influence, the lowest part of the second region
 being seldom at a lower temperature than 74°at the sea-bottom.
 It is in these two regions that Professor Forbes has shown
 distinctly the influence of local temperature on the fauna; for
 he remarks “that it is in this belt we have the characteristic
 species of the Mediterranean fauna.”
    The third region extends to the depth of 20 fathoms, at
 which the temperature has fallen to 68°; but it has no very
 characteristic fauna, Professor Forbes remarking that it may
 be regarded as a zone of transition between the Mediterranean
 fauna and that of the region below, where it presents well
 marked characters.
    The fourth region increases its range to 35 fathoms, at
 which the temperature has decreased five or six degrees, being
generally 62°; and, being so far beyond the influence of atmo
 lº       changes, is of a more permanent standard throughout
 the year; the consequence is, a more distinctly marked fauna,
 and one upon which the influence of the decreased temperature
 is decisive, for we find that the per-centage of Celtic forms in
this region is nearly 50 per cent.
    In the sixth region at the depth of 75 fathoms, the tem
perature has    º, reached its minimum of 55° or 56°, a di<U+017F>
ference of only five or six degrees below that of the fourth
region. The Celtic forms are found rapidly to diminish in
the lowest region to 20 per cent., whilst in the sixth and seventh
regions it stands at 36 per cent. But Professor Forbes re
marks, “that although we find fewer northern species in the
fauna of the lower zone, the number of forms representative
of northern species is so great, as to give them a much
more boreal or sub-boreal character than is present in those
regions where identical forms are more abundant.” It must
be remembered, that our knowledge of the northern fauna is
not so perfect as that of the AEgean. This may partly be taken

  upon the Distribution of the Fauna of the Ægean Sea. 173
into account for the diminished number of identical species;
or more probably, this poverty of identical northern species
may arise from the peculiar condition of the sea-bottom at this
depth. Fuci having become rare in and below the sixth region
are replaced by occasional patches of Nullipora, upon which
the living Testacea in the lower regions are mostly found, pre
senting prolific spots in the otherwise barren fields of yellow
clay, like an oasis in the desert. These peculiar conditions
develope necessarily a peculiar marine fauna, upon which the
climatal influence nevertheless stamps its characteristic form
throughout the species; and, if identical forms are not known,
point to a far north clime for the locality in which they may
be found.
   The wide range in depth of the eighth region seems to be
in unison with its pervading temperature and more uniform
condition of the sea-bottom.
   Among the AEgean fauna there are several species which
have a considerable range in depth. Professor Forbes enu
merates nine common to six regions, seventeen species to five
regions, and two which ramble throughout the eight regions.
“On inquiring into the history of the species,” says the author
of the report, “which have such a wide range in depth, it is
found that more than one half are known to be wide geogra
phic rangers; and from these facts we may fairly draw a
general inference, that the extent of the range of a species in
depth corresponds with its geographic range.” The obser
vation I made on the cosmopolite species of the littoral tidal
zone, it will be remembered, is also equally applicable to these
wide rangers in depth; for being adapted to climatal changes,
they consequently become wanderers over wide geographic
space, as they ramble into the representations of climate through
regions of depth. Thus we have the climate of a parallel re
presented in marine depths as it is in terrestrial elevation.
   It will be seen by Professor Forbes's report, that the species
identical of a southern latitude are very few, these being con
fined to the characteristic Mediterranean zone, or are wide
rangers. This is, consequently, in strict accordance with the
climatal influence. As a law resulting from this influence,
characteristic tropical and subtropical species will have a
limited distribution in geographic space; whilst the boreal and
sub-boreal characters will be found in every geographic posi
tion where corresponding regions of depth are found with
animal life existing, the limit of which I believe to be much
lower than 300 fathoms, having examples from 390 fathoms.
But I must notice, that the AEgean deep dredges indicate ge
nerally a zero of animal life at 300 fathoms, as Professor Forbes

174         Dr. T. Anderson on the Products of the
was induced to assume. I believe, however, that in the deserts
of yellow clay an occasional oasis of animal life may be found
in much greater depths, depending upon some favourable local
condition or accident.
    I cannot close my remarks without noticing the singular
fact of the decrease in temperature in marine depths in these
parallels being about equal to the increase of temperature
in terrestrial depths at 200 fathoms below the surface; in the
one case decreasing from 78° and 80° to 55°, and in mines, it
is said, increasing to 80° at the same depth. (See Ansted's
Geology, vol. ii. p. 294.)
    These reasonings and observations on the deeps of the
AEgean Sea seem to point out the key to the distribution of the
marine fauna generally; and as they are of evident geological
importance, I am induced to present them to the notice of the
British Association, although so imperfectly carried out, and
attended with so little research as to what is already known of
the temperature of the sea in other localities. The temperature
of great depths in high latitudes was first ascertained by Sir
John Ross in 1818, which he found to be 29 degrees at the
depth of from 200 to 1000 fathoms. I hope, however, that
 these observations may lead to an extension of similar obser
vations in each zone of depth, in connexion with the fauna of
those zones in other and distant localities, by those members
of my profession who have means at command, and more zeal
in uniting science with duty.
XXVI. On the Products of the Destructive Distillation of
    Animal Substances. Part I. By Thomas ANDERson, Esq.,
    M.D.”
 IN     April 1846 I communicated to the Royal Society a paper
       on a new organic base, to which I gave the name of pi
coline, and which occurs in coal-tar, associated with the pyrrol,
kyanol, and leukol of Runge. In that paper I pointed out
 that the properties of picoline resembled, in many respects,
 those of a base which Unverdorben had previously extracted
 from Dippel’s animal oil, and described under the name of
 odorine; and more especially mentioned their solubility in
 water, and property of forming crystallizable salts with chlo
 ride of gold, as characters in which these substances approxi
 mated very closely to one another. And further, I detailed a
few experiments on the odorine of Unverdorben extracted
from Dippel’s oil, with the view of ascertaining whether or

        Destructive Distillation of Animal Substances.         175
not they were actually identical, but on too small a scale to
admit of a definite solution of the question.
   These observations, coupled with the doubts which had
been expressed by some chemists, and more especially by
Reichenbach, as to the existence of the bases described by
Unverdorben, induced me to take up the whole subject of the
products of the destructive distillation of animal substances,
which has not yet been investigated in a manner suited to the
requirements of modern chemistry. In fact, Unverdorben is
the only person who has examined them at all; and his ex
periments, contained in the eighth and eleventh volumes of
Poggendorff’s Annalen, constitute the whole amount of our
knowledge on the subject; and his observations, though valu
able, and containing perhaps as much as could easily be de
termined at the time he wrote, are crude and imperfect, when
we come to compare them with those which the present state
of the science demands.     Since his time, the methods of in
vestigation in organic chemistry have undergone an entire
change: the simplifications of the process of organic analysis
had not then been made, or at least had not come into daily
use as the auxiliary of investigation; and Unverdorben, who
belonged to the old school, and contented himself with the
observation of reactions only, was necessarily led, as I shall
afterwards more particularly show, to confound together sub
stances, the reactions of which approximate so closely that it
is impossible, or at least very difficult, to distinguish them by
such means alone. The errors, however, lay with the method,
and not with the observer; for Unverdorben’s experiments,
so far as they go, I have found to be correct in the main,
notwithstanding their having been called in question by Reich
enbach, whose numerous researches on the kindred subject of
the products of the destructive distillation of vegetable sub
stances gave weight to his opinion, and have indeed been the
principal cause of the doubts expressed by others on the subject.
   The investigation of these products has occupied me pretty
continuously since the publication of the paper before alluded
to ; and my researches have now extended themselves over a
large part of the subject, although, from its branching off into
so many subdivisions, and embracing the consideration of so
large a number of substances belonging to almost every class
of organic compounds, some time must still elapse before it is
complete in all its parts. It is my intention, therefore, as the
subject naturally divides itself into several sections, to take up
the consideration of these in a succession of papers, of which
the present is the first, and in which I propose to consider the
general properties of the crude product employed in my ex

176         Dr. T. Anderson on the Products of the
periments, and those of certain of the organic bases contained
1In 11.
    The products of the destructive distillation of animal mat
ters were long since employed in medicine, and were obtained
from all parts of the body, and from almost every section of
the animal kingdom; but these afterwards entirely gave way
to the Oleum Cornu Cervi, which, as hartshorn is entirely free
from fatty matters, must necessarily be the pure product of
decomposition of the gelatinous tissues. The more volatile
portions of this oil, separated by distillation with water, and
purified by numerous rectifications, constituted the Oleum
Animale Dippellii of the older pharmacopoeias. These sub
stances would in all probability have been the most convenient
crude materials for my experiments; but as they have long
since ceased to be employed, and cannot now be obtained except
by going through the tedious and disagreeable process for their
preparation, I have made use of the bone-oil of commerce,
which is prepared on the large scale by the distillation of bones
in iron cylinders, and can be had in any quantity from the
manufacturers of ivory-black. This oil appears to differ in no
respect from the true Oleum Cornu Cervi, and, like it, is the
product of decomposition of the gelatinous tissues only; for
previous to distillation the bones are boiled in a large quantity
of water, by which means both the fatty matters and also a
certain proportion of the gelatine are separated. They are
then dried, packed in the cylinders, and distilled at a heat
which is gradually raised to redness. The oily product of
this distillation is separated from the watery portion, and,
after rectification, forms the bone-oil of commerce; though
in some instances this latter distillation is dispensed with, and
the product of the first made use of without any further puri
fication.            -
    Bone-oil, as supplied by the manufacturer, has a dark
brown, almost black colour, with a somewhat greenish shade,
and perfectly opake in the mass; but when spread in a thin
layer on a glass plate, it is seen to be brown by transmitted
light. Its specific gravity is about 0.970. Its smell is pecu
liarly disagreeable, and is mixed with that of ammonia, which
is always present, though sometimes in so small quantity that
its odour is disguised by that of the oil itself, and is only ren
dered apparent by distillation. A piece offir-wood moistened
with hydrochloric acid, and held over the mouth of a vessel
containing it, rapidly acquires the dark reddish-purple colour
which is characteristic of the pyrrol of Runge. Acids agitated
with the oil acquire a brown colour, especially on standing,
and extract the bases contained in it; but if the quantity of

         Destructive Distillation of Animal Substances.       177
the acid be large, and in a pretty concentrated state, a non
basic oil is also dissolved, which, on standing for some time,
and more rapidly if heated, undergoes decomposition, and the
fluid becomes filled with orange-yellow flocks of a resinous
substance, which acquires a dark colour by exposure to the
air : this change is produced by the stronger vegetable as well
as the mineral acids.    Alkalies extract an acid oil, and a con
siderable quantity of hydrocyanic acid, which, on the addition
of an acid to the alkaline solution, and distillation, can be
distinguished in the product by its smell, as well as by its
reaction with the salts of iron.
    Previous to the separation of the bases, the crude oil was
again rectified in portions of about fifteen pounds each, in an
iron retort, an operation attended with some trouble, as the
fluid is apt to froth up and boil over in the early part of the
 process, so that the retort must not be more than half-full,
and the heat requires to be applied in a very gradual manner.
 At first a watery fluid distils, containing in solution ammonia,
and a small quantity of the most volatile bases. This is ac
 companied by an oil of a pale yellow colour, limpid and very
 volatile, which after a time comes over without water, and with
 an increased though by no means dark colour. The distilla
 tion proceeds in a perfectly steady and gradual manner, until
 about two-fifths of the oil have passed over, when a point is
 attained at which the temperature requires to be considerably
 raised, in order that the distillation may continue uniformly,
 and the product becomes much thicker and more oily in its
 appearance. At this point the receiver was changed for the
 purpose of collecting the less volatile portion apart, and the
 distillation continued until the bottom of the retort reached a
 red heat. The latter portions of these products were obvi
 ously altered during the distillation, for a bulky porous char
 coal remained in the retort; the oil which passed over smelt
 strongly of ammonia, crystals of carbonate of ammonia made
 their appearance in the neck of the retort, and a certain quan
  tity of water collected in the receiver. The oil also became
  gradually darker in colour, and more viscid in its consistence.
  By collecting in a succession of receivers, I had an opportu
  nity of observing a great number of curious optical phaenomena
  at different epochs of the distillation. The oils frequently
  presented well-marked appearances of epipolic dispersion, and
  the very last portion exhibited a curious species of dichroism,
  its colour being dark reddish-brown by transmitted, and green,
  with the effect of opacity, by reflected light. All these ap
  pearances, however, were very evanescent, and are only seen
  in the newly-distilled oil, for after a few days it becomes very
  dark-coloured, and they are then no longer visible.

   178          Dr. T. Anderson on the Products of the
      Both the more and the less volatile oils contain a variety of
   bases, and were separately treated for their extraction. In
  neither, however, is the quantity large. I obtained from the
  more volatile portion of three hundred pounds of bone-oil less
  than two pounds of the mixed bases; but as in the course of
  the various processes to which it was submitted, some small
  portions were lost, the whole may perhaps amount to about
  three-fourths per cent. of the total quantity of oil. The less
  volatile portion yields a larger quantity, which may be esti
  mated at two or three per cent. of the crude oil. These, of
  course, are only rough estimates, but they may serve to give
  an idea of the quantity of the products.
                        Preparation of the Bases.
     For the preparation of the bases precisely the same pro
  cesses were followed throughout for both portions into which
  the oil was separated by distillation; and as the bases to be
  described in the present paper were contained in the more
  volatile portion, I shall detail the steps followed in reference
  to that quantity only. The oil was mixed in a cask with sul
  phuric acid diluted with about ten times its weight of water,
  and the fluids left in contact for a week or two, during which
  time they were frequently agitated. More water was then
  added, and the whole drawn off, and the process repeated with
 fresh quantities of sulphuric acid as long as any bases were
 extracted.      The solution, which had a reddish and sometimes
 very dark brown colour, contained the bases, along with a
 quantity of non-basic oil and of pyrrol. It was mixed with
 an additional quantity of sulphuric acid, introduced into a
 glass distilling apparatus, and heat applied. As the fluid
 approached the boiling-point, a quantity of the red resinous
 matter before alluded to began to separate, and occasioned
 succussions of so violent a character as to endanger the
 safety of the vessel, and render it necessary to interrupt
 the process for the purpose of filtering it off, after which the
 distillation proceeded without difficulty. A small quantity of
 oil distilled over, and the water which accompanied it had
 exactly the smell of the water in a gas-meter, and contained
 pyrrol+, which continued to pass over for a long time, during
 the whole of which the distillation was continued.              This di
 stillation I had recourse to at first, from a suspicion that some
of the bases were separated from the acid, and volatilized
    * These odours were so exactly alike, that I was induced to seek for
pyrrol in the water of gas-meters; and I found that when mixed with sul
phuric acid and distilled, the product gave the characteristic reaction of
pyrrol with fir-wood. Ammonia remained in combination with the sulphuric
acid. '

during the process; but so soon as I had ascertained that this
was not the case, it was dispensed with, and the fluid boiled
down in porcelain or copper evaporating basins, water being
added, and the distillation continued until, by taking a small
quantity of the fluid and distilling off a few drops in a retort,
they were found to be free from pyrrol. Even this precaution
soon became unnecessary, for a little experience enabled me
to know when the evaporation had been sufficiently prolonged.
    The dark brown fluid which remained in the basins was
once more strained, in order to get rid of such resinous mat
ters as might have separated during the evaporation, and then
distilled in a large glass balloon connected with a condenser,
after the acid had been previously supersaturated by a base.
For this purpose, potash, soda, and lime were indifferently
made use of: the latter answers extremely well; but owing to
the large quantity of sulphate of lime separated, the distillation
requires to be carried on in the chloride of calcium or oil-bath.
When the alkali is added in sufficient quantity, an oil floats
up to the surface of the fluid, and a strong pungent odour is
given off, in which that of ammonia is apparent, along with
another which can be compared to nothing but the smell of
stinking lobsters. At the first part of the distillation a trans
parent and colourless watery fluid passed over, which contained
 the bases in solution; but after this had continued for some
 time, an oil made its appearance running in globules down the
 tube of the condenser, and dissolving immediately in the fluid
 which had already distilled. When the bases ceased to distil
 in quantity, the receiver was changed, and a small quantity of
 oil heavier than water was obtained by continuing the distil
 lation for some time. At the end of the process an oil remained
 floating upon the concentrated fluid in the balloon, the quan
 tity of which is very variable, and depends on the distillation
 of the crude bone-oil, having been continued too long before
 changing the receiver. In fact, it contains some of the bases
 of the less volatile oil, and will come to be considered in an
 after part of the investigation.
     To the product of the distillation sticks of caustic potash
  were added; and as these dissolved, the oily bases separated
  from the fluid in a manner exactly similar to that which was
  observed in the preparation of picoline, as detailed in the paper.
  to which re<U+017F>erence has already been made. The alkaline
 solution was drawn off by means of a syphon, and more potash
  added as long as water was separated. In this way the greater
  part of the base was obtained; but a small quantity of the
  most volatile of all still remains in the alkaline solution, and
  cannot be separated except by the addition of a very large

180         Dr. T. Anderson on the Products of the
quantity of potash. It was, however, readily obtained by di
stilling the fluid, and collecting only the first portion of the
product, from which it was separated by a comparatively small
expenditure of potash. The small quantity so obtained was
preserved separately from the large mass.
   The product of this operation was found to be extremely
complex, and to consist of a mixture of four or five different
bases, exclusive of ammonia. For the purpose of obtaining
these in a separate state, a great variety of processes was
attempted; but none were found to answer so well as frac
tionated distillation, although it is an extremely tedious method
of separation, and occasions a considerable loss of substance,
which is very annoying when the quantities obtained are so
small.    When the mixed bases were distilled with a ther
mometer, ammonia began to escape at a very low temperature;
but at 160°Fahr. the fluid entered into steady ebullition, and
a perfectly transparent and limpid oil began to distil. A small
quantity of oil passed over between this temperature and 212°,
which was received by itself, and the after products collected
in a succession of receivers, which were changed at every ten
degrees which the thermometer rose. The fluid continued in
steady and rapid ebullition, and the thermometer ascended
rapidly to 240°, and between that and 250° a considerable
quantity was collected. It then again went up pretty rapidly,
and another large quantity was obtained between 270° and
280°; after which the distillation proceeded more slowly until
the temperature rose to 305°, at which point the characters
of the products underwent a complete change. All the sub
stances obtained at lower temperatures dissolved instantane
ously in water; but that which now distilled floated on the
surface, and only dissolved on agitation with a considerable
quantity of water. Distillation now continued with somewhat
greater rapidity, till the thermometer rose to about 355°, when
a drop of the product allowed to fall into a solution of chloride
of lime immediately gave the reaction of aniline. When this
was observed, the whole remaining products, which formed
only a small fraction of the whole, were collected together.
They consisted chiefly of aniline.
   The products of these different distillations were repeatedly
rectified, and by this means bases were obtained corresponding
to the points at which the thermometer was found to remain
longest in the first distillation. Of these I have as yet ex
amined only the most volatile, and that which boiled at
about 270°.

                               Petinine.
   The most volatile portion of the bases obtained by the frac
tionated distillation was mixed with the small portion which
was separated with difficulty from the potash solution, and had
been kept separate from the large quantity. The mixed fluid
still contained a large quantity of ammonia, for the separation
of which it was again rectified several times in succession, and
fractionated in a small retort, the receiver being kept carefully
cool. After this process has been repeated until it is properly
purified, it constitutes the base to which I give the name of
petinine (from werewºg, volatilis), in allusion to its volatility,
which is greater than that of any base yet known, with the
exception, of course, of ammonia. The quantity of this sub
stance contained in the bone-oil is excessively small, as I ob
tained from three hundred pounds no more than was sufficient
for the determination of its constitution, and the leading cha
racters of a few of its compounds. It is probable, however,
that some loss was incurred in the preliminary processes, as,
from not anticipating the presence of so volatile a base, I did
not take any precautions for producing complete condensation
of the products, by means of freezing mixtures or otherwise;
and a considerable quantity was also lost owing to my anxiety
to expel completely the ammonia which it might retain.
                     Constitution of Petinine.
   The petinine employed for analysis was very carefully dried
over caustic potash, the fluid poured off after some days’ con
tact, and distilled in the water-bath at a very gentle heat; a
precaution which is rendered necessary by its dissolving a
certain quantity of potash, I did not possess a sufficient quan
tity to make a determination of the nitrogen, but took it for
granted that oxygen was absent; an assumption which is jus
tified by the analogy of all the other volatile bases, as well as
by the perfect coincidence of the experimental results with the
calculated formulae. . It was analysed with oxide of copper in
a very long tube, and gave the following results:—

   The mode in which this base is formed during the decom
position of gelatine, it is of course impossible at present to
perceive. In its chemical relations it is, however, in all pro
bability related to the butyric series; and it is even possible
that we may obtain it by artificial processes. Some time since,
Kolbe" published some researches on the galvanic decompo
sition of valerianic acid, among the products of which he dis
covered a carbo-hydrogen, having the formula Cs Ho. Now
by treating this substance in the same manner as benzine is
acted upon for the preparation of aniline, we ought to obtain
from it, if not petinine, at least an isomeric compound, as may
be easily seen by comparing the formulae of the different sub
Stances:—
     Benzine . . . Cls Hs             Cs Ho          Kolbe's carbo-hydrogen.

I have not yet had an opportunity of determining whether the
change which theory would lead us to expect actually takes
place, but there is every reason to suppose that it would.
                         Properties of Petinine.
   Petinine is a transparent colourless fluid, limpid as aether,
and possessing a high refracting power. It has an excessively
pungent odour resembling that of ammonia, and yet quite
distinct; for when the effect of its pungency has gone off, or
it is smelt in a dilute state, its smell is disagreeable, and some
what similar to that of decayed apples. Its taste is hot and
very pungent. It boils at a temperature of about 175° F.;
               * Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxxi. p. 348,

        Destructive Distillation of Animal Substances.         183
but the quantity which I possessed was too small to admit of
an accurate determination either of this point, or of its specific
gravity, although the latter is certainly less than that of water.
Petinine is a very powerful base, and immediately restores the
blue colour of reddened litmus, and gives abundant fumes
when a rod dipped in hydrochloric acid is held over it. It
unites with the concentrated acids, with the evolution of much
heat. It dissolves in all proportions in water, alcohol, aether,
and the oils; and is also soluble in dilute solution of potash,
but not in concentrated. Petinine gives double salts with
bichloride of platinum and corrosive sublimate, both of which
are soluble in water. With chloride of gold it gives a pale
yellow precipitate, which does not dissolve on boiling the so
lution, and is not deposited in crystals. Petinine throws down
peroxide of iron from its compounds. It also precipitates
salts of copper, and the oxide thrown down dissolves in excess
of the base with a fine blue colour.
   These properties agree with those of none of the bases de
scribed by Unverdorben; and, in fact, it is certain that peti
nine could not have been present in the mixture to which he
applies the name of odorine, for he expressly states that it
commenced boiling at 212°. And it is easy to see why he
did not obtain it; because in separating the bases from the
acid by which they were extracted from the crude oil, he took
 care to add a quantity of potash just so great that the oily bases
 were liberated, and not the ammonia; and as his object in
 doing so was to get rid of the latter substance, and there being
 no means of doing this exactly, it is probable that he did not
fully separate the bases, but the most volatile, which is also
the most powerful, remained in combination with the acid
 along with the ammonia.
                     Compounds of Petinine.
    The minute quantity of petinine which I obtained has ne
 cessitated a very cursory examination of its salts, which are
 interesting, both from the facility with which they crystallize,
 and their great stability. None of them undergo change in
 the air, but may be left exposed for any length of time without
 acquiring colour. They are all soluble in water, and those
 with the volatile acids sublime without decomposing, and are
 deposited in crystals upon cold surfaces.
    Sulphate of Petinine is obtained by adding petinine to dilute
 sulphuric acid until the fluid is neutral. On evaporating,
 petinine is given off; and the solution, when concentrated to
 a syrup, concretes on cooling into a foliated mass of crystals
 of an acid sulphate. These crystals are strongly acid to test

   Chloride of Platinum and Petinine.—If bichloride of plati
num be added to a dilute solution of hydrochlorate of petinine,
the salt formed remains in solution; but when both substances
are concentrated, it falls as a pale yellow precipitate, which
was purified by crystallization from hot water. On cooling,
the fluid, if sufficiently concentrated, becomes entirely filled
with exceedingly beautiful golden-yellow plates, resembling
those of crystallized iodide of lead. It is pretty soluble in cold
water, extremely so in hot, and is not decomposed by boiling
the solution.    It is also soluble in alcohol.

   Chloride of Mercury and Petinine.—A solution of petinine
in water, added to a solution of corrosive sublimate, gives a
white precipitate, which dissolves in a considerable quantity
of hot water, from which it is again deposited in crystals. It
is much more soluble in alchohol; and the boiling solution
gives a deposit of beautiful silvery plates on cooling. It is
decomposed by boiling its watery solution, petinine being
driven off, and a white powder deposited. It is readily soluble
in the cold in dilute hydrochloric acid, probably with the for
mation of another double salt,

              Products of Decomposition of Petinine.
   The want of substance, which prevented the full investiga
tion of the salts, has likewise curtailed this branch of the sub
ject to a very few observations; which is the more to be re
gretted, as the general properties and low atomic weight of
petinine give promise of definite products, which might enable
us fully to determine its position in the chemical system.
    When treated with concentrated nitric acid, it dissolves
without any remarkable phaenomena, and on boiling, a feeble
evolution of nitrous fumes takes place; but the petinine is
 attacked only to a very small extent; for after being kept boil
ing for a long time, and then supersaturated with potash, it
 evolved the smell of the base apparently unchanged. Solution
 of chloride of lime immediately acts upon it in the cold, and
 developes a highly irritating odour, and some compound is
 manifestly produced: the solution remains colourless. Bro
 mine water dropped into an aqueous solution of petinine oc
 casions the precipitation of a yellow oil heavier than water,
 and insoluble in acids: the solution contained hydrobromate
 of petinine. From the analogy of the other volatile bases, we
 should expect this to be tribromopetinine, Cs H, Bra N. My
 material being exhausted, I was not able to extend these ob
 servations further.
                               Picoline.
    Having determined the properties of petinine, I next turned
 my attention to that portion of the mixed bases which boiled
 between 270° and 280°, where I had every reason to expect
 the presence of picoline. After several rectifications, in each
 of which the first and last portions of the product were sepa
 rated, I obtained a fine colourless transparent oil, possessed
 of all the properties of that substance. It dissolved readily in
 water; gave, with chloride of gold, a fine yellow compound
 depositing in needles from the hotsolution, and with bichloride
 of platinum, a salt crystallizing in orange-yellow needles, ana
 logous in all its properties to that of picoline. This identity
 was confirmed by analysis, which gave the following results:—
             5-648 grains of picoline from bone-oil gave

   For still further security, a determination of the platinum
in its double salt with the chloride was made:—
      12784 grains of chloride of platinum and picoline gave
       4'204     ...    platinum.
This corresponds to 32.88 per cent, and the calculation gives
32°94.                                      -
   The suspicion, then, of the occurrence of picoline in the
odorine of Unverdorben turns out to be perfectly correct; at
the same time my experiments have clearly shown that odo
rine is a mixture of picoline, with at least one other base, the (
properties of which will be detailed in the second part of this
investigation. The quantity of picoline contained in bone-oil
is considerable, and it can be more readily prepared from that
substance than from coal-tar naphtha; in fact, I obtained from
three hundred pounds of bone-oil a larger quantity of picoline
than that employed in my examination of it, which was ob
tained from some hundred gallons of coal-tar naphtha ; and
by means of it, I shall be enabled to trace out the products of
its decomposition, which I was unable to pursue in my former
COmmunication.
   The presence of aniline in bone-oil I have already alluded
to; and its quantity, though small, is by no means inconsi
derable, when compared with that of the other bases. I did
not think it necessary to take any further means for its identi
fication than its highly characteristic reactions with chloride
of lime and nitric acid.
   The investigation of the other bases is not yet in a suffi
ciently advanced state for publication. The sparingly soluble
one has been especially troublesome, and its purification is
attended by difficulties which I have not yet fully overcome.
The consideration of these will be taken up in the second part
of this investigation.
XXVII. Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending
   June 30, 1848. By JAMES GLAISHER, Esq., of the Royal
   Observatory, Greenwich *.                        -
     HE meteorological returns for the past quarter furnished
      to the Registrar-General have been obtained from thirty
seven different places, situated between the latitudes of 50°
and 55°, and between the longitudes of 5°18' W. and 0° 16' E.
   The results from every place have been examined and
further reduced by myself. The following are the particulars
of the weather during the quarter ending June 30, 1848.
                  * Communicated by the Author.

           during the Quarter ending June 30, 1848.          187
   The weather during the first month of this quarter was a
continuance of the wet weather of the two preceding months;
that during May was extremely fine; and that in the month
of June was changeable, wet and dull. Till April 5, the daily
temperatures of the air exceeded the averages of the same
days of seven previous years by 11°9, 12°8, 15°6, 16°1 and
7°2; on the 6th it was below the average, and for the most
part continued below, till May 2, at times to a great extent;
from this time till the 30th of May the daily temperatures
exceeded their averages by quantities varying from 2° to 15°.
From May 30 to the end of the quarter the daily temperatures
were below their average values, with the exception of eight
days only.
   In pursuance of the arrangement I have hitherto followed,
I will speak of each subject of investigation separately.
    The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich—
    For the month of April was 47°-6, which is 0°-6, 2°4, 0°-5
above those of the years 1841, 1842, and 1843 respectively,
4°. I below that in 1844; 19-3, O’-5, and 2°.3 above those of the
years 1845, 1846 and 1847; or it is 0°-5 above the average
of these seven years;
    For the month of May was 59°7, which is 2°-9, 6°-5, 7°5,
6°8, 10°-3, 5°1, and 3°3 above those of the years 1841 to 1847
respectively; or it is 6°1 above the average of “these seven
years;
    For the month of June was 58°5, which is 2°1, 2°2, and
0°-5 above those of the years 1841, 1843, and 1847 respectively,
4°4, 2°2, 2°2, and 6°8 below those of the years 1842, 1844,
 1845, and 1846, respectively; or it is 1°6 below the average of
these seven years.
    The mean value for the quarter was 55°3; that for 1841
was 53°4; for 1842 was 55°-8; for 1843 was 5.1°-9; for 1844
was 55°1; for 1845 was 52°1; for 1846 was 55°7; and for
 1847 was 53°2; so that the excess for this quarter above the
corresponding quarter in the years 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844,
 1845, and 1847, was 1°9, 1°5, 3°4, 0°2, 3°2, and 2°1; the
 only year between 1841 and 1847 whose mean temperature for
 this period exceeded that for the present year was 1846; the
 difference, however, is small, being 0°4 only. The average
 value for this quarter from the seven preceding years was
 53°6; so that the mean temperature of the air for the quarter
 ending June 30, 1848, exceeds that of the corresponding
 quarter in the preceding seven years by 1°7. In the quarter
 ending March 31, 1848, this value was found to be 1°7 in
 excess; and in that ending Dec. 31, 1847, it was found to be
 3°4 in excess; so that the mean temperature of the air in the
                               O2

188        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
nine months ending June 30, 1848, exceeds the average value
for the same period of time in the preceding seven years by
2°3.
    The mean temperature of the evaporation at Greenwich—
   For the month of April was 44°5, which is 0°4 above
that for the preceding seven years;
    For the month of May was 53°0, which is 2°-6 above that
for the preceding seven years;
   For the month of June was 54°4, which is 1°-2 below that
for the preceding seven years.
   The mean value for the quarter was 50°-6, which is 0°-6
above the average for the seven preceding years.
    The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich—
    For the month of April was 41°4, which is 0°7, 3°1,0°8,
and 4°-2 above those for the years 1841, 1842, 1845, and 1847
respectively; 1°2, 2°8, and 0.9 below those of the years
 1843, 1844 and 1846; or it is 0°-6 above the average of these
seven years;                                 -
    For the month of May was 48°6, which is 1°9, 2°7, 4°0,
and 0°-6 above those for the years 1842, 1844, 1845, and 1846
respectively, 2°2 and 0°:2 below those of the years 1841 and
 1843, and is the same as that for 1847; or it is 0°-9 above the
average for these seven years;
    For the month of June was 51°-6, which is 2°4, 0°4, 1°8
above those for the years 1841, 1843 and 1847 respectively;
2°7, 3°6, and 4°4 below those of the years 1842, 1845 and
 1846 respectively, and is the same as that for 1844, or it is
0°8 below the average for these seven years.
    The mean value for the quarter was 47°2, which is 0°-2
above the average for the corresponding period of the preceding
seven years.
    The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the
 º was 3-8 grains, which is 0.1 grain less than the average
  or the seven preceding years.
    The additional weight of water required to saturate a cubic
foot of air was 14 grain. The average for the seven preceding
years was 1-2 grain. The value required in May was 2 grains,
 and the mean value for May from the preceding seven years
is 0°-9 grain only.
    The mean degree of humidity of the atmosphere for April
 was 0-794, for May was 0.664, and for June was 0.768; these
 values being less than their averages for the seven preceding
years by 0:012, 0-154, and 0.012 respectively. The value for
 the quarter was 0.742, which is 0.059 less than the average
 for these years.
    The mean elastic force of vapour for the quarter was 0.343

           during the Quarter ending June 30, 1848.         189
inch, which is of the same value as the average of the seven
preceding years.
    The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich for April
was 29:589 inches, for May was 29-926 inches, and for June
was 29-642 inches; these values are 0.164 inch below, 0-158
inch above, and 0.167 inch below respectively the averages for
the seven preceding years. The mean value for the quarter
was 29-719 inches, which is 0.058 inch below the average for
these years.
    The mean reading in February was 29'517 inches, in March
was 29'505 inches, and in April, as above, 29'589 inches.
There is no similar instance in this century of the mean
reading of the barometer for any three consecutive months
being so small as this; the nearest approach to it was in the
months of November and December, 1803, and January, 1804.
    The average weight of a cubic foot of air under the average
temperature, humidity, and pressure, was 531 grains; the
average for the seven preceding years was 533 grains.
    The rain fallen at Greenwich in April was 3-4 inches; in
 May was 0-4 inch; and in June was 3.5 inches; the average
 values for the seven preceding years were 1.3 inch, 1.6 inch,
 and 1.5 inch respectively. The amount fallen in the quarter
 was 7-3 inches, which is 2.9 inches above the average of the
 corresponding quarters of seven previous years. The total
 amount fallen in this year till June 30 was i5-2 inches, which
 is nearly six inches above the average fall in this period as
 deduced from the above-mentioned years. So large a fall of
 rain as 7-3 inches has not occurred at the Observatory within
 the corresponding quarter since the year 1824; and so large
 a fall as 15 inches within the first six months of the year has
 not taken place within the previous thirty-three years, pro
 bably not within this century.                   -
     The temperature of the water of the Thames was 60°7 by
 day, and 59°6 by night. The water, on an average, was 3°6
 warmer than the air.
     The horizontal movement of the air was about 114 miles
 daily, being about its average value.
     The highest and lowest readings of the thermometer in Air at
 the height of four feet above the ground, and protected as
 much as possible from the effects of radiation and rain, were
 80°-O and 32°.O.
     The average daily range of the readings of the thermometer
 in Air at the height of four feet, were 16°7, 30°5, and 17°.7
  in the months of April, May, and June respectively. The ave
 rage ranges for these months from the observations of the
  seven preceding years were 16°7, 17°6, and 19°4. The range

 190        Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather
 in the month of May exceeded the average value for that
 month by 12°9, and it was larger than the mean daily range
 in any month in the preceding seven years. The next largest
 mean daily range was 22°5, which took place in the month
 of June 1846. The average for the quarter was 21°6, being
 3°4 in excess over the average for the seven years ending
 1847.
    In April the readings of the thermometer on grass were at
 or below 32° on twelve nights, and the lowest reading was 25°.
 In May they were at or below 32° on fourteen nights, and on
 eleven other nights the readings were below 40°. In June the
 lowest reading was 31°5: on six nights the readings were be
 tween 32°and 10°. The amount of heat radiated at night from
 the earth in the month of May was very great indeed. The
 observer at Leeds says, that white frosts were almost of nightly
 occurrence during this month. The observer at Beckington
 speaks of the severe frost of the 30th of June, and which was
 general over the south of England.
    The mean amount of cloud for April was 7-8, for May was
 3.0, and for June was 7-4. The month of May presented this
 remarkable peculiarity,+that the sky was absolutely cloudless
 both day and night during the first eight days, and almost free
from cloud till the 15th day, the atmosphere being free from
haze during this time. These circumstances are without a
parallel on record. The sky during the months of April and
June was more clouded than usual, so that the mean amount
for the quarter, viz. 5:9, is only 0:2 less than the average for
the corresponding quarter of the seven previous years.
   There were three exhibitions of the aurora borealis during
the quarter, which occurred on April 3, 7, and 29.
   The electricity in the atmosphere during the month of April
was generally in an active state, and rather more than the
average amount. It was frequently negative, which circum
stances always preceded or occurred during the fall of rain.
In the month of May the amount of electricity was small, and
particularly during the first half of the month, excepting on
the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, on which days very active positive elec
tricity was shown. Till the last week in June the electricity
was frequently active, being mostly positive, and at times ne
gative. Generally the electricity was positive at all times
when rain was not falling, and at times after rain had been
falling for some time.                                           -
   Thunder-storms at different parts of the country occurred
on April 1, 2, 7, 17, 19, May 10, 14, 15, 18, 20 and 26, June
12 and 22. The heaviest of these storms occurred on June 12,
and extended over all the southern parts of the country, in

            during the Quarter ending June 30, 1848.                   191
cluding latitude 52°; north of this parallel very heavy rain
fell. At many places on this day more than an inch of rain
fell in a few hours. Generally, however, the storms during
this quarter, and more particularly in the month of April, were
local, in many cases not extending beyond a radius of a mile.
The observer at Cardington says, “On April 2, at 4 P.M., an
exceedingly heavy storm of hail and rain fell; within twenty
minutes water to the depth of 0-64 inch was collected.” By
inquiries it appeared that this storm was confined within a cir
cumference of three miles.         The observer at Whitehaven says,
“that on May 14 a violent thunder-storm occurred, accom
panied by a heavy fall of triangular pieces of ice; near Gras
mere, garden plants, shrubs, and vegetables were completely
riddled, and eighty panes of glass were broken in a conserva
tory by the ice-shower. Though the ground was previously
quite warm, the hail, or rather ice, remained on the ground for
several hours, and in some places till the following morning.”
    This storm continued for about forty minutes, and was con
fined to a radius of less than two miles. Many other storms
of a similar character took place in different parts of the
country.
   Snow fell at Saffron Walden on April 9, at Greenwich *,
Lewisham, and Stone on April 10, and at Leeds on April 11.
The flakes at Stone measured three inches by two inches.
    The mean monthly temperatures of the places in Cornwall
and Devonshire have not been very different from those at
other places during this quarter; usually in the summer
months they are below those of other places.
    The reading of the barometer during the month of April was
fluctuating, and exhibited a continuance of those oscillations
and low readings mentioned in last report in February and
March. On April 1, at 9" A.M., the reading was 29.969 in
ches; slight variations only took place till the 5th, on this
day the reading decreased 0-3 inch, and on the 6th, at 6 P.M.,
was 29'516 inches, and still decreasing; on the 8th, at 6" P.M.,
it was 29-198 inches, it then turned to increase, and was
29.330 inches at midnight. On the 9th, at noon, it was
29:430 inches, when it again turned to decrease, and was
29' 183 inches on the 10th at midnight; shortly after this the
reading increased, and was 29'639 inches on the 11th at
3" P.M.; it again decreased, and was 29-301 inches on the
 12th at 6h A.M.; it then turned to increase, at first slowly, and
then quickly. The reading on the 12th at midnight was
   * The fact of snow having fallen on April 10 at Greenwich and Lewisham,
was inadvertently omitted in the remarks accompanying the Registrar
General's report.                                                    -

 192        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
29.928 inches; it then turned to decrease, and was 29-179
inches on the 18th at midnight; it continued at about this
value on the 19th and 20th; it then began to increase slowly,
 and reached 29-8 inches on the 26th at midnight; it then
 alternately decreased and increased by small quantities till the
 last day, when for the first time in the month it reached the
point 30 inches.
    From May 1 to 14 its readings were above 30 inches, the
highest being 30.217 inches on the 11th at 6" A.M.; this value
decreased to 29°155 inches on the 17th at 6h P.M.; it increased
to 30 inches on the 20th, and to 30'169 inches on the 24th ;
it passed below 30 inches on the 26th, and to the end of the
month the changes were small.
   During June the reading was generally low; its extreme
readings were 29.143 inches on the 3rd, and 30.015 inches on
the 20th.
    The heavy rains in April, following the wet weather of Fe
bruary and March, caused the land to be in a soddened state,
and rivers generally to be much swollen. The thunder-storms
in many places did much damage. The months of February,
March, and April were so wet that the spring corn was sown
with much difficulty. The month of May was distinguished
by high temperatures, cloudless skies both day and night for
a long period, very small falls of rain, with only the average
amount of water mixed with the air, notwithstanding the high
temperature, so that the degree of humidity was small. The
earth became sun-baked, and so hard as to be almost unbreak
able; vegetation was greatly checked. During the month
of June the earth became again saturated; the crops improved,
and at the end of the quarter there was every prospect of a
full average produce.
   The observer at Leeds says, “that in April the diseases in
the lungs affecting cattle and sheep were extremely frequent
and generally fatal. In May, notwithstanding the great heat
during the days, the almost nightly occurrence of white frosts
checked the growing vegetation greatly; the disease among
cattle and sheep was in a great measure stopped. In June,
with the return of wet and cold weather, the disease among
cattle again appeared. So <U+017F>atal a season to milch cows has
not occurred within my remembrance in this neighbourhood.
The potato crop is free from disease, and this vegetable is
so abundant, that I have never known it so cheap before at
this season.”
   The observer at Beckington says, “I have heard a good
deal of the potato disease in this parish, but my own are in
as healthy a state as they have ever been. The severe frost.

           during the Quarter ending June 30, 1848.           193
on Friday night, the 30th of June, struck the potato haulm,
and did much damage to the peas.”
    The approximate mean monthly values of the several sub
jects of investigation are printed in the Registrar-General's
quarterly report, for the time or times of the day that the obser
vations have been made. These numbers have been reduced as
follows:–First, for diurnal variations to deduce true monthly
values for each element; secondly, the reduced monthly mean
“elastic force of vapour’ was taken from the reduced “baro
meter readings;” thirdly, the mean of these reduced monthly
values were then taken; reducing that for the barometer to
the level of the sea, and in this way the subjoined quarterly
table was formed.
    From the numbers in the first column it seems that the
 volume of dry air was the same at all parts of the country.
 The mean of all these results is 29'554 inches, and this value
 may be considered as the pressure of dry air for England
 during the quarter ending June 30, 1848.
    From the numbers in the second column it seems that the
 mean temperature of the air for the quarter ending June 30,
 1848, in the counties of Cornwall and Devonshire, was 54°1;
 at places situated south of latitude 52° was 54°0; between
 the latitudes of 52° and 53° was 53°6; between the latitudes
 of 53° and 54° was 52°0; and of Durham and Newcastle was
 50°-7.
    The average daily range of the temperature of the air in
 Cornwall and Devonshire was 15°3; at Brighton, Liverpool
 and Whitehaven, was 14°9; south of the latitude of 52° was
 21°3; between the latitudes of 52° and 53° was 20°3; be
 tween the latitudes of 53° and 54° was 19°5; and of Durham
 and Newcastle was 14°-9.
    The greatest mean daily ranges took place at Latimer,
 Hartwell, Aylesbury, and Beckington respectively; and the
 least occurred at Liverpool, Brighton, Whitehaven, and New
 castle respectively.
    The highest thermometer reading during the quarter was
 at Leeds, which was 88°; and the lowest was also at Leeds,
 viz. 23°.   The extreme range of temperature in England
 during the quarter was therefore 65°, but this is probably
 somewhat too great.
    The average quarterly range of the reading of the thermo
 meter in Cornwall and Devonshire was 42°5; at Brighton,
 Liverpool, and Whitehaven, was 37°7; at all other places,
 except Beckington, Hartwell, Leeds and Wakefield, was 51°5.
    The direction of the wind has been so variable, that it is
 not possible to determine its mean direction. Observers in

          Mr. J. Glaisher’s Remarks on the Weather.          195
adjacent localities have estimated it differently. At all places
its strength seems to have been unusually small.
   From the numbers in the ninth column, the distribution of
cloud seems to have been the same at all places, and such as
to cover about one-half of the sky. This value is much less
than the average amount of cloud.
   The fall of rain during the quarter has greatly exceeded the
average amount for the season. The amount in May was
much below the average for that month. In the months of
April and June the amount was unusually large, particularly
in the latter month. The places at which rain fell on the
greatest number of days were Leeds, Nottingham, Stonyhurst,
Saffron Walden, &c.; and on the smallest number of days
were Thwaite, Scarva, Helston, Newcastle, &c. The places
at which the largest falls have taken place were Hereford,
 Stonyhurst, Southampton, York, Leeds, Wakefield, &c.;
and the places where the falls have been the least in amount,
are Saffron Walden, Cambridge, Newcastle, Stone, &c.; but
it would seem that the amount at the last-mentioned place is
wrong (see the amounts at Hartwell and Aylesbury). Ge
nerally the largest falls have been in Yorkshire, and the small
est in the counties north of Yorkshire.
    The numbers in column 12 to 16 contain the mean values
of the hygrometrical results at every station; from which we
find that—
    The mean weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air for En;
gland (excepting Cornwall and Devonshire) in the quarter
ending June 30, 1848, was 3.8 grains.
    The mean additional weight required to saturate a cubic
foot of air in the quarter ending June 30, 1848, was 1.1 grain.
    The mean degree of humidity in the quarter ending June 30,
 1848, was 0.778.
    The mean amount of vapour mixed with the air would have
produced water, if all had been precipitated at one time on the
 surface of the earth, to the depth of 4-6 inches.
    The mean weight of a cubic foot of air at the level of the
 sea, under the mean temperature, humidity and pressure, was
 584 grains.
    And these values for Cornwall and Devonshire were 3-8
<U+017F>º ;
 1Velv.
          1-2 grain; 0.765; 4.7inches; and 534 grains respect
    ºie results from the station in Ireland agree very closely
 with those in England in the same parallel of latitude, except
 ing those depending on the water mixed with the air, and in
these respects an excess of humidity is shown at this station.

XXVIII. On the Application of Quaternions to the Theory of
            Rotation. By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq.”
IN a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine, Fe
      bruary 1845, I showed how some formulae of M. Olinde
Rodrigues relating to the rotation of a solid body might be
expressed in a very simple form by means of Sir W. Hamilton's
theory of quaternions. The property in question may be thus
stated. Suppose a solid body which revolves through an angle
0 round an axis passing through the origin and inclined to the
axes of co-ordinates at angles a, b, c. Let
             1                       1                  l
    A=  tanãº   cos a,    P. H. tan 2 6 cos b,   w= tan 2 0 cos c,
and write
                        A= 1 +ix +ju + kv.
    Let a, y, z be the co-ordinates of a point in the body pre
vious to the rotation, ri, y, z, those of the same point after
the rotation, and suppose
                           II=ia +fy +kz
                           III = iri +jyi + k21.
The co-ordinates after the rotation may be determined by the
formula
                             III =ATIA-";
viz. developing the second side of this equation,
                       III = i. (24 +6/-H y2)
                           +j(alw-H 3'y--y'3)
                           +k(x"w-H 3"y+y's),
where, putting to abbreviate x = 1 + A*-Hp.”--vº, we have
      xx = 1 + A*–p.”—vº, x2' =2(Au--v), x2"=2(Ay—p),
      x3=2(Au-y), x3 = 1–X*-i-pº-vº, x6"=2(uy--A),
      xy=2(AV-FM), xy'-2(ºv–x), xy"– 1–3°—p.”+vº;
 these values satisfying identically the well-known system of
 equations connecting the quantities 2, 3, Y, a!, 6', ')', 2', 6", y”.
    The quantities a, b, c, 0 being immediately known when
 A, u, v are known, these last quantities completely determine
 the direction and magnitude of the rotation, and may therefore
 be termed the co-ordinates of the rotation—A will be the qua
 ternion of the rotation, I propose here to develope a few of
 the consequences which may be deduced from the preceding
 formulae.

    Suppose, in the first place, II = A-1, then III = A–1, which
evidently implies that the point is on the axis of rotation. The
equation III = II gives the identical equations
                      A(2–1)+Pe3+vy=0
                      Aa' +P.(3–1)+vy'-0

From which, by changing the signs of A, w, v, we derive
                      A(x-1)+ ºx'+va"=0
                      A3+p.(8–1)+ w8"=0
                      Ay-Fºy'+ w(y"–1)=0.
 Whence evidently, whatever be the value of II,
                           AIIA-" —II–0,
 if after the multiplication i, j, k are changed into A, w, v, a
 property which will be required in the sequel.
     By changing the signs of A, º, v, we also deduce
                   A-IIA = i. (aw-Hay-Ha's)
                              +j(3r--8'y--8"×)
                              +k. (ya-i-yy-Fy"2),
 where a, 3, y, a!, 6', 'y', 2', 8", "y" are the same as before.
     Let the question be proposed to compound two rotations
  (both axes of rotation being supposed to pass through the
  origin). Let L be the first axis, A the quaternion of rotation,
  L' the second axis, which is supposed to be fixed in space, so
 as not to alter its direction by reason of the first rotation,
 A' the corresponding quaternion of rotation. The combined
 effect is given at once by
                       II, = A'(ATIA-1)A'-', i. e.
                       III = A'A.II.(A'A)-".
  Or since if A, be the quaternion for the combined rotations
  III = A, IIAT', we have clearly                                -
                              A1= M1A'A,
  M, denoting the reciprocal of the real part of A'A, so that
                        MT-1-xx!—pp!—w.
  Retaining this value, the coefficients of the combined rotations
  are given by
                       Al-M1(x+x'+p'w-pºw)
                       *1=M1(u +9/--w'A-VA)

198       Mr. A. Cayley on the Application of Quaternions

x, x', x, as before. An or A" may be determined with equal faci
lity in terms of A', Al, or A, A1. These formulae are given in my
paper on the rotation of a solid body (Camb. Math. Journal,
vol. iii. p. 226).
    If the axis L' be fixed in the body and moveable with it,
its position after the first rotation is obtained from the formula
II, = AIIA- by writing II-A'— 1. Representing by A"—1
the corresponding value of III, we have A"=AA'A-", which is
the value to be used instead of A' in the preceding formula for
the combined rotations, i. e. the quaternion of rotation is pro
portional to AA'A-". A, that is to AA'. So that here
                              A = M1AA',
which only differs from the preceding in the order of the qua
ternion factors.       If the fixed and moveable axes be mixed
together in any order whatever, the fixed axes taken in order
being L, L', ... and the moveable axes taken in order being
Lo, L'o... then the combined effect of the rotation is given by
                          A = M ...A"A"AAoA'o...,
M being the reciprocal of the real term of the product of all
the quaternions.
    Suppose next the axes do not pass through the same point.
If x, 6, y be the co-ordinates of a point in L, and
                             T=ai +éj+ 'yk,
the formula for the rotation is
                         III–I'=A(II—I)A-",
Or
                      III = AIIA-1. – (ATA-1–D),
where the first term indicates a rotation round a parallel axis
through the origin, and the second term a translation.
    For two axes L., L' fixed in space,
              III = A'A. II. (A'A)-l.
                    —(A'T'A'-1–I")—A'(ATA-1–I)A'-1;
and so on for any number, the last terms being always a trans
lation. If the two axes are parallel, and the rotations equal
and opposite,
                               A = A-1.,
whence
                    II, +II+A'(I–I")A'-(T-T);
or there is only a translation. The constant term vanishes if

i,j, k are changed into A', p.", V, which proves that the trans
lation is in a plane perpendicular to the axes.
   Any motion of a solid body being represented by a rotation .
and a translation, it may be required to resolve this into two
rotations.    We have
                            III-A,IIAF-T,
where T is a given quaternion whose constant term vanishes.
Whence, comparing this with the general formula just given
for the combination of two rotations,
              A = A'A. M.
              T=–(AT'A'-1–I")—A'(ATA-1–I)A-1,
the second of which equations may be simplified by putting
Al-TA'-S, by which it may be reduced to
                 S=(Al-I"A"— I')–(AIA-1–T),
which, with the preceding equation Al=MA'A, contains the
solution of the problem. Thus if A or A' be given, the other
is immediately known; hence also S is known. If in the last
equation, after the multiplication is completely effected, we
change i, j, k into A, w, v, or x', u/, V, we have respectively,
               S=A'-'I''A'—T',     S=–(AIA-1–I),
which are equations which must be satisfied by the coefficients
of T' and T respectively. Thus if the direction of one axis is
given, that of the other is known, and the axes must lie in
certain known planes. If the position of one of the axes in
its plane be assumed, the equation containing S divides itself
into three others (equivalent to two independent equations)
for the determination of the position in its plane of the other
axis. If the axes are parallel, A, u, v are proportional to A', w, v';
or changing i, j, k into A, w, v, or x', w, v', we have S=0; or
what is the same thing, T=0, which shows that the transla
tion must be perpendicular to the plane of the two axes.
    If p, q, r have their ordinary signification in the theory of
rotation, then from the values in the paper in the Canbridge

 XXIX. Geometry and Geometers. Collected by T. S. DAVIEs,
                      Esq., F.R.S. and F.S.A.”
                               No. II.
 I    HAVE already mentioned that there are twenty-seven
       letters of Dr. Simson's to John Nourse in the collection
before me. There are also two from Simson's pupil, Dr. James
Moor; and three notes from Dr. Robert Smith of Cambridge
(the founder of the “Smith's prizes,” to obtain which is now
quite as high a distinction as to be senior wrangler): all of
which relate to Simson. To this series the present and the
next communications will be confined.
    Dr. Trail, in his Life of Simson, p. 26, has a passage which
will throw light on this correspondence. “The hesitation
about making additions to the Treatise of Apollonius [on Plane
Loci] probably contributed to the delay in printing the work,
which was not executed till 1749.         He then met with some
unexpected difficulties in treating with a bookseller for the
sale of the whole impression, which alone prevented the pub
lication at that time; and except a few copies distributed
amongst his friends in 1750, the book remained unpublished
till after his death.”
    This information is founded on a letter of Dr. Simson to
Earl Stanhope (at least all but the statement of the actual time
of publication being after Simson's death; which is a mere
inference, and an erroneous one), dated Sept. 10, 1750. Now
it appears in the course of these letters that Nourse was in
personal intercourse with the Earl at a period shortly after
wards, and that this intercourse did not appear to be of recent
origin. Nothing is more likely than that the Earl at once
brought the matter under the notice of Nourse; for the first
letter of this series is dated Glasgow, Jan. 1, 1751, in answer
to one referred to in it, from Nourse of the “25th Oct. last.”
It will be seen from the first three of these letters, that the
Loci Plani was actually published in London almost imme
diately, instead of being delayed till after Simson's death, as
Dr. Trail infers. A subsequent letter will also show that
the work “did not sell,”—even in an age in which it has been
represented that geometry was more ardently cultivated than ,
it is in our own.
                                            “Glasgow, 1st Jan. 1751.

slender performances. I would by no means have so long delayed to
write in answer to your civil letter, but that I every post expected to
have heard of the receipt of Nine copies I sent more than half a year
ago to Stationers' Hall, that I might inform you of the books (I mean
the Loci Plani) being to be speedily published, but notwithstanding
I have dunned the person to whose care I committed the Sending
of these copies from Edinburgh, ever since he told me of their being
ready to be shipt for London, I have not yet account of their being
got there. I beg you will forgive my incivility in not writing sooner,
and that you will be so good as to write me how to direct a letter to
the keeper of Stationers' Hall whose name I know not, or, if it were
not too much trouble that you would, as the speedier way, acquaint
me if he has received these 9 copies, and if he has not already sent
a receipt of them to be given me, that you would get one and trans
mit it to me, upon which I should immediately order the book to be
published in the Lon. Gazette and some other of the publick papers.
   “The price of it to the publick, bound, I am advised to make 11 sh:
the finest paper, and 9 shill: the other, which is not much coarser;
and to Booksellers who take 100 or more copies 5 sh; in sheets, one
third of the best and 3ds of the other paper. It consists of 31 sheets
and # sheet over in 4to, and there are about 700 copies printed by
Mr. Foulis here.
   “As for the Conick Sections, Mr. Alexander Kincaid Bookseller
in Edinburgh bought the entire right from me more than a year ago,
nay it is a year since he reprinted them at Edinburgh; but they are
not yet published, and I heard last week that all the Copper plates
were not cast off as yet, for what reason I know not ; so it is to him
you are to apply if you incline to have any of them. I have corrected
a good many things and changed some Demonstrations for the better.
Some few things have been added by my friend Mr. Matth. Stewart
and my self, an account of which you will see at the end of the
Preface. I wish you a happy new year, and am

     These three letters fully prove the period of the publication
  of the Loci Plani; whilst the quaint stile and the indications
  of Simson's methodical habits, give independent interest to
  them. I find amongst these letters no further reference to
  the work in question till near the close of the correspondence,
  namely in a letter dated June 29, 1767, a few months before
 his death, and when he had nearly completed his eightieth
 year. He says:–
    “I am sorry the Loci plani do not Sell, but indeed the taste for
 the Antient Geometry or indeed any Geometry seems to be quite
 worn out, and for want of acquaintance with it not a few blunders
 appear in the modern books; I know not if you have observed one
 in Kirkby's book of the doctrine of ultimators, which even a tolerable
 knowledge in the Algebraick doctrine of Loci might have prevented;
 in page 115 at the bottom you see there and in next page he makes
 the curve which he calls Pyriformis to be of a different kind from the
 Ellipsis, but in page 125 where he gives you the AEquation of it, viz:
 2cv-vv4–v=s it appears to be formed by two arches of two equal
 and Similar Ellipses meeting one another. I could not prevail with
 myself to read his doctrine of Ultimators tho Mr. Will. Trail lent me
 the book to consider Something about that Doctrine; Pray let me
 know what you or any of your friends that deal in these things think
 of his performance, and if he sufficiently makes out what he designed.
    “Could I think I were able, both in respect of memory and eye
 Sight, to print Apollonius two books de Sectione Determinata,
 which Mr. Trail who is here, and is to stay till October, has from
 me for some weeks past to read over and observe any errors, I would
when I published them put the Loci plani after them; perhaps the
 Novelty of the first might help of the other. Mr. Trail is very
urgent with me to make the wooden cuts, which I believe I shall do
even tho' they should never be used by me; If I come the length
of resolving to print, I shall write to you for paper.
    “I wish your health and business, both which I heartily pray may
encrease, could allow you to write to me oftener, it would refresh
me much. Pray let me know how much I am in your debt, and let
our Accounts be Settled and cleared. I believe I wrote to you for
merly that, if I can do no better, I design to send you the copies of
the Loci plani and the Latin 4” Euclide of which I have a good
number, for any price you think fit, or for no price at all rather than
let them lie useless beside me.”
    The last letter of this series is dated Sept. 11, 1767 (pro.
bably his last letter to Nourse), a few months before his death.

    much better than he has done by bringing in Ultimate ratios which

    Mr. William Trail who is Professor of Mathematics in the new Col

    his uncle Dr. Trail Professor of Divinity, he has copied over for me
    a few sheets, I believe but one or two at most, concerning the limits
    of ratios from which the rules for finding fluxions are geometrically
    deduced, and he also copied as short a paper concerning the elemen

    rately treated of; if I find myself in tolerable health next Spring, for I
    am afraid how I shall stand thro’ the winter, I design to annex these
    two small things to the Sectio Determinata and print them ; but if
    God see fit to determine otherwise by my want of health, I design
    to leave the care of printing them to Mr. Trail who is a worthy good
    young man and an Excellent Mathematician for his age ; and I de
    sign to do the same with respect to the Porisms if I can get them
    ready to be put into his hands.”
       This letter is marked on the back with a memorandum in
    Nourse's hand, “answered April 16, 1768;” and as Simson
    lived only till the 1st of October, it is probable that he never
    wrote in reply.
       The complaint which Simson makes of the ancient geo
    metry being “worn out,” was then only too true in respect to
    academic history: yet amongst non-academic mathematicians
    in this country, of whom Dr. Simson seems to have known
    little, nothing could be less accurate. I find that even in
    Cambridge, a considerable degree of patronage was afforded
    to Simson's Euclid; for in the letters of Dr. Robert Smith,
    there is notice of a remittance of 28l. 15s., dated April 4, 1756,
    and another respecting 10l. 16s. on account of this work. We
    ought also to recollect how very extensively the geometrical
    writings of Thomas Simpson had been diffused; and the pe
    riodicals devoted to mathematics (as the Lady’s Diary, the
    Gentleman's Diary, the Mathematician, and others) will show
    how strongly geometry prevailed amongst non-academic men
    in those days, and the eminent powers of investigation pos
... sessed by those geometers. It cannot be denied, however,

206      Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
that as a general rule, geometry has held a very subordinate
and precarious position in our universities since the commence
ment of the preceding century; whilst non-academic men, till
very recent times, have manifested extraordinary skill in such
researches. It is certainly a curious fact, that since our non
academic men have devoted so much more of their attention
to analysis, (for I believe that Messrs. Lowry and Whitley
remain the only two representatives of the old English school
of geometers now left us,) the tide is setting, in one of our uni
versities at least, in the direction of the ancient geometry.
   It would appear from the last of these letters, that the edi
ting of the posthumous works of Simson was not a work of
considerable difficulty; and indeed they are probably printed
nearly in the state that they were left by their distinguished
author. There is no doubt that with due attention there might
have been selected from his papers things much more worthy
of publication than those printed in the appendix, —the last
proposition, however, excepted. This one is important in re
spect to a problem of great celebrity—that of the “tactions”
of Apollonius: but on this head I must refer to a paper in the
Mathematician, vol. iii. p. 77, where its importance is esta
blished.
   There still exists (as I am informed by a friend to whom
I refer in the paper just quoted) in the library of the Escurial,
an Arabic translation of the Sectio Determinata.        If it were
possible for another Halley to compare that translation with
the restoration of the work by Simson, it would be a sub
ject of the greatest interest; inasmuch as it would fully de
cide the degree of confidence which we should place in any
“restorations” whatever, this being the one upon which Sim
son appears to have bestowed more care than upon any of his
works except the Porisms.
   I think the conclusion of Kirkby's preface ought to disarm
criticism with respect to his “Doctrine of Ultimators.” The
work itself, indeed, never appears to have attracted much at
tention; and it is now altogether forgotten, except by a few
collectors of mathematical curiosities.    The remark of Simson,
however, is correct; for the equation which Kirkby brings
out (which is unexceptionable except as to the omission of the
sign + from the radical) is that of the ellipse. As a general
rule, however, curves generated by means of ordinates to the
circle assume more convenient forms of equation when polar
co-ordinates are employed, though there occasionally occur
exceptions to it—of which the pyriformis is one.

XXX. On a new and practical Voltaic Battery of the highest
   powers, in which Potassium forms the positive element.          By
   John GooDMAN, Esq.”
     OTASSIUM is well known in science as one of the most
      powerful chemical substances, possessing chemical affini
ties and powers of the highest order. This substance appears
to have been long known also in an electrical point of view,
for we find it arranged by Sir H. Davy and others at the head
of a list of positive and negative metals, in which it forms the
principal oxidizable metal, being, with its amalgams, electro
positive to all other metals arranged in electrical relations
with it.
    It was with this knowledge of the high powers of potassium,
that the author, whilst pursuing his researches into the      º
of light, heat, electricity, &c., devised several experiments wit
the intention of constructing a voltaic arrangement, in which
this metal should form one element. At first, the potassium,
amalgamated, was suspended by a copper wire in mineral
naphtha, floating upon dilute sulphuric acid. In the acid
liquid a plate of platinum was arranged, in connexion with
one extremity of the galvanometer, to the opposite extremity
of which the potassium wire was attached. On lowering the
potassium down to the surface of the acidulated water, a cur
rent of 60° or 70° was observed, and a strong action ensued,
which after a few moments generally dislodged the metal from
its connexions, and put an end to the experiment.
    After many fruitless attempts permanently to fasten the
metal upon its wire of communication, it was remembered that
in one instance a very efficient voltaic pair had been formed,
in which a simple copper wire of a spiral form merely sur
rounded the wet bladder in which the zinc element was im
mersed in dilute acid, being only in contact with, and acting
through, the substance of the membrane, although unimmersed
in any fluid. Advantage was taken of this knowledge, and it
was contemplated that potassium might, as possessing such
extraordinary affinities, also act upon water through an inter
vening membrane. Thus might its excessive action be mode
rated, and itself rendered probably quiet and manageable.
    On the 5th of May last the following plan was ultimately
adopted after much consideration, and proved successful be
yond my most sanguine expectations. A wine-glass was filled
with dilute sulphuric acid, and in this was immersed a plate
of platinum just below the surface of the liquid. At the ex

 tremity of a short length of glass tubing a piece of membrane
 was tied, so as to close up its lower end, which was by an
 appropriate stand so fixed that the membrane or diaphragm
 should come in contact with the surface of the acidulated
 water, immediately above the immersed plate of platinum.
  Into this tube was dropped a globule of mercury, which, lying
 upon the membrane, would serve to amalgamate and keep in
 that condition the piece of potassium destined for this situation.
 The tube was then filled with mineral naphtha, so that the
 metal could be raised at pleasure into a medium in which it
 would remain perfectly quiescent, and would only suffer loss
 when required so to do.
    The potassium, weighing about half a grain, was now
 screwed upon the “tapped '' extremity of the copper wire,
 upon which a shoulder or button of wood was also screwed,
 about one-sixteenth of an inch from its extremity, to prevent
 the wire perforating the potassium too far, and coming itself
 in contact with the diaphragm. This wire was (as is usual) in
 metallic communication with the immersed platinum, and for
 the purpose of raising or depressing the potassium in its cell,
 a moveable mercury cup formed the medium of communication.
 From this the potassium hung suspended by its wire, upon
 which a small weight was affixed, to ensure the continuous
 contact and close application of this metal to the membrane.
    With the apparatus thus arranged, it was found that potas
 sium became a very manageable element in a voltaic battery;
and on lowering it into contact with the diaphragm, a conti
nuous current of 45° to 50° was observed by the aid of an in
tervening galvanometer. To test the comparative power of
 this arrangement with an ordinary pair, two plates, one of zinc
the other of copper, 2} inches by 1% inch, were employed in
deflecting the same galvanometer. And it was found that in
very fierce action in water, strongly acidulated with sulphuric
acid, they only deflected the galvanometer to 65°, which in a
few minutes fell to 61°, although at that period in fair brisk
action.

this single pair was beautiful and emergetic; and what was
remarkable, continued some time (decreasingly) after the pla
tina plate was disconnected, the electric energy of the potas
sium still inducing current.
   Exp. 2. With sulphate of copper solution, the next very
small piece of potassium gave only 10° of deflection, and 5°
during decomposition, which was tolerably rapid. Afterwards
a deflection of 50° in another experiment, which fell to 5° in
decomposition.
    Exp. 3. With dilute acid only, galvanometer 55°; but
during decomposition, which was very <U+017F>aint, only 24°.
    Exp. 4. In neither case could decomposition be effected in a
second decomposing cell.
    Exp. 5. With a copper plate instead of platina, a deflection
from 45° to 50° fell during decomposition, which was not
powerful, to 5°. Decomposition could not be effected in two
cells.
   There is a peculiar property of electricity, exhibited in all
its various modifications, which is considered by the author as
the distinguishing quality of electric force. It is first perceived
in the tendency of all substances exposed to the action of elec
tric force, to assume what is termed a polar condition.             It has
been shown by Dr. Faraday to exist in the molecules of the
various substances which are interposed between the decom
posing poles, or electrodes of a voltaic arrangement. The
author suggests that it is this polar condition which causes,
by the simple law of attraction and repulsion, the elements of
any fluid under decomposition to progress towards, and ulti
mately to be deposited upon, or chemically combined with,
that pole of the apparatus to which they severally belong, by
a law as certain as the force of gravitation itself+.
   This quality of electric force does not depend upon the quan
tity of fluid eristing in a circuit; for the ordinary electricity
manifests it in a much higher degree than does voltaic fluid,
although the latter is found at all times incomparably greater
in quantity. The author of this paper has frequently decom
posed water in four successive cells, by the current from a
single electrical machine; and yet to effect decomposition in
one cell by voltaic power, several pairs are required.
   It is found that this state of polarization is at all times ac
companied by other characteristics in proportion to its inten
   * As conduction destroys polarity, this polar condition could have no
existence if the battery-current were conducted by the electrolyte, as sug
gested by Dr. Faraday, and upon which basis the whole of his electric no
menclature is founded. (See experiments 46, 48 and 49.)

 210     Mr. J. Goodman on a new and practical Voltaic Battery.
 sity. It is observable, that the higher the polar condition,
 the greater are its powers of transmission, or conduction,
 through various known aeriform media, liquids and solid
 bodies. And when at its maximum, as seen in ordinary elec
 tricity, and lightning, it is found to be accompanied by, and
 capable of inducing attraction and repulsion of whole sub
 stances of a light nature, as gold-leaf, pith-balls, &c. The
power of chemical combination and decomposition appears to
 be also dependent upon this quality, or polar condition of
 bodies.
    Mr. Gassiot has shown that deflection of gold-leaf may be
produced or developed by chemical substances possessing the
lowest chemical powers in voltaic arrangements, if a sufficient
number of well-insulated pairs only be employed, which he has
also beautifully illustrated by a water battery of 3500 pairs.
So it is shown by the following experiments, that a chemical
substance of the highest powers of affinity will develope, by a
very few pairs, the same phaenomena.
    An attempt was now made to construct twelve pairs of plates
of the description aforementioned. By means of glass pillars
and an appropriate framework of wood, each pair was kept
insulated from the other, and twelve wine-glasses formed the
jars for this beautiful little battery. The whole being com
pleted, an attempt was made to produce the deflection of gold
leaf. A micrometer-screw was arranged so as to cause a
copper disc to recede or approach the lower extremity of a
suspended slip of gold-leaf, and on connecting the poles of
the battery with the same, a deflection was readily produced
of above one-tenth of an inch with twelve pairs. The solution
of sulphate of copper was here employed unacidulated.
    I believe Mr. Grove has succeeded in affecting gold leaves
by a small number of pairs of his gas battery; and I am not
yet aware how small a number of my arrangement will pro
duce sensible action upon the electroscope, but shall shortly
attempt this inquiry, when time permits *.
    These experiments with potassium tend to show, that there
is a very intimate relation (if not a complete analogy) between
electrical and chemical phaenomena, as shown by Sir H. Davy.
For the substance which possesses the highest chemical affinity
is here shown to manifest also the most exalted electrical energy
or tension, and vice versä ; and this electrical energy is at all
   * Since this paper was read, the author has attempted the deflection of
gold-leaf by six pairs, and succeeded very satisfactorily. Five pairs, four,
three, and two were tried, and a measured deflection took place in each
instance ; and ultimately one pair alone produced a sensible and measured
deflection,

action for two hours, and, by a little contrivance, the potassium
was in each cell simultaneously raised from its membrane into
the supernatant naphtha, and remained there in a quiescent
 state until the following evening, when it was again used with
 facility; no loss having occurred of any consequence, except
in the giving way of three membranes. It was found that, for
 delicate experiments with one pair, goldbeaters' skin or turkey's
 craw is considerably more efficient than bladder: decomposi

 XXXI. Remarks on a Paper by the Rev. Brice Bronwin,
       On the Solution of a particular differential Equation.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
 THERE          is a single explanation which, after reading Mr.
       Bronwin's remarks published in the last Number of your
 Journal, I deem it right to make.
     Mr. Bronwin observes that I have in various papers made
 assertions without alleging any proof, or entering into any
  sufficient explanation, and that he was led to conclude from
  this, that I held it to be always lawful to reject the supernu
  merary constants of the solution of a differential equation.
     I think it probable that in the instances to which Mr. Bron
  win refers, sufficient detail was not given. Having clearly
  stated in one paper the general principles which decide whether
  the elements in question are to be rejected or determined, I
  have in subsequent applications of the same method, contented
  myself with simply referring to the original paper, and, in one
  instance, with applying the principle without reference. Mr.
  Bronwin will find upon examination that the results are in
  each instance correct, and that the cases are mutually analo
  gous, the real point of analogy being the relative position of
  the direct and the inverse factors of operation. But inasmuch
  as there may really have been a deficiency of needful expla–
  nation, I feel it just to make the present acknowledgement;
  and had the same view of the case presented itself to me be
  fore, I would have made it sooner.
                        I am, Gentlemen,

  XXXII. An Account of a Method of determining the Total
    Intensity of the Earth's Magnetic Force in Absolute Measure.
    By the Rev. H. LLoyd, D.D., President of the Royal Irish
    Academy".
      HE ordinary process for the determination of the earth's
        magnetic º, it is well known, consists in observing
 the time of vibration of a freely-suspended horizontal magnet,
 whose moment of inertia is known; and then employing the
 same magnet to deflect another, similarly suspended, and ob
 serving the angle of deflection at a given distance. From
 these two observations the horizontal component of the earth's
 magnetic force is deduced; and the total force is thence in
 ferred, by multiplying by the secant of the inclination.
    This method is inapplicable in the high magnetic latitudes.
 The relative error of the force, arising from a given error of
 inclination, varies as the tangent of that angle; and where
 the inclination approaches 90°, it becomes so great as to ren
 der the result valueless.        I was induced to consider the means
 of supplying this defect,      "É. the occasion of the expedition of
 Sir John Franklin to the Polar Sea in 1845; and I have been
 recently led to re-examine the problem, on account of the two
 Arctic expeditions, under Sir James Ross and Sir John Ri
 chardson, which are now in course of preparation.
    The object to be attained is to determine the total force
 directly, without the intervention of its horizontal component.
 The ordinary inclinometer will serve for this purpose. The
statical method, in which the position of the dipping-needle is
observed under the combined action of magnetism and gra
vity t, will enable us to determine the product of the earth’s
 total magnetic force into the moment of free rºagnetism of
 the needle; and the ratio of the same quantities may be ob
tained (as in the case of the horizontal component) by removing
 this needle, and employing it to deflect another substituted in
its place.
    Let us suppose, for generality, that the needle moves in
any vertical plane, inclined to the plane of the magnetic meri
dian by the angle a ; and let R denote the earth's magnetic
force, X and Y its horizontal and vertical components, and m
the magnetic moment of the needle. Then the effective mag
   * From the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, January 24, 1848.
   t The principle of this method appears to have been first suggested by
Mr. Christie, for the relative determination of the intensity; and it has been
since applied, under different modifications, by Mr. Fox and myself, to the
same purpose. Mr. Fox's mode of applying it, although not the simplest
in practice, is undoubtedly the best.

  netic forces are m X cos cº, my ; and their moment to turn the
  needle is
                     m(Y cos 7–X cos a sin m);
  in which m denotes the actual inclination of the needle to the
  horizon. This moment is opposed by that of the weight. Let
 this be applied in the manner adopted by Mr. Fox, namely,
 at the circumference of a light pulley, whose centre is on the
 axis of the cylindrical axle. Its moment is in this case inde
 pendent of the position of the needle, and is equal to the
 weight W, multiplied by the radius r, of the pulley at whose
 circumference it is applied. Accordingly, the equation of
 equilibrium is
                 m(Y cos 7–X sinn cos x)=Wr. . . . (1.)
    There are two cases which deserve consideration, namely,
 that in which the plane of motion of the needle coincides with
 the magnetic meridian, and that in which it is perpendicular
 to it. º the former case &=0; and substituting for X and Y
 their values, R cos 0 and R sin 6 (3 being the inclination), the
 preceding equation becomes
                       mR sin (0–1) = Wr; . . . . . (2.)
 from which we obtain mR, the product of the earth's magnetic
 force into the moment of free magnetism of the needle, when
 W and r are known, and the angles 0 and n given by obser
 vation. In the latter case, &=90°, and (1.) becomes
                        my cos n=Wr; . . . . . . (3.)
 which gives the similar product in the case of the vertical
component of the force.
    Now let the needle be removed, and applied to deflect
another which is substituted in its place; and let the deflect
ing needle be placed so that its axis passes through the centre
of the supported needle, and is perpendicular to its axis. Then
the moment of its force to turn the needle is mm'U, in which
m' is the moment of free magnetism of the second needle, and
 U a function of D, the distance of the centres of the two
needles, of the form
                          2        p      g
                    U=#(4 5, #).
The moment of the earth's magnetic force, opposed to this, is
of the form already assigned, in which we have only to sub
stitute m' and º' for m and n. Hence the equation of equili
brium is
                   Y cos º'-X sin º'cos 2–m U. . . . (4.)

214 The Rev. Dr. Lloyd on determining the Total Intensity
   When the plane of motion of the needle coincides with the
magnetic meridian, or z=0, this becomes
                      R. sin (0–1) = m U; . . . . . (5.)
which gives the ratio of the earth's magnetic force to the mag
netic moment of the needle, when U is known, and the angles
0 and º' given by observation. The coefficients p and q, in
the value of U, may be obtained (as in the ordinary method)
by observing the angles of deflection, 6–7, at different di
stances; it is probable, however, that their values may be
inferred, d priori, from the lengths of the needles, with as
much accuracy as is attainable in observations of this nature.
When the plane of motion is perpendicular to the magnetic
meridian, or a = 90°,

two observations in the plane of the meridian : for, multiply

   The equations (3.) (6.) furnish, in like manner, a similar
value of the vertical component of the force.
   In order to determine the probable error in the resulting
value of the force, arising from the errors of the observed
angles, u and u', we have to observe that the moveable needle
is acted on, in each case, by two forces, one of which is the
moment of the earth's magnetic force mR sin u, while the other
is constant. Hence, in any position, the directive force is
                       F=m R. sin u-G.
Let uo denote the value of u, corresponding to F-0, or to the
case of equilibrium; then mR sin uo-G, and
                     F=mR (sin u– sin uo).               -
Let u=wo--Auo, Auo being a small angle,_or, in other words,
let the needle be displaced by a small amount from the posi

the displacement be just balanced by friction; then

 s denoting the value of Auo corresponding to uo-0, or the
limit of the error due to friction in the natural position of the
needle, under the influence of the earth's magnetic force alone.
    To find the error in the value of R, corresponding to Auo,
 we have only to differentiate the equation of equilibrium with
 respect to R and uo, and we have

    We see, then, that the relative error in the value of the
 force resulting from friction, in either part of the process, is
inversely as the sine of the angle of deflection; and that it is
therefore requisite for accuracy that these angles should be
considerable. The angle of deflection may obviously be as
large as we please in the first part of the process, where the
deflection is caused by a weight; but in the second, a large
deflection can only be produced by a massive magnet, and
such a magnet cannot be employed in the first part without
impairing the accuracy of the result by the increased friction.
The conditions of accuracy required in the two parts of the
process are therefore incompatible.
   We evade this difficulty by employing the inclinometer for
one only (namely, the second) of the two observations, and
completing the process by the determination of the magnetic
moment of the bar in the ordinary method. This method is
applicable to the determination of mix and º (and, therefore,
also to that of m) in the high magnetic latitudes; and we have
only to substitute the value so obtained in the formula derived
from (5.),

is therefore to be preferred to the old in the high magnetic.
latitudes, provided that the angle of deflection be sufficiently
great; and the relative accuracy increases indefinitely as the
observer approaches the magnetic pole. ,
   It should be observed that the two observations for the
determination of m may be made in a room, where the mag
nets are under the action of local disturbing forces; it is only
necessary that these forces should not be so great as to alter
the magnetic distribution in the deflecting bar, and that they
should remain unchanged during the observation. This cir
cumstance of course will contribute to the facility of the ob
servation, and to the exactitude of the result, It will pro
bably not be necessary to repeat these observations on every
occasion on which the value of R is sought by deflection; the
repetition being, in fact, unnecessary so long as the moment
of the deflecting bar continues unchanged.
   For the observation of deflection it is only required that the
inclinometer should be provided with a revolving arm, move
able round the centre of the divided circle, for the support of
the deflecting magnet; while a second arm, connected wit
the former, and at right angles to it, carries the

 XXXIII. An Investigation on the Chemical Nature of War.

    I. On Cerotic Acid, a new Acid contained in Bees'-War.
    N the summer of 1845, while studying at Giessen, in the
      laboratory of Professor von Liebig, f undertook, at the
request of that distinguished chemist, the analysis of certain
waxes which were the results of an experiment made by M.
Gundlach of Cassel, of feeding bees upon different kinds of
sugar. It is not my intention to give those analyses here, and .
I mention them now only for the purpose of stating that it
was this circumstance which first turned my attention to the
inquiry of which I now offer the results to the Royal Society,
   * From the Philosophical Transactions, part i.; having been received by
the Royal Society March 2, and read March 30, 1848.
   Phil. Mag. S. 8. Vol. 33. No. 221. Sept. 1848.                 Q

218            Mr. B. C. Brodie's Investigation on the
and that it was in Professor von Liebig’s laboratory that this
investigation was begun.
   Various chemists have beforeme undertaken asimilarinquiry.
The chemical history of a substance so abundant in nature
and so useful to man as wax was always a curious question.
Of late it has acquired a peculiar interest from our knowledge
derived from repeated experiments, that wax is formed in the
organs of the bee, and that in the body of that insect that
remarkable change of sugar into wax takes place, the know
ledge of the true conditions of which would, we may hope,
throw light upon the formation of fatty bodies, and on the way
by which out of vegetable products the continual repair of the
animal structure is effected. The first step to such a know
ledge must be the accurate study of the chemical nature of
those substances which are thus produced.
    But little progress however has been made in this inquiry.
I may sum up in a few words those results already known
which, by my own experiments, I am able to confirm as true.
 It has been ascertained that wax is separable by alcohol into
two portions, which have been called cerine and myricine;
that, by the action of potash upon wax, an acid or acids may
 be obtained, and also an unsaponifiable body, ceraine; and
that by the distillation of wax we obtain volatile oils, solid
hydrocarbon, and an acid which has been surmised to be mar
garic acid, from its resemblance to that substance.
    I say that these are the ascertained facts. The high atomic
 weight of these bodies, and the unavoidable errors of analysis,
 have rendered it easy to find formulae for them, and to specu
 late as to their nature.     If, however, the views which, in the
 following pages, I offer to the Royal Society are correct, their
 true chemical relations and constitution          n.     been undis
 covered.
    It would be useless, and it is by no means my intention, to
 comment upon all the ideas which other chemists have enter
 tained upon this matter. There is however one theory, which
 has been advanced by certain chemists in France, of which it
 would be unbecoming in me to take no notice, both because
 it has a certain apparent amount of fact to support it, and
 because the originators of it, and others also, believe that they
 have finally settled the question of the true place which wax
 should hold in our classification of chemical substances”. M.
 Lewy has stated that cerine, that portion of the wax which is
 the more soluble in alcohol, is converted by oxidation by
 means of lime and potash into stearic acid. The method he

pursued was that used by Dumas with such success for the
conversion of alcohol into acetic acid; of potatoe oil into vale
rianic acid; and for other similar transformations.        He has
explained the reaction by giving to the cerine the formula
Cas Has O. On this hypothesis, the cerine, by conversion
into stearic acid, loses three equivalents of hydrogen and takes
up three equivalents of oxygen into its constitution, the reac
tion being expressed by the equation
      Cas Has O,4-3HO= Css Has O,-- H =             [**  8
                                                              >
the cerine being considered the aldehyde of stearic acid. M.
Gerhardt has taken up and extended this idea. Proceeding
on the belief that the myricine and cerine are isomeric—
a belief, I may observe, not justified by experiment, although
almost universally adopted by chemists—he has stated that
the myricine, of which by far the larger portion of the wax
consists, corresponds to the metaldehyde of the same acid, and
in a paper which he entitles, “Faits pour servir à l'histoire
de la cire des abeilles”,” has explained on this hypothesis the
origin of the products of the dry distillation of that substance.
The theory of M. Lewy agrees sufficiently well with his ana
lyses of the substances in question and with the relations of
his formulae. I must however observe, that any person who
 will take the trouble of reckoning out those analyses on which
the formula of stearic acid depends, according to the atomic
weight of carbon now almost universally adopted by chemists,
carbon 6, hydrogen 1, will see that this formula itself demands
a new inquiry before we can accept it. These results of M.
 Lewy are in many ways at variance with my own experiments;
but I confess that if the agreement of the analysis and of the
melting-point of the substance he obtained by oxidation of the
cerine with the analysis and the melting-point of stearic acid
were in truth a sufficient proof of the identity of the bodies,
this difference in our results would be to me very difficult to
explain. Wax certainly stands in a remarkable relation to
 fat, but I do not believe that relation to be of the nature M.
 Lewy has conjectured, and I cannot but think that, in his
desire to establish this relation, he has rested content with
 insufficient proofs of his theory. Any person who has had a
little experience in these inquiries, must know how deceptive
 this melting-point and analysis are as criteria of the purity or
identity of bodies. The separation of this class of substances
 by crystallization is difficult, and often the composition per
 cent. of two substances of entirely different chemical formulae
 will agree within the unavoidable errors of the method of

220          Mr. B. C. Brodie's Investigation on the
analysis. The reasons will hereafter appear why I am justi
fied in saying that, in the cerine which M. Lewy analysed, he
did not work on a pure chemical substance; and that conse
quently any theory founded on the reactions of this body must
fall to the ground<U+017F>; I believe that by more careful inquiry he
might have procured that substance of a different melting
point and constitution to that which he found. I have also
in vain searched the papers which M. Lewy and M. Gerhardt
have published upon this matter, to find some account of the
preparation and the analysis of a salt of this so-called stearic
 acid, an easy and satisfactory experiment, and one which alone
 in the case of acids of such high atomic weight, can justify the
 chemist in pronouncing on their constitution. Until such a
 salt is made, I cannot but consider that the evidence is insuf
 ficient, that the remarkable oxidation in question has ever been
 effected.
    I propose to give to the Society, in three papers, the results
 of an investigation on the nature of wax. The present paper
 will contain an inquiry as to the constitution of the so-called
 cerine; I mean that portion of the bees’-wax which is the more
 soluble in boiling alcohol. The second paper will treat of
 the chemical constitution of a wax from China, a substance
 which, although it considerably differs in its appearance and
 properties from bees’-wax, in the form in which it comes be
 fore us in nature, is nevertheless, chemically speaking, closely
 analogous to that body. In a third paper I propose to con
 sider the nature of myricine, the other constituent of the bees'-
 wax itself. I may here state, that to ensure the purity of the
 wax used in the following experiments, I prepared it myself
 from the comb. It was made by bees in the county of Surrey
 in the years 1845 and 1846. This wax I have always used
 for the first preparation of a substance. For further experi
 ment I have sometimes used wax procured in other ways.
                            Cerotic Acid.
    If wax melting at about 62° or 63° Centigrade be treated
  with boiling alcohol, a considerable portion will be dissolved.
  If this operation be repeated, the quantity of substance dis
  solved the fifth or sixth time will be evidently less than that
  dissolved in the first operation. But however often this ope
  ration be repeated, there will always be a portion of wax dis
  solved. This fact alone might lead us to suspect that any
  absolute separation of these two portions of the wax, by boiling
  with alcohol and subsequent crystallization out of that liquid,
  was impossible..
    A partial separation can, however, be readily effected, and

                    Chemical Nature of Waw.                   221
by this method a substance can be obtained melting at 70° and
even 72°Centigrade, much harder than the residue of the wax,
brittle, and slightly crystalline in its structure. If this sub
stance be boiled with a solution of caustic potash, it is saponi
fied with the greatest facility. If the soap be decomposed by
an acid, a baryta salt formed of the acid produced, and this
salt be dried and washed out with aether, a certain portion of
a substance will be taken up by the aether, which is but very
slightly acted on by potash. This is that substance which
has been called ceraine.     I remarked that while from the re
sidue of the wax this matter could be procured in considerable
quantities, but a very small portion was obtained from the
cerine; a portion very small in relation to the acids formed,
and the quantity of which diminished with the purification of
the substance. The analysis also of the unsaponified cerine
agreed closely with that of the acid as separated from the
baryta salt, and the melting-points only differed by four or
five degrees Centigrade. Further experiment showed me that
the same cerine, when boiled with caustic baryta, entered with
the greatest facility into combination with that substance.
These facts led me to suspect that the formation of the unsa
ponifiable body was due to the presence of a certain portion of
the other substances of the wax, and was no true product of the
decomposition of the cerine itself; but that this substance was
in truth no other than the acid itself existing, in a free state,
in the wax. The experiments which follow are inconsistent
 with any other hypothesis.                  -
    To prepare this acid bees’-wax is to be boiled out with strong
 alcohol, and the hot solution poured off from the undissolved
residue. This operation may be repeated with advantage
three or four times. The precipitates which are formed on
the cooling of the alcohol are to be collected together and
treated repeatedly with alcohol in the same manner as the wax
itself, until the melting-point of the precipitate is raised to
about 70° C., after which point the further purification of the
 body by this method of crystallization is extremely difficult.
 This substance is now to be dissolved in a large quantity of
 boiling alcohol, care being taken perfectly to effect the solu
 tion. To this solution is to be added a boiling solution of
 acetate of lead in alcohol, by which a voluminous precipitate
 is produced, which does not redissolve in the boiling mixture.
The solution is to be boiled and filtered hot, by means of a
 hot water apparatus, from the precipitate. The precipitate
 while moist is to be taken from the filter, placed again in the
 flask, and boiled out with strong alcohol, and afterwards with
 aether. This operation is to be repeated several times until

222          Mr. B. C. Brodie's Investigation on the
the fluid which passes through the filter carries no substance
with it. The first portions of alcohol will contain consider
able portions of a wax matter having a lower melting-point
than the cerine, and having the appearance of the residue
undissolved by the hot alcohol.
    The lead salt is to be decomposed by very strong acetic
acid. The substance which separates, after having been well
washed with boiling water, is to be dissolved in absolute
alcohol, and the solution, while hot, filtered. On the cooling
of the alcohol a substance will crystallize out in fine granular
crystals. This substance melts at about 78°C. It is highly
crystalline on cooling from the melted state. Very carefully
prepared, it gave on analysis the following numbers. The
analysis was made with chromate of lead.
   0.26 grm. of substance gave 0.753 grm. of carbonic acid

   It is very difficult to wash this lead salt perfectly out. Even
in the present case, after the greatest care, I obtained a trace
of a substance, soluble in aether, on attempting further to
purify the substance by combining it with baryta and washing
out its baryta salt. This makes no difference in the numbers
or the melting-point. But it is advisable to prepare the pure
acid by boiling the acid as separated from the lead salt with
caustic potash, precipitating the baryta salt by a large excess
of chloride of barium, and carbonate of soda ; washing this
well out with aether; decomposing with an acid, and crystal
lizing the resulting substance repeatedly out of alcohol and
aether. The acid prepared in this manner melted at 78°,
79°C., being the same melting-point as the acid separated
from the lead salt; it gave to analysis the following numbers:--
   I. 0.263 grm. gave 0-7583 carbonic acid and 0.3085 water.
   II. Another preparation, 0.2615 grm, gave 0-7558 car

as terminated when no more vapour of hydrochloric acid could
be perceived. The substance had now undergone a remark
able transformation in appearance, a transformation similar to
which may be effected in all the wax substances with which I

being precisely the same numbers as the substance gave before
distillation.
   A question suggests itself, if it be true that this acid is vo
latile, and it be also true that it exists in the wax in an uncom
bined state, how has it happened that it has never been dis
covered among the products of the distillation of wax which
have been so often examined 2
   In truth, it is a remarkable fact, that while this acid, when
heated in a nearly pure state, as separated from the lead salt,
distils over nearly unaltered, the same substance, when distilled
in an impure state, as separated, namely, by alcohol from the
wax, and mixed, as in this case, with other wax matter, which
is decomposed by heat, itself suffers decomposition. In the
course of this investigation other examples have occurred to
me of similar facts.
   About three ounces of the cerine, melting at 70° C., from
which this acid can be precipitated by acetate of lead, was
distilled. The first portions of the distillate consisted entirely
of oil. Towards the end a small quantity of solid matter ap
peared. The oil, on standing, separated into two portions: the
lower part was withdrawn by a pipette, being but a small
portion, say one-twentieth of the whole. The upper portion

                     Chemical Nature of War.                 227
 was boiled with potash, only a very small portion of acid
 however was separated in this manner. The soap was drawn
 off by a syphon, and the oil washed out with water. On being
 washed with strong alcohol the oil dissolved, almost entirely,
leaving only a small portion of solid matter of the appearance
of paraffine. This oil consists of a mixture of oils of different
boiling-points, which were separated as far as possible by rec
tification, but during the distillation the boiling-point kept
constantly rising, and I could obtain no oil in which it was
absolutely constant.
   Three of these oils, of the respective boiling-points of 210°
to 220°C., 230° to 250° C., and 250° to 274°C., were ana
lysed. By far the greater portion of this whole distillate went
over between 230° and 250° C. The results of these analyses
Were—
   In the case of the first oil,
 - #!    0.2676 grm. gave 0.826 carbonic acid and 0.8307 water.
     n the case of the second oil,

   The amount of oxygen therefore diminishes as the boiling
point rises in these oils, the last oil being nearly pure hydro
carbon. It is useless to calculate formulae for them : I give
however the analyses to point out the source of the oils in the
wax distillate, and to account for the disappearance of the
cerotic acid in that product.
   The products of this distillation prove also that we must
look to some other body than the cerine for the source of the
margaric acid, or the acid resembling that substance which
has been found in the wax distillate, and for the origin also
of the paraffine, of which only traces can be found even on the
distillation of the impure cerine.
   The existence of a free acid in wax is a fact to which we
have no parallel in the constitution of any known fat, and
although the reactions, which I have given, left little doubt
upon my mind that in the wax the acid was in this condition,
it yet appeared to me desirable to procure it from the wax by

228          Mr. B. C. Brodie's Investigation on the
simple crystallization. By patience this may be accomplished.
The cerine analysed by M. Lewy melted at 62°5 C. I have
stated that by means of alcohol this substance may be pro
cured of a melting-point of 72°. If this substance of 72°
melting-point be repeatedly dissolved and crystallized out of
a large quantity, not of alcohol, but of aether, the melting
point can be raised to 78°, in which state the substance is
highly crystalline, and has all the appearance of the acid as
procured by other means.
    0.25625 grm. of this gave 0-7435 CO, and 0-3005 HO,
which gives in 100 parts—

                                          100'00
Both the melting-point and the analysis perfectly agree with
 the melting-point and analysis of cerotic acid, which have
 been already given, and with its formula.
    It is certainly a strange fact that the presence of this body
 in the wax should so long have escaped the notice of chemists.
 The wax however is a complex substance, and the cerotic
acid to be obtained in purity has to be separated from many
 other bodies which disguise its nature and reactions.
    Should any chemist be induced to verify the results which
 I have given, I must beg him also rigidly to observe the
 methods I have laid down for the preparation and purification
 of the substances, for errors which are slight in the analysis
 of the substance and which neither the analysis nor melting
 point detect, become of great importance when the trans
 formations of the substance are investigated, and its atomic
 weight is to be determined.
    The alcoholic extract, out of which the cerotic acid has
 crystallized, contains yet another acid, although in very small
 quantity. If to the solution an alcoholic solution of ace
 tate of lead be added, a precipitate of a lead salt is produced:
 this salt is readily distinguished from the salt of the cerotic
 acid as it is dissolved on boiling the alcoholic solution, out of
 which, on cooling, it will separate in crystalline grains. This
 substance is contained in very small quantity in the wax. . It
  resembles in appearance margaric acid. I have analysed this
 acid and one of its salts. These experiments showed that it
 approached margaric acid in its constitution: but I have
 never been able to procure the quantity necessary to its suffi
 cient purification, and the analyses led to no conclusions as
  to its formula which deserve to be recorded.

                    Chemical Nature of War.                  229
   It is a matter of interest to know in what proportions, rela
tive to its other constituents, the cerotic acid is contained in
the wax. This may readily be determined by precipitating
by acetate of lead i. solution of a known quantity of wax
and determining the quantity of the lead salt produced. It
is necessary however, in order to know to what quantity of
acid in the wax the found quantity of lead salt corresponds,
to know the atomic weight of the lead salt itself. There is
great difficulty in washing out this lead salt so as perfectly to
remove from it the myricine. In order therefore to effect any
satisfactory purification of it, I was obliged to operate on a
smaller quantity of the salt than I should otherwise have
chosen. My experiment, however, was sufficient to show that
the salt is the neutral salt containing one equivalent of lead.
    0.1445 grm. of the lead salt gave when ignited 0.032 grm.
of solid residue.     This residue, extracted with acetic acid
and dried, left 0:0065 grim. of residue, and lost 0.0255 grim.,
 which, reckoned as oxide, contains 0.0236 grim. lead. This
gives 0.0296 as the whole quantity of lead in the salt. Re
duced to parts per cent. this gives 20:48 as the per-centage of
lead. The formula Cº. His Os--PbO requires 20:26 per
cent.; this therefore is the formula of the salt.
    To determine the proportion of the acid in the wax itself,
a portion of pure yellow wax was dissolved in aether and fil
tered from adhering impurities, then dissolved in naphtha
aether and precipitated by acetate of lead dissolved in alcohol;
an additional portion of aether was afterwards added to ensure
the entire precipitation of the salt, the solution was filtered
hot, and the lead salt was carefully washed on the filter.
    1-0905 grm. of wax treated in this manner gave 0.3015
grim, of the lead salt, which, assuming it to be the neutral salt,
 is equivalent to 0-24 grim. of the acid Csa Hsa O. This
 reduced to parts per cent. gives 22.0 of the cerotic acid in
 every 100 parts of bees’-wax.
    Although this was the proportion of cerotic acid in the
 bees’-wax I had prepared, it by no means followed that other
 specimens of wax when examined would give a similar result.
 Various chemists have stated that the proportions of the
 cerine varied in different specimens of wax; and although
 the estimate of the cerine was a mere matter of guess, no crite
 rion of its presence or absence being known, yet nevertheless
 the great difference in the results of the different chemists
 who have attempted to determine this point led me to suspect
 that the quantity of the cerotic acid in the wax did in truth
 vary; i that it might be possible, if so, to find a wax which
 even did not contain this body. I have found this acid in all the

  230       Investigation on the Chemical Nature of Waw.
  bees’-wax made in this part of the world, bleached or other
  wise, which I have examined º.           It occurred to me however
  that wax made under very different conditions of climate and
  vegetation to ours might possibly have a different constitution.
  With this view I procured, through the kindness of a friend
  who was resident in Ceylon, some bees’-wax from that island.
  The wax as I received it was white, having in all respects the
  appearance of English wax, and melting at 63°C. In other
  points also, as I shall show in another paper, its chemical
  nature was the same as that of English wax. The cerotic
  acid however was entirely absent. When extracted in the
  boiling alcohol a portion of the wax dissolves; but on the
  addition of acetate of lead to the alcoholic solution hardly a
  trace of precipitate is formed.
     Such a variation in the nature of an insect-secretion under
 different conditions of life is a remarkable fact, which we may
 place by the side of the curious difference in the nature of the
 constituents of butter in different years, discovered by Lerch.
 In his excellent investigation on the nature of the volatile
 acids of butter, this chemist discovered f that the butyric and
 caproic acids of one year were in another year replaced by
 vaccinic acid, an acid from which, by deoxidation, the two
 former acids might readily be formed.
             Vaccinic acid. Butyric acid. Caproic acid.

       XXXIV. On the Action of Chlorine on Anilic Acid.
                 By John STENHouse, Esq., Ph.D.”
 IT is stated in most of the systems of chemistry that anilic
       acid is not acted on by chlorine. This however is by no
means correct; for when a solution of anilic acid is digested
with a mixture of chlorate of potash and muriatic acid, no
chloropicrine is formed, but the anilic acid is rapidly converted
into chloranile.
    When a stream of chlorine gas is sent through a hot satu
rated solution of anilic acid, the acid is speedily attacked; and
if the action of the chlorine is continued for a couple of days,
the anilic acid is wholly changed into chloranile. When anilic
acid is boiled with an excess of hypochlorite of lime no chlo
ropicrine is evolved, and the solution assumes a dark brown
colour. When this solution is saturated with muriatic acid,
a flocculent matter precipitates, forming a yellowish uncry
stallizable resin.
    The action of chlorine is therefore a very easy mode of
distinguishing anilic acid from chrysammic, oxypicric or nitro
picric acids, and of detecting any mixture of these acids in
anilic acid, as the presence of the smallest portion of any of
these acids is immediately indicated by the formation of chlo
ropicrine.

Chap. IV. Of the Distribution of Stars, and of the Constitution of the
                   Galary in the Southern Hemisphere.
THE present chapter is divided into three sections, which treat—
      1st, of the statistical distribution of stars; 2nd, of the general
appearance and telescopic constitution of the Milky Way in the
southern hemisphere; and 3rd, of some indications of very remote
telescopic branches of the Milky Way, or of an independent sidereal
system, or systems, bearing a resemblance to such branches.
   The subject of the distribution of the stars over the surface of the
visible heavens had received little attention previous to the time of
Sir William Herschel, whose researches, and their results, are thus
briefly alluded to:—
                  * Communicated by the Author.

 232               Notices respecting New Books.
   “That the comparative abundance or paucity of stars in any par
ticular region of the northern hemisphere, so far as visible in our
latitudes, has reference to its situation in respect of the Milky Way,
is a proposition which the researches of Sir William Herschel have
sufficientlyestablished, not merely by the general aspect of theheavens
when viewed with the naked eye, but also when examined with
powerful telescopes in a mode which may properly be called statis
tical,—that is to say, by counting the number of stars in the field of
view of one and the same telescope at a great number of given points
in the concave of the heavens, and so estimating their comparative
populousness in stars, in their different districts. The results of a
system of observation of this nature have, as is well known, con
ducted him to the highly remarkable and interesting conclusion
above-mentioned, and to this further consequence, that all the stars
visible to us, whether by unassisted vision, or through the best tele
scopes (such at least as are scattered, or not congregated in resolvable
nebulae, or globular or similar highly condensed clusters), belong to
and form a part of a vast stratum, or considerably flattened and un
symmetrical congeries of stars in which our system is deeply, though
excentrically plunged, and, moreover, situated near a point where
the stratum bifurcates or spreads itself out into two sheets.”
   It may be readily supposed that the opportunity of carrying out
this great induction by similar observations in the southern hemi
sphere was not neglected; and accordingly, so soon as a knowledge
of the regions where nebulae might more especially be expected had
been acquired, or where, without too much risk of missing such ob
jects the sweeps might be interrupted for the purpose of gauging,-
i.e. of counting the number of visible stars in determinate fields of
view,-a system of star. gauges was set on foot, “so as to dot over
the surface of the heavens as it were with a regular tesseration of
gauged or counted fields, disposed at regular and equal intervals of
right ascension and polar distance.” According to the plan laid
down, the gauges were taken when the telescope, in the regular course
of sweeping, arrived at either extremity and at the middle of the zone
under examination, so that the intervals were 10" of time in R.A.,
and 19 30' of arc in P.D. It was not indeed expected, or even con
sidered possible, that so great a multitude of fields as this plan sup
poses could be actually counted; but a system of some sort was
absolutely necessary to prevent confusion and unequal observing,
and more especially to ensure an absolute impartiality in the selec
tion of the gauge-points; and it was also foreseen that many of the
fields would inevitably be passed over from the interference of the
regular and more important business of the sweep. On the whole
about 2300 gauges were obtained in this manner, which, though
leaving some blanks, afford ample materials “for testing the validity
of the induction in question, and for estimating the comparative rich
ness of every considerable district in the southern heavens.”
   After some further details relative to the mode of observing and
arranging the results, the author gives a “synoptic table of southern
star-gauges, arranged on meridians and parallels.” He then proceeds

  to examine how far the induction before alluded to is borne out by
  the observations, for which purpose the following process was insti
  tuted. The poles of the great circle marking the medial line of the
  Milky Way were first found, their places being ascertained to be
  in 0° 47" R.A. and 116° 0' N.P.D. for the southern pole, and 12h
  47"R.A. and 64° 0' N.P.D. for the northern. To this great circle,
  which Sir John happily designates the Galactic circle, a series of
  parallels were drawn on an 18-inch globe, dividing the heavens
  into zones of 15° each in breadth, and the points of intersection of
  these with the meridians, taken at intervals of twenty minutes, were
  read off in N.P.D. by the aid of the brass meridian arc, and trans
  ferred to a chart containing the actual projections of all the observed
  gauges. These points were then connected by regular curves, which
  are consequently the projections of the series of parallels above
  mentioned, or the galactic parallels, the spaces between them being
  the projections of the zones into which they divide the surface of the
  sphere. This done, the next step consisted in counting the number
  of fields of view actually laid down on the charts, and in adding
  into one sum the number of stars observed. The following are the
  results obtained :-
     “In the oval representing the circle of 15° radius surrounding the
  southern pole of the galactic circle were found to have been observed
  43 fields, containing in all 260 stars, which gives for the average
  density of stars in this region of the heavens, 6-05 stars to a field of
   15'in diameter, visible in the 20-foot reflector with the usual sweep
  ing power 180.
     “In the zone comprised between the parallels of 15° and 30°ga
  lactic south polar distance 144 gauges were found to occur, con
  taining an aggregate of 953 stars, or 6-62 stars to a field.
     “In the zone comprised between 30° and 45° were observed 218
  gauges, containing 1980 stars, which gives an average of 9-08 stars
  to a field.
     “In the zone from 45° to 60° were found 375 gauges containing
  5060 stars, being 13.49 stars to a field.
     “From 60° to 75° were found to have been observed 472 gauges
  containing 12409 counted stars, whence the average of 26-29 stars
  to a field.
     “From 75° to 90°, being the zone immediately adjacent to the
  Milky Way on the south side, and containing half its breadth, 442
  gauges are registered containing 26105 stars. Among these occur
  some gauges in which the stars are set down as ‘innumerable’ or so
  crowded as to be impossible to count them without bestowing more
  time and care than the nature of the object in view was judged to
  require. These are taken when they occur at 200 stars to the field,
  which is certainly not an excessive estimate. There are, however,
  not above five or six gauges in this predicament. The average den
  sity of stars in this zone, according to the numbers above stated, is
  59'06 to a field.
     “A zone of 3° in breadth bisected throughout by the galactic
  circle, or extending 14% on its north and as much on its south side,
     Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 33. No. 221. Sept. 1848.               R

 was found to include 84 gauges containing 6258 stars, giving an
 average of 74°50 stars to a field. The average would have been
 much higher if, instead of following the course of this circle, a zone
 of equal breadth pursuing the irregular line of maximum intensity of
 the Milky Way had been chosen, which in some places deviates by         º
 several degrees from the great circle which expresses its general
 situation. Judging from the course of the counted gauges only, the
 mean density of stars in the medial line of the actual galaxy in that
 part I have observed would be somewhere about 90 stars to the field,
 but this must be considered as exclusive of the more densely clus
 tering masses.”—P. 380.
     On the northern side of the galactic circle the average number of
 stars to a field was found to be as follows:—In the zone extending
 from 0° to 15°, 51-28 ; from 15° to 30°, 23.47; from 30° to 45°,
 14:46; from 45° to 60°, 7-71. The number of gauges taken in those
 zones were respectively 321, 195, 68 and 21.
     “Nothing,” says Sir John Herschel, “can be more striking than
 the gradual but rapid increase of density on either side of the Milky
 Way as we approach its course, and the reproduction of nearly the
 same law of graduation on the north side which holds good on the
 south, so far as the comparative paucity of the gauges taken in that
 direction allow us to judge. On the whole, this induction, founded
 as it is on the actual enumeration of 68948 stars contained in 2299
 fields, must be admitted as decisive of the specific point in question,
 and as completing the evidence to the same effect afforded by Sir
 William Herschel's observations in the northern hemisphere.”
    Calculating upon the above averages the number of stars visible
enough to be distinctly counted in the 20-foot reflector over the whole
sphere, it will be found to be 5,331,572, or somewhat less than five
 and a half millions.   “That the actual number is much greater there
 can be little doubt, when we consider that large tracts of the Milky
 Way exist so crowded as to defy counting the gauges, not by reason
of the smallness of the stars, but their number.”
    It will be understood that great local departures from the law of
distribution above indicated occur in all regions, and nowhere more
remarkably than in the Milky Way itself, whose irregularities of
breadth and structure are most conspicuous and singular; but with
the exception of portions of the galaxy, nothing was found in any
part of the heavens meriting in the smallest degree to be regarded
as systematic, as respects those deviations from perfect regularity.
So purely local are they, that on a careful revision of the whole chart
Sir John found it difficult to specify any considerable areas over
which an average density of stars prevails materially differing from
what might be expected from the law above indicated, regarded as a
function of the galactic polar distance.
    Another interesting question remains, namely, whether the in
creased frequency of stars in approaching the Milky Way is observable
in respect of stars of all classes of magnitude indifferently. In order
to ascertain this point, not only the total numbers of stars were set
down in counting the gauges, but those of all the several magnitudes

                     Notices respecting New Books.                    235
 down to the eleventh inclusive; and a table is given in which are
 exhibited the numbers of all the stars of the several magnitudes
 occurring in the registered gauges, distributed in the respective zones
 of galactic polar distance. The following are the results:—
    “On a general view of the table it appears that the tendency to
 greater frequency, or the increase of density in respect of statistical
 distribution, in approaching the Milky Way, is quite imperceptible
 among stars of a higher magnitude than the 8th, and except on the
 very verge of the Milky Way itself, stars of the 8th magnitude can
 hardly be said to participate in the general law of increase. For the
 9th and 10th, the increase, though unequivocally indicated over a
 zone extending at least 30° on either side of the Milky Way, is by
 no means striking.     It is with the 11th magnitude that it first be
 comes conspicuous, though still of small amount when compared
 with that which prevails among the mass of stars of magnitudes
 inferior to the 11th, which constitute sixteen-seventeenths of the
 totality of stars within 30° on either side of the galactic circle.
    “Two conclusions seem to follow inevitably from this; viz. –1st,
that the large stars are really nearer to us (taken en masse, and with
out denying individual exceptions) than the smaller ones. . . . ; 2nd,
that the depth at which our system is plunged in the sidereal stratum
constituting the galaxy, reckoning from the southern surface or
limit of that stratum, is about equal to that distance which, on a
general average, corresponds to the light of a star of the 9th or 10th
magnitude, and certainly does not exceed that corresponding to the
11th.”—P. 383.
    The 2nd Section of this chapter contains a minute and exceedingly
interesting description of the general and telescopic appearance of
the Milky Way—too long, however, to be extracted here in extenso,
and scarcely susceptible of abridgement. We must make room for
two or three paragraphs.
    “Immediately after the contraction between A Centauri and & Crucis
the Milky Way suddenly expands so as to include the southern half
of the cross and the northern portion of Musca, whence it proceeds
to 3 Centauri, embracing in this wide expansion that singular vacuity
on the south following side of the cross, called the ‘Coal-sack,” a
pear-shaped oval, whose greatest length is about 8°, and breadth 5°,
the longer axis being nearly parallel to the line joining 2 and B Crucis,
which line is very nearly a tangent to the north-preceding portion
of its circumference. As this is always regarded by voyagers and
travellers as one of the most conspicuous features of the southern
sky, it may not be irrelevant to state a few particulars as to its tele
scopic constitution.    It is by no means entirely devoid of stars, the
lowest gauges being 9 and 7, and no blank fields being specified as
occurring in it. The cluster of telescopic stars h. 3407 is actually
contained within its area; and even in the middle of its extent
gauges of 29 and 48 stars are noted.         Its striking blackness is,
therefore, by no means owing to an absolute want of telescopic stars,
but rather to its contrast with the very rich portion of the Milky
Way adjacent, where the * run up to 98, 100, 120, and even
                                      2

236                Notices respecting New Books.
200 on the preceding side—to 65, 103, 108, on the following; 68
on the south, and 90 on the north. The contrast is enhanced by
the suddenness of the transition.”—P. 384.
   “It is about this region, or perhaps somewhat earlier, in the in
terval between m Argüs and a Crucis, that the galactic circle, or
medial line of the Milky Way, may be considered as crossed by that
of the zone of large stars which is marked out by the brilliant con
stellation of Orion, the bright stars of Canis Major, and almost all
the more conspicuous stars of Argo, the Cross, the Centaur, Lupus,
and Scorpio. A great circle passing through s Orionis and a Crucis
will mark out the axis of the zone in question, whose inclination to
the galactic circle is therefore about 20°, and whose appearance
would lead us to suspect that our nearest neighbours in the sidereal
system (if really such), form part of a subordinate sheet or stratum
deviating to that extent from parallelism to the general mass which,
seen projected on the heavens, forms the Milky Way.”—P. 385.
    “Bode's, and most other celestial charts, make the Milky Way
bifurcate, in Cygnus and the tail of Scorpio, into two great streams,
both of which, the preceding and the following, preserve their conti
nuity, from point to point, unbroken. This, however, is the case
only with the following, or main stream, whose course we have just
traced. The preceding is discontinuous. Its northern portion (from
 Cygnus southwards) terminates precisely at the equator, just beyond
 the bisection of a line m Serpentis and 3 Ophiuchi; and from this
 to the nearest point of its southern continuation (if it can be so con
 sidered) there is a break of 14° in extent to the star o Serpentis,
 totally devoid of all appearance of it.”
    “If we now consider the telescopic structure of the region spread
 over by, and inclosed between the effusions of the Milky Way in the
 body and tail of Scorpio, the hand and bow of Sagittarius, and the
 following leg of Ophiuchus, we shall find it, in the highest degree,
 interesting and complex. No region of the heavens, in fact, is fuller
 of objects beautiful and remarkable in themselves, and rendered still
 more so by their mode of association, and by the peculiar features
 assumed by the Milky Way, which are without a parallel in any
 other part of its course.”—P. 386.
    The description is wound up with the following remarks:—
    “From the foregoing analysis of the telescopic aspect of the Milky
 Way in this interesting region, I think it can hardly be doubted that
 it consists of portions differing exceedingly in distance, but brought
 by the effect of projection into the same or nearly the same visual
 line; in particular, that at the anterior edge of what we have called
 the main stream, we see, foreshortened, a vast and illimitable area
 scattered over with discontinuous masses and aggregates of stars in
 the manner of the cumuli of a mackerel sky, rather than of a stratum
 of regular thickness and homogeneous formation; and that in the
 inclosed spaces insulated from the rest of the heavens by the prece
 ding and following streams, and the ‘bridges’ above spoken of as
 connecting them (as, for instance, in that which includes A Scorpii),
 we are, in fact, looking out into space through vast chimney-form

or tubular vacancies whose terminations are rendered nebulous by
the effect of their exceeding distance, and at the same time are
brought by that of perspective to constitute the interior borders of
the apparent vacuities. It is possible that the globular clusters we
see scattered over it are nothing more than such masses in a higher
 state of aggregation, to which perhaps the others are by slow degrees
advancing. Yet in that case we should certainly be prepared to ex
pect specimens of an intermediate character to occur in considerable
numbers, scattered among them, whereas, in fact, it would be diffi
cult to particularize any objects in the region in question which can
be quite fairly so considered. The intermediate stages of central
 condensation between the highly compressed globular cluster, and
 the dilute and nearly uniform nebuloid patch, if not altogether want
 ing, are, at all events, feebly represented.”—P. 390.
    In the 3rd Section mention is made of a phaenomenon sometimes
 observed in the course of sweeping, which seems to indicate the exist
 ence of starry regions of great extent and excessive remoteness, not
 in traceable connexion with the Milky Way, except in some parti
 cular localities, yet possibly outlying portions of that system. It
 consists in “an exceedingly delicate and uniform dotting or stippling
 of the field of view by points of light too small to admit of any one
 being steadily and fixedly viewed, and too numerous for counting
 were it possible so to view them.”     Sir John states that he always
 felt satisfied of the reality of the phaenomenon at the moment of
 observation; but the conviction was not permanent, the idea of illu
 sion continually arose subsequently, partly from the extreme delicacy
 of the points of light, but chiefly from the circumstance, that when
 noticed it was almost invariably soon after the commencement of the
 sweeping. But he thought it right, notwithstanding the doubt, not
 to suppress all mention of the phaenomenon, “which, if it arise from
 physiological causes, is at least curious and remarkable as a case of
 optical illusion.” A list is given of the places in the heavens where
 it was remarked, and another of places where the ground of the sky
 was recorded as particularly black, and certainly devoid of any such
 stippling or nebulous appearance; and some details are added with
 the view of throwing further light on the subject.
    The chapter closes with a reference to one of the plates, repre
  senting the course and aspect of the Milky Way from Antinous to
  Monoceros, delineated with as much precision as the nature of such
  work admits, that is, with the naked eye by faint lamp-light in the
  open air. The differences in some very obvious features between
  this and former representations of the same portion of the heavens
  are sufficiently remarkable.

     1848,           R. Dawes.
     In the Monthly Notices for January last were printed some obser

  vations of an interior satellite of Uranus, which had been made in
  the autumn of last year by Mr. Lassell and M. Otto Struve. The
  results are in several respects interesting and remarkable. The fact
  that one observer always saw the close satellite on the northern side
  of the planet only, while the other as uniformly observed it only on
  the southern side, is sufficiently curious to invite further investigation.
      It is however obvious, that the observations at Starfield and at
  Poulkova are utterly incompatible with each other.        While the latter
  point to an approximate period of 3° 22' 10", the period indicated
  by the former is only about 2" 2" 43*6. The distance also of the
   satellite carefully estimated by Mr. Lassell on Nov. 6, 1847, under
  favourable circumstances and with great probability of considerable
  accuracy, was only 11"; the position-angle being estimated 349°.
  Now, assuming the direction of the major axis of the projected orbit
  to be from 10° to 190°, as determined by M. O. Struve for the satel
  lite observed by him; and assuming also that the apparent ellipticity
  of the orbit does not greatly differ from that of the orbits of the
  bright satellites I. and II. ; we find that the distance of the satellite,
  at its greatest elongation, would be 12"-2, on the supposition that
  the distance was correctly estimated at 11" when the position-angle
  was 349°. But this is almost precisely the greatest elongation
  theoretically due to a satellite revolving about Uranus in the period
  indicated by Mr. Lassell's observations.        We are thus led to the
  conclusion, that there are at least two satellites interior to the nearest
  bright one : and to avoid the confusion which might arise from ap
 plying numbers of any kind to the smaller satellites, I beg permission
 to denominate them for the present, a, b, c, &c. in the order of di
 stance from the primary;—a being the satellite observed by Mr. Las
  sell, and c the satellite observed by M. O. Struve.
     M. O. Struve suggests that the satellite observed by him may lose
 much of its light when in the northern portion of its orbit; and this
 may be the reason why Mr. Lassell did not see it on Nov. 6, 1847,
 on which favourable night c must have been near its greatest north
 ern elongation. On all the other nights when a was observed by
 Mr. Lassell, c was very close to the planet, with one exception only,
 on Sept. 14, at which time c was near its greatest elongation south
 wards, and might perhaps have been seen if the night had been suf
 ficiently good. Neither Mr. Lassell, however, nor myself then ob
 serving with him, perceived any such object in that place.
     It should here be stated, that the estimated position for Sept. 14,
 as given in the printed table, appears to be erroneous. It is incon
 sistent with the diagrams independently made at the time by Mr.
 Lassell and myself, which, taking the measured position of II. as a
 guide, show that the position of a was about 80° north preceding;-
 whereas the angle as printed is 80° north following. It seems clear,
 therefore, that the angle should be 350° instead of 10°. This being
rectified, and the position-angles computed for the times of observa
tion, by reckoning back from the peculiarly valuable observation of
Nov. 6 as an epoch, and assuming a period of 2d 2" 43*6, the esti
mated angle minus the calculated angle comes out, for Sept. 14=–2°;
for Sept. 27 = -2°; for Sept. 29 = + 1°; for Oct. 1= +2°.

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                    239
    That the satellite a should never have been seen by M. O. Struve
 may arise from its becoming faint in the southern portion of its
 orbit, as c probably does in the northern. It appears, from calcula
 tion on the assumptions before mentioned, that on every night when
 M. O. Struve saw c, with the only exception of Dec. 10, a was in
 the southern portion of its orbit; yet sufficiently distant from his
 observed position of c to render any confusion between them impos
 sible. On Nov. 28, indeed, the position-angles of the two satellites
 must have been almost precisely the same : but the measured distance
 of c was 16"-85; while the distance of a could not have exceeded
 11" in that part of its orbit.    It should be noticed, with reference
 to the non-observation at Poulkova of the satellite a on Dec. 10, that
 though on that night near its greatest northern elongation, it was at
 a smaller distance from the primary than c ever was when it was
 observed. Unless, therefore, the night were unusually fine, so faint
 an object might easily be overlooked.
    So long ago as the autumn of 1845, Mr. Lassell occasionally saw
a faint object, supposed to be a satellite, at about the same distance
from the planet as a was observed to have been last year; and, with
only one exception, it was always seen on the northern side of the
primary, and usually in the north preceding quadrant, in which it
was uniformly seen in 1847. On Oct. 5, 1845, at 12" 26" Green
wich mean time, being on a visit at Starfield, I had the gratification
of seeing this satellite in the 20-foot reflector. When the light of
the planet was hidden from the eye by a bar, the satellite became
steadily visible; and a careful diagram being made, both by Mr.
Lassell and myself independently, the position-angles deduced from
them agreed within 3°, the mean being 324° 1. This is very nearly
the same with the estimated position on Sept. 27, 1847; and assu
ming, that in the interval of 721.8896 days, 342 complete revolutions
had been performed, the period comes out 2" 2" 39" 36°. It seems
probable, therefore, that the period of this satellite does not differ
much from that quantity.
   Supposing that those nights on which the satellites I. and II. were
measured at Starfield in 1847 were probably favourable, though a
was not noticed, it becomes interesting to know whether a were
then at such a distance from the planet as might allow it to be visible
in the 20-foot reflector.    I have therefore computed the places of a
for each of those mights; and the results show, that only on Oct. 16
was it in the northern portion of its orbit, and not very close to its
primary. On every other occasion, therefore, it was probably either
invisible in the southern portion of its orbit, or overpowered by its
vicinity to the planet.
   By a similar computation, it becomes evident, that on none of
those nights was the satellite c near its greatest southern elongation;
and that, therefore, it was probably invisible on the northern side of
the planet, or too near it to be discerned.
   It is singular, that in the whole series of observations at Starfield
and Poulkova, only one night, Nov. 1, is common to them both ;
nd that was of so indifferent a quality at Starfield, as to render it

240                   Royal Astronomical Society.
improbable that so difficult an object as the satellite c could have
been detected; a was then in the south following quadrant, and
rather near the planet, so that it was not seen at either place of ob
servation.
    On the whole, therefore, it seems highly probable that the interior
satellites observed by Mr. Lassell and M. O. Struve are entirely
distinct; that the one becomes invisible in the southern part of its
orbit, and the other in the northern ; and that, during the last appa
rition of Uranus, it has so happened, that each satellite has been seen
only by its own observer. If either of them is the same as was dis
covered by Sir W. Herschel, it seems most likely to be that observed
at Poulkova.
    The object observed at Starfield on Nov. 6, 1847, and supposed
to be an intermediate satellite between I. and II., was estimated to
be only 10" distant from the planet. But its position was then
almost precisely opposite to that of I., whose distance was estimated
at 20".     It is therefore obvious, that if this were a satellite, its orbit
must be interior to that of I.      It could not however have been c,
which must at that time have been near its greatest northern elon
gation, and therefore probably invisible. Moreover, its greatest
distance could be only about 15"#; and it would therefore be nearly
intermediate between a and c, and for the present it may be distin
guished as b. Though it may seem premature to attempt any con
clusions from a single observation of so difficult an object, yet, on
 the other hand, the observation of Nov. 6 was peculiarly worthy of
reliance. The night was unusually fine. The planet was viewed
 for two hours, during which time the supposed satellites were carried
 along with it. The distance also of b was estimated just half that
 of I., which was almost exactly opposite to it. And that the esti
 mated distance of I. (20") was nearly correct, appears from comparing
 it with the measured distance of the same satellite (20"'57) on Oct. 11,
 when it was in almost precisely the same part of its orbit. If there
fore it were really a satellite, it appears probable that there are three
 satellites revolving within the orbit of I., at apparent mean distances
 of about 12", 15", and 18".
    Mr. Lassell having favoured me with a communication of all his
 observations of a close satellite of Uranus, with the position-angles
 estimated at the time, and copies of the diagrams, it appears from
 them, that only on one occasion has such an attendant been un
 doubtedly seen on the southern side of the planet. This occurred
 on Sept. 27, 1845, at 12h 6m Greenwich mean time. The estimated
 angle was 160°, the distance was three diameters of the planet from
the edge of the disc, which gives 14" for the central distance. This
 does not at all agree with any probable period of the satellite a.
 But on calculating the period of c from this observation, compared
 with each set obtained by M. O. Struve in 1847, employing as a
 guide to the number of entire revolutions the approximate period
 deduced by him, viz. 3° 22' 10", and giving a weight to the Poul
kova observations proportional to the number from which each result
 is derived, the period comes out from the mean of the whole,_3%

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                      241
22* 8" 35°. Mr. Lassell's estimation of distance corresponds to a
greatest elongation of about 17"; which, as well as the period, agrees
so nearly with the result of the Poulkova observations, as to render
it highly probable that the satellite observed by Mr. Lassell on
Sept. 27, 1845, is the same as that observed by M. O. Struve.
   Extract of Letter from M. Otto von Struve to the Astronomer
Royal.
   “You will see from the Astronomische Nachrichten, &c., that we
have not been idle at Poulkova since your visit. In addition to the
published accounts I have little to say, except that my father's cal
culations of the great Russian meridian arc give a considerably larger
value to the difference between the two axes of the earth than has
been hitherto found. I cannot tell you the exact quantity, as the
calculations are not completed.
   “I have finished my observations of the satellites of Uranus for
this season.   As soon as I have a little leisure, I shall deduce their
motions from the observations.       I have seen the third satellite, di
stinctly, only once since my communication to Sir John Herschel,
viz. at 6 P.M. on January 25th. Its position was 202°, its distance
about 18".    I am now inclined to think that the differences of the
light of this satellite in different parts of its orbit are so great, that
it cannot be seen by our refractor when it is in the opposite direction
to that in which I have hitherto observed it.       The atmosphere was
very favourable on two occasions, when the satellite was supposed
to be to the north of the planet, but I could not see the least trace
of it.  The period of its revolution is, however, somewhat uncertain,
for these negative observations are far from conclusive.
   “M. Döllen has finished his calculations on Bessel's fundamental
catalogue for 1820. The result, as respects Procyon, is that the
irregularity supposed by Bessel in its proper motion, vanishes

 nearly with that computed by Mr. Graham.
    On a formula for reducing Observations in Azimuth of Circum
 polar Stars near Elongation, to the Azimuth at the greatest Elon
 gation. By Captain Shortrede.
    In trigonometrical surveys the direction of a chain of triangles is
 often deduced from the observed azimuth of a circumpolar star at its        |
 greatest elongation. The method is convenient, as an accurate
 knowledge of the time is not requisite, and the latitude is generally
 sufficiently well-known. It is indeed necessary to have the polar
 distance of the star with the utmost precision. In the northern
 hemisphere Polaris and 3 Ursae Minoris are usually employed.
    When the time is known with tolerable certainty, it is much more
 satisfactory to observe the star frequently, both before and after its
 greatest elongation; and Captain Shortrede in this memoir gives a
 demonstration of the formula which he has found most convenient
for reducing such a series of observations of azimuth to the azimuth
 at the greatest elongation.
    He deduces an exact expression for the tangent of the difference
 of each azimuth from the greatest azimuth, in which the only vari
 able quantities are the time from the greatest elongation, and the arc
joining the position of the star at its greatest elongation with its
 position at the time of observation. The formula is easy of compu
tation; and when many observations have been made, would greatly
facilitate their reduction.
    Captain Shortrede shows, that in most cases an approximate com
 putation of the principal variable, viz. of the secant of the arc above
mentioned, would be sufficient, and that this may be very readily
effected by a formula involving log    *:::".

   On a Regulated Time-ball.       By Professor Chevallier.
   “The usual method of indicating the time by a ball is by permitting
the ball to fall freely, the motion being a little accelerated at first by a
spring. It is evident that this method is subject to some uncertainty
as to the particular instant of time which is to be observed. There
is also some inconvenience arising from the derangement to which
the apparatus is liable by the sudden stoppage of the motion of the
ponderous ball.
   “It is proposed to remedy these disadvantages by regulating the
descent of the ball, so that its motion may be uniform, and causing
it to pass through three or five horizontal hoops. The motion may
be so regulated that the ball may pass through the distance between
one hoop and another in a determinate interval, as about 20°; and

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                  243
the mean of the times at which the ball is observed to pass the suc
cessive hoops may be taken as in the observation of the transit of a
star.                      -
   “If the ball is spherical, the time of its bisection by the hoops
may be noticed.
   “The observer is supposed to be at some distance from the appa
ratus, so that his eye may not be very far distant from the plane of
any of the hoops.”
   Colonel Batty sent for inspection a curious dial, of the workman
ship of Nicholas Kratzer, horologier to King Henry VIII., and the
friend of Holbein.
   This consists of a block cut into various faces and hollows, each
serving for a dial, mounted on a foot, and furnished with a plumb
line for rectification. There is a hollow on the top, which it is con
jectured was meant to receive a compass. The date is 1542, and
the arrangement and ornamental work very elegant.
   Colonel Batty has supplied the following biographical notice of
Kratzer, extracted from Bliss's edition of Wood's Athenae Oronienses :
   “Nicholas Kratz was born at Munich, and educated at the uni
versities of Cologne and Wittenburg. He came to England with
the degree of B.A., was made Fellow of Corpus Christi, Oxford, by
Bishop Fox, in 1517, gave lectures in astronomy in that university
on the king's order, and was appointed mathematical reader by
Cardinal Wolsey.
   “He seems to have written several mathematical treatises, which
are in still in MSS., chiefly in the Bodleian Library. One of these,
which is reputed to be his, is De Compositione Horologiorum.
   “He made the old dial which is now in the garden of Corpus,
and another standing on a pillar in the churchyard of St. Mary's.
He was living in the year 1550, and after his death many of his
books came into the hands of Dr. John Dee, and some into those of
Dr. Richard Forster.”
   Lunar Eclipse of March 19, 1848.
   Extract of a letter from the Rev. Charles Mayne, Killaloe.
   “The eclipse was observed with an excellent thirty-inch telescope
of two inches aperture, fixed pretty firmly to the window-sash.
Nothing particular was noted at first. The moon was seen well at
intervals between clouds for an hour and a half, and then was com
pletely covered. Some considerable time after, one of the family
going to the window exclaimed, ‘The eclipse is over!” I went to
the window and saw the whole of the moon, the colour much like
that of tarnished copper, i.e. of a dullish red, some parts being
darker than others. After looking at it for some time, I perceived
with great surprise that the eclipsed part was marked, but (from the
general effect produced on the moon) only indistinctly. Clouds soon
after covered the whole sky, and the moon was not again visible till
about a quarter of an hour before the end, when the appearance
was as usual, the eclipsed part nearly black and the rest perfectly
bright. I am told that aurora was visible the same night.”

    oN THE composition of THE PHosphates of URANIUM.                  º
                          BY M. WERTHER.
THE        author obtained two phosphates of uranium in a state of
        purity. When oxide of uranium is diffused in a small quan
tity of phosphoric acid, a saline mass of a bright yellow is formed,
part of which is dissolved by ebullition, and part remains insoluble.
The yellow solution, when sufficiently concentrated, deposits after
long exposure over sulphuric acid, a lemon-coloured salt in irregular
crystals, collected in groups. These crystals gave the following
results by analysis:—at 212°F. they lost 7.5 per cent.; at 248°,
10.2 per cent. ; after long exposure to 320°, they lost 13 l l ; and
by calcination 179 per cent. of water. Another portion lost by
calcination 168 per cent. of water, gave 26-7 of phosphoric acid,
and 55-96 of oxide of uranium; a third portion lost 12: 1 per cent.
of water at 230°, 17:2 by calcination, and gave 54.6 per cent. of oxide
of uranium; lastly, a fourth portion gave 27:49 of phosphoric acid.
    The mode of estimating adopted by the authorwas the following:—
He fused some potassio-tartrate of soda in a platina crucible, and
carbonized it with a sufficient degree of heat, out of contact of the
air, and added to it a noted weight of phosphate of uranium. The
heat must not be continued longer than is requisite to fuse the black
mass: by this all the sesquioxide is reduced to protoxide, and from
 it water will dissolve all the phosphate of soda, and the excess of
 carbonate, unmixed with even a trace of uranium, the protoxide of
 which remains on the filter, mixed with charcoal.
     M. Werther recommends two precautions in this operation to avoid
 decomposing the phosphoric acid, and consequently to prevent the
 perforation of the crucible: the phosphate of uranium must not be
 placed at the bottom of the crucible, and then merely introduce the
 potassio-tartrate of soda; again, the heat must not be raised above
 the degree of redness requisite to effect the decomposition.
     Sometimes small flames appear during the fusion; they are occa
 sioned merely by oxide of carbon. The filtered portion containing
 the phosphoric acid is saturated by hydrochloric acid, mixed with
 excess of ammonia and precipitated by sulphate of magnesia. As to
 the protoxide remaining on the filter, it is to be dissolved in nitric
  acid, precipitated by ammonia, and the precipitate is to be calcined.
     The preceding results lead to the formula [Pº O°, U* O3 +5H2O];
  or reckoning 2H2O as constituting an integrant part of the salt
  [P. O*, U* O*O, 2H2O+3 aq]. It is, however, correct to state that
  all the water is expelled between 338° and 356°F.
     This phosphate of uranium is decomposed by water into phos
  phoric acid, holding a little oxide of uranium in solution, and an
  insoluble subphosphate of uranium. If the latter be dissolved in
 phosphoric acid and precipitated by ammonia, a yellow salt is depo
  sited which retains ammonia after repeated washings.
     The phosphate of uranium, corresponding to common phosphate

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             245
of soda, is obtained by different processes; either by treating oxide
of uranium by phosphoric acid, or acetate of uranium with this acid;
or lastly, by precipitating nitrate of uranium by diphosphate of soda.
The salts obtained by these different processes do not, however,
contain the same quantity of water. They are of a bright yellow
colour, and usually crystalline, at least when seen by the microscope;
they are insoluble in water and acetic acid, but soluble in the mineral
acids and excess of carbonate of ammonia.
    a. The salt obtained by treating oxide of uranium with dilute
phosphoric acid and submitted to washing, is not crystalline, becomes
deeper coloured by calcination, and on cooling reassumes its bright
colour. Analysis gave, oxide of uranium, 72-77 to 72°16; phosphoric
acid, 1811 to 1796; water between 248° and 356° F., 7.03; and
by calcination, 9' 12 to 9.7 per cent. The formula deduced is
 [P 09, 2U8 O* O, H3O+3 aq]. The calcined salt, moistened with
water and dried over sulphuric acid, regains 7 per cent. of water,
 which may be expelled at 347°F.
    b. The salt obtained by adding phosphoric acid to a solution of
 acetate of uranium, as long as a precipitate is formed, constitutes,
 after washing, a crystalline powder, a little deeper than the foregoing
 salt. Dried at 140°F. it yielded,—oxide of uranium, 67-93; water
 at 248°, 12.9 per cent.; and from 500° to calcination 1574 to 15-2.
 The calcined salt gave 80 l of oxide of uranium and 19.9 of phos
 phoric acid. In another experiment, in which the salt had been
 dried merely by exposure to the air, by heating to 248°F. it lost
 2:19 per cent. of water, the same quantity at 320°, and by calcination
 such a further quantity as to give 1846 as the whole quantity of
 water; the same salt gave 64-78 of oxide of uranium. From these
 numbers M. Werther deduces the formula
                     [P 03, 2U2 O' O, H2O+8 aq].
     c. The salt obtained by the mixture of diphosphate of soda and
 nitrate of uranium has the same appearance as the foregoing; it lost
  1291 per cent. of water at 248°F., and by calcination 15:08; it gave
 67.97 per cent. of oxide of uranium, and 16:51 of phosphoric acid.
 M. Werther obtained the same saltby precipitating incompletely the
 trisphosphate of soda by nitrate of uranium, separating the precipi
 tate by a filter, and adding excess of nitrate of uranium to the filtered
 liquid.
   "Wien to nitrate of uranium an excess of trisphosphate of soda is
 added, a deep yellow salt is precipitated, which redissolves almost
 entirely on a further addition of the phosphate. If this excess be
 avoided, and the precipitate be perfectly washed, an agglomerated
 powder of a deep yellow colour is obtained, which, like all the other
 phosphates, is insoluble in water, but which is decomposed by acetic
  acid.   This salt contains more uranium than the preceding ; the
  author was, however, unable to obtain it of a composition exactly
  corresponding to a trismetallic phosphate.—Journ. de Ph. et de Ch.,
  Juillet 1848.

    ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE ARSENIATES OF URANIUM.
                           BY M. WEIt'THER.
   The author observes that arsenic acid acts like phosphoric acid on
 the oxide of uranium. It is easy to obtain salts with one or two
equivalents of metal; as to trisalt, M. Werther cannot positively
affirm that it exists.                                 -
   To analyse these arseniates, the author dissolved them in hydro
chloric acid, then boiled with sulphurous acid, and precipitated the
arsenic by sulphuretted hydrogen; the filtered solution was after
wards precipitated by ammonia, as in other analyses. He always ob
tained more exact results by estimating the arsenic acid by difference.
   The arseniate with one equivalent of uranium is obtained by eva
porating the oxide of the nitrate or acetate of uranium with an ex
cess of arsenic acid, and allowing it to remain over sulphuric acid.
The salt then appears in small crystals grouped together, but which
are not measurable,     It is soluble in mineral acids and carbonate of
ammonia, insoluble in acetic acid and in water. When strongly
calcined it yields anhydrous arsenic acid, oxygen and a subsalt, the
composition of which has not been determined.
   If the solution of the salt in arsenic acid be treated with ammonia,
a bright yellow precipitate is obtained which contains ammonia.
   This salt yielded by analysis,—oxide of uranium, 48:17; water,
13-7. Heated to 302°F. the salt lost 9.2 to 10.8 per cent. of water,
which agrees with the formula [As O9, 2H2O, U* O' O, +3 aq].
   The diarseniate of uranium, like the corresponding phosphate, may
be obtained by different processes.
   a. By adding arsenic acid to acetate of uranium, washing the
pale yellow precipitate, and drying it over sulphuric acid. The pro
duct is insoluble in water and in acetic acid.      Analysis:—oxide of
uranium, 59:05; water, 172; it loses at 248°F. 15:07 per cent. of
water.    These results agree with the formula
                   [Asº O', Hº O, 2U's O2 O-H-8 aq].
   b. When nitrate of uranium is boiled with arsenic acid till a good
part of the nitric acid is expelled, on water being added to the
liquid, a yellow powder separates, which, when completely washed
and analysed, gives the same composition as the preceding.
   c. If a solution of biarseniate of potash be added to one of nitrate
of uranium, a pale yellow crystalline powder separates. This salt
always containspotash, but not as much as an equivalent. Analysis:—
water by calcination, 11.3; at 266°, 10:5; oxide of uranium, 60-85;
potash, 27. The calcined salt contains 67.84 per cent. of oxide of
uranium, and 3.6 per cent. of potash.        .
   If an excess of trisarseniate of soda be added to a solution of ni
trate of uranium, a pale yellow powder separates, and the liquid con
tains no uranium. The precipitate appears viscid, and passes through
the filter during washing. It must therefore be washed with a so
lution of sal-ammoniac, and then with weak alcohol.
   This salt contains—soda, 5:9 l ; oxide of uranium, 60°21 to 61° 13;
water, 9.91 ; that is to say [Asº O', Na2O, 2U8 O2 O-H-5 aq]. It is
therefore a sodio-arseniate of uranium.—Journ. de Ph. et de Ch.,

    XXXVIII. Some Remarks on the Substances discovered by Mr.
       Stenhouse in the Roccella tinctoria and Evernia Prunastri.
       By Edward Schunck”.
    IN a paper read some months ago before the Royal Society,
        Mr. Stenhouse has communicated the results of an elabo
    rate investigation of the proximate principles of some of the
    lichens, especially the Roccella tinctoria and the Evernia Pru
    nastri. The multitude of new observations recorded by Mr.
    Stenhouse in his valuable paper, and the accuracy with which
    he has examined the composition of the various substances
    obtained by him, would seem at length to confer on this part
    of organic chemistry the degree of completeness required in
-   the present state of the science. . Nevertheless, on comparing
    his results with those of his predecessors on this field of in
    quiry, it may be asked how it is possible for so many persons
º
    to examine the same subject and arrive at such widely differ
    ent results; and some doubt may arise in the mind either as
-.
    to the skill of some of the investigators, or as to the accuracy
    of the methods at present employed in organic chemistry.
    The Roccella tinctoria has now been examined four times, and
    the discrepancies between the several investigations are very
    striking. Heeren discovered in it a substance which he called
    erythrine. Kane obtained from it a substance differing in its
    properties from Heeren's erythrine, and which he named ery
    thryline. In my examination of the plant I found a body
    corresponding to Heeren's erythrine and Kane's erythryline,
    but differing in properties from both, and in composition from
    the latter. To this substance I gave the name of erythric acid.
    Lastly, Mr. Stenhouse has obtained from different varieties of
    the Itoccella tinctoria no less than three different substances,
    similar to, but not identical with, those discovered by Heeren,
    Kane and myself. If, therefore, we are to believe all the

250       Dr. E. Schunck on the Substances discovered in
statements of those who have examined the subject, the same
plant, according to its varieties and the places of its growth,
produces sometimes one, sometimes another, of six different
bodies, each of which may entirely supply the place of any
one of the others. This circumstance is contrary to analogy;
since it is more common to find plants differing totally from
one another produce the same substance, than to find the same
plant in different circumstances secrete different substances.
 From the Evernia Prunastri, again, Messrs. Rochleder and
Heldt obtained lecanoric acid, while to Mr. Stenhouse the
same plant afforded evernic acid. There can of course be
no doubt that the Roccella tinctoria does in reality produce
 substances very different from one another according to the
place in which it grows. I shall, however, endeavour to show
in the following pages that it is possible, by comparing these
substances, to find a link by which to bind them together and
 bring them into harmony with one another.
    Now on comparing together the various colour-giving sub
 stances found at different times in the Roccella tinctoria, we
 shall find that all or several of them have certain properties
 in common. They all give red colouring matters when dis
 solved in ammonia and exposed to the air. In the next place,
 erythrine, erythryline and erythric acid, all produce, under
 certain circumstances, a bitter substance; but these circum
 stances are not the same with all three, and the bitter sub
 stance itself is also different in each case. Erythric acid and
 the two orsellic acids of Mr. Stenhouse are decomposed by
 alkalies into carbonic acid and orcine, accompanied in the case
 of erythric acid, according to Mr. Stenhouse, by another body,
 viz. pseudo-orcine. Lastly, all these substances agree with
 one another and with lecanoric acid, in giving, when treated
 with boiling alcohol, crystallized bodies soluble in boiling
 water, which have been proved to be aethers.
    It is to the latter circumstance that I wish in the first place
 to draw attention. Lecanoric acid, erythrine, erythryline,
 erythric acid, alpha-orsellic and beta-orsellic acid, all give,
 when treated with boiling alcohol, solid crystallizable aethers.
 The aether produced in this way from erythrine was called
 by Heeren, who was ignorant of its true nature, pseudo-ery
 thrine. Let us now compare together the composition of these
 various aethers, as determined by Kane, Rochleder and Heldt,
  Stenhouse and myself.
    The aether from erythrine consists, according to Kane, of

   On comparing the preceding analyses with one another,
any one conversant with organic chemistry will immediately
perceive that the differences are not greater than those usually
found in analysing the same substance from different sources.
The properties of these aethers are also identical as far as they
are known. I found lecanoric aether to have exactly the same
properties as those ascribed to pseudo-erythrine by Heeren
and Kane. I was also unable to discover any characteristic
difference between lecanoric aether and the aether from erythric
acid. Mr. Stenhouse says of orsellesic aether, “This aether
cannot be distinguished in its external properties from the
lecanoric and erythric aethers;” and the aether from beta
orsellic acid, according to him, “cannot be distinguished in
appearance from the orsellesic, lecanoric or erythric aethers,
with which bodies in its properties and reactions it very closely
corresponds.”     I therefore maintain that all these aethers are
nothing more nor less than lecanoric aether.                 Now lecanoric
aether consists of Cls HsOs-HC, H, O= C, His Og, and its
calculated composition is as follows:–
                                   S2

             22 eqs. Carbon . . 1650                     60-83

    It will be seen that the numbers of almost all of the above
analyses closely correspond with those of the calculated com
position of lecanoric aether. There is therefore at present
nothing to oppose the hypothesis that pseudo-erythrine, ery
thric aether, and the orsellic aethers, are all identical with leca
moric aether+.
    If this conclusion be accepted, it follows necessarily that
erythrine, erythryline, erythric acid, and the two orsellic acids,
 must contain lecanoric acid; and not only the elements of that
acid, but the acid as such. For if by acting on a certain sub
 stance with boiling alcohol we obtain the aether of a certain
 acid, it follows that this acid must have been contained in the
 original substance as such; since it would be contrary to all
 analogy to suppose that boiling alcohol is capable of exerting
 such a powerful influence on any substance as to make the
 elements of the latter arrange themselves in such a way as to
 form an acid, with which the basis of the alcohol might com
 bine to produce an aether, the affinity of oxide of ethyle for
 organic acids being in general so weak as to render the inter
 vention of a strong acid necessary to cause the decomposition
 of the alcohol before the combination can take place.
     Having now obtained a basis for comparing the various
 colour-giving substances of the Roccella tinctoria, I shall, in
 the first place proceed to the consideration of erythric acid.
    * I have supposed that the formula given above for lecanoric acid, viz.
  Cls Hs Os, is firmly established, and I am not aware that any experiments
  have been made tending to establish a better. Mr. Stenhouse, however,
  in a recent paper on Alpha-orcine and Beta-orcine (Phil. Mag., vol. xxxiii.
  p. 1), has given a new formula for orcine, called by him alpha-orcine, viz.
  Cºl His O9. Dry orcine, according to him, is Cºl His Oc. This change he
  has made apparently in order to obtain a formula corresponding with the
  analyses of dry orcine; since the composition of crystallized orcine, as de
  termined by him, agrees much better with the old formula Cig Hu O; than
  with the new one. I have myself never been able to obtain dry orcine of
  uniform composition; and even if obtained of uniform composition, as
  stated by Mr. Stenhouse, it may be questioned whether it is not a mixture
  of various hydrates in some proportion determined by the temperature and
  the length of time occupied in drying. At all events, if we change the for
  mula for orcine, the formula for lecanoric acid must also necessarily be
  changed, since lecanoric acid minus carbonic acid plus water is orcine. It
  will, however, be found impossible to find a formula which will express the
  composition of lecanoric acid, and will at the same time be in accordance
  with Mr. Stenhouse's new formula for orcine. I therefore prefer retaining
  the old formulae for orcine and lecanoric acid, the more so as these also
  harmonise with those of lecanoric aether and orceine,                      -

          the Roccella tinctoria and Evernia Prunastri.        253
   The first point to be determined is, whether the substance
to which I gave the name of erythric acid is the same as the
erythric acid of Mr. Stenhouse. Both give when treated with
boiling water picro-erythrine. Mr. Stenhouse, however, states
that picro-erythrine, when decomposed with alkalies, gives
carbonic acid, and a new substance called by him pseudo-orcine,
while I was of opinion that it is decomposed into carbonic acid
and orcine. Being still in possession of a sufficient quantity of
picro-erythrine, I treated some of it with boiling caustic baryta,
and after filtering, precipitating the excess of baryta by a
stream of carbonic acid gas and evaporating, I obtained a
mass of crystals, which, after being treated with aether and
crystallized over again, possessed the properties and compo
sition ascribed by Mr. Stenhouse to pseudo-orcine. The
aether on evaporation gave a quantity of orcine. This pro
perty of picro-erythrine, the discovery of which is due to Mr.
Stenhouse, is so characteristic as to prove at once that the
erythric acid examined by him is identical with that described
by me. As Mr. Stenhouse seems to have obtained the acid
in a state of much greater purity than I did, I shall lay no
stress on the differences found by us in its composition, but
shall at once accept the numbers given by him as expressing
the true composition.
   Mr. Stenhouse found erythric acid to consist in 100 parts
of
                              I.         II.        III.

   The formula given by him is Coo Hu Olo.
   Now I propose to change this formula into Cas Has O21. The
calculated composition will then be as follows:—

   It will be seen that Mr. Stenhouse's numbers agree suffi
ciently well with this formula; and I shall now show how, by
means of it, we may explain the various changes which the
acid undergoes.

remains to be explained in harmony with the preceding for

    On subjecting pseudo-orcine, prepared according to Mr.
 Stenhouse's method, to analysis, I obtained the following
 results:—
    I. O’5695 grim. substance gave 0.8270 carbonic acid and
 O°4355 water.
    II. 0.4130 grim. gave 0.6020 carbonic acid and 0.3240
 Water.
    It therefore consists in 100 parts of
                                                      Stenhouse.

    It will be seen that the formulae here adopted for erythric
 acid, picro-erythrine and pseudo-orcine, agree very well with

          the Roccella tinctoria and Evernia Prunastri.                255
the composition of these substances as determined by Mr.
Stenhouse; while the formulae given by that gentleman for
picro-erythrine, Cai H23 Ozo, and pseudo-orcine, Clo His Olo,
are not reconcilable with one another, nor with that given by
him for erythric acid, viz. Cao Hu Olo. By adopting the above
formulae, the changes which erythric acid undergoes admit of
an easy explanation. According to my view, erythric acid
may be considered as a compound of lecanoric acid and picro
erythrine. It is a coupled acid, in which the saturating power
of the simple acid is not destroyed. When erythric acid is
treated with boiling water, the lecanoric acid is decomposed
into orcine and carbonic acid, so that on evaporating the so
lution, a mixture of picro-erythrine and orcine is obtained.
When erythric acid is treated with boiling alcohol, the leca
noric acid contained in it is changed into lecanoric aether+,
and the liquid contains picro-erythrine. When picro-erythrine
is treated with alkalies, it loses carbonic acid, and taking up
several equivalents of water, is changed into pseudo-orcinet.
When, however, erythric acid is acted on by alkalies, the le
canoric acid contained in it is changed into orcine and car
bonic acid, and the picro-erythrine is changed into pseudo
orcine and carbonic acid, so that a mixture of orcine and
pseudo-orcine is obtained.
    As the names picro-erythrine and pseudo-orcine have a
barbarous sound, and the latter is also inappropriate, I pro
pose to change the former into Erypicrine and the latter into
Eryglucine. Erythric acid might therefore be called erypicrine
lecanoric acid.
    Mr. Stenhouse has discovered in a South American variety
of the Roccella tinctoria an acid, which he calls alpha-orsellic
acid; and in a Cape of Good Hope variety of the same plant,
a very similar acid, called by him beta-orsellic acid. He has
   * It follows that Mr. Stenhouse's erythric-methylic aether is, in fact,
lecanoric-methylic aether. Its formula must therefore be Cls Hs Os-HC, H2O
=Cao Hu Oo. Its composition would then be as follows:–

   # I am inclined to think that the orcine, which is found in small quan
tity accompanying the pseudo-orcine derived from the decomposition of
picro-erythrine, was produced from erythric acid left undecomposed among
the picro-erythrine.

   Now if these two acids are distinct, they are certainly iso
meric, since the differences in the preceding analyses are not
sufficiently great to justify the establishment of distinct for
mulae. I propose for these acids, therefore, the formula
C. His Ol. The calculated composition will then be as <U+017F>ol

   Assuming, then, that the above formula is the correct one,
it follows that—
        if from 1 eq. orsellic acid . .            = Cs. His Old
        we subtract 1 eq. lecanoric acid           = Cls Hs Os
                                     -               C16 Hio Os
        and add 1 eq. water       . . . .          =      H O
        we obtain 1 eq. crystallized orcine =Cig Hu O,
   According to this view, then, orsellic acid is a coupled acid,
consisting of orcine and lecanoric acid; or it is orcine-leca
noric acid, just as erythric acid is erypicrine-lecanoric acid.
It is therefore obvious how the formation of lecanoric aether

        the Roccella tinctoria and Evernia Prunastri.           257
by means of boiling alcohol, and of orcine by means of alkalies,
takes place.
   The formation of erythrelesicandorsellesic acids still remains
to be explained. If the view here taken be the correct one,
it follows that these two acids must be identical with lecanoric
acid combined with one equivalent of water, i. e. Cls HsOs
+ HO=Cls HoOo. Its composition would then be as fol
lows:—

   The composition of erythrelesic acid not having been ex
amined, it is impossible to arrive at any conclusion in regard
to it.
   I may here mention, that I some time ago discovered that if
lecanoric acid be dissolved in caustic baryta and again preci
tated, it is found to have taken up one equivalent of water,
and been changed into Cls Ho Og, and this water it does not
again lose. This equivalent of water is replaced in the aether
compound by C, H, O, so that it appears that this aether
forms no exception to the general rule, according to which
the oxide of ethyle in the aetÉ. always replaces the water of
the hydrated acid. The body Cls Hs Os might still retain the
old name of lecanorine.
   Mr. Stenhouse's evernic acid may also be shown to belong
to the same class of bodies as the preceding. Mr. Stenhouse
gives for evernic acid the formula Csa Hig Ola. I propose to
change this to Cas Hiz Ols. It would then be composed as
follows:—

    Evernic acid may therefore be considered as a coupled
acid, consisting of lecanoric and evernesic acids. It con
sequently appears probable that the Evernia Prunastri may
sometimes contain lecanoric acid only, as found by Rochleder
and Heldt, and sometimes lecanoric and evernesic acids com
bined to evernic acid, as found by Mr. Stenhouse. The
 orcine which is produced on treating evernic acid with alka
 lies, must be derived from the lecanoric acid.          Evernesic
acid being a more stable body than lecanoric, resists the action
 of alkalies; and on supersaturating with a mineral acid, it is
 precipitated. It seems probable that if evernic acid were dis
 solved in caustic alkali without adding an excess of the latter,
 and the solution just heated to the boiling-point, as in the case
 of orsellic acid, then, on adding a strong acid, a mixture of
 lecanoric and evernesic acids would be precipitated. But as
 Mr. Stenhouse treated his evernic acid with an excess of
 caustic potash or baryta, and boiled for some time, the leca
 noric acid would of course be decomposed. On treating
 evernic acid with boiling alcohol also, I should suppose that
 lecanoric aether would be generated, as well as evernesic aether.

Mr. Stenhouse, however, added caustic potash to the alcohol,
so that any lecanoric acid or lecanoric aether present must
necessarily have been decomposed.
   I have still a few words to say in regard to Kane's erythry
line. Kane has given this name to the colour-producing sub
stance found by him in the Roccella tinctoria. It is analogous
to erythric acid; but in composition it differs so widely from
the latter, as to preclude the supposition of their being iden
tical. Since erythryline gives among the products of its de
composition a body of §. same composition as lecanoric
aether, I infer that it contains lecanoric acid in a similar state
of combination as in erythric, orsellic and evernic acids. Kane
gives as the formula of erythryline, C2a His OS. I propose to
change this into Cas Has Ols. The composition would then
be as follows:—
                                                     Kane.

    Now C2. He, Os is the formula which I have given in my
paper on the <U+017F>toccella tinctoria for roccellic acid. It would
 appear, therefore, that erythryline is equal to lecanoric acid
 plus roccellic acid minus two equivalents of water. As Kane
 has mentioned no experiments on its products of decomposi
 tion, no further reasons can be given for or against this view
 of its composition.
    In my opinion, therefore, erythryline, erythric acid, orsellic
 acid and evernic acid, are coupled acids, in which lecanoric
 acid forms the acid ingredient, and they might be called re
 spectively roccell-lecanoric, erypicrine-lecanoric, orcine-leca
 moric and evernesine-lecanoric acids. They resemble those
 coupled acids, which consist of simple acids united with neu
 tral bodies, and which saturate the same quantity of any base
 as the simple acids contained in them. They are similar to
 hippuric acid, which may be considered as a compound of

benzoic acid and glycocoll minus two equivalents of water.
Before this view, however, can be considered as established,
it will be necessary to examine carefully the aethers derived
from lecanoric, erythric and orsellic acids, in regard to their
crystalline form, specific gravity, action on light, &c., and also
to compare accurately together orsellesic, erythrelesic and
lecanoric acids.      If the aethers derived from various sources
should possess the same physical properties, and if orsellesic
and erythrelesic acids should prove to be identical in proper
ties and composition with lecanoric acid which has been dis
solved in alkali and reprecipitated, then I contend that my view
of the composition of these bodies will best explain the mani
fold changes which they undergo.

XXXIX. An Account of some Experiments on Volta-Electric
             Induction. By REUBEN PHILLIPs, Esq.”
Th;         apparatus I employed consisted of three similar coils
       of covered copper wire, number 16, each coil being about
3-5 inches diameter, and containing eleven yards of wire; the
ends of the wire were left exposed, so that by binding-screws
the coils could be united in any order. I call these coils re
spectively A, B and C. To ascertain the force and direction
of the induced current, I generally used an indicating helix
containing a needle; this helix was made by winding covered
copper wire, No. 24, on a piece of glass tube about Tºth of an
inch in diameter; the wire was wound on the glass until it
had acquired the depth of nine layers. This helix, which I
call the indicator, was maintained in the same relative position
with regard to an induced current, and the needles were
always inserted with their points in the same relative direction;
consequently the direction of the magnetism imparted by a
current traversing the indicator was always the same for cur
rents in that direction. I call a needle after it has been placed
in the indicator, the indicating needle; the needles employed
were of one size, and by the same maker. The magnetism
imparted to them by the indicator was discovered by present
ing them to one of two sewing-needles, which had been mag
   * When I had completed this paper, which I thought was altogether
new, I acquainted Dr. Faraday with it, who informed me Dr. Henry had
previouslygiven the same results in a paper entitled “Contributions to Elec
tricityand Magnetism” (Transactions ofthe American Philosophical Society,
vol. vi.); however, Dr. Faraday thought very well of my paper and advised
its publication. It is proper to remark, the paper has been a little altered
since Dr. Faraday expressed this good opinion of it.

           Mr. R. Phillips on Volta-Electric Induction.          ‘261
 netized and suspended so as to form a partially astatic arrange
ment. The battery was one on Smee's construction; it con
 sisted of six repetitions, and the immersed portion of each
plate was about 4 inches by 3.5 inches. Throughout these
experiments the battery current always passed in the same
direction with regard to the convolutions of the indicator.
    One of the coils A was laid horizontally on a table, and the
coil B upon A; the ends of A were in communication with
the indicator, one end of B with a wire from the battery, and
the other end of B dipped into some mercury into which the
other galvanic pole could be plunged. A needle was now
placed in the indicator, the battery circuit completed, and the
needle removed; the point of the needle was found as the
marked end of a magnet.
    The battery current was now sent through B, then the
 needle was placed in the indicator and the battery circuit
broken, when the eye end of the needle was the marked mag
netic end.
    A needle was now placed in the indicator, and the battery
circuit made and broken, when the eye end of the needle be
came as the marked end of a magnet. In these three cases
the magnetism was very strong and apparently equal.
    These induced currents circulate in the same direction as
pointed out by Dr. Faraday, but their law of relative force is
entirely different; for he found that “when the unmagnetized
needle was put into the indicating helix, before contact of the
inducing wire with the battery, and remained there until the
contact was broken, it exhibited little or no magnetism; the
first effect having been nearly neutralized by the second. The
force of the induced current upon making contact was found
always to exceed that of the induced current at breaking of
contact”.”
    When the coil A was connected with a galvanometer instead
of the indicator, then closing the circuit through B, caused the
ends of the galvanometric needles to start through a space of
about gºth of an inch, and the same on breaking the circuit;
but when the end of the wire was rapidly plunged into and re
moved from the mercury, the needle appeared to make only
an abrupt and barely perceptible motion on the circuit being
completed. This agrees with the equality which Dr. Faraday
and all who have followed him have found; so that although
different helices give the two induced currents as various
forces measured by the indicator, yet, as measured by the
galvanometer, they are respectively very equal. This can only
arise from the two induced currents being about equal in
         * Experimental Researches in Electricity, vol. i. p. 4.

262        Mr. R. Phillips on Volta-Electric Induction.
quantity but differing in velocity; for if a shock of electricity
is sent through the wire of a galvanometer in a given time,
imparting motion to the needle, then if a shock of the same
quantity of electricity passes through the wire in any less time,
it will impart, making up in force what it wants in time, the
same motion to the needle, while it would develope a much
higher magnetism in the indicator. I thus conclude, that when
induced currents are produced by the discharge of a Leyden
jar, the magnetized needle principally registers the variable
difference of velocity between the two currents.
    It will be convenient to call the current induced in the
neighbouring coil by completing the battery circuit, the first
 induced current; and that generated while the battery current
 ceases, the second induced current.
    It seemed to me very improbable that the first and second
 induced currents should travel the copper wires with such
 unequal velocities, and yet be exactly equal in quantity, as it
 would involve a strange relation between the electromotive
 force of the induced currents and metallic electric conduction.
    By proper supports and by bending it, I arranged the wire
 which dipped into the mercury, so that striking the wire, as
 one would a key of a piano played staccato, sufficed to close
 and open the battery quickly whenever I pleased. The gal
 vanometer being connected with the coil A as before, the
 needles were made to vibrate through an arc about Tºth of an
 inch long; I then struck the wire with my finger at such times
 as should tend to increase the motion of the needles, on the
 supposition that the first induced current is the more powerful;
 the needles were soon reduced to rest. I again made the
 needles vibrate, and struck the wire at those times when so
 doing should add motion to the needles according to the no
 tion that the second induced is the more powerful current,
 and now the needles could be kept oscillating in a small arc
 as long as I pleased. Therefore the second induced current
 is the larger quantity.
     The third coil C was placed on B, one end of both A and
 C were united to the indicator, and the other ends bound
 together; A and C were so placed that on causing an electric
 current to circulate through B, the current induced in A should
 act against that induced in C; I found they effectually neu
  tralized each other.
     I next placed a copper plate 4'5 inches square (which was
  the size of all the plates employed in these experiments) and
  inth of an inch thick, between B and C, and made and broke
  the battery circuit once through B, which rendered the eye
  end of the needle as the marked magnetic pole.

          Mr. R. Phillips on Volta-Electric Induction.       263
   The battery circuit was completed through B, and then the
needle was placed in the indicator and the circuit broken,
which made the eye end the marked pole.
   Finally, a needle was placed in the indicator, the battery
circuit closed and the needle removed; the point of the needle
was the marked end. In these two last experiments the mag
netism was much stronger than in the one preceding them.
   The copper plate was now removed, and a plate of zinc the
rändth of an inch thick was substituted for it; on closing and
opening the battery circuit once, the eye end of the needle
became as the marked magnetic pole. I have thought it rather
unnecessary to examine every plate as I did the copper, and
I have therefore taken the most easily obtained case as a re
presentative of the others. I should observe, too, that in all
these experiments care was taken to place only unmagnetized
needles in the indicator.
   A plate of lead ºth of an inch thick being substituted for
the zinc, produced the same effect; so also did a plate of tin
of similar thickness; but when a glass plate gºth of an inch
thick was used instead of the metal plates, I could obtain no
effect on the indicating needle, although I closed and opened
the battery circuit through B many times.
    When a plate of iron gºth of an inch thick was placed
between B and C, the same effect as if it was a copper plate
was produced on the indicating needle, but with the iron plate
 the induced current was evidently much more powerful.
    I now proceeded to examine if a specific force belongs to
each metal, or whether they all similarly effect the volta-elec
tric induction.
    Between A and B I placed a plate of lead gºth of an inch
thick, and between B and C a plate of copper of similar thick
ness; the battery was then closed and opened once through
 B as before; the indicating needle had its eye end as the
marked end of a magnet.
    A needle was now placed in the indicator, the circuit through
 B completed, and the needle removed; in this case the point
 was the marked end.
    The battery was now closed through B, the needle placed
 in the indicator, and the circuit broken; this gave the eye end
 of the indicating needle as the marked magnetic pole. In
 these two last experiments the magnetism was stronger than
 in the experiment next going before.
    When a plate of copper was substituted for the lead, no
 effect could be obtained in the indicator, even when this plate
 of copper was only <U+017F>ºuth of an inch thick.
    From the last experiment it follows that lead is much in

 264       Mr. R. Phillips on Polta-Electric Induction.
 ferior to copper in cutting off the inductric influence of a con
 ductor; and this difference is perceptible with either the first
 or second induced current; also the difference of magnetizing
 power between the first and second induced current still re
 mains.
    Having reversed the plates, that is, having placed the cop
 per where the lead was, and the lead where the copper was,
 other circumstances being the same as before, the magnetism
 of the indicating needle announced a current of electricity the
 reverse of that obtained when the plates were in their former
 position. In this, and generally in all the following experi
 ments, the mercury was not employed to complete the battery
 circuit, which was effected by bringing together two copper
 wires; I have found the results identical with either method.
    A plate of tin gºth of an inch thick and the usual size of
 4:5 inches square, was placed between A and B, and the similar
 plate of copper between B and C.; no effect was produced on
 the needle by completing the battery circuit twelve times; but
 when the circuit was closed and opened by drawing one of the
 terminal wires a few times over a file, the eye end of the needle
 became as the marked end of a magnet.
    On placing the copper plate between A and B, and the tin
 plate between B and C, and interrupting the battery current
 as before, the point of the needle became as the marked end
 of a magnet. Hence tin acts with regard to copper as lead
 does, but the difference between tin and copper is less than
 between lead and copper.
    I now placed between A and B a plate of zinc ºrth of an
 inch thick, and between B and C the similar plate of copper;
 but although I employed the file I could obtain no magnetism,
 even when another similar copper plate was laid on that pre
viously used.                                                * *
    It occurred to me that perhaps such thick plates of metal
were unsuited to develope the effects sought; for denoting by
 P, P' those portions of the magnetic force which found their
                                                 #
way respectively to A and C, then, although might be very
great and go on increasing with the thickness of the metal
plates, yet P-P', which must be the magnetizing force, might
be very small and capable of increase by a somewhat dimi
nished thickness of the plates. This proved to be true.
   I placed between A and B a plate of zinc rºodth of an inch
thick, and between B and C a plate of copper ºth of an inch
thick; the battery circuit was closed and opened ten times,
when the eye end of the indicating needle was its marked mag
netic end.   I now reversed the order of the plates, and closed
                                                                   ;

and opened the circuit ten times, when the point of the needle
was its marked magnetic end.                                -
   I substituted for the zinc in the two last experiments an
other plate of copper Hirth of an inch thick; in one experi
ment there was obtained a scarcely appreciable amount of
magnetism and in the other none; in both instances the cir
cuit was made ten times.
   I could produce no effect in the indicating helix even with
the aid of the file when a plate of glass ºth of an inch thick
was placed on one side of B, and a corresponding interval
filled of course with air, maintained on the other side.
   I thought it interesting to ascertain what relation two similar
plates of one metal, but having different thicknesses, bear to
each other in limiting the action of the primary coil upon the
secondary coils. I therefore placed a plate of zinc rºodth of
an inch thick, together with a plate of glass gºth of an inch
thick, between A and B, and between B and C a plate of zinc
gºth of an inch thick; the glass was merely employed to pro
duce a suitable space between A and B; the battery circuit
was closed and opened twenty times, which made the eye end
of the indicating needle to become as the marked end of a
magnet. When the thin zinc and glass were placed between
B and C, and the thick zinc between A and B, then on com
pleting and breaking the battery circuit as before, the indica
ting needle showed a reverse magnetism. I made some ex
periments to ascertain if any difference arose by putting the
glass plate on different sides of the thin metal plate, but could
obtain no result to countenance such a notion.
    Like results were obtained by using for the two zinc plates
of the last experiments two plates of copper, one THzth of an
inch and the other ºth of an inch thick. Nor did it appear
to occasion any difference if the place of the thicker metal
plate was supplied by two thinner ones.
    From these experiments I conclude, that a thick mass of
 metal plate stands to a thinner mass of the same metal as cop
 per does to lead.
    The question now arose in my mind, Does a metallic plate
 effect similarly, as to degree, the first and second induced
 currents? This was answered negatively by the following
 experiments.
    Having removed the upper coil C, I united that end of the
 indicator, with which C had previously communicated, to the
 end of A which had been joined to C, and placed two plates
 of copper, each ºth of an inch thick, between A and B;
 after having completed and broken the battery circuit once
 through B, the point of the indicating needle was as the marked

end of a magnet. One only of the copper plates was insuffi
cient to produce this effect.
   I now used instead of the copper plates two zinc plates each
gºth of an inch thick; the magnetism of the needle, after the
completion and disruption of the battery circuit as before,
was much weaker than if no plates had been interposed be
tween the coils, and in the same direction, that is, the eye end
of the needle was as the marked magnetic end. Having re
moved these zinc plates, and substituted a pair of zinc plates
each 8 inches by 4-5 inches square, their combined thickness
being 3 of an inch, and having closed and opened the battery
circuit once, I found the point of the needle strongly as the
marked end of a magnet; these plates had however been
amalgamated and a little used for galvanic purposes. Two
plates of zinc and two of tin, each ºth of an inch thick and
of the usual size, acted the same as the two thick zinc plates
in the last experiment; the tin plates alone were quite in
effective. In these experiments the induced current always
passed in the directions pointed out by Dr. Faraday.
   Here, then, we have the first induced current the more                  <U+017F>º
powerful, which is the contrary to that obtained in any of the
foregoing experiments. The superiority of copper in produ
cing this effect evidently arises from its great power of electric
conduction. When a mass of glass was used instead of the
copper, the eye end of the indicating needle became of course
as the marked end of a magnet.
   I made some experiments on the transmission of the mag
netic force by the metals with the aid of two small electro
magnets, the coil of one being connected with the indicator
and that of the other with the battery; the poles of each were
placed near to each other, so that the battery current being
sent through, or checked in the coil of one magnet, induced
a current in that of the other. The interposition of masses of
metal between the magnetic poles occasioned no difference in
the intensity of the magnetism imparted to the indicating
needle when the battery circuit was closed or opened. I ac
count for this by considering the slowness with which iron
varies its magnetic state, and by supposing the action of
such a metal as copper, when placed in the lines of magnetic
force, retards their transmission more than air, and my ap
paratus not being sufficiently delicate to distinguish these two
effects. Dr. Faraday first supposed such might be the action
of interposed substances, and his experiments on this subject
much confirm this view%.                                                 -
  * See Experimental Researches in Electricity, vol.ip,545 and following,

           Mr. R. Phillips on Volta-Electric Induction.        267
   In concluding I cannot but observe, that the power pos
sessed by the different metals I have yet employed to shut off
the circumferential influence of an electric current varies as
their electric conduction; for we have them in the order of
copper, zinc, tin and lead, which is that of their relative powers
of electric conduction according to Harris. This view is further
confirmed by the difference produced by thick and thin plates
of the same metal. Indeed the following experiment clearly
shows that the office of a metal, in thus intercepting volta
electric induction, is that of an electric conductor.
   The former arrangement of A, B and C was restored; and
of two similar plates of zinc, each rºodth of an inch thick, one
was placed between A and B and the other between B and C ;
then by the aid of a file I rapidly made and broke the battery
current through B, but could obtain no magnetism in the in
dicating needle. I now removed the plate from between B
and C, and commencing at the middle point of one of its edges,
I cut a slit at a right angle to the edge 3.5 inches long and 1
of an inch wide; the plate was then replaced in its former
position between B and C, and the battery closed and opened
once through B, which made the point of the indicating needle
as the marked end of a magnet. When the position of the
plates was reversed, the magnetism of the indicator was also
reversed. Therefore a plate is to its fellow which has been
slit as copper is to lead; and, moreover, the only assignable
use of the slit is to prevent the circulation of electric currents.
   With regard to constructing the three coils with which these
foregoing results are to be obtained, I would remark they
should not be much more than half an inch thick each; they
may however contain any quantity of wire, and be of any dia
meter consistently with the power of the battery. I propose
to call this instrument a differential volta-inductometer.
    By means of my three small coils it is easy to obtain a shock
from the specific induction of a metal, by removing the indi
cator from the ends of the coils A and C, these coils being of
course set so as to tend to circulate the induced current in
opposite directions through each other; then having placed a
plate of copper next B and brought the unattached ends of A
 and C to one's tongue, on closing and opening the battery
circuit through B the shock is obtained.

   a Binomial, with a simplifted proof of a remarkable Theo
   rem of Abel. By J. R. YoUNG, Professor of Mathematics
   in Belfast College”.
Th; following properties of the                   binomial development,
       although for the most part new to me, yet lie so near the
surface, that I can scarcely suppose that they have hitherto
been overlooked. It is probable, however, that there may at
least be something novel in the method of investigation I have
employed; and this, added to the circumstance that the proof
of Abel's remarkable generalization of the binomial theorem,
and of the development of the function p (w-Ha), is a little
facilitated by this method, may perhaps justify the publication
of the paper in these pages.                      * . . . . .. . .

something like an anticipation of the value sought.

   The theorem (12.) is included in this of Abel, as that illus
trious analyst has noticed; but the other analogous theorems
in this paper, where the exponents are different from n—1,
are not implied in the theorem of Abel, nor have I ever met
with them.
   It is probable, however, that some works on finite differ
ences may contain these expressions; but this is a point about
which I have not thought much inquiry necessary, as my chief
object is to show, in detail, how a remarkable theorem in the
higher analysis may be arrived at by only the simplest prin

a theorem given by Murphy in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1887, and which is usually referred to as “Murphy's
theorem.” It appears, however, from the above method of
obtaining it, that it is a particular case of the general theorem
of Abel. But as Abel's posthumous papers—among which
this theorem was found—were not published till 1839, ten
years after the author's death, Murphy's claim is quite inde
pendent, although not, as hitherto supposed, exclusive.
   The preceding method of establishing this general theorem
of Abel, by assuming a series of a particular form, and then,
as in the investigation of Maclaurin's theorem, putting, in the
successive differential coefficients, those values for a which
cause all the terms containing this variable to vanish, is very
short and simple; but without the previous proof of the par
ticular case of the binomial theorem, we should have had no
thing to suggest to us the peculiar form selected. . This sug
gestion, however, once supplied, we may, instead of examining
each differential coefficient in succession, as above, and thence
inferring the general uniformity of the law of the coefficients
A, B, C, &c. by induction, —instead of this, we may proceed
at once to demonstrate the general property that

is zero for w=r8, provided n < m; and that it is 1.2.3....n,
for n=m; which property will establish the above values of
 A, B, C, &c., rigorously and universally.
   To prove it, conceive a in (A.) to be changed into a 4-h,
the binomial to be developed, and the series multiplied by
a +h: the coefficient of h", in the result, will, of course, when
multiplied by 1.2:3...n, be the nth differential coefficient (A.).
It is easy to see that this coefficient, that is the coefficient of
h", is

cing the absent numerical factor, we have in this case
                          (A.)= 1.2. 3... n,
as was to be proved.
   The expression under the sign of differentiation in (A.), if
developed, and then the series differentiated n times, né being
afterwards put for a, will furnish new properties of the binomial
coefficients, which need not however be here formally exhibited.
   There are probably other expressions, analogous to (A.),
that might suggest developments of like generality with that
of Abel; but I question whether they are worth searchin
for. In fact, and the remark is of some importance, all .#
general theorems must be received with caution and quali
fication: they are strictly true only when the terms of the series
become at length actually zero, or at least tend to zero. With
out this qualification, the binomial theorem itself, even in its
ordinary form, would be fallacious.         Analysis, unfortunately,
abounds with fallacies of this kind.       Theorems are sometimes
presented to us with an aspect of       unlimited     Fºliº   which
are not true even in a single individual case ! The following
is an instance : viz.
     £(a)=p(a + 2)--4 (w—a)—p(a +22)—p(a —22) + . . . .
the simplest case of which, viz.
                    ar= a + v – ºr – ºr + 3 + . . . .
is repugnant to common sense.
   This theorem was, I believe, first given by Français in the
Annales des Math., vol. iii. It was again obtained by Abel,
in vol. ii. of his CEuvres, p. 85, and has been reproduced by
Gregory in his Examples, p. 243. It is the tendency of ana
lysis, if left unrestrained, to spread, in some directions, into
unprofitable luxuriance, by which it is encumbered, but not
advanced. A little in the way of correcting this fault, I have
myself attempted in the pages of this Journal and elsewhere;
but much more is required. This, however, is a task which
I leave to those whose position may be less inimical to the

add, in conclusion, that in order not to encroach unreasonably
on these pages, I have transferred two articles connected with
the present paper to the Mechanics' Magazine; they probably

   $ XVIII. Does Induction affect the acoustic properties of
                             Elastic Bodies 2
 165.   I    PUBLISHED two years agot some experimental
              researches on the causes of the sounds produced by
discontinuous electric currents in metallic wires. This phae
nomenon may be viewed under other aspects, and it may be
asked whether a permanent electric induction determines in
the molecules of sonorous bodies a change of elasticity which
is rendered evident by appreciable modifications in their
acoustic properties. The following experiments have been
undertaken with a view to solve this question.
    166. A disc was selected of 0"198 diameter, and Om'0018
thickness, forming part of a Marloye's set of plates. This
disc was made with the greatest possible care: its texture is
remarkably homogeneous, and the acoustic figures, formed of
diameters or concentric circumferences, are produced upon
it with extreme precision. Its lower surface was covered with
a thick layer of gum-lac varnish; and after strongly electrizing
this sort of electrophore, the charge was sustained by means
of a good machine. It was however impossible to discover
the least difference in its sonorous state, whether it was elec
trified or not.
    167. A glass disc, Om 135 in diameter and Om.002 in thick
ness, was furnished on both its surfaces with a circular arma
ture of tinfoil, 0” 117 in diameter. This flat condenser was

of which are identical with those which I then enunciated with respect to
the effects of discontinuous currents.   See the Institut of the 10th of

held by its centre between two isolating clamps. Its funda
mental tone was then ascertained, and the tones which cor
respond to different modes of nodal subdivisions. The same
experiments were then repeated, after electrifying the lower
surface, the other being put in communication with the ground.
The fluid distributed over the latter exercised no influence on
the musical qualities of the plate. The only effect which in
dicated its presence was a repulsion of the particles of sand
at the fixed point toward the common intersection of the

   168. An iron wire, one metre long, was stretched on a mo
nochord. It occupied the axis of a glass tube, on which was
rolled a thick copper wire covered with silk, and forming part
of the circuit of a Grove's battery of five pairs (139.). #.
transversal and longitudinal sounds of the wire remained the
same as before the action of the current.
   169. A brass wire, arranged on the sonometer parallel to
the first, was tuned exactly in unison with it. An electro-magnet
excited by the five pairs was placed near the iron wire. Every
time the instrument was arranged so that the attraction of its
É. could not make the wire bend, the latter comported itself

   170. In the preceding experiment the induction was distri
buted over a great length. It might thence be feared that its
effect would be diminished on the nodal or ventral portions
of the wire. I therefore repeated these experiments with wires
of only 0”20 of copper and iron. In order to prevent any
temporary or permanent disfigurement resulting from the
different tensions to which they were subjected, I employed in
stretching them a mechanical artifice used in the suspension
of the threads of rheometers.       It consists of a moveable nut
acting upon a screw terminated by a square prism, which slips
into a fixed hollow piece of the same section. The metallic
cord was attached at one end to an immoveable pin, and the
other to the extremity of the prism opposite to the screw. It
coincided with the axis of a bobbin On 1 in length, and Om.032
external diameter, and which is perforated by an aperture
of Om'011, in which were placed eleven concentric tin cylinders,
cut according to a generatrice and isolated from one another.
Each wire was made to vibrate transversely by means of the
bow, first in the natural state and then under the intense in
duction of Grove’s battery, without ever finding a difference
in the musical sound. . The experiment was repeated with
different degrees of tension of the wires, and making them give
a numerous series of harmonics.       The result never varied."

       171. I afterwards operated on metallic plates placed near a
    magnetic apparatus, the induction of which could make itself
   felt successively in all their sections. With this view I pro
   cured three discs, one of tempered steel, another of untem
   pered steel, and the third of soft iron,0"198 in diameter and
   0"-0018 in thickness: they were fixed in turn on a glass bar,
   kept vertical by a convenient support. The magnet, which is
   provided with a vertical steel rod situated in the prolongation
    of the geometrical axis of the bar, and parallel to the branches
   of  §:.             is arranged above the plate, and at a distance
    variable at will. This rod is terminated by an endless screw
   in which a toothed-wheel catches, which is worked by a winch.
    One of the extremities of the wire of the electro-magnet is
    fastened to the rod, whilst the other is soldered to a copper
   ring which surrounds an isolating wooden disc carried by
    the axis. This simple arrangement permits the current of
    Grove's battery to pass into this wire without interruption,
    whatever be the velocity of rotation given to the magnet. It
   suffices for this to employ as voltaic poles two copper springs,
   one of which presses against the steel axis, and the other
   against the ring. ...
       172. The three discs, being of different elasticity, gave a
   different fundamental sound, notwithstanding the equality of
   their dimensions. The electro-magnet exerted on them, at
   a distance of two to six millimetres, so energetic an attraction,
   that it was necessary to recur to an enormous pressure against
   their support to overcome it entirely.
       173. After having sprinkled the plate under observation
   with very dry sand, and determined the corresponding sounds
   by different modes of vibration indicated by acoustic figures,
   I endeavoured to ascertain whether the magnetic influence is
   capable of modifying these sounds. Here, again, all the
   results, were negative. The only difference of action of the
   magnet, according as it was immovable or turned with any
   rapidity, was limited to a slight irregularity of the nodal lines,
   solely produced by the currents of air.
      174. When iron-filings were substituted for the sand, the
   sonorous phaenomena were still the same, although more sup
   pressed. The filings spread in the vicinity of the poles accu
   mulated against them as soon as the electric current was
   established, and soon rendered the rotatory motion of the
   magnet almost impossible.
      175. These experiments were repeated, rendering the pas
   sage of the electricity discontinuous. The molecular shocks
   investigated by several physicists were then heard. With a
   mercurial commutator in the circuit of the battery exciting

the magnet, the plates of soft iron become the seat of suffi
ciently intense sounds for a great number of persons to be
able to hear them simultaneously.
    176. Finally, I tried to induce at the same time electricity
of tension and magnetism in the steel and iron discs. For
this purpose, the bar which supports them was placed in the
centre of a glass tube O*02 in diameter, to which was fixed a
horizontal circle of wood, on 18 in diameter by 0”018 in
thickness. This circle, entirely covered with tinfoil, commu
nicates with a good electric machine. Parallel to the surface
which is made to vibrate, it is thus brought as near as possible
to it without the spark being emitted to it. The acoustic
properties of the three discs remained indifferent to this new
action. The plate of tempered steel had acquired a perma
nent magnetism which did not at all interfere with its musical
properties.
    177. It results from these experiments, that electric or
magnetic induction has no appreciable action on the elasticity
of different sonorous bodies, such as glass, copper, brass, soft
iron, and steel tempered or untempered. The number of vibra
tions executed by them in the unity of time remains the same.
But this conclusion must probably not be accepted in too abso
lute a manner. It might be that extremely energetic and very
durable causes of induction determine an action which, in my
experiments, has been too weak to be observed *.

       R. CAYLEY'S ingenious researches, published in the
           last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, have re
called to my mind some speculations of my own upon the
same subject. To the purely mathematical treatment of it I
have indeed little to add. What I shall say will rather have
reference to its philosophy.
    It were much to be desired that the general principles which

duced to a consistent theory; for there undoubtedly exists a
theory of signs applicable as well to the signs of common dis
course as to the signs of mathematics. Without attempting
to exhibit any complete doctrine on the subject, I will venture
to state one or two views which I have been led to form, and
apply them to the subject of quaternions.
   Signs employed as instruments of reasoning may, in one
point of view, be considered as the representatives of opera
tions. This is not indeed the interpretation that we necessarily
attach to them, but it is one which it is probable that in all
cases we may attach, and from which their laws may in all
cases be deduced. If we employ a particular symbol or com
bination of symbols A to represent a given operation, and
another symbol or combination of symbols B to represent
another given operation of the same kind, then, according to
the Arabic order of writing, AB will represent the successive
performance of the operations denoted by B and A. In order
that such signs may be really available as instruments of de
duction, it is necessary that the laws of the symbols entering
into B and A should be such, that the expression AB deve
loped according to those laws may, in agreement with the con
ventions established for the interpretation of A and B, repre
sent an operation, the effect of which is equivalent to the com
bined effects of the operation A and B performed in the order
(proceeding from right to left) A.B.
   In strict accordance with this principle, we may assign an
interpretation to a quaternion w:i-iv-Hjy+kz, subject to the
condition
                         wº-wº-y”--2°–1 . . . . . (1)
For if we write
 w-cost                          =sin !cosº.     ==sinº    co,
   =cos; •=sin!        COS
              wasing cosº y=sing                  =sing cosx,
and assume the quaternion wi-ia-Hjy--kz to represent a ro
tation through an angle 6 round an axis whose direction cosines
are p, q, x, then representing this quaternion by A and any
other quaternion subject to a similar condition by A', we shall
have
                             AA'-A",
A" being a quaternion which, according to the same conven
tions, will represent a single rotation equivalent in effect to the
two rotations represented by A' and A performed in the given
Succession.                                                       -
   A quaternion which does not satisfy the condition (1.) can
not be directly interpreted in geometry. Such expressions

280           Mr. G. Boole's Notes on Quaternions.
may nevertheless be employed, with the understanding that
certain factors shall be rejected or other reductions performed,
and thus they may lead to correct results. But the employ
ment of such a form of the process seems to involve a depart
ure from the principle, that the laws of the sign shall consti
tute in every respect an exact counterpart to the laws of the
thing signified.
   Sir William Hamilton's theory of the application of qua
ternions appears to be based upon the relations which their
elements bear to the angles and angular points of spherical
polygons; and similar to this is the basis which Prof. Graves
has adopted for the not less interesting theory of triplets and
multiplets. In all these systems we meet with such theorems
as the following, viz. that the product of two given points is a
certain third point, &c., by which it is meant that a certain
expression, having a determinate reference to the latter point,
is the product of two expressions having a similar determinate
reference to the two original points. I believe that upon exami
nation it will be found that these systems of interpretation are
founded upon a principle of Naming, as the one which I have
proposed is founded upon a principle of Operation. And I think
it not foreign to the subject to remark, that the symbolical
forms of common language as exhibited in the calculus of logic
may indifferently be referred to the one or the other of these
modes of conception.
                      Laws of Quaternions.
   The laws of quaternion multiplication are founded, as is
well known, upon the following relation:                  -
      i”=–1 jº-–1 K*=–1 if–k jk=i ki–j
               ji= —k kj= —i ik- —j;
but it may be shown that the three last of these laws are con
sequences of the former ones considered as of universal appli
cation.
   For if if-k universally, let the subject be <U+017F>y, then
                             ijjy=ky,
or
                             ijºy=kjy;
but jº-–1, therefore
                              -iy-/<U+017F>y,
and similarly for the others.

           XLIII. On the Eristence of the Colour Brown.
                          By ERNST BRücke”.
  BROWN is wanting in the prismatic spectrum, and its
       relation to the colours of the spectrum is as yet unknown. .
  Any one may, however, easily convince himself that brown is
 nothing more than the complementary colour to that of Her
  schel's lavender-gray rays, i. e. white light from which these
  rays have been removed.
     For this purpose, separate plates should be split from cry
 stallized gypsum in such a manner that on one side they are
 as thin as possible, and from it gradually increase in thickness
 in broad terraces. One of these plates is placed under the
 microscope, which must be furnished with two Nichol’s
 prisms, one beneath the object-glass, and one in the eye-piece,
 and so arranged, the prisms being parallel, and the linear
 magnifying power being about twenty diameters (at a di
 stance of eight French inches), that the above-mentioned thin
 side is in the field. If it is sufficiently thin, no colour is per
 ceived immediately at the side; but as we proceed towards
 the thicker part, at first a pale brown tint becomes visible, as
 if we were looking through a very thin plate of horn, and as
 the thickness of the plate gradually increases in broad and
low terraces, the brown continues to become darker until it
assumes a deep and pure nut-brown colour, without the inter
vention of any of the prismatic colours which the thicker parts
of the plate exhibit.
    It is evident that the plate at the margin where it appears
colourless is so thin, that the difference of the path of the
ordinary and extraordinary ray on their exit does not amount
to half the length of a wave for any colour. Thus interference
of the most refractive rays does not occur until the thickness
is greater, and the brown colour must therefore be produced
by the disappearan
pound    light.      A-

                                               -
    The correctness of this conclusion is readily tested. ... On
crossing the prisms, it is seen that whilst in the case of all the
other colours of the plate the well-known complementary co
lours appear, that portion which was previously brown becomes
coloured lavender-gray, and the intensity of this colour is in
proportion to the depth of the brown previously observed at
the same spot.

          XLIV. On the Colouring Matters of Madder.
            By JAMEs Higgin, Esq., Manchester*.
THE        various analyses I have made of madder have led me
       to the same conclusion as Dr. Schunck, in his recent
valuable paper “On the Substances contained in Madder,” viz.
that there are three colouring matters capable of isolation—
xanthine, a yellow; an orange, which he names rubiacine;
and alizarine, a red. To this latter alone he ascribes all the
tinctorial power of madder, an opinion from which I am com
pelled to differ; and the object of my present paper is to show
that, under proper circumstances, the other two colouring
matters have a great influence on its dyeing properties.
    I believe the difference in our results to have arisen from
the use, in one case, of boiling water to extract the principles,
and in the other of cold or tepid water; the temperature having
a remarkable influence on the products of extraction.
    I will here state the method I employ to separate from each
other the three colouring matters; observing that, when sepas
rated, they differ little in their properties from those described
by Dr. Schunck. I will afterwards show that, as existing in
madder, and in the condition in which they are applied in
dyeing, peculiar reactions take place, which, as far as I know,
have never been described before.
    The same method was employed for various sorts of mad
der, viz, Dutch, French, Turkey, &c., with the same results,
varied of course in the amount and proportion of colouring
Imattel'S.
    I put the madder on a conical calico filter, and wash well
 with boiling water till the liquor comes away only faintly
 coloured and has no particular taste. I object altogether to
boiling madder in water, as I find that substances are obtained
 by so doing which have no existence in normal madder, being
 the result of decomposition; and consider the action ought to
 be as brief as possible. The extract by hot water, when cold,
 is acidulated with sulphuric acid, which causes a flocculent
 precipitate, which is collected on a filter. The precipitate con
 tains rubiacine and alizarine, with some pectine. The deep
 yellow filtrate contains all the xanthine, slight traces of aliza
 rine and rubiacine, some sugar, and the various organic and
 inorganic salts.
    The filtrate is neutralized with carbonate of soda, and a
 very small quantity of hydrate of alumina added; the mixture
 is digested at a temperature of 180° F. for about half an hour,

 and then filtered; by this means the traces of rubiacine and
alizarine are removed, and the xanthine left, if not too much
alumina has been used. To the filtrate is added barytic water
 to throw down sulphuric and phosphoric acids; and after
 the separation of the baryta salts, sufficient subacetate of lead
 to throw down all the xanthine: some chloride and an or
ganic salt are precipitated at the same time. The red lake is
 washed with a little cold water to remove some chloride of
lead, sugar, &c.; it is then diffused in water and sulphuretted
 hydrogen passed through; the xanthine remains attached to
 the sulphuret of lead. This is thrown on a filter, and washed
 with cold water to remove the organic acid; it is then repeat
 edly boiled in water and filtered. Xanthine dissolves with
a rich yellow colour. The solution is evaporated to a syrup
 in a water-bath, and, if necessary, neutralized with baryta, the
 evaporation completed, and the dry mass treated with absolute
alcohol. Pure xanthine dissolves, and may be again evapo
rated to dryness.
1. As thus obtained it is a dark brown, gummy and deliques
cent mass, perfectly soluble in water; the solution is a beau
tiful yellow when sufficiently dilute. It has a peculiar dis
agreeable bitter taste, without astringency or sweetness; it is
 very soluble in alcohol, and but sparingly in aether; soluble
 in alkalies, with a purplish red colour. Alum throws down
 from this a dull red lake, which may also be produced by
 adding a large quantity of hydrate of alumina to the watery
 solution. Acids make the solution in water lighter in colour,
 but do not cause any precipitate. When the solution in water
 is boiled with a little sulphuric or muriatic acid, a green powder
 falls; this is characteristic of xanthine. When the solution is
 strong and rendered very acid with either of those acids, it
 slowly becomes green in the cold. When dry, xanthine dis
 solves in concentrated sulphuric acid with a fine orange colour;
 when heated, this becomes more crimson; and on the addition
 of water all the colouring matter is deposited in yellow flocks,
 which dissolve easily in ammonia, and give a beautiful crimson
 colour, much more brilliant than that produced by ammonia
 with the original xanthine. The flocks, as far as I have ex
 amined them, have the properties of rubiacine. The solution
 in sulphuric acid, heated an hour or so, becomes brown; and
 on addition of water a brown powder falls, which does not
 dissolve in ammonia and is not coloured thereby. Xanthine
 is not precipitated by neutral acetate of lead, but entirely by
 subacetate; the compound is sparingly soluble in cold water,
 more so in hot, and very soluble in acetic acid. When heated,
 xanthine fuses, blackens and swells up into a bulky coal, which

   The precipitate by sulphuric acid from the watery extract
of madder is washed, first with water acidulated with sulphuric
acid, and afterwards with a little pure water. About an equal
bulk of fine chalk is then mixed up with it, and the mixture
repeatedly boiled in water and filtered, till the solution, at first
dark-coloured, becomes a faint pink only; the mixed solutions
are acidulated with sulphuric acid, and the greenish-yellow
precipitate collected, washed to remove acid, and dissolved in
alcohol; the solution evaporated down to one-fourth of its
volume, and an equal measure of water added. The precipi
tated rubiacine may be again dissolved in hot alcohol, and
crystallized therefrom. It has the following properties:—Spa
ringly soluble in cold water, but more so in hot,--the solution
is amber-coloured; very soluble in alcohol and aether. Boiling
alum solution dissolves it, and forms a clear orange solution
with no shade of pink; it does not precipitate from this solu
tion when cold, unless a large quantity of alizarine be also in
solution, when almost all the rubiacine precipitates. Sulphuric
acid precipitates it from the alum solution perfectly in green
ish-yellow flocks. Its solution in alkalies is a fine crimson,
similar to archil. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it
readily, and gives a fine orange solution; water precipitates it
unchanged. The solution, if heated some time, becomes
brown, and water now precipitates a fine brown powder, which
has no colouring properties. Rubiacine is less soluble in aci
dulated than in pure water; it forms a compound with lime of
considerable solubility. In solution of sulphate of ammonia
made alkaline by ammonia, rubiacine is soluble when heated,
a property offering one means of separation from alizarine,
which is totally insoluble in that menstruum at any tempera
ture. Rubiacine may be boiled a long time in dilute sulphuric
acid without change. Boiling solution of chlorate of potash
has no action on it. When heated, rubiacine fuses, blackens,
and gives off orange vapours, which condense in a crystalline
mass.     Mordanted cloth is not dyed, when treated in the usual
manner, with rubiacine.                              . . . . . . . . . <U+017F>º ..
   The alizarine is contained in the insoluble chalky matter
left after the separation of rubiacine. This is digested with
dilute hydrochloric acid at a gentle heat, cooled, filtered, and
again treated with dilute acid, then washed on a filter till free
from acid; alizarine remains, and may be crystallized from
alcohol.    It is obtained in much greater quantity from the
madder which had been treated with boiling water at first.

     Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Matters of Madder.       285
 This washed madder contains principally alizarine, with a
 small quantity of rubiacine. It is boiled three or four times
 with a weak solution of alum to separate the rubiacine; it is
 next boiled with a saturated solution of alum for a quarter of
 an hour and filtered, and this process repeated till the madder
 is perfectly exhausted, and has become an ash-gray; the mixed
 liquors are cooled to 90°F., and made sharply acid with sul
 phuric acid; after several hours the alizarine will have sepa
 rated; the separation may be assisted by violent stirring occa
 sionally. The filtered precipitate may be purified in the same
 manner as rubiacine.
    Alizarine thus obtained is sparingly soluble in cold water,
 much more so in hot; very soluble in alcohol and aether; very
 soluble in boiling alum liquor, the solution is a splendid and
 pure pink; it does not separate much from this solution when
 !...". sulphuric acid precipitates it wholly in a few hours
 in orange flocks; an alkali added to the alum solution throws
 down a delicate pink lake. Alizarine is less soluble in water
 acidulated than in pure; concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves
 it with a fine red colour; the solution may be strongly heated
 without decomposition; addition of water precipitates it wholly
 from the solution.    Alizarine dissolved in alcohol, and lime
 water added, is thrown down as a dark red compound of ali
 zarine and lime, which is soluble to a small extent in pure
 water, and may be entirely dissolved by continued washing;
 but the compound is totally insoluble in water containing lime.
 Carbonate of soda dissolves alizarine; but the solution, on
 standing, deposits purple flocks which dissolve in more water;
 the solution is crimson; ammonia dissolves it very plentifully,
and forms a splendid pink solution; carbonate of potash only
 dissolves it on the application of heat. Alizarine boiled with
 chalk dissolves some lime, and dyes the chalk red. Alizarine
 is insoluble in any liquid containing sulphate of ammonia or
 sulphate of potash, even if strongly alkaline by ammonia; it
 merely becomes a deep purple powder.       This insolubility in
 boiling alkaline sulphate of ammonia is characteristic of ali
zarine. "When heated, alizarine fuses and sublimes. Mor
'danted cloth is dyed the ordinary madder shades by alizarine,
but much finer than those obtained by madder.
    Having described the isolated colouring matters, I will
endeavour to show that the action of cold or tepid water on

treatment all the xanthine and the greatest part of the rubia
'cine may be made to disappear, the change being accompanied
by niñcrease in the tinctorial power; and since, of the three
 colouring matters, alizarine only can be made to dye colours,

proving that alizarine and rubiacine result from changes in the
xanthine.
   When madder is mixed with cold water, stirred three or
four minutes, and then filtered through fine calico, a deep
reddish-brown liquid is obtained, tasting sweet at first and
then disagreeably bitter; a drop let fall upon white calico
stains it a deep yellow, in the same way as a solution of pure
xanthine does. When the liquid is allowed to stand an hour
or two, it becomes gelatinous, if the solution has been strong,
and an orange red flocculent precipitate falls; when this is
filtered out, the liquor appears to have undergone a change,
and is much diminished in intensity of colour. It is now sweet
only to the taste, without a trace of the bitterness so remark
able before; and a drop applied to calico stains it only a pale
reddish colour, with no shade of yellow. The powder filtered
out has a very intense tinctorial power. The filtrate, on aci
dulation with sulphuric acid, gives more precipitate of the same
nature, and remains a pale yellow, similar to the saturated
solution of rubiacine and alizarine in a dilute acid.      From
some of the freshly-filtered solution of madder, xanthine was
separated in the following manner:—Subacetate of lead was
added to throw down all colouring matter; the lake washed
and decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, the sulphuret
boiled in water several times, the mixed liquors neutralized
with ammonia, and a small quantity of hydrate of alumina
added; the mixture digested half an hour and filtered from
the lake of alizarine and rubiacine; on evaporation to dryness
and treatment with alcohol, abundance of xanthine was obtained
of the usual properties. The filtrate from the madder liquor
which had stood till changed, was examined in like manner
for xanthine, but without any being found. The red powder
which had separated was dissolved in alcohol, precipitated by
subacetate of lead, and the lake decomposed by sulphuretted
hydrogen. On boiling the sulphuret in water, an orange
liquor was obtained, from which, on cooling, flocks of rubia
cine and alizarine fell ; the pale orange liquor then evidently
contained no xanthine. The sulphuret boiled in alcohol
yielded abundance of alizarine and rubiacine.
   It was evident from this experiment, that in the madder
liquor left to spontaneous action, all the xanthine had become
changed into some colouring matter. "To see what was the
nature of this change, I took some madder liquor quite freshly
made in the cold, and added some solution of acetate of lime,
which precipitates alizarine.     The dark red precipitate of
alizarine-lime having been separated, a dark reddish-brown
solution remained : part of this was acidulated with hydro

chloric acid, when a few yellow flocks fell, which when washed
were found to be pure rubiacine. When mordanted cloth
was attempted to be dyed with this powder, only the faint
shades of rubiacine were obtained. The deep yellow filtrate
from the rubiacine, when left to stand several hours, deposited
no more flocks, and ultimately became green, as does solution
of pure xanthine under the same circumstances.
   Another portion of the filtrate from precipitation by acetate
of lime was diluted a little with water, and allowed to stand
about four hours; it had then lost the intense bitterness of
taste, and retained only that of acetate of lime. On acidula
tion by hydrochloric acid, copious yellow flocks fell, which
when filtered out left the filtrate a pale yellow; they were
proved to be rubiacine, and had no tinctorial power. The
yellow filtrate was examined for xanthine, but only a very
small quantity was found.
   Another portion of the original filtrate was set aside for
about eight hours, when a quantity of reddish-orange powder
had subsided, and the supernatant liquor was much diminished
in intensity of colour. The filtered precipitate, after treatment
with dilute acid and washing, had a very strong tinctorial
power; it was dissolved in alcohol, diluted a little with water,
and lime-water added; a dark red precipitate appeared, sus
pended in a red liquid. The filtered precipitate, washed with
boiling water and decomposed by hydrochloric acid, was found
to be pure alizarine; the filtrate from it, acidulated with hy
drochloric acid, gave yellow flocks of rubiacine. The quantity
of alizarine in the powder was greater than that of rubiacine;
the liquor from which it had subsided was acidulated with
hydrochloric acid, when a further quantity of powder was
obtained, consisting of both rubiacine and alizarine, but more
of the former. The filtrate from it was a pale yellow, and
contained no traces of xanthine.                        -
   In these experiments, the madder liquor, from which all
alizarine had been taken and which had then no power to dye,
by spontaneous action acquired a further portion of alizarine,
and consequently recovered its power of dyeing. As the
xanthine had totally disappeared during the process, the for
mation of alizarine must have been at its expense. The action
is not however direct, as by stopping the process before any
precipitation has occurred, only rubiacine is obtained, whilst,
as before, xanthine has disappeared. It is evident, then, that
the xanthine has become first rubiacine and afterwards ali
zarine.
   This reaction does not result from oxidation, since I have
found it to take place equally well in vacuo; and as numerous

 288      Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Malters of Madder.
 experiments on the pure substance with various oxidizing
 agents failed totally to produce any alizarine, I am induced to
 consider it the result of fermentation produced by a peculiar
 azotized matter found in madder, and to be similar to the re
 action between starch and diastase, where the starch becomes
first dextrine and afterwards sugar.
    This action becomes very probable from various experiments,
 in which it is <U+017F>ound that the madder changes are best pro
duced under circumstances favourable to the ordinary action
of ferments, and are stopped by such substances as destroy
 their action.
    I have, in the proximate analysis before-mentioned, used
 boiling water to extract the principles, as by this means all ulte
rior action is stopped, and the colouring matters are obtained
in the same proportion in which they existed in the madder;
were cold water used, and the solution allowed to stand a
certain time, very little if any xanthine would be obtained,
and more than the due proportion of alizarine and rubiacine.
    If boiling water be added to madder, the mixture may be
allowed to stand any length of time without losing its deep
yellow colour and bitter taste. When madder is washed with
cold water and the clear filtered solution brought to boil,
it becomes turbid, froths up, and, is found to be § of small
flocculent particles, which when filtered and washed burn with
a smell like burning feathers. Boiled with caustic alkali,
they evolve abundance of ammonia; the filtrate from them
undergoes no change on standing.              -
   When to a cold solution of madder any acid or any acid
salt is added, a flocculent precipitate falls, which is composed
of alizarine and rubiacine, pectine and the azotized principle,
whilst the xanthine remains in solution, and never changes on
standin .     -    •  ** **      ** *        , --, * * * - - ****
   If º very strong solution of madder, made in the cold,
alcohol be added in sufficient quantity, a gelatinous substance
separates, which is partly pectine and partly the nitrogenous
matter; if this be filtered out,  j. never changes; but
if left in, and the liquor gently heated, to drive off alcohol, as
the flocks redissolve, the changes take place as usual. . . .
    My endeavours to obtain the pure nitrogenous substance,
and prove its power of exciting a change in xanthine and ru
biacine, have not yet met with success. I have not been able
to obtain it in a soluble, and consequently active condition.
My experiments are still in progress, and I give them as far
as, I can: ,    made madder into a paste with cold water,         ex
pressed strongly, and then added a considerable quantity of
alcohol, which threw down a flocculent substance; I was

   Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Matters of Madder.          289
this well with alcohol to free it from colouring matter which
it carries down with it. It is now a brown matter, which, when
burnt, emits the smell of burning flesh, and leaves a large
quantity of ash; it probably also contains pectine and woody
matter, which must inevitably be pressed through the cloth.
It is insoluble in water. Boiled with caustic soda, it gives the
characteristic smell that all proteine compounds do with an
alkali. Nitric acid heated with it forms a yellow mass, which
gives to ammonia a red colour; an acid precipitates therefrom
a yellow powder, which has the properties of xanthoproteic
acid. The mass is easily soluble in slightly alkaline liquors.
It appears in every respect to be similar to coagulated vege
table albumen. I have not been able to extract any nitroge
nized substance soluble in alcohol from madder, and believe
this substance to be the only one containing nitrogen.
   I have in the foregoing experiments described the changes
undergone in cold water; but, as in all other fermentations,
a proper increase of temperature is attended with more rapid
results. The temperature I find best is from 120° to 180° F.
Water added to madder and the mixture kept at that tempe
rature, rapidly changes in appearance and taste; it gradually
becomes redder, loses its bitter taste, and becomes more sweet:
the yellow disappears, and the liquid, tested from time to time
by dropping on white calico, is found constantly diminishing in
intensity of colour. In about half an hour all xanthine has dis
appeared; and the madder, if examined, is found to containabun
dance of rubiacine and alizarine: if it was rich in xanthine,
there will be at this stage a preponderance of rubiacine, so much
 so as to give an orange solution with boiling alum liquor,
without much shade of pink. If the fermenting action be con
tinued, the rubiacine is found gradually diminishing, and the
alizarine proportionably increasing: the action is complete in
about two hours and a half; and if the madder be now tried,
only a º of rubiacine is found; and the colour of
the alum solution is pink, but not quite so pure as that pro
duced by pure alizarine, as I have never been able to get rid
of the last portions of rubiacine by this process; a small frac
tion of the quantity originally found still remains.
   The quantity of water required for this reaction is small,
though it will take place in however dilute a solution. I have
frequently done it with perfect success by making madder
into a thin paste with water, either heating or not, and adding
water to replace that evaporated. If this process be continued
 too long, the alizarine formed attaches itself to the fibre, and
the madder will now give out little colour to water; treatment
with hot acid brings it again into a soluble condition.

290      Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Matters of Madder.
   Good madder contains sufficient ferment to convert an ex
cess of xanthine into available colouring matter. I made
several experiments with different quantities, and found 20
per cent. additional to be the greatest quantity madder would
 Convert.
   With a view to place the utility of xanthine in dyeing be
yond all doubt, I made the following experiments:—
    No. 1. Two equal portions of the same madder were taken,
and an equal quantity of water at 120°F, added to each; to
 one, one-tenth of its weight of dry xanthine was added: I
kept them at the same heat for half an hour, then put in each
an equal quantity of mordanted cloth of the same pattern,
and heated gradually on a sand-bath, observing that the heat
ing of the two dyeings progressed equally. At the end of an
hour and a half, when the heat was 180° F., I removed the
dyed cloth, washed and dried it: the piece dyed with the 10
per cent, additional xanthine was much darker and better
:      than that with madder alone; the whites were equally
g No. 2. The same experiment was repeated with 20 per cent.
additional xanthine with increased advantage.
   No. 3. Two equal weights of madder were taken : to one
a certain quantity of boiling water was added, and the mixture
allowed to cool; to the other portion the same quantity of cold
water was added. Two equal quantities of mordanted cloth
were then introduced, the temperature being the same in
each, and the dyeings made with the same precautions as
before. That dyed with the portion treated with cold water
was immeasurably superior to the one treated with boiling
water, having fine solid colours; those of the other bein
pale, meagre and dirty-looking. The whites of the col
one were also good; those of the hot very bad. The liquors
after dyeing were saved and examined, being filtered from the
woody matter; that from the hot portion contained abundance
of xanthine, whilst that from the other contained none.       *
   No. 4. The preceding experiment was repeated with a little
variation. Lest by the action of boiling water it might have
happened that the alizarine was merely thrown into an inso
luble condition, and consequently the madder weakened in
power, I resolved to convert the residue of each dyeing into
garancine, and dye with it some more mordanted cloth; I
therefore, after taking out the dyed cloth, added to each the
same quantity of sulphuric acid and boiled half an hour, then
filtered, and washed each with the same quantity of water. The
two garancines were then put into an equal quantity of water,
and mordanted cloth dyed in them as before, Now if the

   Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Matters of Madder.          291
alizarine had been merely thrown into an inactive condition
by the boiling water, the converting of the residue into ga
rancine would certainly have restored its activity, and the
dyeing made with that garancine would have been superior to
the other; but, on the contrary, the second results were not
even equal, the same remarkable difference occurring as in
the first instance.  This shows that in the one case the tinc
torial power was dependent on the alizarine existing normally
in the madder; in the other, that the xanthine had contributed
a further portion.
   No. 5. Two equal portions of madder were again taken:
to one a certain quantity of water at 120°F. was added, and
the heat continued for half an hour; a certain quantity of
dilute sulphuric acid then added, the mixture filtered, and the
mass washed with a known quantity of dilute sulphuric acid,
and afterwards with a known quantity of water.
   The other portion was mixed with the same quantity of
water and dilute acid as the former, filtered, and washed with
the same quantity of dilute acid and water. The two portions
thus treated were used to dye equal quantities of mordanted
cloth, with the usual precautions. The one which was sub
jected to spontaneous action previous to washing with acid,
dyed full and rich shades; that from which the xanthine had
been washed out unchanged, dyed shades very many times
weaker.       -
   In this experiment the two madders were under exactly
equal circumstances, except that one of them was allowed to
ferment the xanthine; yet the difference in result was very great,
and could only arise from the xanthine becoming available co
louring matter. I consider these five experiments as clearly
demonstrating the value of xanthine in madder-dyeing.
   The madder used in this case was “ombro,” a variety very
rich in xanthine, and therefore the best to test its value.
   With this theory of madder, the operation of dyeing be
comes much more intelligible,; It is known that, to dye well
with madder, the process must be begun at a low temperature
and the heat gradually raised. The application of the theory
will be this. The xanthine, on immersing the madder in
water, immediately begins to decompose, becoming rubiacine;
this in its turn becomes alizarine, and then the combination
between it and the mordanted cloth takes place. The dyeing
is begun by the alizarine already existing in the madder, and
continued by the quantity continually formed. The slow
 heating of the liquor is very favourable to the change taking
place, T.Generally the temperature is about 180° at the end
of the first hour; long before that, however, the xanthine has

 292      Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Matters of Madder.
 become rubiacine and part of this alizarine, the remainder of
 the time being occupied in completing the change; the ali
 zarine, being removed from solution as fast as formed, has
probably some influence in accelerating the change of rubia
 cine.    This will be the final action; and when the mordants
 are saturated, there will always be a small residue of rubiacine,
 which has a tendency to dull the shades; and hence the su
perior brightness of those dyed with garancine, which contains
no rubiacine. Examination of the residual dye liquor gene.
 rally shows a small quantity of rubiacine, which gives it an
opaline appearance; there is also always alizarine united to
 woody fibre and lime. Examination of the dyed cloth, of

    It is found advantageous sometimes to mix a lower quality
of madder with a superior; the effect produced not being a
mean of those resulting separately, but not much inferior to
that produced by the superior madder alone. The low qua
lity abounding in xanthine, has probably more than can be
readily converted in the required time; but as we have seen
that good madder can readily convert more than its own
quantity, the change goes on nearly as uniformly as if good
madder alone were used.
   The fermentation and improvement of madder, when kept
in the cask, is readily explained by supposing the xanthine
gradually to change into alizarine: this is particularly noticed
in Dutch madders, which abound in xanthine.           Many sub
stances and salts, added to a madder dyeing, weaken its in
fluence very much. An examination of the residual liquor
uniformly shows the xanthine remaining unchanged, and the
dyed effect has only been produced by the quantity of alizarine
originally in the madder.                                . .      .
   Madder contains a varying º of sugar of an un
crystallizable species, which may be isolated in the following
manner: —To the madder solution le<U+017F>t after throwing dow
xanthine, in the proximate analysis before-mentioned, is adde
sufficient dilute sulphuric acid to throw down any lead tha
may be in excess, then evaporated to dryness, the sugar dis
solved in alcohol, decolorized by animal charcoal, and again
evaporated to dryness: if the evaporation be too fast, the re
sulting sugar is coloured slightly; but if a gentle water-bath
heat has been used, it is quite colourless.        . . . . . . .
   I do not think the resins found by Dr. Schunck are ori
ginally contained in madder, but have been formed .#
the boiling. I have never in my experiments on the products
obtained at a low temperature, or brief boiling temperature,

   Mr. J. Higgin on the Colouring Matters of Madder.       293
met with any resinous matter; with a view further to test
this, I boiled madder in alcohol repeatedly, till it became an
ash-gray, and no more colouring matter was given to the
alcohol; the solutions were mixed. Dilution with water in
any proportion did not produce any milkiness, even after
standing some time, as must have been the case had any
resins been dissolved by the alcohol. The solution, added to
alum liquor and boiled, gave a perfectly clear solution, with
out any resinous matter being rejected. The alcoholic solu
tion, evaporated to dryness in contact with air, and again
treated with alcohol, left a brown substance, insoluble in
boiling alcohol, ammonia, and caustic soda; some more was
left on evaporating the second solution to dryness, and treat
ing with alcohol. The powder seemed formed at the expense
of the xanthine, as on examination very little could be found
in the third solution; this was acidulated with sulphuric acid
and diluted with water, and the resulting flocks washed and
boiled in alum liquor. This time a small quantity of resinous
matter was rejected, which could not have been in the original
solution.
   This experiment also proves that the colouring matter of
madder is all free, none being united to lime, as it is capable
of being so perfectly exhausted by alcohol as to leave only
an ash-gray powder. The compound of alizarine with lime
is perfectly insoluble in boiling alcohol. Boiling alum solu
tion also decolorizes madder more rapidly and better than
alcohol. If, however, madder be boiled in water, the colour
ing matter cannot afterwards be wholly separated by alcohol;
a large quantity remains in a state not soluble in water or
alcohol; this results partly from alizarine becoming united
to lime during the boiling, and partly from the woody fibre
acting as a mordant, and withdrawing alizarine from solution;
woody fibre having a great affinity for that colouring matter,
and when introduced into its boiling solution becoming dyed
a dark red. I have sometimes found that, after all lime-salts
 ave been removed from madder by an acid, if dried at too
  igh a temperature, very little colouring matter is given to
water, and mordanted cloth receives very faint shades of
colour; the madder in this condition is a deep red; hot acid
separates alizarine again from the fibre. This fact explains
why garancine is spoilt by too high drying.

and to be remarkably free from rubiacine, xanthine, pectine,
and the nitrogenous matter. In no way have I been able to
separate any of these substances from the specimens I have
tried. The peculiar utility of garancine consists in all sub
stances being removed which have an injurious influence on
the action of alizarine. From the experiments of Schunck
it appears, that any of these substances, when used in conjunc
tion with pure alizarine, injure the dyed colour and stain the
whites. In the making of garancine, they are rendered inert,
as the following experiments will attest.
    1. I took xanthine, dissolved it in a little sulphuric acid,
and heated the solution for some time. From being a bright
orange, it gradually became a dark brown; when diluted with
water, a brown powder separated, which, when dry, was in
soluble in any menstruum except sulphuric acid.
   2. I treated rubiacine in the same way, and obtained,
exactly the same results.                                * , . . . .
    3. Alizarine treated the same way was not decomposed
even by long heating, but remained as a rich red, solution,
from which water threw down all colouring matter.
    4. I then made a mixture of alizarine, rubiacine, and xan
thine, dissolved in sulphuric acid, and heated some time.
The solution gradually became dark brown; and on addition
of water a brown powder fell, which when washed and dried,
was a soft velvety substance, possessing an intense tinctorial,
power; hot alcohol separated all the alizarine and left the
dark brown powder obtained from xanthine and rubiacine.
This compound of alizarine and the brown matter may be
considered as pure garancine freed from woody fibre. ,
    As to the greater proportional dyeing power of garancine,
over madder, I coincide in the opinion of Dr. Schunck, that
the lime-salts being removed, no alizarine can remain com
bined with lime, and that in garancine dyeing all colouring
 matter is used up, whilst in madder only two-thirds are used.
    The foregoing series of experiments, though perhaps not
 possessing the completeness they might have, warrant us, I
 think, in drawing the conclusion, that all the colouring matter,
in madder springs primarily from xanthine, an opinion held
 by Decaisne, who observed that fresh madder roots contained
 only a deep yellow fluid, and acquired a granular appearance
 only during the process of drying.

XLV. Notice of a colourless Atmospheric Arch seen in the
    interior of Brazil. By WILLIAM Jory HENwood, Esq.,

   To Sir David Brewster, K.H., LL.D., F.R.S.L. & E., &c.
          My DEAR SIR DAVID,
THE village of Cattas Altas is situated in long. 43° 15' west,
          and lat. 19° 58' 30" south, on an open undulating expanse
of pasture land, about 3500 feet above the sea, bounded on
the south-west by the mountain-chain of the Caraças, which
rises from 4000 to 5000 feet above it, a deep narrow glen
intervening between them.
     At about seven o’clock in the morning of the 12th of May
lastº, I had occasion to cross this open country towards the
north-west, almost on the edge of the ravine. A dense mist
covered all the lower grounds, whilst the little hills shone in
unclouded sun-light; in the fog a light air from the westward
was perceptible, but a gentle breeze in an opposite direction
prevailed on the hills.
     During my journey I passed several times from sunshine
into mist, and vice versä.
     Whilst immersed in fog on the verge of the vale, and some
400 feet above its bottom, an arch of about forty-five degrees
 in altitude became visible. In width, and indeed in every other
respect, it exactly resembled a rainbow, except that the whole
of its upper part was entirely colourless, being, as it were, a
bow of denser mist surrounded by the ordinary fog. For an
altitude of about ten degrees, however, of the lower portion,
 which was beneath the horizon of my station, it had the faint
 est possible tint of violet colour, which was rather more per
 ceptible in the south-eastern extremity than in the other.
       On entering the mist a second time, a few minutes later, I
 observed a similar, but fainter and less perfect arch.
       My isolated situation affords me access to but few books of
 reference; and as but one of these mentions a colourless rain
 bow t, and as I have never before seen one myself, I venture
 to trouble you with this brief notice of a phaenomenon which
 perhaps may not be of frequent occurrence.

Chap. V. Observations of Halley's Comet, with Remarks on its phy
              sical condition, and that of Comets in general.... º.º  # *    **      **
THE comet was first observed at the Royal Observatory at the
      Cape on the morning of the 1st of September (1835), but it was a
not before the 28th of October that Sir John Herschel obtained aw
view of it. About the end of March, previously, he had carefully but a
without success examined the places set down in M. Rumker's ephe
meris, and the whole adjacent region of the heaven ; nor was he
 more fortunate when he resumed the search about the end of August,…
by sweeping over the places given in the Nautical Almanac for that,
year. On these occasions his efforts were uniformly baffled by a drift -
of light vapour hurried rapidly along by the south-east wind of the
season, but constantly forming anew nearly over, the spot to whichs,
the telescope was directed. At length, despairing of success at home, ,
and impatient of repeated disappointments, he dismounted the equa
torial telescope, and having constructed for it a temporary stand, a
transported it to a station on the Cape Flats, five or six miles to the
eastward of Feldhausen, where he was sheltered by a range of low
sand-hills from the violence of the wind, and freed by distance from a
the obstruction produced by the Table Mountain with its superposedu.
mass of cloud. The instrument was erected about sunset on thes
28th of October, and before the termination of the twilight he had,
obtained an excellent view of the comet....… …a cºlº e nº
   The appearance of the cometin the 7-foot achromatic on this night
was “that of a nebula very suddenly and highly condensed in then
centre, to so great a degree indeed that I could not have ventured from a
this observation alone to have denied the existence of a solid nucleus,”
No phase, however, was perceptible on that central mass which might,
have been so regarded. Neither was any other remarkable pecu-u.
liarity about the head, nucleus, or tail, noticed on this, occasion,” in
On the following evening, which proved very clear, at Feldhausen, tº
the 20-foot reflector, armed with an excellent mirror recently and tº
brilliantly polished for the purpose, was brought to bear on the
comet. “Under these circumstances its appearance was most sin
gular. . . . . . Its nucleus, small, bright, and highly condensed, was a
shielded or capped on the side next the sun by a vivid but marrow
crescent of nebulous light, the front of which presented an outline &
nearly circular, having an amplitude of somewhat more than 90° 3.
from horn to horn.” Within this was the nucleus, the horns of the wº
crescent extending a good way behind it on either side.” “The
nucleus was decidedly not planetary, and as decidedly exhibited no.

phase. As the evening advanced, the exterior strata of the crescent
—the coma and the tail which were before obliterated by the twilight
—became visible.      The tail, however, was never very apparent.”
 On the 30th, no observation was made at Feldhausen.      On the 31st
the general appearance of the comet was not materially different, but
the crescent was less remarkable than on the 29th, and on the fol
lowing evening still less so. After this the comet was not again seen
in the 20-foot reflector till its return from the sun after the peri
helion passage.                                      -
   After the passage the comet was first seen at the Cape on the
25th of January, and from this time till the 5th of May it was very
frequently observed.    On its reappearance it offered to the naked
eye “the aspect of a star, a very little dim and hazy, but no tail was
visible, neither was any seen in the night glass, in which its appear
ance was that of a highly condensed globular nebula. In the equa
torial it appeared as a bright, round, and very nearly uniform nebu
lous disc, little condensed towards the centre, but decidedly more
sharply defined on the following than on the preceding side. . . . No
trace of a tail was observed in this instrument, but a considerable
coma enveloped the disc, extending to nearly an equal distance on
all sides.” For some days trees prevented its being taken up by the
great reflector; but from the time this instrument could be brought
to bear on it, the observations assume an extraordinary interest.
The following extract conveys a vivid impression of its general ap
pearance:—
    “Viewed through the 20-foot reflector (which on this as on the
former occasion I had taken care to provide with a mirror freshly
polished and in the highest possible condition), the comet was now
indeed a most singular and remarkable object. Certainly nothing
could be more surprising than the total change which had taken place
in its appearance since the observations of October. Not to speak
of the extraordinary sharpness of termination of the head, especially
towards the following side, for which I can find no comparison so apt
 as the ground glass of an Argand lamp, a new and perfectly unex
pected phaenomenon had presented itself, a phaenomenon, I believe,
 quite unique in the history of comets. Within the well-defined
head, and somewhat excentrically placed (being rather nearer to its
northern than to its southern edge), was seen a vividly luminous
nucleus, or rather an object which I know no better way to describe
than by calling it a miniature comet having a nucleus, head, and tail
of its own, perfectly distinct and considerably exceeding in intensity
of light, the nebulous disc or envelope which I have above called the
“head.” As the comet gained altitude, a minute bright point like
a very small star, or rather like the nucleus of the nebula in Andro
meda, only smaller, came to be distinctly perceived. It is this point
which I shall henceforward term the nucleus, and which, according
to the state of the atmosphere at the time of the observation (and
perhaps also that of the comet itself), was subsequently seen some
times more, sometimes less sharply concentrated, and stellar—but
always of excessively minute dimension, certainly on no occasion

subtending an angle of 4", and never quite so well-defined as to give
a positive assurance of the existence of a solid sphere—much less
could any phase at any time be discerned on it. The whole was
encircled with a strong coma which nearly filled the field of view
(15" diameter), dying away insensibly but rapidly at the edges.
When the nucleus was brought to any part of the circumference of
the field, the border of the coma fell little short of the centre.      On
the south preceding side, however, its extent was somewhat greater,
projecting in that quarter into a feeble and irregular appendage,
which might be regarded as a rudimentary tail.”—P. 397.
   The changes which the comet underwent in its figure and dimen
sions, as also in respect of the relative degrees of illumination of its
different parts, were extremely remarkable, and are of great import
ance in reference to the study of its physical constitution.        On the
25th of January some measures were taken with the equatorial.
The diameter of the head in declination was found to be 237"-3;
and upon the measure being repeated about two hours and a quarter
after it was found to be 252"-0, or about 14*7 greater. Such a
difference in so short an interval of time, and in opposition to the
tendency of the morning twilight, “seemed inconceivable, and threw
a momentary doubt on the exactness of the earlier observation.
That measure had, however, been taken and read off with all possible
care, and in short nothing remained but the conclusion, that the
change was real, and that the comet was actually increasing in dimen
sions with such rapidity that it might almost be said to be seen to grow!
    “On the next night, the 26th, the increase of dimension of the
comet was evident at the first glance. Its form, too, had undergone
a change, being more elongated in proportion in the direction of its
axis, and materially less definite in its posterior region. . . . . . The
coma had also undergone a great and remarkable change, not so
much in dimension as in brightness; being very much enfeebled....
The head or envelope had begun to assume an evident tendency to
a paraboloidal form, the posterior portion being terminated, however,
by an outline of an oval or nearly semicircular figure. The nucleus
appeared as a star about the 11th magnitude, not, however, sharp
and sparkling like a true star, but furred and nebulous, so that, with
its ray, it presented exactly the appearance of a miniature comet,
having a head and tail of its own.”—P. 399.
   On the 27th of January, the head or envelope, with its enclosed
nucleus or ray, was still more dilated than on the preceding night,
but the coma was grown extremely thin and faint.             On the 28th
the coma was all but gone, but there were long irregular nebulous
tails in various directions. The nucleus was no longer a dim misty
speck but a brilliant point. The observations of this night conclude
with the following memorandum :—“so ended a most memorable
night.    I can hardly doubt that the comet was fairly evaporated in
perihelio by the heat, and resolved into transparent vapour, and is
now in process of rapid condensation and re-precipitation on the
nucleus.”
   The 29th and 30th proved cloudy. On the 31st the comet was

                     Notices respecting New Books.                   299
so much dilated as to more than fill the field of view in length, and
nearly so in breadth, of the great reflector. Every trace of coma
had disappeared.      “The clear parabolic outline of the head was seen
free from any mistiness or vaporous appearance, in its full beauty;
and certainly a more delicately formed and soft, yet well-defined,
outline than it presented on this night could not be imagined. . . . . .
All idea of vagueness or confusion connected with an ill-defined and
fluctuating coma being now absent, an impression of regularity of
structure, and of precise and definite laws obeyed in its constitution,
was no less strongly conveyed by this view of it, than by that of the
body of Jupiter or Saturn. From this time may be dated the com
mencement of the development of the true tail. . . . . The coma from
this time appeared no more, but in the progress of the comet towards
its final extinction the semblance of a new coma arose from the dila
tation of the mass of internal light immediately surrounding the
nucleus, after the final dissipation of the envelope, and which, from
being at first a subordinate and inconspicuous part of the phaeno
menon, became by degrees a leading feature, and at last may be said
to have constituted the whole visible comet, the infinitely minute
and hardly perceptible nucleus excepted.”—P. 401.
   With respect to the small density of the comet, as indicated by
its almost inappreciable effect in extinguishing the light of small stars
seen through it, we have the following remark:—“I may here men
tion, once for all, that among the innumerable stars of all magnitudes,
from the ninth downwards, which at various times were seen through
it, and some extremely near to the nucleus (though none eractly on
it), there never appeared the least ground for presuming any extinc
tion of their light in traversing it. Very minute stars, indeed,
on entering its brighter portions, were obliterated, as they would
have been by an equal illumination of the field of view ; but stars
which before their entry appeared bright enough to bear that illumi
nation, were in no case, so far as I could judge, affected to a greater
extent than they would have been by so much lamp-light artificially
introduced.”
   From the 1st to the 11th of February the observations with the
reflector were suspended by reason of the moon approaching and
passing the place of the comet. On the latter day the comet was a
superb object, but grown much too great for the grasp of the tele
scope with its ordinary sweeping power. The nucleus was then the
most conspicuous part. On the 17th it was “dilated to a vast size
and no longer sharply defined, but yet the outline well made out,
the nucleus pretty sharp, all but stellar, and much brighter than ever
seen before, but the interior cometic tail hardly perceptibly brighter
than the general tail. On the 19th the nucleus and its coma very
bright and highly condensed. The parabolic envelope hardly to be
made out, and evidently distorted. . . . . From this time forward the
envelope continued still to dilate, being, however, worse defined and
fainter, till at length, on the 18th of March, all trace of a visible out
line had disappeared.”—P. 402.
    The last recorded    *of the comet was made on the 5th

of May, on which day it was still visible, though with great difficulty:
in the equatorial. Cloudy nights prevented further operations till
the 11th, when the comet was searched for but not found. On the
12th another attempt was made, and a faint object was discovered
which was supposed to be the comet, and consequently prevented
further search; but on the next night the object was again seen in the
same precise situation, and proved to be a small nebula not previously
known. “Clouds prevented all further search on that and several
subsequent nights, and when at length the weather became favour
able, no trace of the comet could be found after a long and perse
vering search. Thus,” says Sir John, “by a most inopportune dis
covery of a nebula, otherwise interesting enough, I found myself
deprived of the opportunity I should doubtless have otherwise en
joyed, of accompanying this remote denizen of our system a few
steps further on its journey.”—P. 398.                      tº:-- it     tº
    After describing the successive appearances presented by the comet
 (of which he has given a series of beautiful drawings), Sir John
proceeds to make some observations on its physical state as indicated
 by the changes it underwent. “Four things,” he remarks, “in the
 post-perihelion history of this comet are especially remarkable :-lst,
 the astonishingly rapid dilatation of the visible dimensions; 2nd, the
 preservation of the same geometrical form of the dilated and dilating
 envelope; 3rd, the rapid disappearance of the coma; and, lastly, the
 increase in density and relative brightness of the nucleus.” With
 respect to the first of these, a synoptic table is given of the measures
 of its several parts, taken from January 25 to February 11, upon
 which he remarks, “The only element in these measurements which
 is sufficiently definite and comparable throughout the series and at
 the same time little affected by the unequal lights of the telescope
 used, is the distance of the nucleus from the vertex of the parabo
 loid.” Calculating from this element, a series of values was found of
 “the apparent and real bulk of that definite segment of the parabo
 loid which may be conceived cut off at its vertex by a plane at right
 angles to its axis passing through its nucleus.” . The real volumes
 were as follows:—              *     * * *    i t  .     : * : * : , ; ;;;

    From this it appears that the definite segment in question ha
 actually enlarged to seventy-four times its original bulk in the in
 terval of seventeen days between the extreme observations. The
 total volume, however, of the whole visible paraboloid had increased
 in a much greater proportion. By comparison of the different mea
 surements, it was found that the apparent linear dilatation of the
 envelope was nearly uniform, and at the rate of21: a day ºn the
 vertical distance. Calculating backwards on this hypothesis, the
 singular conclusion is obtained that “on the 21st of       #. at 0°
  10" rim, the envelope had no magnitude; that in shortatthat moment

                     -Notices respecting New Books.                  3O1
a most important physical change commenced in the comet's state.
Previous to that instant it must have consisted of a mere nucleus, a
stellar point more or less bright, and a coma more or less dense and
extensive. "At that instant the formation of the envelope commenced,
and continued in the manner and at the rate above described. The
Ray, or internal comet, no doubt, also commenced its existence at
the same instant.” This result was corroborated by an observation
made at Breslau by Prof. Boguslawski, who on the 22nd of January
observed the comet, as a star of the 6th magnitude, a bright concen
trated point which showed no disc with a magnifying power of 140.
*Sir John next proceeds to examine the hypotheses respecting the
physical constitution of the comet which the phaenomena render
probable. He observes, “It will not be necessary to enter into any
calculation of the comet's distance from the sun at the moment of
these observations to warrant our rejection of an hypothesis such as
that of M. Walz, which makes the volume depend directly on the
distance. Undoubtedly its recess from the sun is ultimately, but
indirectly, the cause of the observed increase. "The question is only
as to the modus operandi. The perihelion passage, it will be borne
in mind, took place on the 15th of November, and it was not there
fore till the 83rd day after that event that the formation of the enve
lope commenced. Now during these 83 days it is certain that a
process of refrigeration had been going on. . . . . The surface of the
 nucleus must be supposed to have cooled down, at this precise epoch,
to the dew-point. ... At this instant, therefore, must have commenced
the formation of a mist, first precisely in contact with the radiating
 surface,andby degrees more orless rapid ascending aboveit, and limited
by a definite upper surface, the seat of a fresh process of radiation.
 As this superior vapour plane attains a higher and higher level, corre
-sponding to a less and less actual density both of the atmosphere and
'vapour, its surface, without losing its geometrical form, necessarily
 becomes less and less visible and conspicuous. . . . . It is this su
perior vapour plane which constitutes, in our conception of the mat
-ter, the visible surface of the envelope.”
     In reference to the form of the envelope, he says, “If the conden
 sible vapour were everywhere distributed spherically around the
 nucleus, so as to have equal density at equal distances, the form of
 the envelope would necessarily be spherical, because on account of
 the exceeding tenuity of the cometic atmosphere, its posterior por
  tion is in no way shaded by its anterior, but every part, interior and
"exterior, equally exposed to the sun's rays, or very nearly so. That
  the form ; fact notspherical, but paraboloidal, or very eccentrically
  elliptic, instructs us in an important and truly wonderful fact, viz.
 that the surfaces of equilibrium of the vapour in its transparent state
 are so; that, in fact, although not seen the envelope existed as a trans
 parent atmosphere—a tail in posse, though not to our eyes in esse,
  and of its full extent, prior to the epoch of its commencing visibility,
 and probably      rior to hº passage.” . . . . . . .
     He next proceeds to inquire by what forces it is possible that such a
'form of equilibrium can be maintained, and remarks that the laws of

302                Notices respecting New Books.
gravitation, as at present recognised, are altogether insufficient to ac
count for it. “Such a form, as one of equilibrium, is inconceivable
without the admission of repulsive as well as of attractive forces.
But, if we admit the matter of the tail to be at once repelled by the
sun, and attracted by the nucleus, it no longer presents any diffi
culty.”
   Air     some further remarks in corroboration of this view, and
citing the opinions of Newton and Kepler, he adds—“Supposing
the approach of a comet to the sun to be such as to enable the re
pulsive force to overcome the attractive in those portions of its tail
remote from the nucleus, they would, of course, be driven off irreco
verably. But what would now be the state of the remaining mass?
Inertia and repulsion have been subtracted; of course, what is left
has become pro quantitate materia, on both accounts more attractively
disposed as a whole; the dimensions of the orbit must therefore
contract. The periodic time will diminish. We have here presented
to us a series of consequences, identical in some of their leading
features with those which, observed in the case of Encke's comet,
have been attributed to resistance of the aether.       Pursued into all
their consequences no doubt the two explanations diverge. . . . But
it may be doubted whether observation of a body so ill-defined is yet
precise enough to decide between them.”—P. 410.
   We can only make room for two further extracts:—                        -
   “The preservation of the geometrical form of the envelope of our
comet is undoubtedly indicative of a high degree of tranquillity, the
definite action of perfectly regular forces, and at least a near approach
to a state of equilibrium in the strata of which the mass consists. It
proves also, if taken in conjunction with what has been said respect
ing its apparent dilatation, similarity of external and internal strata,
precisely such as the laws of equilibrium would lead us to expect in
an elastic fluid mass subjected to such forces.                  ; :* ,, ,
   “The rapid disappearance of the coma would seem to be referable
neither to dissipation nor absorption into the head, but rather to its
being swept off into the tail by the sun's action, and there deposited
as part thereof. . . . . The ray or tail of the nucleus is also a highly
instructive phaenomenon. As the envelope dilated and grew fainter,
this, on the contrary, while also dilating at the same rate, grew more
intense up to the 1st of February, after which time it faded, while
the nucleus with its coma rapidly increased in comparative bright
ness. It seems hardly possible not to recognise in these changes the
effect of the gradual deposition of the matter of the envelope;
choosing the line of its axis as the course of the deposited particles
in their progress to rejoin the nucleus.”—P. 411.                 * - - --
   From the above extracts the reader will be enabled to form an
opinion of the manner in which this very interesting portion of the
work is treated. At the next return of the comet, it will be regarded
as a fortunate event for astronomy that the time of Sir John Her
schel's sojourn at the Cape embraced that of its last appearance, and
that the most powerful optical means then in existence, in the hands
of the first astronomer and philosopher of the age, were applied to the

portant in reference to the light which they throw on the constitution
of the solar system.
          Chap. VI. Observations of the Satellites of Saturn.
   “During the years 1835, 1836 and 1837, the ring of Saturn and
the orbits of the satellites were sufficiently open to permit the accu
mulation of a considerably extensive series of their angles of position
with the meridian, or with the longer axis of the ring, so disposed
as to be available towards the more exact determination of their
orbits; of which little is known with the exception of that of the
sixth, which is the largest and most easily observable, and whose
elements and perturbations have been made the subject of elaborate
investigation by Bessel.” The author therefore considers that his
observations of those bodies, “though confessedly imperfect, owing
to their extreme faintness in the equatorial, and the difficulty of ob
taining any measures at all of position with the 20-foot reflector out
of the meridian, may not be wholly without interest as a contribu
tion to their theory.”
   The number of known satellites belonging to Saturn is seven,
of which one was discovered by Huygens, four by D. Cassini, and
the remaining two by Sir William Herschel. The two last are ex
tremely small and faint; and so long was it before the observations
of the discoverer were confirmed, that some astronomers began even
to entertain doubts of their existence. Such, indeed, is their extreme
minuteness, that it is only under the most favourable circumstances,
and with telescopes of extraordinary power, that they can be per
ceived. The three which are most remote from the planet may be
seen with telescopes of moderate power. “Measures of the fourth
satellite could rarely be procured so as to be in any degree satisfac
tory with the equatorial—of the third, never. . . . .  As to the two in
terior satellites, it is needless to state that no glimpse of either of
them was ever obtained with this instrument.”          In fact, the one
nearest the planet was only observed once in the 20-foot reflector.
   The satellites of Saturn had hitherto been distinguished merely by
the ordinal numbers, first, second, third, and so on; and it is the
usual, though not uniform practice, to begin with the satellite near
est the central body and reckon outwards. But the discovery of
the two interior satellites necessarily deranged the nomenclature, the
one which had been previously reckoned the first now becoming the
third. Some astronomers have also adopted the contrary order, and
begun the numeration with the most remote satellite. Sir John
states, that having found the equivoque practically annoying, and a
source of frequent error and mistake, he had recourse to the practice
of distinguishing them by individual names, adopting a mythological
momenclature, which, however, he does not “pretend to recommend
to others, though persuaded that some nomenclature other than the
equivocal one in actual use will be found necessary by all who ob
serve these bodies.” The names which he selected are the following,
beginning with the most remote, and proceeding downwards in order:

Iapetus, Titan, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, Mimas. The
reasons for the selection are set forth in a note which we transcribe
at length.                                                                -              **
    “As Saturn devoured his children, his family could not be assem
bled round him, so that the choice lay among his brothers and sisters,
the Titans and Titanesses. The name Iapetus seemed indicated by
the obscurity and remoteness of the exterior satellite, Titan by the
superior size of the Huygenian, while the three female appellatives
class together the three intermediate Cassinian satellites.                   The mi
nute interior ones seemed appropriately characterized by a return to
male appellatives, chosen from a younger and inferior (though still
superhuman) brood. Should an eighth satellite exist, the confusion
of the old nomenclature will become quite intolerable. I am not
aware that a distant satellite of Jupiter (analogous to Iapetus and
our moon) has ever been looked for. Would it not be worth a .
search Pº”—P. 415.              -*   --                                     -          . . .”
    The contents of the present chapter may be briefly described. The
author first gives some explanations respecting the mode in which
the observations were made. A table follows, exhibiting a synopsis.
of all the measured (and some of the estimated) angles of position of
the satellites as taken both with the equatorial and reflector. In
 order to render the observations available for the purpose of affording
 epochs by which to correct the received periodic times, the observed
angles of position must be converted into Saturnicentric longitudes.
Formulae and elements for this purpose are given; but as the use of
the elements supposes the orbits of the satellites to be coincident
with the plane of the ring, they are not applicable to the reduction
of the observations of Iapetus, the orbit of which deviates from that
plane very considerably. Of Mimas, there being only a single ob-,
servation, no conclusion could be deduced respecting the orbit. In
respect of the remaining five satellites, tables are given exhibiting,
the Saturnicentric longitudes from the descending node of the ring,
calculated from the elements and formulae above referred to for each. 5

These observed longitudes are then compared with the corresponding.
mean longitudes, calculated from certain assumed epochs of longitude
and mean motions, and the differences given. In most cases, where,
the differences are considerable, the observations were found to have
been recorded as doubtful or unsatisfactory, and some of them are:
therefore rejected. "In order to deduce elements, the observations.
were treated by a method of graphical projection, and the results.
gave values of the eccentricity, the equation of centre, the perisatur
nium, and correction of epochs for four of the satellites, viz. Titan, i.

   For the determination of the mean distances or major semiaxes of
the orbits, measures at or near the greatest elongations can only be
advantageously employed. In the course of the observations a good
many measures of distance were taken; but by reason of the want
of symmetry of the upper and lower portions of the outline of the
visible part of the planet, which renders it extremely difficult to fix
upon the position of the apparent centre, they were found (excepting
in situations very near the line of the ansa:) not only to present dis
cordances among themselves, but to be affected by a general cause
of error. The measures of distance are therefore made use of in the
case of Titan only, and the resulting value of the semiaxis of the

  "The author states that he had no confidence in any of the distances
of Rhea measured with the equatorial micrometer, the faintness of
the object not permitting it to be satisfactorily covered with the wire.
They are accordingly not stated. In the case of Iapetus there was
less' difficulty; and though the measures were not numerous, and
were for the most part taken merely for the purpose of identifying
the satellite, it was thought they might be usefully recorded. One
 of them appears to have been an observation of the greatest elonga
tion, and amounted to 553".93, which, reduced to the mean distance
of Saturn, corresponds to a radius vector of 8'38"-07. Considering
 that we have no knowledge of the eccentricity of the orbit, this agrees
 sufficiently well with the mean elongation (8' 34"-8) calculated from
 the distance of Titan by comparison of their mean motions.”
   * * * Chap. VH. Observations of the Solar Spots.
   “At the latter end of 1836, and during the first half of 1837, the
 spots on the surface of the sun were extremely remarkable, not only
 for their number and size, but also in their arrangement and forms.
 In consequence, during the interval above-mentioned, a great number
of drawings were made of the sun's disc by projecting the image
formed in the focus of an achromatic finder attached to the equatorial,
for which, after a few trials, a perspective day telescope of 20 inches
focus, and 1:4 inch aperture, was spbstituted as more, convenient. ,
The image was received on paper pinned on a screen of wood, and
 traced ..º.º.º.º.º.º.º.ing the right

ascension motion was allowed to rest, the image of this spot of course
travelled away from the dot, and after allowing it to do so till near
the edge of the paper, another dot was made marking its newplace,
 and these two dots being joined by a straight line, gave the direction
 of the diurnal parallel on the paper. The minuter details necessary
 to effect a complete resemblance of the projection to the actual ap
pearance of the spots, with their penumbras, &c., were then worked

 306                Notices respecting New Books.
    The above description may be found useful to some who are de
 sirous of making projections of the solar spots. Sir John states that
 he did not consider it worth while to engrave and publish all the
 drawings made by him, but he gives a list of the days on which they
 were made, “in case it should ever be considered necessary to appeal
 to any of them as records of the state of the sun's surface at that
 time;” and he observes, it is much to be wished that all who habi
 tually make such drawings would at least place the days for which
they possess them on record, in order that it may be rendered possible
to ascertain the state of the sun by actual observation on any given
day.
    Äner giving some further particulars respecting the mode of deli
 neating the spots, he calls attention to the following points shown
by the drawings as characteristic or remarkable:—1st, to certain
forms frequently reproduced on the sun's surface; 2ndly, to the
remarkable radiated or striated apparent structure of the penumbra
in certain cases; 3rdly, to the total absence of all penumbra in some
spots; 4thly, to the occurrence of distinct shades in certain parts of
some penumbrae; and lastly, to the immense area occupied by some
of the spots with their penumbrae represented in the drawings. As
instances of enormous magnitude, he mentions that the spot observed
on March 29 occupies an area of nearly five square minutes; and as
a square minute on the sun corresponds to 756,000,000 square miles,
“we have here an area of 3,780,000,000 square miles included in
one vast region of disturbance, and this requires to be increased for
the effect of foreshortening. The black spot of May 25 would have
allowed the globe of the earth to drop through it, leaving a thousand
miles clear of contact on all sides of that tremendous gulph.”—P. 432.
    He next proceeds to consider a question which may be regarded
as the most interesting which can be proposed in connexion with the
subject, namely, “to inquire for an efficient cause—for a vis motria.
—to give rise to such enormous dynamical phaenomena, for such
they undoubtedly are;” and after remarking that the cause of the
movements which we observe must reside within the sun itself, and
must be there sought for, he thus continues:–                A
   “Whatever may be the physical cause of the spots, one thing is
certain, that they have an intimate connexion with the rotation of
the sun on its axis. The absence of spots in the polar regions of
the sun, and their confinement to two zones extending to about 35?
latitude on either side, with an intermediate equatorial belt much
more rarely visited by spots, is a fact notorious in their history, and
which at once refers their cause to fluid circulations, modified, if not
produced, by that rotation, by reasoning of the very same kind
whereby we connect our own system of trade and anti-trade winds
with the earth's rotation. Having given any exciting cause for the
circulation of atmospheric fluids from the poles to the equator, and
back again, or vice versd, the effect of rotation will necessarily be
to modify those currents as our trade-winds and monsoons are mo
dified, and to dispose all their meteorological phaenomena on a great
scale which accompany them as their visible manifestations in zones

                   Notices respecting New Books.                    307
parallel to the equator, with a calm equatorial zone interposed. It
only remains, therefore, to inquire, Whether any such cause of cir
culation can be found in the oeconomy of the sun, so far as we know
and can understand it º’’
   In answer to this inquiry he observes, that if any physical differ
ence in the constitution or circumferences of the sun's polar and
equatorial regions tends to repress the escape of heat in the one, and
to favour it in the other of these regions, the effect will be the same
as if those regions were unequally heated from without, and all the
phaenomena of trade-winds, mutatis mutandis, must arise.       That the
sun is surrounded by a transparent atmosphere, extending beyond
its luminous surface, Sir John holds to be conclusively established
by various phaenomena, and he instances in particular the striking
deficiency of light at the borders of the visible disc, and the extra
ordinary phaenomenon of the rose-coloured clouds witnessed during
the total eclipse of July 8, 1842, which must have floated in and
been sustained by an exterior transparent atmosphere. He also
thinks that the distance to which this atmosphere extends beyond
the visible disc must be considerable, not merely in absolute measure,
but as an aliquot part of the sun's radius. “Now, granting the ex
istence of such an atmosphere, its form in obedience to the laws of
equilibrium must be that of an oblate spheroid, the ellipticities of
whose strata differ from each other and from that of the nucleus.
Consequently, the equatorial portions of this envelope must be of a
thickness different from that of the polar, density for density, so that
a different obstacle must be thereby opposed to the escape of heat
from the equatorial and the polar regions of the sun.       The former,
therefore, ought, according to this reasoning, to be habitually main
tained at a different temperature from the latter.”             -
   According to this view of the subject, the spots come to be “assi
milated to those regions on the earth's surface in which, for the
moment, hurricanes and tornadoes prevail—the upper stratum being
temporarily carried downwards, displacing by its impetus the two
strata of luminous matter beneath,. . . . . the upper of course to a
greater extent than the lower, and thus wholly or partially denuding
the opaque surface of the sun below.         Such processes cannot be
unaccompanied with vorticose motions, which, left to themselves, die
away by degrees and dissipate, with this peculiarity, that their lower
portions come to rest more speedily than their upper, by reason of
the greater resistance below, as well as the remoteness from the point
of action, which lies in a higher region, so that their centre (as seen
in our water-spouts, which are nothing but small tornadoes) ap
pears to retreat upwards.     Now this agrees perfectly with what is
observed during the obliteration of the solar spots, which appear as
if filled in by the collapse of their sides, the penumbra closing in
upon the spot and disappearing after it.”—P. 434. . . .
   Some appearances which were frequently noticed in the course of
these observations might seem at first sight to militate against this
idea. , Lines of spots of more or less extent, or connected with pe
numbral trains more or less beset with spots, were frequently noticed

 308                Notices respecting New Books."
 oblique to the direction of the parallels of latitude on the sun's sur
 face, and converging on both sides of the equator to the preceding
 side of the disc. Penumbrae of great spots also were sometimes
 observed to be rounded and well-terminated on the preceding side,
 but rugged and extensively diffused on the following, where th y
 would often take the form of great trains, and ultimately affect
 form of pretty long, straight parallel bands, having the same obli
                                                                       º
 quity to the parallels of latitude as the lines and spots above-men
 tioned. Sir John is of opinion that these bands and lines, having a
 transverse direction to the course of the currents which the dyna
 mical theory supposes, “must be assimilated rather to ripple-marks
 which are transverse to the direction of the general movement i
 which they have their origin than to trails drawn out by a      º:
 in its own direction, if indeed the appearances in question be any.
 thing more than accidental.”                         -     . . . ..
    A very remarkable character of the solar spots is the intense
 blackness of the spot “nucleus,” or “opening,” as it has been   º
 as contrasted with the penumbra or “shallow” surrounding it.
 “This want of graduation—this sharply marked suddenness of tran
 ition, is altogether opposed to the conception of a susceptibility of
 indefinite and easy mixture in the luminous, non-luminous, and
 semi-luminous constituents of the solar envelope. . . . . There is no
 gradual melting of the one shade into the other—spot into penumbra
 —penumbra into full light... The idea conveyed is º: that of the
 successive withdrawal of veils—the partial removal of definite films,
 than the melting away of a mist, or the mutual dilution of gaseous
media. Films of immiscible liquids having a      º                  float
ing on a dark or transparent ocean and liable to temporary/removal
by winds, would rather seem suggested by the general tenour of the
appearances, though they are far from being wholly explicable by
this conception, at least if any considerable degree of transparency
be allowed to the luminous matter.”—P. 436. , , , , , a          A * *
    The chapter concludes with the remark, that, during the months
embraced by the observations the state of the sun seemed evidently
undergoing a gradual alteration in the nature of a subsidence from

  "There are a great many problems in heat, fluid motion, &c., the
 solution of which requires the development of an arbitrary function
 of a, f(r), between certain limits as o and a of e, by means of func
 tions of known form. The form of the expansion is determined, at
 least in part, by the conditions to be satisfied at the limits; and it
 is usually considered that these conditions are satisfied by adopting
 the form of expansion to which they lead. Thus, if the problem
 requires that f(0) and f(a) vanish, it is considered that this condition
 is satisfied by developing f(r) in a series of sines of * and its mul
 tiples." But since sº admits of expansion in such
 a series, the expanded function is not restricted to vanish at the
 limits 0 and a. It becomes then a question, how shall we know

 tained, and the amount of the sudden change of the function deter

     The most important case in considering a series of sines, is that
  in which f(a) is continuous; but f(0) and f(a), instead of being equal
  to zero, are given quantities, and the coefficients in the expansion
 are indeterminate. In this case the coefficients in the expansions of
f'(r) and f'(x) contain, in addition to the indeterminate coefficients
 which enter into the expansion of f(r), the given quantities,f(0) and
f(a).     Thus the expansion in a series of sines is useful, not only when
f(0) and f(a) vanish, but also when they are given quantities. In the
 same way the expansion off(r)in a series of cosines is useful whenf'(0)
  and f'(a) are given, as well as when they vanish. Thus, to take an
  example, the permanent temperature in a rectangular parallelepiped,
 when the temperatures of the faces are any arbitrary functions of
 the co-ordinates, can be expressed in a double series of sines in
  volving any two of the three co-ordinates,                                    º
     The author has only considered a series of sines and a series
  cosines, with the corresponding integrals; but the methods which
  he has employed are of very general application. The comparison
  of different expressions of the same function of two or more inde
 pendent variables often leads to very remarkable formulae. The de
 velopment of arbitrary functions in the way considered by the author
 is, however, not only curious but useful; for the expressions thus
  obtained are often much better adapted to numerical computation
  than those which would be obtained by the developments usually
  employed.                                                      . .         . . . .
     In connexion with these investigations, the author was led to con

  of integrals between infinite limits, which sometimes takes place even
  when the series or integral remains convergent, and the general term
  of the series, or the quantity under the integral sine, is a continuous
 function of some quantity which is regarded as variable.                             The
 author has shown that in all such cases the convergency of the series

similar method may sometimes be advantageously employed in other
questions. The electricity is first supposed to be diffused over a
finite space : this allows of the expansion of the potential V in a
 triple series of sines. Instead of the equation VV=0, where V

it becomes of course necessary to employ the equation VV= -4Tp.
The solution having been obtained, the electricity may now be sup
posed to be condensed into a point, and one of the summations may
be effected. The potential is thus expressed in a double series,
which appears to be the simplest form that it admits of.

   May 8, 1848.-Supplement to a paper “On the Intensity of Light
in the neighbourhood of a Caustic.” By G. B. Airy, Esq., Astro
nomer Royal.
   The author, after referring to the paper printed in a former volume
of the Society's Memoirs, in which he has shown that the expression
for the intensity depends on the integral   /.cos   (wº—mw) between
the limits w=0, w = infinity, where m is proportional to the distance
of the point at which the intensity is required, from the geometrical
caustic, and in which he has calculated by quadratures the value of
 the definite integral for different values of m as far as m++4.0,
states that he was induced to have recourse to the method of qua
dratures only because every expansion which he attempted made it
necessary to rely (for some of the terms) upon definite integrals
equivalent to the integral<U+017F> cos 0 from 0–0 to 0 = infinity, and that
he was not satisfied with the reasoning upon which some mathema
ticians had given a determinate value to that integral. Professor De
Morgan, however, who felt no doubts upon it, had furnished him
with a series proceeding by ascending powers of m, and had also
explained in detail (in a letter embodied in this paper) his views on
the evidence for the value of the series, and on the method of de
termining it. From this series, the values of the definite integral are
computed for all the values of m for which the computation had been
made by quadratures, and the result is that the two sets of computed
numbers are entirely accordant. The computations are also extended
to the limit m==E5-6, which is the greatest value to which it is
possible to extend the calculations by the use of 10-figure logarithms.
ºr June 5.—On some new Fossil Fish of the Carboniferous Period.
By Frederic M'Coy, M.G.S., N.H.S.D.                                -
   The author having premised that the species of fish of the carbo
niferous limestone enumerated in the third volume of the Poissons
Fossiles of M. Agassiz are for the most part still unpublished, being
without definitions or figures, states that through the kindness of
Capt. Jones, R.N., M.P., &c. he was enabled to study the original
specimens of twenty-eight out of the thirty unpublished species
from Armagh in M. Agassiz's list, and is therefore certain of the
species described by him being so far distinct from those alluded
to. The greater number of the examples here described are in
the cabinets of the University of Cambridge (principally collected
by the Rev. W. Stokes, of Caius College), and of Captain-Jones;
 a few from the lower carboniferous shales of Ireland are only
known in that of Mr. Griffith of Dublin. The descriptions are
accompanied by drawings of all the species of the natural size, and

are made of the kind co-operation of the Rev. Prof. Clark and Mr.
Anthony of Caius College, Cambridge, in this part of the investiga
tion, by allowing the use of their large microscopes, and assisting to
prepare the transparent fragments for examination.
   Twelve new genera are proposed :-1st. Isodus, for a fish of the
yellow sandstone, having very numerous teeth with a simple conical
pulp-cavity in their upper part, which divides into branches below as
in Rhizodus (Owen); but the section is circular, and the teeth are
all equal in size. 2nd. Centrodus, for curved conical teeth with a wide
simple pulp-cavity, reducing the base to a sharp edge, and having
not only the form but the microscopic structure of a reptile tooth,
that is, from the simple pulp-cavity minute calcigerous tubes radiate
to the circumference, terminating near the surface in a layer of small
calcigerous cells, covered by a layer of true glass-like enamel, pre
senting no trace of structure with a power of 300 diameters, and
quite distinct from that dense modification of dentine, which, forming
the polished surface of most fish-teeth, has been confounded with
true enamel, but which it is here proposed to call ganoine in future
descriptions. 3rd. Colonodus, for very long simple teeth with simple
pulp-cavity, and their sides indented by transverse wrinkles. 4th. Os
teoplar, for large, flat, polygonal dermal plates, minutely wrinkled on
the surface, and allied to Psammosteus (Ag.) of the Old Red Sand
stone; but while the latter plates are composed of horizontal layers
of large cells, the present genus has a very singular microscopic
structure, being traversed by vertical branched (Haversian ) canals
terminating in the pores of the surface; and in the intervening blas
tema are numerous oval Purkinian cells, the radiating tubuli of which
do not anastomose. 5th. Erismacanthus, for a singular Ichthyodo
rulite not uncommon in the Armagh limestone, which, arising from
a large compressed base, branches into two portions, one long ante
rior closely tuberculated prop-like portion, and another extruding
backwards, short, and resembling a small Ctenacanthus, but with
smooth ridges. 6th. Platycanthus, for small spines, extremely wide
and compressed, resembling small Oracanths, but arched and with
posterior rows of teeth. 7th. Dipriacanthus, for small, curved dorsal
spines, which have two rows of denticles pointing downwards on the
posterior face, and two rows pointing upwards on the anterior face,
reminding us of the recent Pimelodus and Synodontus of the Nile.
8th. Polyrhizodus, an extraordinary genus of Psammodontoid teeth
not uncommon in the Armagh limestone, having the root divided
into numerous fang-like lobes, as in a mammalian tooth. 9th. Glos
sodus, for certain tongue-shaped teeth allied to Helodus (Ag). 10th.
Climatodus, for some palates allied to Pacilodus (Ag), but instead of
being transversely trigonal and obliquely ridged, they are equilateral,
and have the ridges transverse and parallel (like a flight of steps).
11th. Chirodus, for little hand-shaped teeth allied to the Ceratodi,
but distinguished by the thumb-like lobe projecting from the middle
of the long side, and which would prevent the union of the teeth in
pairs in the mouth, in the manner of Ceratodus. 12th, Petrodus,

  small conical ridged teeth resembling limpets, common in the Der
  byshire limestone, but presenting, of all known fossil fish, the near
  est approach to the microscopic structure of the recent Cestracion.
  It is also proposed to divide the genus Holoptychius of M. Agassiz;
  and instead of considering it and Rhizodus of Owen as synonymous,
  to limit the latter to those great teeth with an elliptical section so
  common in some parts of the Carboniferous series, accompanied by
 large, thin, quadrate scales, marked with concentric lines of growth,
 and having a fine cancellated structure internally, the Holoptychius
 Hibberti (Ag) (Rhizodus feror, Owen) and H. Portlocki (Ag) being
 the types; thus retaining sº name Holoptychius for those fish so
 abundant in the Old Red Sandstone with thick, bony, ovate, longi
 tudinally wrinkled scales, and minute teeth with a circular section,
 having the H. nobilissimus, H. giganteus, &c. as the type.
    The number of new species described and figured in this paper is
 forty-one, of which several belong to genera not previously known
 in rocks of the carboniferous period, many showing a strong affinity
 to the Devonian type of form. Thus we have two species of Psam
 mosteus, one of Chelyophorus, one (doubtful) of Coccosteus, one of
 Asterolepis, two of Homacanthus, and one of Cosmacanthus, genera.
 hitherto only found in the Old Red Sandstone.
    On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carmot's Theory
 of the Motive Power of Heatº, and calculated from Regnault's ob
 servations f. By Prof. W. Thomson, Fellow of St. Peter's College.
    The determination of temperature has long been recognized as a
 problem of the greatest importance in physical science. It has ac
 cordingly been made a subject of most, careful attention, and, espe
 cially in late years, of very elaborate and refined experimental re
 searchest; and we are thus at present in possession of as complete a
 practical solution of the problem as can be desired, even for the most
 accurate investigations. The theory of thermometry is however as
 yet far from being in so satisfactory a state. The principle to be
followed in constructing a thermometric scale might at first sight
 seem to be obvious, as it might appear that a perfect thermometer
 would indicate equal additions of heat, as corresponding to equal
 elevations of temperature, estimated by the numbered divisions of
 its scale. It is however now recognized (from the variations in the
specific heats of bodies) as an experimentally demonstrated fact that

thermometry under this condition is impossible, and we are left with
out any principle on which to found an absolute thermometric scale.
    Next in importance to the primary establishment of an absolute
scale, independently of the properties of any particular kind of mat
ter, is the fixing upon an arbitrary system of thermometry, according
to which results of observations made by different experimenters, in
various positions and circumstances, may be exactly compared. This
object is very fully attained by means of thermometers constructed and
graduated according to the clearly defined methods adopted by the
best instrument-makers of the present day, when the rigorous expe
rimental processes which have been indicated, especially by Regnault,
for interpreting their indications in a comparable way, are followed.
The particular kind of thermometer which is least liable to uncertain
variations of any kind is that founded on the expansion of air, and
 this is therefore generally adopted as the standard for the comparison
 of thermometers of all constructions.        Hence the scale which is at
present employed for estimating temperature is that of the air-ther
 mometer; and in accurate researches care is always taken to reduce
 to this scale the indications of the instrument actually used, whatever
 may be its specific construction and graduation.
     The principle according to which the scale of the air-thermometer
 is graduated, is simply that equal absolute expansions of the mass of
 air or gas in the instrument, under a constant pressure, shall indicate
 equal differences of the numbers on the scale; the length of a “de
 gree" being determined by allowing a given number for the interval
 between the freezing- and the boiling-points.           Now it is found by
 Regnault that various thermometers, constructed with air under dif
 ferent pressures, or with different gases, give indications which coin
 cide so closely, that, unless when certain gases, such as sulphurous
 acid, which approach the physical condition of vapours at saturation,
  are made use of, the variations are inappreciable”. This remarkable
 circumstance enhances very much the practical value of the air
  thermometer; but still a rigorous standard can only be defined by
  fixing upon a certain gas at a determinate pressure, as the thermo
  metric substance. Although we have thus a strict principle for con
  structing a definite system for the estimation of temperature, yet as
  reference is essentially made to a specific body as the standard ther
  mometric substance, we cannot consider that we have arrived at an
  absolute scale, and we can only regard, in strictness, the scale actu
  ally adopted as an arbitrary series of numbered points of reference
  sufficiently close for the requirements of practical thermometry.
      In the present state of physical science, therefore, a question of
  extreme interest arises: Is there any principle on which an absolute
  thermometric scale can be founded ? It appears to me that Carnot's
     * Regnault, Relation des Eapériences, &c., Fourth Memoir, First Part.
  The differences, it is remarked by Regnault, would be much more sensible
  if the graduation were effected on the supposition that the coefficients of
  expansion of the different gases are equal, instead of being founded on the
  principle laid down in the text, according to which the freezing- and boiling
  points are experimentally determined for each thermometer.

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                    315
theory of the motive power of heat enables us to give an affirmative
anSWer.
   The relation between motive power and heat, as established by
Carnot, is such that quantities of heat, and intervals of temperature, are
involved as the sole elements in the expression for the amount of me
chanical effect to be obtained through the agency of heat; and since
we have, independently, a definite system for the measurement of
quantities of heat, we are thus furnished with a measure for intervals
according to which absolute differences of temperature may be esti
mated. To make this intelligible, a few words in explanation of
Carnot's theory must be given; but for a full account of this most
valuable contribution to physical science, the reader is referred to
either of the works mentioned above (the original treatise by Car
not, and Clapeyron's paper on the same subject).
   In the present state of science no operation is known by which heat
can be absorbed, without either elevating the temperature of matter,
or becoming latent and producing some alteration in the physical
condition of the body into which it is absorbed; and the conversion
of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible”,
certainly undiscovered. In actual engines for obtaining mechanical
effect through the agency of heat, we must consequently look for the
source of power, not in any absorption and conversion, but merely
in a transmission of heat. Now Carnot, starting from universally
acknowledged physical principles, demonstrates that it is by the
letting down of heat from a hot body to a cold body, through the
medium of an engine (a steam-engine, or an air-engine for instance),
that mechanical effect is to be obtained; and conversely, he proves
that the same amount of heat may, by the expenditure of an equal
amount of labouring force, be raised from the cold to the hot body
(the engine being in this case worked backwards); just as mechanical
effect may be obtained by the descent of water let down by a water
wheel, and by spending labouring force in turning the wheel back
wards, or in working a pump, water may be elevated to a higher
level. The amount of mechanical effect to be obtained by the trans
mission of a given quantity of heat, through the medium of any kind
of engine in which the oeconomy is perfect, will depend, as Carnot
demonstrates, not on the specific nature of the substance employed
as the medium of transmission of heat in the engine, but solely on
the interval between the temperatures of the two bodies between
which the heat is transferred.
    Carnot examines in detail the ideal construction of an air-engine
and of a steam-engine, in which, besides the condition of perfect
    * This opinion seems to be nearly universally held by those who have
 written on the subject. A contrary opinion however has been advocated
by Mr. Joule of Manchester; some very remarkable discoveries which he
 has made with reference to the generation of heat by the friction of fluids
 in motion, and some known experiments with magneto-electric machines,
 seeming to indicate an actual conversion of mechanical effect into caloric.
 No experiment however is adduced in which the converse operation is exhi
 bited; but it must be confessed that as yet much is involved in mystery
 with reference to these fundamental questions of natural philosophy.

oeconomy being satisfied, the machine is so arranged that at the close
 of a complete operation the substance (air in one case and water in
 the other) employed is restored to precisely the same physical con
 dition as at the commencement.         He thus shows on what elements,
 capable of experimental determination, either with reference to air, or
 with reference to a liquid and its vapour, the absolute amount of
 mechanical effect due to the transmission of a unit of heat from a
 hot body to a cold body, through any given interval of the thermo
 metric scale, may be ascertained. In M. Clapeyron's paper various
 experimental data, confessedly very imperfect, are brought forward,
 and the amounts of mechanical effect due to a unit of heat descend
 ing a degree of the air-thermometer, in various parts of the scale,
 are calculated from them, according to Carnot's expressions. The
 results so obtained indicate very decidedly, that what we may with
 much propriety call the value of a degree (estimated by the mecha
 nical effect to be obtained from the descent of a unit of heat through
 it) of the air-thermometer depends on the part of the scale in which
 it is taken, being less for high than for low temperatures*.
    The characteristic property of the scale which I now propose is,
 that all degrees have the same value; that is, that a unit of heat
 descending from a body A at the temperature Tº of this scale, to a
 body B at the temperature (T-1)*, would give out the same me
 chanical effect, whatever be the number T. This may justly be
 termed an absolute scale, since its characteristic is quite independent
 of the physical properties of any specific substance.
    To compare this scale with that of the air-thermometer, the values
 (according to the principle of estimation stated above) of degrees of
 the air-thermometer must be known. Now an expression, obtained
 by Carnot from the consideration of his ideal steam-engine, enables
 us to calculate these values, when the latent heat of a given volume
 and the pressure of saturated vapour at any temperature are experi
 mentally determined. The determination of these elements is the
 principal object of Regnault's great work, already referred to, but at
 present his researches are not complete. In the first part, which alone
 has been as yet published, the latent heats of a given weight, and the
 pressures of saturated vapour at all temperatures between 0° and 230°
 (Cent. of the air-thermometer), have been ascertained; but it would
 be necessary in addition to know the densities of saturated vapour
 at different temperatures, to enable us to determine the latent heat
 of a given volume at any temperature. M. Regnault announces his
 intention of instituting researches for this object; but till the results
 are made known, we have no way of completing the data necessary
   * This is what we might anticipate, when we reflect that infinite cold
must correspond to a finite number of degrees of the air-thermometer below
zero; since, if we push the strict principle of graduation, stated above, suf.
ficiently far, we should arrive at a point corresponding to the volume of
air being reduced to nothing, which would be marked as —273° (–          ;
if 366 be the coefficient of expansion) of the scale; and therefore —273°
of the air-thermometer is a point which cannot be reached at any finite
temperature, however low.

for the present problem, except by estimating the density of saturated
vapour at any temperature (the corresponding pressure being known
by Regnault's researches already published) according to the approxi
mate laws of compressibility and expansion (the laws of Mariotte
and Gay-Lussac, or Boyle and Dalton). Within the limits of natural
temperature in ordinary climates, the density of saturated vapour is
actually found by Regnault (Etudes Hygrométriques in the Annales
de Chimie) to verify very closely these laws; and we have reason to
believe from experiments which have been made by Gay-Lussac and
others, that as high as the temperature 100° there can be no consi
derable deviation; but our estimate of the density of saturated va
pour, founded on these laws, may be very erroneous at such high
temperatures as 230°. Hence a completely satisfactory calculation
of the proposed scale cannot be made till after the additional experi
mental data shall have been obtained ; but with the data which we
actually possess, we may make an approximate comparison of the
new scale with that of the air-thermometer, which at least between
0° and 100° will be tolerably satisfactory.
   The labour of performing the necessary calculations for effecting
a comparison of the proposed scale with that of the air-thermometer,
between the limits 0° and 230° of the latter, has been kindly under
taken by Mr. William Steele, lately of Glasgow College, now of
St. Peter's College, Cambridge. His results in tabulated forms were
laid before the Society, with a diagram, in which the comparison
between the two scales is represented graphically.
   In the first table, the amounts of mechanical effect due to the
descent of a unit of heat through the successive degrees of the air
thermometer are exhibited. The unit of heat adopted is the quan
tity necessary to elevate the temperature of a kilogramme of water
from 0° to 1* of the air-thermometer; and the unit of mechanical effect
is a metre-kilogramme; that is, a kilogramme raised a metre high.
    In the second table, the temperatures according to the proposed
scale, which correspond to the different degrees of the air-thermo
meter from 0° to 230°, are exhibited. [The arbitrary points which
coincide on the two scales are 0° and 100°.]
   Note—If we add together the first hundred numbers given in the
first table, we find 1357 for the amount of work due to a unit of
heat descending from a body A at 100° to B at 0°. Now 79 such
units of heat would, according to Dr. Black (his result being very
slightly corrected by Regnault), melt a kilogramme of ice. Hence
if the heat necessary to melt a pound of ice be now taken as unity,
and if a metre-pound be taken as the unit of mechanical effect, the
amount of work to be obtained by the descent of a unit of heat from
100° to 0° is 79 × 135-7, or 10,700 nearly. This is the same as
35,100 foot-pounds, which is a little more than the work of a
one-horse-power engine (33,000 foot-pounds) in a minute; and
consequently, if we had a steam-engine working with perfect occo
nomy at one-horse-power, the boiler being at the temperature 100°,
and the condenser kept at 0° by a constant supply of ice, rather
less than a pound of ice would be melted in a minute.

eye. The details are given in the work above-named, and also in
the Arcana of Science for 1834, p. 184.
   I am induced to trouble you with this communication in order to
make known a somewhat similar irregularity in my own case; though
as mine was only temporary, it may perhaps, from the circumstances
under which it occurred, afford some clue to the cause.      I therefore
forward the following note, made at the time, for your perusal.
   “Having occasion to divide a yard into a thousand parts, I used
an eye-lens of six inches focus to assist the Right eye while dividing
—the left was kept closed.     I had been employed about two hours
in making 400 divisions, and then left off.     I then found that upon
looking at a window on the opposite side of the street with the LEFT
(unemployed) eye, the bars were TRIPLE, while with the right (em
ployed) they were single. This effect lasted (gradually decreasing)
for at least two hours; the bars were also surrounded by a strong
penumbra. At first, objects—such as people on horseback—were
so distorted that I had great difficulty in deciding what they
were.”
   On another occasion I have noticed a defect of vision of a some
what different character, of which I also send you the note made at
the time. “Upon rising one morning I observed in the right eye,
as it were, innumerable faint scintillations or lucid points, the whole
field of vision being covered by them. Upon going to a looking
glass, I found that I could not see one half of the face with that eye
—it appeared perfectly dark. The effect lasted perhaps half or
three quarters of an hour.” Dr. Kitchener mentions having been
alarmed by a somewhat similar appearance; but this seems to have
arisen from over-exertion of the eye from minute examination of the
powers, &c. of several telescopes. In my own case, I am not aware
that the eye had been at all overworked on the previous day, or for
some length of time; nor had it any connexion with the previous cause
of multiple vision, this having occurred more than twelve months
before. If you deem the above at all likely to interest your readers,
I hope you will make use of it.
                            I am, Gentlemen,

ON THE DETECTION OF LEAD IN THE PRESENCE OF BISMUTH
     IN BLOWPIPE EXPERIMENTS.             BY E. J. CHAPMAN, ESQ.
   It is well known that lead, bismuth and cadmium are the only
metals which, when heated before the blowpipe, deposit a yellow
coating of oxide on the support. The areola formed by oxide of
cadmium is of a much deeper colour than that deposited by either
lead or bismuth; and the metal itself is so rapidly volatilized, that
in these experiments it is never obtained in the metallic state. When,
therefore, in the examination of any substance, a yellow sublimate
takes place upon the charcoal with the production of a metallic glo
bule, we have to determine whether this globule consist of lead or of
bismuth, or of the two combined. A malleable “button” is usually
presumed to consist of lead, and a brittle one of bismuth ; neverthe
less a perfectly malleable globule may be obtained, containing an
admixture of bismuth ; and a brittle one, on the other hand, con
taining a very considerable quantity of lead. For this reason the
 assay should be examined further; and in the reaction of bismuth
 with microcosmic salt, as first noted by Berzelius, we possess a ready
 method of detecting that metal, whether it be combined with lead
 or not. For this purpose it must be treated with the reagent on
 charcoal in the reducing-flame, with the addition of a minute par
 ticle of tin, when the glass, which is colourless and quite trans
 parent whilst hot, becomes on cooling, if bismuth be present, grayish
 black and opake. The only metal which produces a similar reac
 tion is antimony; but this, if it chance to be present, can easily be
 got rid of by Plattner's process, which consists in fusing the assay
 matter with vitrified boracic acid in the oxidating flame, taking care
 not to allow the globule to be entirely surrounded by the flux, by
 which means the antimony is entirely driven off, whilst the lead and
 bismuth are retained, as oxides, by the melted acid, and may be
 again brought to the metallic state by fusion in the reducing-flame
 with carbonate of soda.
    Thus far then the presence of bismuth is easily ascertained even
 in a malleable globule consisting almost wholly of lead; but the
 detection of this latter metal in a globule rendered brittle by a large
 proportion of bismuth, has been hitherto, in experiments with the
 blowpipe, a much more troublesome affair. Plattner recommends
 for this purpose a modification of one of the methods given in the
 Manual of Professor Rose for the separation of lead from bismuth;
 but this method—which consists, as modified by Plattner, in fusing
 the mixed metals with an excess of bisulphate of potash, and subse
 quently treating the fused mass, first with water, and afterwards with
 nitric acid, to dissolve the sulphate of bismuth—is scarcely admissible
  in these rapid experiments, in which the use of liquid acids and
  other bulky reagents should, if possible, be avoided, in order not only
  to render the operations as simple as accuracy will admit of, but
  also to prevent the dimensions of the blowpipe-case from affecting
  its portability. On this account I have endeavoured to discover
  some other method for the detection of lead when combined in small

quantity with bismuth; and the following very simple process for
that purpose has occurred to me, founded on the known reduction
and precipitation of salts of bismuth by metallic lead—a method
which I have found to succeed perfectly with brittle alloys containing
upwards of 85 per cent. of bismuth. A small fragment or little
 crystal of nitrate of bismuth is placed in a porcelain capsule, and
 moistened with a few drops of water, the greater part of which is
 afterwards poured off; and the metallic button of the mixed metals,
as obtained by the blowpipe, having been slightly flattened on the
 anvil until it begins to crack at the sides, is then placed in the midst
 of the subsalt of bismuth formed by the action of the water, when
 in the course of a minute, or even less, according to the amount of
 lead present, minute arborescent crystals of metallic bismuth form
and collect around the assay. Copper does not affect this reaction;
 but if either zinc or iron were present, the precipitation would ensue
 from that cause alone. Zinc, however, if originally contained in the
assay-matter, would be volatilized by the action of the blowpipe,
 especially if a little carbonate of soda were added to it before sub
jecting the globule to the above test; and iron might be easily sepa
rated by treating the assay in the reducing-flame with a mixture of
carbonate of soda and borax—the latter reagent serving to dissolve
the iron, and to prevent its reduction to the metallic state.         If a
single operation do not effect this,      the globule must be removed
from the saturated dark green glass,      and treated with a further sup
ply of the mixture on another piece       of charcoal until the resulting
glass be no longer coloured.—From         the Chemical Gazette for Sep

       ON THE SEPARATION OF ANTIMONY FROM ARSENIC.
                              BY C. MEYER,
   The following method is founded on the insolubility of the antimo
niate of soda, and the conversion of arseniferous antimony into
arseniate and antimoniate of soda. The author first convinced him
self of the perfect insolubility of calcined anhydrous antimoniate of
soda. . When antimony is deflagrated with nitrate of soda and the
mass exhausted with cold water, no antimony can be found in the
liquid. The residuous antimoniate of soda is NaO, Sb O5, and an
hydrous. When a solution of antimoniate of potash is precipitated
with sulphate of soda, and the liquid after some time filtered off
clear, no antimony can be detected in it. The crystalline precipi
tate was proved by analysis to be also NaO, SbO3, but it contains
6 atoms or 21:23 per cent. of water; experiment gave 21.5. The
antimony was estimated in some cases by precipitating it with sul
phuretted hydrogen from a solution of the salt in a mixture of mu
riatic and tartaric acids; in others by the method recently proposed
by Rose", igniting the salt with chloride of ammonium, which gave

the most accurate result. This hydrated salt is not quite insoluble
in boiling water.
    To test the applicability of the insolubility of the calcined anti
moniate of soda to its separation from arsenic, a known weight of
pure antimony was mixed with arsenic, and the mixture deflagrated
with three times its weight of a mixture of nitrate and carbonate of
soda. After washing the mass with cold water and ignition, a quan
tity of antimoniate of soda was obtained, which almost exactly cor
responded with the weight which should have been obtained ac
cording to theory. On examination before the blowpipe, the salt
proved to be perfectly free from arsenic. The arsenic was precipi
tated from the solution with sulphuretted hydrogen, and determined
in the usual manner; and its quantity likewise agreed perfectly well
with the amount employed.
    0.10 grim. tartar-emetic and as much arsenious acid were dissolved
in a thick soup, the organic matters destroyed as much as possible
by a long-continued current of chlorine, the heated liquid filtered,
the mass upon the filter well-washed, the solution saturated with
sulphuretted hydrogen and left for some time in contact with it; the
precipitate filtered, washed, and then dissolved together with the
filter in hot nitric acid, the solution saturated with carbonate of
soda, some nitrate of soda added to it, the whole evaporated, and
the residue heated in a porcelain crucible until the sulphurets and
organic matter were completely oxidized, and the mass finally fused.
On exhausting the mass with water, 0.057 grm. antimoniate of soda
was obtained, while according to theory 0.058 should have been
obtained.    The solution which contained the arseniate of soda was
evaporated to dryness; all the carbonic, nitric and nitrous acids ex
pelled by concentrated sulphuric acid; the salt dissolved in water,
mixed with sulphurous acid; and, after expelling the latter, the
arsenic precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen. To separate the
free sulphur, the precipitate was dissolved in very dilute ammonia,
 and reprecipitated with sulphuric acid; it weighed 0-120 grim, which
 corresponds to 0.096 arsenious acid, which also is very near to the
 amount employed,
     The author applied this insolubility of the antimoniate of soda
 likewise to the preparation of antimony free from arsenic acid with
 complete success. Commercial antimony was fused together with
 #th its weight of arsenic, the powdered regulus mixed with 14th
 part of crude nitrate of soda (cubic nitre), and # part carbonate of
 soda, heated to faint redness, and the mass exhausted with water.
 The residue of antimoniate of soda was, when dry, fused with half
 its weight of cream of tartar, when a very beautiful white regulus
 was obtained, which gave off not the slightest odour of arsenic be
 fore the blowpipe, and was characterized by the ease with which it
 continued to burn away. Moreover the regulus neither contained
 sodium nor potassium, which latter it generally contains when re
 duced from the antimoniate of potash-Liebig's Annalen, May 1848.

    ON THE COMPOSITION OF ORCINE AND ITS DERIVATIVES.
                 BY M.M. LAURENT AND GERHARDT.
   Chemists generally admit the formulae proposed some years since
by M. Liebig, for dry and crystallized orcine. According to this
chemist, they are—
                Dry orcine . . . . . . . .    C16 H16O4
                Crystallized orcine.. C*H19 O*--3Aq.
   These formulae seem at first to agree perfectly with the metamor
phoses by which orcine originates, and especially with the production
of orcine by lecanorine. But if the formulae of M. Liebig be com
  ared with the analyses of M. Dumas, and with the more recent ones
of MM. Will and Schunck, whose results are almost identical with
those of M. Dumas, it will be seen that these formulae suppose an
error of nearly 3 per cent, in the carbon found by experiment in dry
orcine.
   Struck with this circumstance, one of the authors proposed two
years since to reject the formulae of M. Liebig, and to replace them
by the following:—
                Dry orcine. . . . . . . . . . . . C7H8O2
                Crystallized orcine .... C7H8O2+Aq.
These not only agree very well with the analyses of orcine, but also
with those of lecanorine and other crystallizable derivatives.
   MM. Laurent and Gerhardt state that they have lately obtained
with orcine a new derivative, the composition of which confirms the
latter formulae.    This compound is bromorcine, a substance which
crystallizes in fine silky needles, and is easily produced by the action
of bromine on orcine.       The formula of bromorcine is C7H5 B3 O*,
and it consequently represents orcine, in which three equivalents of
hydrogen are replaced by three equivalents of bromine. It is re
markable that potash dissolves it immediately, and becomes of a very
deep violet-brown colour. It was found to contain 23.1 per cent.
of carbon, the authors' formula requiring 23-2. If the proportions
of M. Liebig were supposed to be correct, the authors state that they
must have committed an error of nearly 2 per cent. in the same way
as M. Dumas in his experiments on normal orcine.
   The authors' formulae place orcine in relation with the salicylic
series; they form an isomeric with the saligenine of M. Piria. The
following are the relations which exist, according to MM. Laurent
and Gerhardt, between orcine and its crystallizable derivatives.
    Lecanorine : by ebullition with barytes water, it gives carbonate
 and orcine:—

gives carbonate, orcine and pseuderythrine :

    The alkalies when boiling transform pseuderythrine into carbonate,

    The formulae by which the authors represent lecanorine and pseu
derythrine agree perfectly with the analyses of MM. Schunck, Liebig,
Kane, Rochleder and Heldt.

 on PSEUDog UINA—A NEW ALKALOID.                 BY M. MENGARDUQUE.
    M. Pelouze had in his laboratory an extract of cinchona, the source
 of which was uncertain; he gave it to the author for examination
 as an exercise. This substance was of a deep brown colour, friable,
 very bitter, slightly soluble in water, soluble in acids, which it satu
 rated like the alkaloids, and formed true saline solutions, from which
 water precipitated it as a pitchy mass. This matter, treated by the
 processes for the extraction of quina and cinchonia, did not yield the
 least trace of either of these alkaloids; nor was the cinchovatine of
 M. Manzine met with in it; but the author was so fortunate as to
 discover an alkaloid which he believes to be new, and which he so
 described as to leave no doubt in the mind of M. Pelouze, who wit
 nessed his experiments.                                             -
     This alkaloid differs from the substances by which it is accompa
 nied in the extract, in saturating acids more perfectly, insomuch
 that it expels ammonia from its compounds, like lime or barytes; it
 scarcely dissolves even in boiling aether, and of these properties ad
 vantage was taken in order to effect its separation.
     The extract was boiled with an equal weight of hydrochlorate of
  ammonia till ammonia ceased to be evolved.           On cooling, a very
  abundant brown matter was deposited of a syrupy consistence, upon
  which floated a limpid liquid of a light amber colour. This liquor,
  poured off and filtered, was precipitated by ammonia.
     The product thus obtained was yellowish and flocculent, suscep
  tible of softening, and agglutinating by heat. It was dried and
  treated with cold aether, which dissolved the greater part of it, and
  left a pulverulent white matter, which was the new alkaloid in a state
  of purity.
     This product, thus purified, possessed the following characters:
  subjected to heat on platina foil it fuses, and then burns with a blue
  flame without leaving any residue. It is insoluble in water and in
  sipid, soluble in alcohol, and much more so when hot than cold; its

 alcoholic solution readily crystallizes in irregular prisms; it is soluble
 in the mineral and in organic acids, even diluted; it is insoluble in
 aether.
    Ammonia, potash, and soda precipitate it from its saline solutions;
 water precipitates it from solution in alcohol. Lastly, if it be dis
 solved in aqueous solution of chlorine, and ammonia be added, the
 liquor assumes a reddish-yellow colour. It is well known that quina
 similarly treated yields a green solution.
    Its solution in sulphuric acid may be rendered neutral to litmus
 paper; it is but slightly bitter. By evaporation it yields fine cry
 stals, which are flattened prisms beveled at the summits.
    The solution in hydrochloric acid had all the properties of an hy
 drochlorate, but it could not be made to crystallize.
    By analysis it yielded—

of this substance, and especially from its composition, that it is a new

  PREPARATION OF META-ANTIMONIATE OF POTASH AS A TEST
                                  FOR SODA,
   M. Fremy observes, that since the publication of his first memoir
on the antimoniates, the meta-antimoniate of potash has been ge-,
nerally employed in laboratories as a test of the salts of soda; and
as the preparation of this salt has been found difficult by several
chemists, the author states the following to be the process which he
now employs, and by which he obtains in a few hours nearly two
pounds of meta-antimoniate of potash. . . . . . . .                    ** -
   He begins by acting upon one part of antimony with four parts of .
nitre in a red-hot earthen crucible; insoluble anhydrous antimoniate
of potash is formed, which is washed with cold water to remove the
nitrite and nitrate of potash, an excess of which it usually retains.
   The antimoniate of potash is then boiled for two or three hoursin,
water, in order to convert it into the gummy soluble antimoniate;
water is to be added to supply the loss by evaporation. During,
ebullition the greater part of the antimoniate dissolves, there remain.
ing but a small quantity of bi-antimoniate of potash, which is sepa
rated by the filter,   ...               .        . . . . . . .. . . .
   The solution of the gummy antimoniate of potash is then evapo

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                   325
rated, adding to it several fragments of pure hydrate of potash so as
to render it very caustic. A few drops of the solution are tried from
time to time to see whether on cooling they become crystalline;
and when this takes place the evaporation is to be discontinued, the
meta-antimoniate of potash then crystallizing abundantly; the alka
line solution is to be poured off, and the salt is to be dried on por
celain plates.                                                           -
    This salt always contains an excess of alkali; it ought to be washed
two or three times before it is used as a reagent.               As the meta
antimoniate of potash decomposes in solution in water, it is proper
to keep it in the dry state, and to dissolve it at the moment in which
the trial is to be made.
    To make an examination, which scarcely requires ten minutes,
about fifteen grains of the potash to be tried should be dissolved in
a small quantity of water and supersaturated with hydrochloric acid,
and the solution is to be evaporated to dryness in a porcelain or
platina capsule. The chloride of potassium, being then perfectly
neutral, is redissolved in water and treated with the solution of meta
antimoniate of potash. If the potash contains 2 or 3 per cent. of
soda, a precipitate is almost instantly formed; but if the quantity be
smaller, time and agitation will be necessary to effect precipitation.
    M. Fremy states the sensibility of this reagent to be so great, that
he found by synthetic experiments he could detect a half per cent.
of carbonate of soda in commercial potash.-Ann. de Ch. et de Phys.,
Août 1848.
  soluBILITY OF THE HYDRATEs of copper AND CHRoMIUM,
                      ETC, IN POTASH AND SODA.
    M. Fremy observes, that when hydrate of copper, precipitated from
the sulphate by great excess of potash, is washed and dried in vacuo,
it is represented, according to his analysis, by the formula CuO,
 2HO.     In this state it is perfectly soluble in concentrated solutions
of potash and soda, as stated by Proust, forming solutions of a fine
blue tint, the hydrate of copper thus consequently acting as an acid.
 If these solutions be subjected to ebullition, the hydrated oxide of
copper is decomposed; the oxide, becoming anhydrous, completely
loses its solubility in the alkalies, and precipitates.
    The influence which water appears to exercise on the acidity of
certain hydrates, is shown more remarkably with the sesquioxide of
chromium. If a salt of this oxide be precipitated by potash, and the
precipitate be washed with cold water and then dried in a current
of dry air at common temperatures, a hydrate is obtained which is
totally soluble in the alkalies, forming soluble green salts which have
been properly called chromites. This hydrate is composed of—
                 Hydrated oxide of chromium                0.519
                 Water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0-268

326            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
It contains therefore 51.6 per cent. of water. Representing this
hydrate by Crº O3, 9HO, theory would give 51.4 per cent. of water.
   When a solution of chromite of potash is boiled for a few minutes,
it is decomposed; a green precipitate of sesquioxide of chromium is
formed, which is entirely insoluble in the alkalies. This precipi
tate was by repeatedly washing freed from potash, and yielded by
analysis—
                Hydrated oxide . . . . . . . . . .    0.729
                Water.... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0-360
It contained therefore 49.3 per cent. of water. Representing this
hydrate by the formula Crº O3, 8HO, theory would give 484 per cent.
of water.
   It appears, then, that the elimination of only one equivalent of
water is sufficient to completely modify the hydrate of sesquioxide of
chromium, and to render it insoluble in the alkalies. This hydrate
becomes anhydrous by heating to 266°F.
   This example will suffice to show the influence which water can
exert over the properties of a metallic oxide; since, according to its
proportion, it determines its solubility or non-solubility in the alka
lies; it shows also the difficulties attendant upon the study of hy
 drates. M. Fremy states that he has often seen hydrates lose a cer
tain quantity of their water at common temperatures during washing,
or even by the action of light alone, and thus acquire properties en
tirely new. The instability of certain hydrates may be compared to
that of some metallic peroxides.
    The preceding hydrates are not the only ones which owe their
acid character to the presence of the water which they contain. The
 hydrate of protoxide of tin, which dissolves, as well known, so readily
 in potash and soda to form stannites, loses its solubility in the alka
 lies when it becomes anhydrous.
    The hydrates of the oxides of antimony, zinc and lead, which dis
 solve so readily even in very dilute alkaline solutions, can be dissolved
 by them only when concentrated, if rendered anhydrous.
    It must then be admitted that hydrates often lose their acid cha
 racter on becoming anhydrous. As this modification of the properties
 of a hydrate may be effected at common temperatures, and as it is
 always accompanied with the disengagement of water, it cannot be
 attributed to those isomeric changes which certain oxides undergo
 when they are calcined, and which M. Chevreul has with reason
 compared to the coagulation of albumen, and describes under the
 general denomination of phénomènes de cuisson.
    When a hydrated oxide dissolves in potash or soda, is it to be
 understood that it combines with the base in the state of hydrate to
 form a ternary group composed of water, of base and of acid : In order
 to resolve this question, it is requisite to obtain crystalline compounds
 of the preceding hydrates with alkaline bases, and this M. Fremy
 states he has not yet been able to accomplish.                         -

   evaporate even in vacuo, a period arrives at which the hydrate loses its
   water and precipitates.           The author states that other combinations
N.
   which he has described furnish incontestable proofs of the existence of
   saline groups, which would be impossible without the presence of
   water, and in which the oxide appears to be combined in the state
   of hydrate.—Ann de Ch. et de Phys., Août 1848.

    measuring the Intensity of the Chemical Action of the Rays of
    Light on all the Photographic preparations, and for com
    paring with each other the sensitiveness of these different pre
    parations. Invented by A. CLAUDET, London, September

  W W 7E   are not yet in possession of an instrument capable of
          measuring the variations in intensity of the sun's light
with the same precision that we appreciate those of its heat.
 In photographic operations the want of a photometer has long
 been felt; and it was soon perceived that it was not sufficient
 to measure the light, properly so called, but certain accom
 panying rays, which exert on different bodies a chemical action
 without producing on the retina the sensation by means of
 which objects appear to us visible. All photographers know
 by experience that the chemical action is not exactly in pro
portion to the intensity of the visible light.                    -
    Many ingenious contrivances have been resorted to for in
dicating the intensity of the chemical or actinic rays existing
at a given moment; but as the object was to study more par
ticularly the variations of the direct solar rays, it was found
necessary to have recourse to complicated instruments fur
nished with heliostats and clock-work movements.
    In 1839 Mr. T. B. Jordan of Falmouth invented an instru
ment which he called a heliograph. This instrument was
imperfect. It was modified and improved by Mr. R. Hunt,
who has devoted much time to photographic processes and
researches on the properties of the different rays of light.
    The apparatus of Mr. Hunt, which he called an actino
graph, consists of a cylinder placed parallel to the axis of the

ecliptic, having a triangular opening and turning upon its
axis, following the sun's path, clock-work movement being
used for the purpose.
    The photogenic paper is rolled upon another cylinder placed
in the interior of the first, and turning in a contrary direction:
The sun's rays, passing through the triangular opening, fall
successively upon all that portion of the paper exposed by the
rotation of the exterior cylinder.
    The photogenic effect produced upon the paper is in direct
proportion to the intensity of the light present during the
 motion of the triangular opening, and also in direct proportion
 to the length of the lines parallel to the base of the triangle at
 every part of its opening; so that as the intensity of the light
 increases or diminishes, the commencement of the photogenic
 effect is indicated at a point more or less distant from the
 base. At the end of the day, on removing the paper we find
 a long figure, the height of the ordinates of which is the mea
 sure of the intensity of the chemical action of the light.
    Mr. Hunt described his actinograph at the meeting of the
 British Association at Cambridge in June 1845.
    Sir John Herschel in 1840 constructed an instrument for
 the same purpose.        He places photogenic paper under an
 immoveable disc, having a narrow opening in the direction of
 its radius for the passage of the sun's light reflected by a
 heliostat: this light falls on the paper fixed upon another disc,
 turning on its axis by clock-work.
     At the end of the day every part of the photogenic paper has
 passed this opening, and the effect produced shows theintensity
  of the light during the various hours from sunrise to sunset.
     All these several ingenious contrivances had no other object
  than that of measuring the photogenic intensity of the direct
  rays of the sun during the different hours of the day. Besides,
  they were applicable only to photography on paper; and the
  results were uncertain, because the paper does not long pre
  serve the same degree of sensitiveness: then the heliostats
  and clock-work movements rendered the apparatus compli
  cated, expensive and difficult to use.
     It may then be asserted, that up to the present time there     t
  does not exist an instrument for indicating to the photogra
  pher the intensity of the chemical rays, and at the same time
  the sensitiveness of his preparation.
     I have endeavoured to supply this want, and offer the result
  of my labours in publishing an instrument which, I believe,
  fulfils all the conditions necessary to render it useful, as it
  measures at the same time the intensity of the chemical rays
  and the sensitiveness of the preparation. I have called it a

  Mr. A. Claudet's Description of the Photographometer. 331
photographometer, because it indicates the combined results of
the photographic operation.
    My apparatus is very simple, and serves equally for pro
cesses on paper or on metallic plates.      It indicates the inten
sity of the chemical rays at all moments of the day during
atmospheric variations, and at the instant we may wish to
operate. It serves also to compare the degree of sensitiveness
of the different photographic preparations.
    For an instrument of this kind (see Plate II. fig. 1), it is
important in the first place to have a motion always uniform,
without complicated or expensive mechanism. This I have
obtained by a means founded upon the principle of the fall of
bodies sliding down an inclined plane. The sensitive surface
is exposed to the light by the rapid and uniform passage of a
 metal plate AB, fig. 2, having openings of different lengths
which follow a geometric progression. It is evident that the
exposure to light will be the same for each experiment, be
cause the plate furnished with the proportional openings falls
always with the same rapidity, the height of the fall being
constant, and the angle of the inclined plane the same. Each
opening of this moveable plate allows the light to pass during
 the same space of time, and the effect upon the sensitive sur
face indicates exactly the intensity of the chemical rays. The
 rapidity of the fall may be augmented or diminished by alter
 ing the inclination of the plane by means of a graduated arc
 CD, fig. 1, furnished with a screw E, by which it may be
fixed at any angle. The same result may be obtained by modi
fying the height of the fall or the weight of the moveable plate.
 }he photogenic surface, whether it be the Daguerreotype
plate, the Talbotype paper, or any other preparation sensitive to
light, is placed near the bottom of the inclined plane F, figs. 1&2.
 It is covered by a thin plate of metal pierced with circular holes,
 which correspond to the openings of the moveable plate at the
 moment of the passage of the latter, during which the sensitive
 surface receives the light wherever the circular holes leave it
 exposed.
    The part of the apparatus which contains the sensitive sur
 face is an independent frame, and it slides from a dark box
 into an opening on the side of the inclined plane. The fig. 3
 represents the frame and the dark box, and by its inspection
 the manner will be understood in which the sensitive surface
 is placed in it before the experiment and carried to the mer
 cury-box after the operation.
    A covering of black cloth impermeable to light is attached
 to the sides of the moveable plate enveloping the whole in
 clined plane, rolling freely over two rollers R, R' placed, the

one at the upper and the other at the lower part of the inclined
plane. This cloth prevents the light striking the sensitive
surface before and after the passage of the moveable plate.
    The openings of the moveable plate are parallel to each
other, and in the direction of the inclined plane. They are
 seven in number.      The first is 1 millimetre; the second, 2
millim.; the third, 4 millim.; the fourth, 8 millim.; the fifth,
 16 millim.; the sixth, 32 millim. ; and the seventh, 64 millim.
 Each opening is then the half of the following, and double of
 the preceding one. After the operation we have seven (or
 less, according to the intensity of light) separate images, the
different intensities of which represent the action of the light
during intervals of time in the geometric progression of::1:
 2:4: 8:16:32:64. These numbers are quite sufficient for
general observation; we can multiply the effects by allowing
the plate to fall twice, thrice, or a greater number of times. I
adopted this progression because I found an arithmetic pro
gression did not give an appreciable difference in the intensity
of the photogenic effect, a doubling of the action being required
to produce a marked difference of effect. If we wish to com
pare the photogenic intensity of the sun's rays with those of
the moon, we allow the moveable plate to fall a number of
times sufficient for the moon's rays to produce an action, which
may be rendered apparent by the mercury. A few trials suf
fice to obtain an effect from which may be calculated the pro
portion of the intensities.                               .    . .
    The moveable plate containing the parallel proportionate
openings is furnished with a flap which opens and shuts freely,
and by which the openings may be protected from light when
the plate is to be raised again in order to fall a second time.
    A simple apparatus thus constructed will be a photographo
meter certain for every preparation. It will be an index and
an infallible guide for the operator. It will indicate the in
tensity of the photogenic light, and also the sensitiveness of
the preparation. But it becomes still more useful when con
structed double; that is to say, when the moveable plate is
furnished with two equal series of proportional openings placed
in a line perpendicular to the direction of the inclined plane,
and the fixed plate pierced with two series of holes correspond
ing to the openings in the moveable plate.            , -   .      . .     . .
    By placing beneath each series of holes a different sensitive
surface, each of these surfaces will, during the fall of the
moveable plate, receive the same proportion of the same light,
and thus their different degrees of sensitiveness may be com
pared. In this manner we learn the comparative sensitiveness
of different preparations of the iodide, of the bromo-iodide and

… When we only wish to make experiments of comparison
with different preparations, a much more simple and portable
apparatus will serve as well. In this the plate furnished with
parallel openings is immoveable, and fixed in the centre of a
frame having grooves underneath to keep it in contact with
another frame, in which we place the two sensitive surfaces
we wish to compare. Two plates, having round holes for the
passage of the light, cover the sensitive surfaces, which are
held by a shutter fastened at the back by a button. This part
of the apparatus resembles a Daguerreotype “passe partout,”
with this difference, that in the place of the glass we have a
metallic plate furnished with holes.                                          -
      When the apparatus, has been charged in a room shaded
from the daylight, it is carried out, and the frame containing
the sensitive surfaces is made to slide along by the hand, while
the frame containing the proportional openings is exposed to
the daylight or to the sun. With a little practice, a movement
may be obtained regular enough to measure by this simple
apparatus, with sufficient exactness, the intensity of the light.
      By the double apparatus, whether it has the uniform motion
É.        by the inclined plane, or that less regular given by the
  and, we shall decide a very interesting question; which is, to
know if each variation in the quantity and quality of light affects
equally the different photogenic preparations. We shall find,
perhaps, that certain lights require different preparations or
proportions to obtain the maximum of sensitiveness.
      In place of a single series of round holes upon each plate,
we can have two, three, four or five, which enable us to make
several experiments upon the same surface. On the paper, for
instance, we can prepare a zone for each series of holes with a
different substance; and on the Daguerreotype plate we may
vary the coatings of iodine, bromine or chlorine, so that the
same surface will contain two, three, four, or five experiments
of comparison, serving to indicate the best method of prepa
ration.
      The plate, fig. 4, shows the result of an experiment of this
kind, and is the exact representation of the plate itself after it
has received the mercurial vapour. The plate had been ex
posed to the vapour of iodine in such a manner that one zone
had attained the first coating of yellow colour, a second zone
had reached the red, a .# the blue-green, and the fourth,
after having passed through all these tints, had obtained the

334 Mr. A. Claudet's Description of the Photographometer.
second yellow coating. The number of white circular spots
on each vertical zone indicates the degree of sensitiveness of
these various coatings; the less sensitive being the first coat
ing of yellow, and the most sensitive the second coating of the
same colour, which I call the double coating of iodine.
    Therefore, we have an instrument by which we can de
cide, in an incontestable manner, upon the merits of different
accelerating liquids used in the Daguerreotype, resolve a great
number of problems, and make experiments, from which will
infallibly result the simplification and improvement of the art
 of photography, which up to the present time has suffered too
 much from empiricism and charlatanism.
    Appended to this description are a drawing of the apparatus,
 and the plans necessary to explain its action and construction.
 (See Plate II.)
    I am still engaged in making experiments with this appa
 ratus; as soon as they are completed I shall hasten to com
 municate the result of my labours. I content myself for the
 present with announcing a very extraordinary fact which my
 apparatus has furnished me with.
    I do not give it as the result of a calculation mathematically
 correct; but I cannot be far from the truth in stating, that
 the pure light of the sun modifies the bromo-iodized silver
 plate, communicating to it an affinity for mercurial vapour
 which produces the white image in the Daguerreotype, in a
 space of time which cannot be much more than the thousandth
 part of a second. I made the experiment in the following
 manner:—I let the light of the sun fall upon the plate through
 an opening of a millimetre, whilst this opening passed over a
 space of 250 millimetres in one quarter of a second, as near as
 I could judge; this light could not therefore have acted on the
 plate during much more than the rºodth part of a second,
 and nevertheless this inconceivably short space of time suf
 ficed to produce a decided effect.
    It is not necessary that I should indicate all the applica
 tions of this photographometer, and the experiments which
 may be made with it. Without doubt many will be discovered
 which have not occurred to me; but I will enumerate a few
 which appear to me important enough to merit the attention
 of philosophers:–What is the effect of the compound light,
 and that of the different separated rays of the solar spectrum?
  How much photogenic light is lost by reflexion from parallel
 mirrors, prisms and other substances, and by refraction
 through lenses? The proportion of photogenic rays in the
 lights obtained from various sources, including that produced
 by electricity ? If the photogenic light varies with the height
 of the atmosphere and with the changes of temperature? If

 it is affected by the electrical state of the atmosphere? In fine,
 what is the proportion of the photogenic rays at each hour of
 the day, and at different points in space at a given moment?

THE         following method of showing the applicability of the
         theorem of Leibnitz to successive integration, though
new to me, may possibly be found in some works on the inte
gral calculus which I have not seen. I venture however to
give it here, chiefly because it suggests a consideration, in
reference to the “ &l. of Operations,” which is perhaps
deserving of notice.

      On the Absence of any Traces of the fall of Aérolites. 337
      The theorem here considered is usually treated by the
  “Calculus of Operations,” a method which has deservedly
  received much attention of late. The employment of this
  refined principle of investigation requires, however, more than
  ordinary caution and circumspection : among other things it
  must be observed, that the theorems to which it leads cannot
  be generally true when they assume the form of series, whose
  character is such that, when the symbols of operation are re
  placed by those of quantity, divergency takes place. The
  present short paper illustrates this: the calculus of operations
  gives the theorem here discussed under the form (A.), and
  makes no provision for the important correction (B.).

  IN no science have the results of a          close adherence to the
       sound principles of inductive reasoning been more striking
  than in geology during the last fifty years. So long as the
  mind was allowed to ramble unrestrained in the field of spe
  culation, hypothesis supplied the place of facts; and the vision
  occasionally obtained of truth was like that of a dreamer, so
  confused and distorted as no longer to resemble any distinct
  reality; but when geologists abandoned this         P".      of an airy
  image, and began to 'search cautiously and laboriously for
  facts as the only sure basis on which any system of human
  knowledge could be founded, a new aera commenced, and
  a science has now been established which in beauty, interest
  and utility, is second to none. To this great end the work
  of Mr. Lyell, Principles of Geology, most powerfully con
  tributed, by its advocacy in the strongest and most uncom
s
  promising manner, of the advantage of 'seeking only in exist
  ing causes (that is, in forces still in action) an explanation of
  past as well as of present phaenomena. It is thus that not

338    Lieut.-Colonel Portlock on the Absence of any Traces
logist is now familiarized with the fact that sea and land ex
isted contemporaneously even at the period of the now meta
morphic schists, and at each succeeding geological epoch, and
is accustomed to strip off, as it were, the accumulations of
more recent deposits, in order to study the condition of the
earth's surface at a period antecedent to them. Whilst, how
ever, we thus rightly and wisely adhere to the system of reason
ing from those facts which we are enabled to study and esti
mate in all their bearings, we must not forget that there are
also facts which we can only partially study and imperfectly
estimate: for example, astronomy gives us strong reasons for
believing that it is more than probable that whilst some sidereal
and planetary systems may be coming into existence others are
passing away even at the present moment, and that an exact
balance in the universe has not been yet attained. It teaches
us, therefore, that we cannot always measure the possible ex
tent of action of any given force by the effects it exhibits at any
one period, and that interfering or co-operating causes may
often tend to diminish or to augment its energy. I have been
led to make these remarks by the acceidentally simultaneous
notice of the two subjects of this article, at the Geological Sec
tion of the British Association at Swansea; the first by the
Marquis of Northampton, in describing some recently fallen
aérolites, and the second by the Dean of Westminster, in again
bringing forward his discovery of the traces of ancient glaciers
in the Snowdonian chain of North Wales. It had been long
familiar to my mind that geological investigation had hitherto
discovered no traces either of the fall of acrolites or of glacial
action in the ancient strata of the earth's surface, and I there
fore made a few observations on the papers read, with a view
to direct the general attention of geologists to the fact, or to
draw from them any statements of observations tending to in
validate the conclusion, and to carry back to past systems
those remarkable phaenomena of the present. It appeared to
me that none of the eminent geologists present were prepared
to doubt the accuracy of my conclusion, so far as it depends
on facts hitherto observed; but there seemed to be an impres
sion that the number of falling acrolites is even now so small,
that the chances of meeting with them are few, and that such
chances must be still rarer in the examination of ancient strata.
This opinion I do not consider to be well-founded, as it must
be remembered that the study of these interesting bodies is com
paratively recent, and that there is now every reason to believe
that the number falling is very considerable, though from
many natural circumstances a large portion of them may fall
unobserved; and so far from the chances of observation being
fewer in the examination of the ancient strata, I consider the

                      of the fall of Aérolites.              339
probability of finding such bodies (had they fallen) in the
numerous quarries opened in all parts of the world, and in
the natural sections examined by so many geologists, much
greater than when they are sought for on the present surface,
obscured as it is by vegetation, or occupied by tillage. When
I made the remark as regards the aérolites, I thought it ori
ginal; but a note to Humboldt's Kosmos has shown me that
the illustrious Olbers had made it before me, and I am even
more gratified by finding that I had thus unconsciously drop
ped into the same train of thought with that acute philosopher.
The passage occurs in his paper on falling stars in Schuma
cher's Jahrbuch for 1838; and as it is one of great interest, I
shall extract it at length from the original, and not from the
abbreviation by Humboldt.
   “Finally, I may be permitted to mention a circumstance
which has not hitherto, so far as I know, been taken into con
sideration by any one, and respecting which I would gladly
learn the opinions of well-informed philosophers and be in
structed by them. It is this, that neither fossil meteorite
nor fossil meteoric iron has as yet been found. May we not,
nay, must we not conclude from this fact, that before the
last modification of the surface of our earth no meteorites had
ever fallen upon it? Would they not indeed be somewhat
frequently found in the secondary and tertiary strata if they
had been projected downwards on the earth for thousands
of years previously, when in the present time several hundreds
of such falls of stones take place yearly? And although such
aérolites may not have retained so perfectly their original form
as the shells of mollusca and the bones and teeth of saurians
and of other vertebrata, yet must they have continued suffi
ciently recognizable. I must confess that this fact appears to
me of great importance as regards geology and cosmology,
and deserves especial consideration in any inquiry into the
nature, formation, and source of aerolites.”
    Such, then, is the opinion of Olbers; and though it is stated
in a note to his paper that some fragments of aerolites had, by
long exposure to moisture whilst imbedded in damp earth,
been totally decomposed and reduced to a gray-looking sub
stance mixed with peroxide of iron, it must be remembered
 that many shells and other organic bodies have been also
 destroyed and removed by decomposition, and that the total
absence of acrolites in the ancient strata cannot therefore be
 accounted for by so partial a cause. Humboldt quotes two
 examples of bodies supposed to have been aérolites; but it
 does not appear from his statement whether they were found
 in gravel, or whether there was any proof that they had been
previously imbedded in rocks; and I think, therefore, it must

be admitted, that as yet there is no satisfactory proof of the
fall of acrolites on the earth's surface prior to its last modifica
tion, or to the glacial period.        •  ** * *       -       ... ',
   Let us now refer to my second subject, namely, the absence
of any traces of glacial action in the ancient strata. Here it
is only necessary to observe, that one effect of glacial action,
º,        the transport of large angular fragments of rock by
floating ice, is still exhibited to us by the regular progression
of large masses of polar ice loaded with fragments of rocks
from the arctic towards the tropical regions; and there cannot
be a doubt that many such blocks of large size must be every
year dropped by the melting ice on the bottom of the ocean.
From the greater extension of glaciers, which also still exist on
the mountains, in the epoch preceding the present, it has been
reasonably inferred that all glacial phaenomena were in like
manner more extended; and a sufficient cause has been thus
acquired, in the floating ice of that epoch, for the production;
the effects exhibited in many of our gravel beds, and in the
remarkable phaenomenon of the huge angular erratics scattered
over the surface, irrespectively of the nature of the rock on
which they rest. But when we pass this boundary, our evi
dence fails us; and although in the vicinity of a basaltic flow
lumps of that subaqueous lava may be occasionally found im
bedded in the strata close to it, or at the very base of the cliff
where it was forming, some large fragments of rock may be
found in a sandstone or conglomerate; the general character
of the secondary formations is not such as to warrant us in
concluding that ice had co-operated in their production, whilst
the absence of ‘erratics’ or large angular blocks in such for
mations is a strong negative proof that ice did not then exist.
Is not then this curious negative fact a remarkable confirma
tion of the positive evidence afforded by organic remains, that
prior to the glacial period the whole earth enjoyed a tempe
rature in some measure assimilated to that of its now tropical
regions? It is true that in the more recent tertiary formations
there is an approximation to the now existing conditions as
to temperature; but it was only an approximation, and widely
different in degree from that extraordinary state of depressed
temperature which followed in the glacial period. It may then
                                                                      .
be asked, can the extraordinary change which produced the
glacial period be explained or its cause assigned? and, in like
manner, can the resumption of a comparatively genial tempe
rature by the earth's surface be explained? Few philosophers,
I believe, are satisfied by the explanation, howeveringenious,
 of such changes, as given by Mr. Lyell, having been produced
 by alterations of the relative position of sea and land; and most
philosophers look beyond the globe, and seek in great astrono

mical causes, that is in general physical causes, for its explana
tion. It is not, however, my intention to enter rashly on any
such speculation, though I think myself justified in at least
drawing attention to the simultaneity of the two great phae
nomena here alluded to, namely, the first fall of acrolites and
the commencement of glacial action, leaving it to astronomers
to decide how far it is possible, under the present most generally
received theory of acrolites, as being either condensed nebulous
matter, or planetary fragments moving regularly in an orbit,
that either the one may have been the cause of the other, or
both the effects of some one great common cause.

  THE object in view in commencing the series of analyses
-      given below, was to ascertain if a standard could be
formed of the nutritive powers of the ales and porters in ge
neral use, in order that a correct estimate of their real value
as an article of diet might be deduced.                - *          * * *
    The analyses show, as might have been expected, a very
great variety in the amount of their respective constituents,
partly arising from the various modifications each brewer finds
himself under the necessity of adopting, from local circum
stances over which he has no control, or from personal ex
perience, though the main steps of the process are essentially
the same throughout... ', " ' "
    The ash consists of that portion of the grain, and other sub
stances employed in the process, which is soluble in water;
whilst owing to the various proportions of malt and water
employed, to the length of time the infusion is continued, to
the temperature at which the infusion is made, to the con
centration the liquor undergoes in the boiling to which it is
subsequently subjected, and to the process of fermentation,
the proportional amount of the constituents varies considerably.
   The method given by Fresenius and Will for the analysis
of Ash was that followed in the present instance. The amount
of iron has been omitted, as in most of the cases it was alto
gether wanting; and in the few instances in which it did occur,
it was so minute as to be inappreciable, and apparently was
only an accidental impurity.' " ' ' ' ' ' ". . .

LIII. On the Apparent Motion of the Figures in certain Pat
  terns of Blue and Red Worsted. By HENRY TAYLoR, Esq.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,                                 Guildford, Oct. 12, 1848.
THE           apparent motion of the figures in certain patterns of
       blue and red worsted is sufficiently well-known to have
excited some attention among the learned as well as the un
learned, but, so far as I know, without receiving any satisfac
tory explanation. After having examined the subject for some
time, I believe I have succeeded in making out the cause of
this singular phaenomenon; and if the following observations
are deemed of sufficient importance, I should be glad to have
them inserted in the pages of your Journal.             *
   If certain patterns of blue and red worsted-work are ex
amined by candle-light, it is found that when they are moved
about, the figures have a tremulous appearance as if they were
moving faster than the ground of the pattern—and blue and
red are the only colours exhibiting this remarkable property
—although it must be observed that some persons are so con

 846 Mr. H. Taylor on the Apparent Motion of the Figures
    The usual patterns consist of blue and red figures on a
ground of the opposite colour, several of them being arranged
together on the same piece; but for the purpose of experiment,
 it is better to have patterns of the simplest kind, and I shall
 suppose them now to consist of single spots, of red on a blue
ground and blue on a red ground.                               -
    If the pattern is moved up and down before the eye, and
attention is directed to the red spot, we may observe a change
of colour taking place at its edge, like a dark border or shadow
flitting from one side to the other. On close examination, it
 will be found that as the pattern is moved upward, this dark
 border appears only at the upper edge of the spot, and but
for an instant; as the pattern descends, it is seen again at the
lower edge, vanishing as before. When the movement is
made from side to side, instead of up and down, a similar ap
pearance may be seen on the right and left of the spot.
    If the blue spot is now examined in the same manner, it
will present an appearance somewhat different, the borders
that form on its edge being of a lighter colour than the rest
of the spot, and having the effect of lights instead of shadows,
as in the former instance.
    These changes of tint are so momentary, that they require
very close attention in order to be seen at all; and the best
way of discovering them is to hold the pattern at some distance
from the lamp or candle, moving it at first rather slowly. I
have described these appearances thus minutely because they
serve, according to my observation, to produce the illusion in
question: in them lies the whole mystery.
    I conceive that the light and dark borders in the two figures
have the same effect on the mind of the observer as the ordi
nary light and shadow seen on any prominent object that is
illuminated from one side; and if such an object could be
presented to our view with its light and shade shifting rapidly
from one side of it to the other, though without its being
moved, I believe we should have an impression that the object
really was moving, because we know from experience that
such an effect is only to be produced by shifting the position
of the candle, or of the object illuminated by it”.
    And so it is with the worsted patterns. When we see these
spots with their light and dark borders shifting from side to
   * I have often convinced myself of the truth of this by a simple experi
ment. Some prominent body, as a white ball or cylinder, is suspended
before an observer seated with his back to a table, on which two lighted
candles are placed at some distance apart. By covering up each candle
alternately, the light and shadow on the object may be reversed; and if
 . is done rapidly, it will give it the appearance of moving from side to
Slde,                                                                 -

          in certain Patterns of Blue and Red Worsted.        347
 side, we are led to infer that, as the lamp or candle is station
 ary, the spots themselves actually shift their position, and
 move faster than the ground of the pattern. Such at least is
 the illusion; and in some instances the spots will even appear
 like protuberant bodies rolling from side to side.
    In order to prove that this change of tint at the edges of
 the figures is an efficient cause of the illusion, I prepared a
 small instrument on this principle. A blue and a red spot
 were affixed to a white card in such a manner that moveable
 shadows might be introduced behind them, which were made
to slide from side to side in imitation of the borders of the
worsted spots, and to persons not acquainted with the nature
of the contrivance the effect was the same, the coloured spots
appeared to move when their shadows only were being moved.
   On the other hand, when the formation of the light and
dark borders is prevented, as may be done by inserting a row
of white stitches round each of the spots, so as to separate the
two colours, then the illusion ceases—the figures are no longer
seen to move. The reason of this is obvious, that the pre
sence of the white stitches is an obstacle to the blending of
the colours on which the light and dark borders depend for
their production. The difference of tint in the two cases may
require some further explanation,--why the red spot has a
dark border, and the blue a light one. The apparent blend
ing of colours in a state of rapid motion is generally accounted
for by the physiological fact, that the eye retains impressions
for an appreciable time after the objects themselves are with
drawn from view; and when a number of objects are presented
to the eye in quick succession, the image left on the retina by
one object is liable to be confused by that of the succeeding
object; and when these are of different colours, a compound
colour is perceived which is intermediate between the two;
but as the spectrum left by the first object is fainter than the
image of that which is actually present, it follows that the
colour of the latter will always predominate. Hence in the
blending of the two colours which takes place at the junction
of the spot and the ground of the pattern, the resulting tints
are different in each case; for the red spot it is purple,
that is, the margin of the red spot is seen through a blue
spectrum, that of the ground,-while the border of the blue
spot appears of a lavender tint, the blue being seen through
the spectrum of the red ground. From experiments made
with glass of different colours, I venture to suggest this as the
probable explanation; for I find that red becomes darker by
being seen through a medium of light blue, while the blue is
rendered lighter by the aid of a red glass.
                              2A2

348         Mr. H. Taylor on an Optical Illusion.
   These effects are not to be confounded with the phaenomenon
of “accidental colours,” in which the spectrum of an object is
of the opposite or complementary colour, these colours being
produced only when the eye has been exerted upon an object
for some considerable time; and, moreover, the complementary
colours of blue and red are not perceived at all in these expe
riments. I mention this distinction, because an attempt has
been made to explain the apparent motion of these figures by
a reference to the theory of accidental colours.
   It remains to be shown why blue and red are the only
colours to exhibit this peculiarity. The only suggestion I
have to make is, that the intermediate tints formed by the
admixture of blue and red contrast strongly with both of the
original colours, so as to produce the required effects of light
and shade; and certainly both purple and lavender form de
cided contrasts with blue and red.       And this is not the case
with any other combination of the primary colours. For ex
ample, the orange tints produced by blending red and yellow
contrast too feebly with either of these colours for any effect
of light or shade, and the same objection applies to blue and
yellow.                                                             g
   Finally, why is the illusion seen only by artificial light?
Not from the blue being seen as green (because some degree
of motion is observable in blue and red patterns by daylight
if they are examined in obscure corners), but from the indi
stinctness of artificial light as compared with solar light; for it
will be found that if the colours are held close to a lamp or
candle so as to be strongly illuminated, the effect is destroyed;
and, on the contrary, it becomes most striking in indistinct
lights, as when the patterns are held under cover of the table
on which the lamp stands, the shadows on the red spot then
become exceedingly dark, while the light tints on the blue
spot have almost a phosphorescent appearance. For the same
reason, when the pattern is viewed indirectly, the effect is
better than when the eye is directed full upon it; and in pat
terns composed of several spots or figures on their appropriate
ground, it is remarked that the apparent motion is greatest in
those parts on which the eye is not directed point blank, be
cause our vision is then indistinct.
    In connexion with this subject, I may mention another phae
nomenon equally curious and perplexing, to be observed with
these same patterns. The blue spot, when viewed indirectly,
always appears lighter than it really is; and when the eye
turns full upon it, it resumes its proper colour with a kind of
start: the red spot again appears much darker by indirect
vision, and becomes as suddenly light again when the eye is

Mr. G. G. Stokes on a difficulty in the Theory of Sound, 349 .
directed straight towards it. There is no doubt that these
changes of tint serve to heighten the illusion of apparent mo
tion when the eye is allowed to wander over the different parts
of a complicated pattern. This phaenomenon may perhaps be
explained by the fact of the sight being most perfect in the
axis of vision, or, as Sir David Brewster has expressed it,
“the eye has the power of seeing objects with perfect distinct
mess only when it is directed straight upon them, so that all
objects seen indirectly are seen indistinctly;” and it may be
supposed that impressions received in those parts of the retina
used in oblique vision are, as it were, diffused. Thus the red
and blue spots, when viewed indirectly, appear tinged with
the prevailing colour of the ground of the pattern,-the red
spot becoming darker by the influence of the blue round it,
and the blue spot lighter by the vicinity of the red; for it is
remarkable that this illusion is not produced with single colours,
only with spots of one colour surrounded by a field of the
other.
    In concluding these observations, I have only to add, that
there cannot be much doubt of the correctness of the view
which ascribes the illusory appearance of motion to the change
of tint at the edges of the figures. These are matters of fact:
but whether the theories offered in explanation of these facts
are correct or not, I must leave to more competent observers
to determine.
            I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
                                         Yours faithfully,

 LIV. On a difficulty in the Theory of Sound. By G. G.
    Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge*.
 THE theoretical determination of the velocity of sound has
        recently been the occasion of a discussion between Pro
 fessor Challis and the Astronomer Royal. It is not my inten
 tion to enter into the controversy, but merely to consider a
 very remarkable difficulty which Professor Challis has noticed
 in connexion with a known first integral of the accurate equa
 tions of motion for the case of plane waves.
     I would first however observe, that I do not think that we
 are obliged, in treating the subject to a first approximation, to
 enter into the consideration of any difficulty which may arise
 when we come to employ exact equations. In neglecting the
  squares of small quantities, we adopt a consistent system of
  approximation, and we arrive at a precise result, namely, the
                     * Communicated by the Author.

  laws which the actual motion tends indefinitely to obey when
  the magnitude of the velocity is indefinitely diminished. And
  if, moreover, we have every reason to believe that the first
  order of small quantities contains all that are sensible in prac
  tical cases, we have arrived, not merely at abstract mathema
  tical results, but at important physical laws. Nevertheless it
  will be admitted on all hands, that any apparent contradiction
  arrived at by employing exact equations is deserving of serious
  consideration.
      The difficulty already alluded to is to be found at º 496
  of the preceding volume of this Magazine. In what follows
  I shall use Professor Challis's notation.
      Without entering into the consideration of the mode in
  which Poisson obtained the particular integral
                         w=f{z-(a +w)t}, . . . . . (1.)
  it may be easily shown, by actual differentiation and substitu
  tion, that the integral does satisfy our equations. The func
  tion f being arbitrary, we may assign to it any form we please,
  as representing a particular possible motion, and may employ
  the result, so long as no step tacitly assumed in the course of our
 reasoning fails. The interpretation of the integral (1.) will
 be rendered more easy by the consideration of a curve. In
 fig. 1 let oz be the axis of z, and let the ordinates of the curve
 represent the values of w for t=0. The equation (1.) merely

 asserts that whatever value the velocity w may have at any
particular point when t=0, the same value will it have at the
 time t at a point in advance of the former by the space (a+w)t.
 Take any point P in the curve of fig. 1, and from it draw, in
the positive direction, the right line PP, parallel to the axis
9f 3 and equal to (a +w)t. The locus of all the points P will
be the velocity-curve for the time t. This curve is represented
infig.2, except that the displacement at common to all points of
the original curve is omitted, in order that the modification in
theform of the curve maybe more easily perceived. This comes
tº the same thing as drawing PP equal towt instead of (al-w).
Qf course in this way P will lie on the positive or negative
side of P, according as P lies above or below the axis of 2.
It is evident that in the neighbourhood of the points a, c the

  curve becomes more and more steep as t increases, while in
  the neighbourhood of the points o, b, z its inclination becomes
  more and more gentle.
     The same result may easily be obtained mathematically.
  In fig. 1, take two points, infinitely close to each other, whose
  abscissae are z and 2+dz; the ordinates will be w and
                                    dw
                               w-H  d's dz.
  After the time t these same ordinates will belong to points
  whose abscissae will have become (in fig. 2) 2+wi and
                                      dw
                        2 + dz-H  (*4 dz. de).
  Hence the horizontal distance between the points, which was
  dz, will have become
                                   dw
                             (1+ #) is:   -  - - - -      -         dw
  and therefore the tangent of the inclination, which was #,        dz
  will have become

     At those points of the original curve at which the tangent

  denominator of the expression (A.) increases with t, and there

  mation of the differential equations of motion with which we
  start, tacitly supposes that we have to deal with finite and con
  tinuous functions; and therefore in the case under considera
  tion we must not, without limitation, push our results beyond
  the least value of t which renders (A.) infinite. This value is
  evidently the reciprocal, taken positively, of the greatest ne

   Of course, after the instant at which the expression (A.)
becomes infinite, some motion or other will go on, and we
might wish to know what the nature of that motion was. Per
haps the most natural supposition to make for trial is, that a
surface of discontinuity is formed, in passing across which there
is an abrupt change of density and velocity. The existence,
of such a surface will presently be shown to be possible, on
the two suppositions that the pressure is equal in all directions
about the same point, and that it varies as i. density. ... I have
however convinced myself, by a train of reasoning which I do            *
not think it worth while to give, inasmuch as the result is
merely negative, that even on the supposition of the existence
of a surface of discontinuity, it is not possible to satisfy all the
conditions of the problem by means of a single function of the
form f{2–(a+w)t}. Apparently, something like reflexion
must take place. Be that as it may, it is evident that the
change which now takes place in the nature of the motion,
beginning with the particle (or rather plane of particles) for

Mr. G. G. Stokes on a difficulty in the Theory of Sound. 353
which (A.) first becomes infinite, cannot influence a particle at
a finite distance from the former until after the expiration of
a finite time. Consequently, even after the change in the
nature of the motion, our original expressions are applicable,
at least for a certain time, to a certain portion of the fluid. It
was for this reason that I inserted the words “without limita
tion,” in saying that we are not at liberty to use our original
results without, limitation beyond a certain value of t. The
full discussion of the motion which would take place after the
change above alluded to, if possible at all, would probably
require more pains than the result would be worth.
. I proceed now to consider the possibility of the existence
of a surface of discontinuity, and the conditions which must
be satisfied at such a surface. Although I was led to the
subject by considering the interpretation of the integral (1.),
the consideration of a discontinuous motion is not here intro
duced in connexion with that interpretation, but simply for its
own sake; and I wish the two subjects to be considered as
quite distinct.             &            -
     Suppose that in passing across a point Q in the axis of &
 the velocity and density change suddenly from w, p to w, p',
and let 8 be the velocity of propagation of the surface of dis
continuity. "Let us' first investigate the equation which ex
presses that there, is no generation or destruction of mass at
 the surface of discontinuity, the equation in fact which takes
 the place of the equation of continuity, which has to be satisfied
elsewhere.
     Take two points A, B in the axis of z, the first on the ne
gative and the second on the positive side of Q, and let QA=h,
 QB=h'. Take also QQ'-8dt, so that Q is the point where
 the surface of discontinuity cuts the axis of z at the time t +dt.
 The quantities <U+017F>h, h' are supposed to be very small, and will
 be made to vanish after QQ'. Consider the portion of space
 comprised within a cylinder whose ends consist of two planes,
 of area unity, drawn through the points A, B perpendicular
 to the axis. i. In the time dt, the mass of fluid which flows in
 at the plane A is ultimately pºdt, and that which flows out at
 the plane B is ultimately p'w'dt. Hence the gain of mass
 within the cylinder is ultimately (pw—p'w')dt. Now the mass
 atoil,the<U+017F>ºtime t is ultimately ph+p'h', and<U+017F> that at the time t + dt is

                       (w'—w)°pp'-a”(p-p')*,     . . . . (4.)
an equation which we may if we please employ instead of (3.).
   The equations (2), (3.) being satisfied, it appears that the
discontinuous motion is dynamically possible. This result,
however, is so strange, that it may be well to consider more
in detail the simplest possible case of such a motion.
   Conceive then an infinitely long straight tube filled with air,
of which the portion to the left of a certain section s is of a
uniform density p, and at rest, while the portion to the right
is of a uniform smaller density p', and is moving in the positive
direction with a uniform velocity w<U+017F>, the surface of separation
s at the same time travelling backwards into the first portion
with the uniform velocity 8. The conception of such a motion
having been formed, consider next whether the motion is
possible or impossible; that is to say, not whether it is pos
sible or impossible in the actual state of elastic fluids, but
whether it would or would not be consistent with dynamical
principles in the case of an ideal elastic fluid, in which the
pressure was equal in all directions about the same point, and
varied as the density.
   In the case under consideration, the fluid to the left of s is
in equilibrium in the simplest way. The fluid to the right is
of uniform pressure, and there is no generation or destruction
of velocity. The only question, then, can be as to the possi
bility of the passage from the one state into the other taking
place in the way supposed. In the first place, it is evident
that, independently of any consideration of force, there must
be a relation between p, p", w, and 8; for a length 8 t of con

 Mr. G. G. Stokes on a difficulty in the Theory of Sound. 355
 densed air comes to occupy, in the rarefied state, a length
 (8+w')t, so that we must have po =p'(8 +w'). Next, if we
 take two sections six s, the first to the left and the second to
 the right of s, and suppose the first to remain at rest, with the
 fluid in which it is situated, while the second moves, along
 with the fluid in which it is situated, with the velocity w, since
 the pressure on s, exceeds that on s, by a”(p-p'), the surface
 of s, or s, being for simplicity's sake supposed equal to unity,
 there must in the time t be generated a momentum a”(p-p')t
 in the fluid lying between s, and sg. But this will be the case
 in consequence of the velocity w being communicated to a
 volume 8t of air which was previously at rest and of density p,
while the state of rest or motion of the remainder of the air
between s, and so has been unaltered, provided a”(p-p')=w'8p.
These two relations being satisfied, it appears that the motion
is dynamically possible. The two equations might have been
obtained at once from (2.) and (3.) by writing — 8 for 8 and
putting was 0, but I have preferred deducing them afresh from
first principles in consequence of the novelty of the subject,
and the reluctance with which the conclusions that I have
arrived at are likely to be received by mathematicians.
    These conclusions certainly seem sufficiently startling; yet
a result still more extraordinary remains behind. . By solving

the rate at which the condensed air (which remains packed
like the combustible matter in a rocket) is discharged decreases
indefinitely as the space into which the discharge takes place
approaches indefinitely to a vacuum. Of course the velocity
of discharge becomes infinite, without which the requisite mo
mentum could not be furnished. The quantity of air which
passes in a unit of time across a plane, of area unity, taken at
the positive side of the tube, is wo', which is easily seen to be
a maximum, for a given value of p, when p'-#p.
    A similar paradox is fully considered by MM. Barré de
   * It is worthy of remark, that when p' is very nearly equal to p, and
consequently w! very small, the velocity of propagation 8 is very nearly
equal to a, to which it approaches indefinitely when w' is indefinitely dimi
nished. Thus even this discontinuous motion offers no exception to the
theorem, at once proved by neglecting the squares of small quantities, that
in very small motions any disturbance is propagated in the fluid with the
velocity a.

de l’Ecole Polytechnique.                                         -
   The strange results at which I have arrived appear to be
fairly deducible from the two hypotheses already mentioned.
It does not follow that the discontinuous motion considered
can ever take place in nature, for we have all along been rea
soning on an ideal elastic fluid which does not exist in nature.
In the first place, it is not true that the pressure varies as the
density, in consequence of the heat and cold produced by con
densation and rarefaction respectively. But it will be easily
seen that the discontinuous motion remains possible when we
take account of the variation of temperature due to condensa
tion and rarefaction, neglecting, however, the communication
of heat from one part of the fluid to another. Indeed, so far
as the possibility of discontinuity is concerned, it is immaterial
according to what law the pressure may increase with the
density.
   Of course the communication of heat from one particle of
the fluid to another would affect the result, though whether
to the extent of preventing the possibility of discontinuity I
am unable to say. But there is another supposition that we
have made which is at variance with the actual state of elastic
fluids. It is not true that one portion of an elastic fluid is
incapable of exerting any tangential force on another portion
on which it slides, even though the variation of velocity from
the one portion to the other be not abrupt but continuous.
In consequence of this tangential force, analogous in some
respects to friction in the case of solids, the mutual pressure
of two adjacent elements of a fluid is not accurately normal to
the surface of separation, nor equal in all directions about the
same point. In many cases the influence of this internal fric
tion is insensible, while in other cases it is very important.
Its general effect is to check the relative motion of the parts
of a fluid. Suppose now that a surface of discontinuity is very
nearly formed, that is to say, that in the neighbourhood of a
certain surface there is a very rapid change of density and
velocity. It may be easily shown, that in such a case the
rapid condensation or rarefaction implies a rapid sliding mo
tion of the fluid ; and this rapid sliding motion would call into
play a considerable tangential force, the effect of which would
be to check the relative motion of the parts of the fluid. It
appears, then, almost certain that the internal friction would
effectually prevent the formation of a surface of discontinuity,
and even render the motion continuous again if it were for an
instant discontinuous.

      LV. On the Spontaneous Cohesion of the Particles of
           Alumina. By Richard PHILLIPs, F.R.S.*
IT      has been observed by M. Wittstein (Chemical Gazette,
      April 1847), that the precipitate which is obtained from
the persulphate or perchloride of iron, ifkept for a great length
of time in water, loses almost entirely the property of being
soluble in acetic acid.      This statement recalled an observation
which I made several years since with respect to the similar
cohering power of alumina; the two cases differing, however,
in these respects, that whereas the sesquioxide of iron requires
one or probably two years for the production of the effect,
alumina undergoes the change partially in a very short time:
the precipitated alumina does not, however, assume a crystal
line appearance, as stated by M. Wittstein to be the case with
the cohering sesquioxide of iron.
   It is well known, both with respect to recently precipitated
sesquioxide of iron and alumina, that they are soluble even in
acetic acid, and consequently in the more powerful acids; but
if the precipitated alumina be kept for two days even moist,
and in contact with the solution from which it was precipitated,
I find that sulphuric acid does not immediately dissolve it.
   The following experiment will perhaps elucidate the fact
which I have now stated: I precipitated the alumina from a
large quantity of alum by excess of ammonia, and after keep
ing it moist for fourteen days, I washed it to get rid of the
excess of ammonia and the salts existing in solution; to a
quantity of this precipitated alumina I added dilute sulphuric
acid in excess, and almost immediately separated by the filter
the insoluble from the dissolved portion; the latter, being
washed and ignited, weighed twenty and a half grains. The
sulphuric solution of the soluble portion was decomposed by
ammonia, and weighed, after washing and igniting, eight
grains; so that in about a fortnight, nearly 72 per cent. of the
particles of the alumina had so cohered as to resist the im
mediate chemical action of the sulphuric acid. I did not tr
 whether solution would have been effected by long cold digestion
 in this case, but I have observed that time greatly increases the
 solvent power of the acid; I found, however, in the present
 instance, that the alumina which cold dilute acid would not im
 mediately dissolve was entirely soluble in it when boiling; but
 if my recollection serves, I have found that, by long keeping,
  ºlumine has become insoluble even in boiling sulphuric
 aClCl.
     When, however, a solution of alum is           decomposed by the
    * Read before the British Association held at Swansea, August 9, 1848,
 and communicated by the Author.

—r
 358      Mr. R. Phillips on the Spontaneous Cohesion of
 carbonate of soda or the sesquicarbonate of ammonia, the
 result as to the solubility of the precipitated alumina is totally
 different; the precipitate in the latter case is more dense, and
 instead of being semitransparent and gelatinous, it is opake
and pulverulent, these differences evidently denoting some
 variation of constitution. Accordingly, I find that whatever
 may have been the length of time which I have kept this pre
cipitate moist, I have always found it totally and immediately
soluble in cold dilute sulphuric acid.
    If it were not almost universally admitted that carbonic acid
does not combine with alumina, the most obvious conclusion          º
to arrive at would be that carbonate of alumina is actually
formed, and that the carbonic acid preventing the cohesion
of the particles of alumina, it remained soluble in acid.
    I shall now, however, state some experiments which seem
 to me to prove that carbonate of alumina may be formed. I
 precipitated 200 grains of alum by excess of sesquicarbonate
of ammonia, and washed the precipitate long after it ceased to
render the water alkaline. After the alumina had been pre-             |
cipitated about fourteen days, I dissolved it in a counterpoised
vessel in dilute sulphuric acid : solution took place with effer
vescence, and twenty grains of carbonic acid gas were evolved.
It follows therefore, I think, that carbonate of alumina was
formed, and that the carbonic acid interposed to prevent the
cohesion of the alumina.
   A very moderate heat seems, however, sufficient to decom
pose carbonate of alumina. A quantity of precipitate, pre
pared as above stated by sesquicarbonate of ammonia, was
dried by the heat of steam; a portion of this was added to          |
dilute sulphuric acid, and although effervescence occurred and       -
some alumina was dissolved, the greater portion had lost its
carbonic acid and become insoluble.
   I have further found, that when hot solutions of alum and
carbonate of soda are mixed, the precipitate formed is not
totally and immediately soluble in dilute sulphuric acid.
   That other substances have the power of intervening to pre
vent the cohesion of precipitated alumina is shown by the fol
lowing experiment:-To a solution of alum I added one of
sulphate of magnesia, and by ammonia precipitated a mixture
of the two earths; and on keeping the mixed precipitate for
such a length of time as would have rendered only one-fifth of       |
alumina precipitated per se soluble, I found that the mixed
earths were totally and almost immediately dissolved by cold
dilute sulphuric acid.
   The experiments which I have now detailed prove, I think,
the following facts:—
   1. That the particles of alumina, like those of peroxide of

                     the Particles of Alumina.                   359
iron, even when kept moist, have the power of cohering so as
to prevent chemical action.
   2. That carbonate of alumina may be formed, though de
composable at a comparatively low temperature.
   3. That owing to the presence of carbonic acid or magnesia,
the particles of alumina are prevented from cohering.
   It will also, I think, be admitted, that the cohering property
which I have now described may have led to errors in analysis,
in which precipitated alumina may have been kept without any
such intervening substances as to render it soluble. I may
remark, in conclusion, that the alumina insoluble in dilute
acids was not taken up by soda, at any rate when used cold.
   Although not connected with the present subject, I will
take the opportunity of mentioning an unexpected case which
lately occurred to me. In examining a soil, I treated one
portion of it simply with muriatic acid and another with nitro
muriatic acid.     On the addition of ammonia to both solutions,
I found the muriatic solution yield a bulky precipitate, evi
dently containing, if not consisting of protoxide of iron,
whereas the nitro-muriatic solution gave a comparatively small
quantity of precipitate evidently of sesquioxide of iron.
   On investigation, I found that the protoxide of iron had
carried down with it a considerable quantity of magnesia;
whether in a state of mixture or combination remains to be
proved.
   To try the experiment on a considerable scale, I mixed an
equivalent of sulphate of magnesia with half an equivalent of
protosulphate of iron, adding an equivalent of sal-ammoniac
to prevent the partial precipitation of the magnesia by the
ammonia, which I added in excess to precipitate all that it was
capable of throwing down. Having carefully washed the preci
pitate, I redissolved it in nitro-muriatic acid, so as to peroxidize
the iron, and I again added sal-ammoniac and ammonia. . By
this peroxide of iron was thrown down; and on adding phos
phate of soda to the filtered solution, I obtained so abundant a
precipitate of the ammonio-magnesian phosphate, as to render
it probable that at least one-fourth of the magnesia had been
precipitated with the protoxide of iron.
   I may also notice another circumstance connected with the
precipitation of the magnesia with the protoxide of iron. It
is well known that excess of ammonia dissolves a portion of
protoxide of iron, which by oxidizement of the air is precipi
tated. This solution however does not happen in the case
above alluded to, the whole of the protoxide of iron being at
once precipitated with the magnesia.

   CHALlis, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Plumian. Professor of
   Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in the University of
   Cambridge".                                                -
IN accordance with         the intention expressed at the close of
      my communication to the Philosophical Magazine for
August last, I proceed to draw some inferences from the equa
tions (B.) and (C.). But, first, it will be proper to point out
two inaccuracies contained in that communication.         The third
                                                  2
term of equation (C.) in p. 100 should be        ºf instead of lºf;
and in the same page, in the series for the form of p, the
quantities in brackets should bez—alt+ci,z—alt-H ca, z—alt+ca,
&c., ci, ca, ca, &c. being certain constants. No inferences are
in the least degree affected by these alterations.
   Let us now, for the purpose of testing equation (C.), suppose
that f is a function of a "+y”. By this supposition the equa
tion becomes, on putting r” for a "+y”,
               _ dºf  (      tºo df*\ , 1 df , bº
             0= i\l- #: ;)+; ; +; f,
showing that the supposition is allowable. In any case of
vibrations not very large, the second term in the brackets is
too small to have any appreciable effect. Omitting this term,
                       2
and putting 4e for a2 the integral of the resulting equation in
a series is
                                e?,*      e3,6
               J-1-er"+ iºar- i...as 48c.
   I have already stated (Phil. Mag. for April, p. 281) that
according to this result f and # cannot vanish together.
Hence, since the velocity of the vibrating particle in any di
rection perpendicular to the axis of x is ? jº and parallel to
the axis of z, f.  #.  it follows that the fluid cannot be con
stantly quiescent at a certain distance from that axis. This
conclusion is inconsistent with the non-divergence of the vibra
tions, and would be enough to condemn the whole of the pre
vious investigation, if the reasoning by which it was arrived at
be good.
   # is now proper for me to state the grounds on which that
conclusion is to be rejected. I have maintained, and still

      Prof. Challis on the Vibrations of an Elastic Fluid. 361
maintain, that to obtain true and consistent results in hydro
dynamics another general equation, distinct from those com
monly recognised, is absolutely necessary. In the foregoing
investigation no reference has been made to that equation, and
the reasoning is on that account defective. Before stating the
modification which the reasoning must undergo, I will briefly
advert to the evidence for the new equation which I have
gyen in a communication to the Philosophical Magazine for
May 1845 (p. 425). I have there obtained, by elementary
considerations which admit of no dispute, the following equa
tion,                                                             * *

a point where the principal radii of curvature of the surface
cutting at right angles the directions of motion are R and R';
and ds is the increment of a line drawn always in the direction
of the motion of the particles through which it passes. This
equation being true and general, is also necessary in the solu
tion of every hydrodynamical problem. It is not identical

because it rests on two principles, that of constancy of mass,
and the principle that the directions of motion are normals to
a surface of continued curvature; whilst equation (II.) rests
only on the principle of the constancy of mass. As however
equation (II.) is true, there must exist another equation, which,
combined with it, conducts to (I.). That additional equation
is the one I contend for. I derive it from the single principle,
that the directions of motion in a given element are at each
instant normals to a surface of continued curvature,—a con
dition necessary for the continuity of the motion,-and I have
shown how, by its combination with (II.), the equation (I.)
is arrived at (see Camb. Phil. Trans., vol. vii. part 3, p. 385;
and Phil. Mag., S. 3, vol. xx. April 1842). Lastly, in a par
ticular instance I have obtained an absurd result by employing
legitimately only the commonly received equations (Phil.
Mag, for May 1845, p. 429). The evidence for the necessity
of the new equation seems therefore to be in every respect
complete. I am not, however, at present aware of any other
use required to be made of it than that of deducing equation
(I.). That deduction being once made, it follows that in every
hydrodynamical problem equation (I.) must supersede equa
tion (II.).

   The equation (1.) serves to define the motion parallel to the
axis of z, and the equation (2.) determines the rate of propa
gation (a'), which, it thus appears, is not altogether indepen

the expression for p account for harmonics.
    Let us now investigate the equation which defines the mo
tion transverse to the axis of z. For this purpose, on account
of the independence of the variables in p and f, suppose p = 0.
Then u-0 and v=0. Hence the motion at each point of the

any point of this plane R and R' each become infinitely great.

LVII. Remarks on the Weather during the Quarter ending Sep
   tember 30, 1848.    By JAMEs GLAISHER, Esq., of the Royal
   Observatory, Greenwich 4.
THE        meteorological returns for the past quarter furnished
       to the Registrar-General have been obtained from the
usual places. These have been all examined and discussed
by myself in the same manner as detailed in the previous Num
bers of the Philosophical Magazine. The following are my
remarks upon the weather of the past quarter.
   With the exception of a few days in July, and the period
between the 9th and 23rd of September, the weather during
the quarter ending September 30, 1848, was wet, with very
little sunshine. The month of August was extremely wet,
and in many places the falls of rain both in July and Septem
ber were unusually great. So much rain falling in a period
immediately following the previous bad weather, renders the
season and the year very remarkable. On July 1 the mean
temperature of the air was 8°4 below the average value from
the seven preceding years, and on the 6th it was 12°2 in ex
cess above the average; on the former day the mean tempe
rature was 46°7, and on the latter day it was 74°0. On the
9th it was 3° below the average, and on the 14th it was 9°.4
above the average; and on the 15th it was again below the
average. These changes were large and abrupt. From
July 11 to September 19 the temperature of the air was almost
always below the average value, and particularly so between the
11th and the 15th of September; on the 12th the departure
from the average was 12°6. From the 20th of September to
the end of the quarter, the temperature of the air ranged some
what above the average value.
   The hottest day in this year was July 6, and this day was
the hottest all over the country. On an average of seven
years, the hottest day is July 5.
   In pursuance of the arrangement hitherto followed, I will
speak of each subject of investigation separately.
   The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich—
   For the month of July was 61°5, which is 8°7, 1°3, 0°-6,
0°-1, and 19.7 above those of the years 1841 to 1845 respec
tively, 3°0 and 8°-9 below those of the years 1846 and 1847;
or it is 0° 1 above the average of these seven years;
   For the month of August was 58°5, which is 2°0, 6°-9,
3°-6, 4°7, and 3°-6 below those of the years 1841, 1842, 1843,
1846, and 1847 respectively, 0°-8 and 19.2 above those of the
years 1844 and 1845 respectively; or it is 2°7 below the
average of these seven years;
                    * Communicated by the Author.

366        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
   For the month of September was 55°-8, which is 2°3,0°-6,
3°7, 1°1, and 4°-3 below those of the years 1841, 1842, 1843,
1844, and 1847 respectively, 1°2 and 19.5 above those of the
years 1845 and 1846 respectively; or it is 1°2 below the ave
rage of these seven years.
   The mean value for the quarter was 58°6; that for 1841
was 58°8; for 1842 was 60°7; for 1843 was 60°-8; for 1844
was 58°-7; for 1845 was 56°-9; for 1846 was 62°6; and for
1847 was 60°3; so that the defect for this quarter below the
corresponding quarter in the years 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844,
1846, and 1847, was 0°2, 2°1, 2°2, 0°-1, 4°0, and 19.7 re
spectively; the only year between 1841 and 1847 whose mean
temperature for this period was less than that for the present
year was 1845, and the difference is 1°7. The average value
for this quarter from the seven preceding years was 59°8;
so that the mean temperature of the air for the quarter ending
September 30, 1848, was below that of the corresponding
quarter in the preceding seven years by 1°2.
   The mean temperature of evaporation at Greenwich—
   For the month of July was 57°-6, which is 0° 1 above
that for the preceding seven years;
   For the month of August was 55°2, which is 2°-9 below
that for the preceding seven years;
   For the month of September was 53°2, which is 1°5 below
that for the preceding seven years.
   The mean value for the quarter was 55°3, which is 1°4
below the average for the seven preceding years.               -
   The mean temperature of the dew-point at Greenwich—
   For the month of April was 54°-6, which is 8°0, 1°4, 0°2,
1°9, and 19.8 below those for the years 1841, 1842, 1845, 1846,
and 1847 respectively, 1°7 and 0°-1 above those for the years
1843 and 1844 respectively; or it is 0°-9 above the average of
these seven years;
   For the month of August was 52°8, which is 2°2, 6°1,
5°0, 4°7, and 3°-3 below those for the years 1841, 1842,
 1843, 1846, and 1847 respectively, 0°-5 and 0°2 above those
for the years 1844 and 1845; or it is 2°-9 below the average for
these seven years;
   For the month of September was 50°-9, which is 2°8, 2°6,
4°0, 2°3, and 4°-0 below those for the years 1841, 1842,
 1843, 1844, and 1846 respectively, 1°2 above those of the
years 1845 and 1847; or it is 1°-9 below the average of these
 seven years.
   The mean value for the quarter was 52°8, which is 1°3
below the average for the corresponding period of the preceding
 SeWen years.                      -
    The mean weight of water in a cubic foot of air for the

        during the Quarter ending September 30, 1848.         367
quarter was 4.5 grains, which is 0.2 grain less than the average
for the seven preceding years.
   The additional weight of water required to saturate a cubic
foot of air was 1.1 grain. The average value for the seven pre
ceding years was 1-0 grain.
   The mean degree of humidity of the atmosphere for July
was 0.762, for August was 0.797, and for September was 0.795.
The averages for the seven preceding years were 0.780,
0.804, and 0.842 respectively. The value for the quarter was
0-785, which is 0.024 less than the average for these years.
   The mean elastic force of vapour for the quarter was 0-411
inch, which is 0.026 less than the average for these years.
    The mean reading of the barometer at Greenwich for July
was 29.836 inches, for August was 29-732 inches, and for
September was 29.832 inches; these values are 0-041 inch
above, 0.065 inch below, and 0-021 inch above respectively the
averages for the seven preceding years. The mean value for
the quarter was 29797 inches, which is of the same value as
the average for the seven preceding years.
    The average weight of a cubic foot of air under the average
temperature, humidity, and pressure, was 527 grains; the
average for the seven preceding years was 526 grains.
    The rain fallen at Greenwich in July was 2-1 inches; in
August was 4-6 inches; and in September was 2.4 inches; the
average amount for the seven preceding years was 2.3 inches
in July, 27 inches in August, and 2-2 inches in September.
The amount fallen in the quarter was 9.1 inches, which is 1-9
inch greater than the average for the seven preceding years.
The average fall of rain during this quarter, as derived from
the observations since the year 1815, is 7 inches. In the
year 1824 the fall of rain in the quarter ending September 30
was 9 inches, in 1828 it was 12-5 inches, in 1829 it was 11
inches, and in 1839 it was 10:5 inches. The total amount of
rain fallen this year till September 30 was 24-3 inches; in
 1841 it was 21-2 inches; in 1842 it was 14.2 inches; in 1843
it was 17.5 inches; in 1844 it was 16-2 inches; in 1845 it was
 16-6 inches; in 1846 it was 17.5 inches; and in 1847 it was
 11'6 inches. So that the fall of rain this year exceeds that in
 1841 by 2.7 inches; in 1842 by 9-7 inches; in 1843 by 6'4
inches; in 1844 by 7-7 inches; in 1845 by 7-3 inches; in
 1846 by 6'4 inches; and in 1847 by 12.3 inches. The excess
 of the fall of rain this year over the average for the seven pre
 ceding years is 7-5 inches.
    In the years 1824 and 1828 the depth of rain fallen to the
 end of September exceeded 23 inches; and in the years 1829
 and 1839 the amount collected exceeded 20 inches. So large

368        Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
a fall as 24-3 inches within the first nine months of the year
has probably not been exceeded within this century.
   The temperature of the water of the Thames was 63°0 by
day, and 62°·0 by night. The water, on an average, was 3°-9
warmer than the air.
   The horizontal movement of the air was about 130 miles
daily; during the period of time between July 19 and July 27
it amounted to 233 miles per day; from July 31 to August 6
its average daily value was 240 miles; and on August 21 it
exceeded 300 miles.
    The highest and lowest readings of the thermometer in Air at
the height of four feet above the ground, and protected as
much as possible from the effects of radiation and rain, were
85°3 and 32°8.
    The average daily ranges of the readings of the thermometer
in Air at the height of four feet, were 22°5 in July, 18°5 in
August, and 20°-9 in September. The average ranges for
these months from the observations of the seven preceding
years were 17°2, 17°. 1, and 16°-2 respectively.
   In July the readings of the thermometer on grass were 29°5
on one night; between 32° and 40° on nine nights; between
40° and 50° on twelve nights; and above 50° on nine nights.
   In August the lowest reading was 36°: and the readings
were below 40° on four nights; between 40° and 50° on
eighteen nights; and above 50° on nine nights.          -
   In September the readings were below 32° on nine nights,
and the lowest was 23°; they were between 32° and 40° on
seven nights; between 40° and 50° on nine nights; and above
50° on four nights.
    The mean amount of cloud for July was 6'6, for August was
7-6, and for September was 5.6. The average values for the
seven preceding years were 6-7, 6-3, and 6-0 respectively.
   There were five exhibitions of the aurora borealis during
the quarter, which occurred on July 11, August 28, September
4, 8 and 18.
    Thunder-storms at different parts of the country occurred
on July 14, 26, August 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 22, 23, 31,
and September 5; and lightning unaccompanied by thunder
was seen on July 24, August 23, 24, 25, September 22 and 25.
The storms of July 14 were observed at Greenwich, Latimer
 Rectory, Cardington, Saffron Walden and Leicester. At
Greenwich,    j.              were observed first in the west and
north-west at 8° 30m P.M.; and from this time till near mid
night the thunder followed the lightning at intervals varying
from 5° to 40°; and lightning was visible during the whole of
the night. At Latimer the storm is described as awful, and

        during the Quarter ending September 30, 1848.          369
of five hours' duration. On July 24 lightning was seen at
Saffron Walden; on July 26 there was a thunder-storm at
Leicester; on August 1, thunder was heard at Greenwich
during the afternoon; on August 3 and 4 at Saffron Walden;
on August 5 there were thunder-storms at Greenwich, Stone,
Saffron Walden, Leicester and Empingham. Near the last
mentioned place a tree was struck by the lightning.
   On August 6 and 7 there were thunder-storms at Leicester;
on August 8 at Leicester and at Exeter; on August 9 at
Greenwich, but no lightning was seen; on August 10 at Stone;
on August 11 at Greenwich, between the hours of 6 and 8 P.M.;
the storm began in the east, and many of the flashes of light
ning were vivid, and preceded the thunder by two or three
seconds only. On August 22 there were storms at Exeter,
Stone, Saffron Walden, Cardington, and at Leicester. At
Greenwich, on August 23 and 24, between the hours of 8 P.M.
and midnight, on both days many flashes of lightning were
seen. On August 31, at Greenwich and at Stone, there were
thunder-storms; at the former place the thunder followed the
lightning at intervals varying from 15 to 12°. On September 5
there were storms at Greenwich, Stone and Leicester; on
September 22 lightning was seen at Greenwich and at Stone,
and again at Stone on the 25th.
    Hail fell at Stone and Cardington on August 22, and at
Empingham on August 5; the hailstones at Cardington were
of very large dimensions.
    Gales of wind took place all over the country on August 20,
 21 and 22, but more particularly on the 21st. At many
places trees were blown down, and a great deal of injury was
done; coasting-vessels and fishing-boats generally suffered very
 much.
    Large and continuous falls of rain.—In July, at Greenwich,
 rain fell to the depth of 0.3 inch on the 15th, 23rd and 31st.
 On the 14th, at Latimer Rectory, rain to the depth of half an
 inch fell in half an hour. In August rain was falling more or
 less at every part of the country on every day. At Greenwich
 the amount collected exceeded 0-3 inch on the 1st, 3rd, 8th,
 10th and 21st; and the falls exceeded 0-7 inch on the 14th
 and 31st; on the 14th a large fall occurred at all places. In
 September, on the 24th, at Thwaite, between 4h A.M. and 9h
 A.M., rain fell to the depth of 2:12 inches, a greater fall within
 the same interval of time than has occurred at Thwaite within
 the preceding forty years; and on this day, at Leeds, the fall
 within nine hours was 2 inches.     On the 28th, 29th and 30th
 days, rain was falling almost continuously over all parts of the
 country. At Cardington the fall within sixty hours was 2.6

 370       Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
inches. At Leicester the amount within seventy-two hours
was 2.25 inches, and this was the amount which fell on these
days at most places. This large fall, extending over so large
a portion of the country, was most unusual.
    The approximate mean monthly values of the several subjects
 of research are shown in extensive tables in the report of the
 Registrar-General.
    The mean monthly temperatures of the places in Cornwall
and Devonshire in these three months are about the same
values as those of other places, but the extremes of daily and
monthly temperatures are much less than elsewhere.
    The reading of the barometer was low at the beginning of
July, being 29.403 inches at 6h A.M. on the 1st; this reading
increased to 29.740 by 6' P.M. on the 2nd; decreased to
29'611 on the 3rd, and increased quickly on the 4th, and
reached 30 inches before midnight on this day. The read
ing ranged above 30 inches on the 5th, and decreased to
29'635 by midnight on the 9th. During the 10th the value
increased 0-539 inch, having passed the point 30 inches at
about 1" P.M. on this day. The reading continued above

to half an inch during the day; and at the end of the month
the reading was 29.313 inches, and still decreasing.

   In September, till the 4th, the reading was above 30 inches;
during the 5th it decreased 0-2 inch, and was 29-638 at mid

night; from the 6th to the 9th the changes were small; on
the 10th, by P.M., the reading decreased 0-219 inch, and
the reading was 29:496 inches; it then turned to increase
quickly; on the 11th the reading at midnight was 30-091
inches. From this time till the 18th the reading was always
above 30 inches; the highest value was 30-345 on the 16th.
On the 19th it began to decrease, and on the 24th the reading
was 29:223 inches; and from this time to the end of the
month the changes were small, and chiefly about the mean
reading of 29'6 inches.
   The great prevalence of rain during the quarter, together
with the very short periods of sunshine, have harassed the
farmer in gathering in the crops. The month of July was
about its usual character, but the constant rain in August
impeded the farmer in his operations, and in many of the
southern counties injured the crops considerably, causing the
corn to sprout and seed-leaves to appear, of fully an inch in
length, by the middle of August; the greater coldness of the
northern counties prevented the sprouting of the corn, but it
otherwise was seriously injured.
    Between the 9th and the 23rd of September the weather
was generally fine, and this period was the only good interval
of time for harvest work during the quarter, and the wheat
gathered within this time was in good condition. The heavy
falls of rain at the end of this month flooded many parts of the
country, and the roads in some places were deeply trenched.
   John Fletcher Miller, Esq., of Whitehaven, says, “The
harvest in this neighbourhood was completed by September 20,
somewhat earlier than usual. The crops were abundant, and
secured in excellent condition.”
    Charles Charnock, Esq., of Leeds, says, “The harvest has
been most protracted, and there is yet much both of barley
and oats out in the fields, which I fear is seriously injured.
There is in fact much more corn out in the northern districts
than is generally supposed. On September 25 I observed in
the East Riding of Yorkshire hundreds of acres of corn and
potatoes with water to the depth of a foot upon them. The
 wheat and barley, which were housed between the 9th and the
 23rd of September, were without damage and in good condi
 tion; that which was housed before this time was in a bad
 state from not being dry. Wheat in this neighbourhood has
 not sprouted generally. Wheat and barley yield badly, and
 both crops are under an average. Both oats and beans are
 average crops. Potatoes are getting worse; the winter or
 late varieties of this vegetable are now attacked and rotting
 very fast; wherever the tops have been very luxuriant they are
 the worst.   I have observed that the disease seems to have

 372       Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather
 been immediately preceded by a white frost, which disease I
 have no doubt is attributable to meteorological causes.
    “Sheep stock has not been healthy; the deaths among the
 lambs have been very numerous even in the driest districts.”
    Samuel Charles Whitbread, Esq., says, “My harvest began
 on the 28th of July; it continued forty-two days, and rain fell
 on twenty-eight of these days, depositing 4-75 inches of water;
 on the whole the crops suffered no damage.” This remark
 has reference to the crops in Bedfordshire.
    The observer at Stone says, speaking of the crops in the
 Vale of Aylesbury, “that those of hay and clover were abun
 dant and good, but were not well-gathered; that wheat was
 below an average of many years, but was well-housed; that
 both barley and oats were average crops, and they were well
 housed.” The observer speaks of the potato crop as being
 generally bad.                          -
   John Drew, Esq., F.R.A.S., of Southampton, has kindly
 procured me an agricultural report from John Clark, Esq. of
 Finsbury Farm, near Romsey, Hampshire, and which I have
 condensed into the following few lines.
   The South Hampshire farmer has been subjected during
 the past quarter to more trying dispensations of Providence
than Mr. Clark has experienced within a period of twenty-five
years' practice. This gentleman further observes that the
almost constant wet weather has injured every kind of crop,
and that but little has come to maturity. The occasional
short periods of sunshine have frequently induced the hope
that a season would come for haymaking and harvest work,
but which expectation unfortunately has never been realized.
 A large quantity of hay has been consequently rendered use
less, and turnips have been very much injured. The wide
 range of prices of new wheat affords the best evidence of the
extent to which this crop has been harassed. On those lands
 which have been well-farmed and well-drained, or on those
which would readily part with an excess of moisture, the crops
are an average (with the exception of potatoes, which are
almost a failure). On heavy cold soils the crops are below an
average. In consequence of the exceeding wetness cattle have
done badly.
   The recent heavy rains (now Oct. 6) excite great anxiety
with respect to seed-time. On wetlands a great deal is needed
to be done to prepare them for sowing, which operation must
be late, and therefore to a certain extent more precarious
than if performed under the more favourable circumstances of
a good seed season.                                    -
   Themean of the numbers in the first column of the subjoined
quarterly meteorological table is 29'541 inches, and this value

        during the Quarter ending September 30, 1848.         373
may be considered as that of the pressure of dry air for England
during the quarter ending September 30, 1848. . The differ
ences between this number and the separate results contained
in the first column, show the probable sums of the errors of ob
servation and reduction; the latter arising partly from errone
ously assumed altitudes, and partly in consequence of the index
error of the instruments not having been determined. In most
cases, however, the sums of these errors are small.
   The mean of the numbers in the second column, for those
places situated in the counties of Cornwall and Devonshire, is
58°1; for those places situated south of latitude 52°, including
Chichester and Hartwell, is 57°8; for those places situated
between the latitudes of 52° and 53°, including Saffron Walden
and Highfield House, was 56°8; for those places situated
between the latitudes of 53° and 54°, including Liverpool and
Whitehaven, but not Stonyhurst, whose mean temperature,
from its greater elevation, is lower than that due to its latitude
alone, was 56°2; and for Durham and Newcastle was 55°8.
This value, however, is somewhat too high for the former
place and too low for the latter, on account of the difference
of elevation of these places. These values may be considered
as those of the mean temperature of the air for these different
parallels of latitude during the quarter ending September 30,
1848.
   The average daily range of the temperature of the air in
Cornwall and Devonshire was 14°-2; at Liverpool and White
haven was 10°2; south of latitude 52° was 19°5; between the
latitudes of 52° and 53° was 15°8; between the latitudes of 53°
and 54° was 15°-9; and of Durham and Newcastle was 14°4.
   The greatest mean daily ranges of the temperature of the air
took place at Hartwell, Latimer, Aylesbury and Leicester
respectively; and the least occurred at Liverpool, Whitehaven,
Torquay and Truro respectively.
   The highest thermometer readings in air during the quarter
were 95° at Leicester, 90° at Wakefield, and 89° at Hartwell;
but it seems highly probable that these readings are greater
than the temperature of the air really reached. The reading
88° seems to be confirmed, and this value may be considered
as the highest during the quarter. The lowest values of the
thermometer readings in air were 29° at Hartwell, 31° at La
timer and Cardington. The extreme range of temperature
of the air during the quarter was therefore about 59°.
   The average quarterly range of the reading of the thermo
meter in Cornwall and Devonshire was 33°2; at Liverpool
and Whitehaven was 32°5; and the mean of the numbers at
all the other places is 49°2. The highest and lowest readings

                    Mr. J. Glaisher's Remarks on the Weather.         375
        at Stone, and all depending upon them, are evidently erro
        neous.
            From the numbers in this quarter, as well as those of pre
        ceding quarters, it would seem that the Vale of Aylesbury is
        subject to greater extremes of temperature than any other part
        of the country of equal extent.
º           The great mass of air has passed from the south-west in all
-       places except Liverpool and Whitehaven, at both of which
        places it seems to have passed from the north-west. By refer
:       ence to the Monthly Table, it will be seen that this was parti
   _{   cularly the case in July and August; but in September the
        direction of the wind was frequently from the east, and its
        compounds.
            From the numbers in the ninth column, the distribution of
        cloud seems to have been nearly the same in amount at most
         places, and such as to have covered about three-fifths of the
         whole sky.
            The fall of rain during the quarter has greatly exceeded the
         average amount for the season, and this was particularly the case
      *  in the month of August. The places at which rain has fallen
h        on the greatest number of days were Stonyhurst, Greenwich,
:        Beckington, Leeds, Highfield House, Helston and Wakefield,
-        and the average number of these places was 59; and the
  A      places at which rain fell on the least number of days are those
-        situated near the eastern coast. The places at which the
:        largest falls have taken place were Stonyhurst, Hereford,
-        Beckington, Leeds and Torquay. The places where the falls
         have been the least in amount are Durham, Newcastle, Saf
         fron Walden, Walworth, Stone and Norwich. The amount
         at Stone being so much less than the fall at adjacent places,
2        seems to be strange; and this was the case in the preceding
  i.     quarter, in consequence of which the Rev. J. B. Reade, on
 >        August 17, wrote to me, stating that “there had been many
  º       electrical clouds giving copious showers around us, especially
         on the Chiltern Hills and in the neighbourhood of Aylesbury,
.        while we were in sunshine. This was particularly the case
         yesterday afternoon.”
             The numbers in column 12 to 16 show the mean values ofthe
 …”
          hygrometrical results at every station; from which we find that—
             The mean weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air for En
          gland (excepting Cornwall and Devonshire) in the quarter
          ending September 30, 1848, was 4.5 grains.
             The mean additional weight required to saturate a cubic
          foot of air in the quarter ending Sept. 30, 1848, was 1-0 grain.
             The mean degree of humidity (complete saturation = 1) in
          the quarter ending September 30, 1848, was 0.815.

 LVIII. Account of the Aurora Borealis as seen at Stonyhurst.
    Observatory, October 1848. By the Rev. ALFRED WELD, .
   B.A., of Stonyhurst College”.                                     ºf
 ON the evening of this day I was fortunate .# to witness º
      the most magnificent display of aurora borealis which has,
been known in this part of the country for many years. The ,
following are the principal features as they were noticed at the ,
Observatory of Stonyhurst.                               .      . . .”
    At about 6'45" E.M. it was observed that the sky in they
N.E. was tinged with crimson, and at the same time an arc,
of light was seen stretching from N.N.E. to a point about.
the N.W. From this arc great numbers of faint rays were .
emitted in both directions. By degrees the whole of that por
tion of the heavens became filled with rays of light, which were,
spread in confusion over the sky, some arising immediately
from the horizon, others having their origin at different alti-,
tudes: none of these were remarkable for length or intensity .
of light. In the meantime the red in the N.E. was increasing
to a brilliant crimson, remaining perfectly fixed, except that .
it extended itself northward like a great cloud of fire, and .
assumed a very magnificent appearance, while the streamers ,
and sheets of light between the N. and N.W. underwent                      **
rapid changes, exhibiting now a somewhat irregular inverted .
arch, and now wound into a wreath so as to enclose an almost
perfect circle. Shortly after seven, the spectacle was yery.
grand; from N.E. to S.W. the whole sky, to the altitude of
30° or 40°, was filled with sheets and streamers of light, all
nearly steady (if we except a certain tremulous motion which,
seemed to animate the whole mass), and chiefly of a brilliant |
crimson hue.                             -      -                  .      .
   During this time the cloud of red light continued station: .
ary in the N.E., in the constellation Auriga, the principal
                                                                *    * * ** *

                                                      -        \!         \

     as seen at Stonyhurst Observatory, October 18, 1848. 377
stars of which shone through with a red light, and there were
occasional streamers of great brilliancy. About the same
time there seemed to be three principal centres of light, one
in the N.E., another in the N.W., and a third in the S.W.
An ill-defined arch was still stretched over the north, and two
distinct but faint arches arose from the same point in the N.E.;
one passing South of the Zenith through the Pleiades, the con
stellations Aries, Pisces and Aquila, and the other rather north
of the Pleiades, through the constellations of Cassiopaea, Draco
and Lyra, and terminating with the other about the S.W.
At 7h 30” P.M. clouds were formed in the north, and passed in
small detached portions over the red mass in Auriga, which
continued to shine with brilliancy between them.
    At 7" 40m P.M. the observations were interrupted until about
8h P.M. Between 8h P.M. and 8h 15m P.M. nothing was ob
 served, except that the sky near the horizon in the N.E. and
 W. was lighter than the rest. At 8* 15" P.M. an auroral
 arch again appeared, terminating in these points; the red
 colour again appeared in the N.E., whilst sheets of light began
 to arise successively from every portion of the horizon from
 W. to E. These rays, which presented many shades of red
 mingled with white, began now to mount to a great altitude,
 and presented the appearance of vast truncated cones, tending
 to some common apex not very far from the zenith.
     The splendour of the scene increased with great rapidity.
 At 9h P.M. the rays of light had shot past the zenith and began
 to meet round a point, corresponding about that hour, exactly
 with the position of « Andromedae, which star was then about
 one hour distant from its culminating point. Between 9" P.M.
 and 9h 15m P.M. the heavens presented the magnificent ap
 pearance of a mighty fan of crimson light stretching out from
 & Andromedae, and presenting over two-thirds of the heavens,
 from S.W. to E., one unbroken sheet of light, varied only by
  its different shades of crimson mingled with white, which
  served to distinguish the rays, and the vibratory motion which
  pervaded it, while waves of paler light shot up from time to
  time with the rapidity of lightning.          -
     At this time the heavens were divided by a distinct and
  clearly defined line into two portions, the greater part being
  brilliant to the extreme, while the remainder, though cloud
  less, appeared so black, that but for the stars which shone
  with great distinctness, I should have imagined it overcast
   with a very heavy cloud; the rays which formed the boundary
   inclined over like the sides of a spherical triangle, whilst those
   in the more northern regions appeared vertical.
      At 9h 15m P.M. the splendour of the spectacle reached its

 378         Mr. B. C. Brodie on the Chemical Nature
height. The appearance could no longer be compared to
that of a fan but to that of a dome of fire; the unillumined
portion of the horizon became confined to about one-fourth
part of the circle, extending more or less between S.S.W.
and E. : y Pegasi became enveloped in the light which shot
southwards from the summit, passing several degrees below
 Saturn, so that in the S.E. not more than a space of about 30°
in altitude remained dark, while all the rest of the heavens
seemed on fire. The summit of the dome presented several
remarkable changes of appearance: at one time the rays met
 as at a point, with great regularity; at another there were seen
great irregular masses of light gathered round it, and at an
other there was a distinct circle round the centre, which was
dark. As the evening advanced, this crown changed its posi
tion among the stars to a considerable extent, retaining how
ever the same altitude and azimuth as the stars moved west
ward. After 9° 30m P.M. the grandeur of the scene diminished,
and at 10h 30" P.M. the crimson colour had disappeared; still
the streamers continued with great vigour till October 19, at
 1h 30” A.M., at which time the observations were discontinued.
    The altitude and azimuth of the corona were determined
from
SPY,         which S Ptriangle
       theinspherical     repre-          Y               Y P-36° 10'

angle of 2 Andromedae at g
9h P.M.
    From this the zenith distance of the corona appears to have
been about 18° south, and its azimuth to have been about 41°
east.
    On the 19th and 20th there were also slight exhibitions of
aurora borealis. On these days the magnets at Greenwich
Observatory were affected, as I learn both from Mr. Glaisher
and from the Registrar-General's Report for the week ending
October 21st.
     LIX. On the Chemical Nature of a Waw from China.
             By BENJAMIN Collins BRod1E, Esq.”
THE        wax which is the subject of the following investigation,
      is a substance which was imported into this country from
China as an article of commerce. Its appearance closely re
sembles that of spermaceti.        It is, like spermaceti, white and,
in large masses, highly crystalline, but differs from it by being .
   * From the Philosophical Transactions, part i.; having been received by
the Royal Society March 30, and read May 11, 1848.

                            of a Waw from China.                            379
  harder, more brittle, and of a more fibrous character of cry
  stallization. The melting-point of the wax is about 83°C. It is
  but very slightly soluble in either alcohol or aether, but dissolves
  with #. facility in naphtha, out of which fluid it may be
  crystallized. This substance is generally spoken of as a ve
  getable wax: on looking however into such facts as I can
  gather which throw any light on its origin, it seems more than
  probable that, like bees’-wax, it is the secretion of an insect.
| Sir George Staunton, in his Embassy to China”, gives an
  account of a wax of insect origin, which there formed an article
  of trade, and in his work may be seen a drawing of the insect
  and of the tree on which the insect lives.              Other writers on
  China give a similar account. In the Comptes Rendus for
  1840 t is a paper by M. Stanislas Julien, who gives an account
  of this tree wax, and states it to be the work of an insect:
  where may be found also a great number of extracts from
  Chinese writers on agriculture, giving an account of the insect
  itself and of the trees suitable for its food; one of these trees
  is the Rhus succedaneum. This same gentleman, M. Stanislas
  Julien, gave to M. Lewy, who was engaged in an investigation
  on these wax substances, a specimen of the wax from this very
  plant, which is therefore in all probability this insect-wax.
  The melting-point, the appearance and the analysis of this
  wax, as given by M. Lewy, agree so exactly with those of the
  wax which I have examined, that I cannot but believe them
  to be the same chemical substance, and that this wax also is
  of insect origin.                          -
     The existence of any other wax-making insect, such as this
  Coccus ceriferus, besides the bee, is a point of considerable in
  terest in relation to the question as to the origin of the wax in
  that insect, and the possibility of the chemical transformations
  by which it is produced.
     The Chinese wax, as it appears in commerce, is a substance
  nearly in a state of chemical purity. By alcohol small portions
  of a greasy matter may be separated from it, and on distillation
  it affords traces of acroleine, which is not a product of the
  distillation of the pure wax. The impurities however are
  unimportant.
      I have spoken of this substance as a wax; and in truth,
  although to the eye it more nearly resembles spermaceti or
  stearine than ordinary bees’-wax, the substance, nevertheless,

380        Mr. B. C. Brodie on the Chemical Nature
which, even in appearance, it more nearly resembles than any
other, is the purified cerine, that is, that cerotic acid of which,
mixed with certain other waxy matter, in a former paper, I
have shown the bees’-wax to consist.         The accurate investi
gation of the chemical nature of the Chinese wax has brought
to light certain curious chemical relations which exist between
these bodies, and led to the discovery of the alcohol of cerotic
acid.
                              Cerotime.
   Chinese wax may be boiled for a long time either with di
lute or with concentrated potash with hardly any signs of
saponification. If, however, it be melted with the hydrate of
potash, it is readily decomposed. This decomposition is best
effected in an iron basin over a large gas flame or gentle fire.
The mass, after the action, is soluble in boiling water, giving
a milky solution. From this solution two substances may be
procured; an acid which may be combined with baryta by
precipitation of the soap with chloride of barium; and a wax
substance of another nature which is obtained by washing out
the baryta salt with any suitable solvent, such as alcohol, aether,
or naphtha. The soap, after precipitation by chloride of barium,
becomes perfectly clear, and, to obtain the wax-substance
which is not combined with the baryta, the baryta salt is first
to be separated by filtration from the fluid, then dried and
pulverized. It is convenient to effect, at first, a partial sepa
ration of the salt from the other matter by washing it out with
a large quantity of boiling alcohol, and filtering the solution
hot through linen. After this operation has been two or three
times repeated, the substance, which passes through the filter,

tered, in a similar manner, through paper, so as to separate
the small portions of the baryta salt which unavoidably pass
through the linen. The solution is much facilitated by the
addition of a small quantity of naphtha to the alcohol. If the
substance be purified by crystallization out of aether and ab
solute alcohol, its melting-point will be raised to 79° C. Pre
vious to analysis the substance is to be dissolved in absolute
alcohol and aether, and the solution filtered. This is a neces
sary precaution, as the naphtha dissolves traces of the baryta
salt. The substance was analysed.          ,

  cided that this was in truth the class of bodies to which this
   substance belonged, and led me to adopt the particular for
   mula for it which I have given. This alcohol I call cerotine.
   If this substance be heated with lime and potash according to
  the method of Dumas, hydrogen gas is given off, and if the
  experiment be conducted with care there will hardly be traces
  of any other volatile product. In the tube is found an acid.
   The experiment requires considerable heat, and I have found
   that it is best made in a long combustion-tube, suspended by
  means of two corks in a large tube of porcelain, which forms
  an air-bath. The apparatus is heated by charcoal in a com
  bustion-trough. In this manner the heat can be regulated
  with the greatest precision. The acid having been purified in
  the usual manner, which it is unnecessary again to refer to, is

   When cerotine is treated in the cold with concentrated sul
phuric acid, it is only acted on by the acid partially and at the
surface. If the action be increased by heat, a reddening of
the mass and decomposition take place. If however the cero
tine be taken in a state of fine granular division, as obtained
by crystallization out of aether, and in this condition acted upon
by the acid, all decomposition is avoided and a perfect com
bination takes place of the acid with the cerotine. The gra
nular crystals are to be dried between blotting-paper, and then
digested with the sulphuric acid, in the cold, for two or three
hours, sufficient acid being added to render the mixture a
rather fluid paste. The mass is to be thrown into cold water,
and washed out with the same on a filter. As long as the
solution is acid the wash-water will go through perfectly clear,
but when the acid is washed out it becomes slightly turbid.
After the adhering acid has been thus removed, the substance
may be dried in vacuo, and, when perfectly dry, dissolved in
aether and crystallized out of that fluid. In this condition it
is perfectly soluble even in water, and dissolves with the great

   Adopting therefore the usual chemical language as to such
compounds, this substance is to be regarded as the sulphate
of the oxide of cerotyle, containing one equivalent of water,
cerotyle being Cº, Hº, the hypothetical radical of the alcohol.
              Chlor-cerotic Aldehyde—Chlor-cerotal.
   The action of chlorine on cerotine gives us a proof of the
strong analogy of chemical constitution between alcohol and
that substance, notwithstanding the wide interval by which
they are separated in the alcoholic series. A body is formed
analogous to chloral; two equivalents of hydrogen are removed
without substitution, the substance passing, apparently, through
the condition of an aldehyde, before chlorine is substituted.
The chlorine produces a similar change in the appearance of
the substance to that which is produced by the action of chlo
rine on cerotic acid. The character of wax is entirely lost,
and the substance converted into a perfectly transparent
slightly yellow body, possessing the appearance and consist
ency of a gum-resin, and which becomes highly electric by
friction. The experiment was made by passing the chlorine

    It is very difficult to tell with certainty when the action of
 the chlorine on the substance ceases, and I have therefore
 written the fractional equivalents, which agree rather more
 closely with the analyses than the whole numbers, Caº            #o.
    The analysis determines with certainty that the substance
 no longer belongs to the alcohol type; for the addition of two
 equivalents of hydrogen to the formula would require above
 0.3 per cent, more hydrogen than the quantity found, a kind
 of error which is highly improbable.

    difficulty. It is best effected by naphtha-alcohol or naphtha
    aether. The wax acid, after separation from the baryta salt,
    is to be purified, first by long boiling with water in an open

   There is a difference between the calculated and found
amount of silver of about 0.5 per cent. which I cannot doubt
arises from traces of cerotine still adhering to the acid, not
withstanding all the pains I took to wash out the salt: for I
found that the amount of silver increased with the purification
of the acid by crystallization, even after I could find not the
slightest variation in the melting-point. The silver salt made
from an acid which was a part of the same original preparation
as the above and of exactly the same melting-point, but which
had not been so often crystallized, gave in two determinations
2007 and 2009 per cent. silver. It will be seen that the
formula I have given for the acid is confirmed by the analysis
of the acid obtained from distillation of the wax.
                    Distillation of Cerotine.
   Cerotine requires a high temperature for its distillation.
The operation is accompanied with little explosions, owing to
the formation of a small quantity of water. The distillate is
perfectly colourless to the last, and solid, giving, when pressed
with blotting-paper, hardly a trace of oil; it resembles in its
general appearance the cerotine itself, but has a lower melting
point, about 70° C.
   The distillate also contains a larger per-centage of carbon
than the substance. A portion, melting at 78°C. and purified
by crystallization, gave to analysis carbon 83'20 and hydrogen
14:22 per cent. ; but it is very difficult to raise the melting
point much beyond 73°C. At first, from the constancy of
the melting-point, I was led to think that a new oxygen com
bination had been formed.      I found, however, afterwards that
the melting-point could be raised to 79°C.; that is, the melt
ing-point of the alcohol, a substance of a lower melting-point
remaining behind; and there can be little doubt but that part
of the cerotine distils over unaltered, while another portion
decomposes into solid hydrocarbon and water. I found, in
fact, that the amount of carbon diminished as the melting
point was raised.

                   Distillation of Chinese War.
   The Chinese wax is decomposed by heat. When distilled,
the distillate consists of two portions; a wax acid which forms
the earlier portions of the distillate, and a portion which is
not acted on by potash, and from which the acid portion may
be separated by saponification. The soap requires to be drawn
off by a siphon. I will first give the analysis of the acid,
which is undoubtedly the same acid as that procured by sa
ponification of the wax itself. The melting-point of the acid
may, by the methods pursued in other cases of separation
from the soap, purification and crystallization out of aether,
be raised to 80°, 81°C., which is probably the true melting
point of the cerotic acid.
   0.2613 grim. of the acid gave 0.7555 CO, and 0.3075 HO,
which corresponds in parts per cent. to—

   The portion of the distillate from which the soap has been
separated by decantation and by repeated washings and boilin
out with water, consists chiefly of a solid hydrocarbon, one #
those substances which have been comprehended and con
founded under the general name of paraffine. It is mixed with
a certain quantity of oil, from which it may be almost entirely
separated by pressure in a press between folds of blotting
paper. If this substance be crystallized out of naphtha-alcohol
and then out of aether, it may be obtained of a melting-point
of 57°, 58°C. In this state it is highly crystalline on cooling,
and presents the general appearance of the substance called
paraffine.

   This substance may be called cerotene. After the discovery
of the alcohol, there was a strong presumption that the hydro
carbon and the cerotine would be related in the manner ex
pressed by the formula, the hydrocarbon being the olefiant
gas of the wax alcohol. It was, however, very desirable to
find some method for the determination of its formula.                           I
investigated, with this view, the action of chlorine on the sub
Stance.
                         Chlor-Cerotene.
   If moist chlorine be passed over the melted cerotene in the
manner before described in the case of the other wax sub

                     of a Waw from China.                      389
stances, it is readily acted upon by the gas. It loses its wax
character, becomes gum-like, and is ultimately converted into
a transparent resin; the substance becoming harder and harder
 with the increase of the chlorine substituted, at length be
 coming extremely hard, and cracking in all directions, on
 cooling, on the surface of the glass on which it has been melted.
 The action goes on very slowly, but more rapidly with moist
 than with dry gas. It was continued for several weeks, until
 no more traces of hydrochloric acid formed could be observed.
    During the operation portions of the substance were taken
 out at intervals and analysed.
    0.303 grim. of the first portion thus examined gave 0.3495
 CO, and 0-0965 HO, corresponding in 100 parts to—

   These analyses determine with certainty the ratio of the
hydrogen to the carbon in the cerotene, and leave no doubt
as to the nature of the hydrocarbon. M. Lewy attempted to
take the density of the vapour of paraffine from bees’-wax. He
found, however, that this could not be effected, as the sub
stance was altered, in process of conversion into vapour, with
the formation of a small quantity of hydrocarbon gas; the
paraffine however remaining white, and the analysis showing
no variation in composition *. It has been also remarked by
others that if bees’-wax be repeatedly distilled, the solid hy
drocarbon disappears from the distillate. These observations
point to the source of the oil in the distillation of the Chinese
wax, viz. the transformation of the cerotene itself into isomeric
hydrocarbons.      In fact, I found, if the cerotene be distilled
and redistilled in a closed tube of the form
annexed, that by effecting the distillation in
this manner under pressure, after about two
distillations the distillate becomes liquid and
the solid matter entirely disappears. The
experiment after about six distillations was put an end to by
the bursting of the heated end of the tube, when a large quan
tity of combustible vapour was given off. The oil which had

collected at the other end of the tube was a mixture of hydro
carbons of various boiling-points, from 75°C. to above 260°C.
No trace of solid matter was to be seen.
   If from the products of decomposition we turn to the ana
lysis of the Chinese wax itself, we find numbers, which are
perfectly consistent with the idea that the chemical position of
this body is among the class of compound aethers, where its
reactions also would lead us to place it.
   To purify the substance, it is to be crystallized out of
naphtha and alcohol; washed with aether to remove the
naphtha ; boiled with water and crystallized again out of ab
solute alcohol, in which it is soluble, although with difficulty.
Its melting-point is 82°C.

                LX. Notices respecting New Books.
                 The Physical Atlas. Parts VI. to X.
      EARLY twelve months ago we directed attention to the earlier
       portions of this work, and the completing Parts have been some
time in our hands. In these we find the high character fully sus
tained, and we congratulate Mr. Johnston on the successful con
clusion of his labours, which have given to the public one of the
most striking of modern standard works. Of its value it is no longer
necessary to speak, since it has now an European reputation. In
pursuance of the course before adopted, we present a brief synopsis
of the contents of the parts published since our former notice.
   Part VI. contains—1. A Chart of the Geological Structure of
the Globe according to Ami Boué, corrected up to Sept. 1846; ac
companied by notes on the general principles of Geology, and their
application, by Prof. Nichol. 2. A Physical Chart of the Indian
Ocean.     3. Two maps showing the distribution of the Rodentia and
the Ruminantia, constructed from the notes of Mr. Waterhouse, ac
companied by elaborate tables drawn up by that gentleman.
    Part VII.-1. A map of the lines of equal Polarization of the
Atmosphere, with some account of the subject, by Sir David
Brewster. 2. Comparative Views of remarkable Geological phaeno
mena. This is a highly interesting sheet, exhibiting maps and views
of a number of volcanoes, regions of volcanic origin, &c., after
Humboldt, Von Buch and others, an exact relative proportion being
preserved, so that it is easy to estimate comparative extent of surface.
3. A map of the River Systems of America, with an enlarged sketch
of the Niagara, plan of the Delta of the Mississippi and of the singular
bifurcation of the Orinoco.
    Part VIII.-Sheets 1 and 2 are devoted to a Palaeontological
Map of the British Islands, by Prof. E. Forbes, which with the ac
companying text presents a mass of information on this subject,
illustrating it in every point of view and exhibiting as much origi
 mality as industry. The author's own researches into the distribution
 of organized beings “in time” rendered him peculiarly fitted to the
 execution of this chart, and its elaborate character at once makes it
 a striking feature of the Atlas, and reflects credit on the condition
 of Geological science in Britain. 3. A Tidal Chart of the British
 Seas, showing the progress of the Wave of High water, the line of
 High-water mark in Greenwich time at new and full moon, and the
 depth of the Sea; in the text is also incorporated a smaller Tidal
 Chart of the World; these are by Mr. Scott Russell.
     Part IX.—l. A map of the Mountain chains of South America.
 2. A Chart exhibiting Humboldt's Isothermal lines and the lines of
 equal Barometric pressure at the level of the sea. 3. Charts exhi
 biting the distribution of the most important Plants yielding food
 for Man, with indications of the Isotheral and Isochimenal lines.
 These lines are at present so imperfectly known, that as here given,
  they are to be taken as mere indications. A wide field lies here for

investigation; it is to be desired that not only the mean summer and
winter lines should be completed, but even those of months, which,
together with the observation of periodic phaenomena of animal and
vegetable life, may lead to many important generalizations.              * *A

the various regions of prevalent Hurricanes. 3. An Ethnographic
Map of Europe. With this Part, which concludes the work, are
given useful Indices, in which the principal subjects illustrated are
arranged under the heads of the four great divisions of the Atlas,
viz. Meteorology, Hydrology, Geology, and Zoology-Phytology.
    Before taking leave of the Physical Atlas, we cannot but express
a sincere hope that the support which it may receive will be as
liberal as the spirit in which it has been executed.

 negatively, endeavours to determine what principles of causation,

 consistently with the doctrine that the secondary qualities of bodies
 are to be explained by means of the primary. His conclusion is,
 that we are at liberty, in constructing an hypothesis as to the mode
 of action of matter on matter, to introduce a new principle of causa
 tion (which he calls (force)*), bearing the same relation to force that
 force does to velocity; and further, that following the analogy here
 suggested, we may introduce an indefinite number of such principles,
 viz. (force)*... (force)", &c., all essentially distinct from one another,
 and from those previously recognised.
     But, on the other hand, he conceives that it is necessary to reject
 any modification of qualitative action; and that consequently physical
  science, though it may cease to be wholly mechanical, will yet always
 continue to be cinematical, in the largest sense of which this word
  (so far as relates to local motion) can admit.
     June 5.—Methods of Integrating Partial Differential Equations.
  By Prof. De Morgan.
     This paper contains a sketch of two distinct methods.         In the first
  (r, y, z, p, q, r, s, t, having their usual significations) the given equa
  tion is supposed to be of the form p(r, y, p, q)=0, and this is made
  the result of elimination between two equations involving a new
  variable v.     From these two, and their four differentials of the first
  order, p, q, r, s, t are eliminated, and an equation of the first order

 results between w, y, v. This last equation is often more manageable
 than the original one.
     The process is rendered very simple when the given equation can
 be reduced to depend on two of the form
                      p=2(r, y, v) q=p(x, y, v).
 The second method was completed, Mr. De Morgan states, and out
 of his hands for transmission to the Society, when he discovered that
 Mouge had communicated it to the Institute, by which body it was
 never published. But M. Chasles found it among the manuscripts
 of the Institute, and stated it a few years ago in one of the notes to
 his Apergu Historique. . . . des Méthodes en Géométrie. Its occurrence
 in the voluminous additions made to a work which itself treats only
 of geometry, seems to have prevented it from becoming known to
 any writer on the differential calculus. Certain particular cases
 appear in the writings of Legendre and Lacroix.
     Let the equation be p(x, y, z, p, q, r, s, t)=0. Change r into p,
 y into q, 2 into pay-H qy–2, p into a, q into y, r into rt — s?, s into

 grated, let its solution be Z=\!/(X, Y). Then the solution of the
 original equation can be obtained by eliminating X, Y, Z from
           Z=}(X, Y) was dZ            = d/ z=rx+yy—Z.

     In both methods the most effective mode of proceeding is to find
 what Lagrange calls a primary solution, containing two arbitrary con
 stants, and then to use that primary solution.

  ON THE RIPENING OF FRUITS AND THE GELATINoUS BODIES
                 OF VEGETABLES.         BY M. E. FREMY.
Tº: author gives the following summary of the facts detailed in
        his memoir on the above-named subjects:—
     i. There exists in the tissues of vegetables, and principally in the
pulps of fruits and of roots, a substance insoluble in water, which he
has named pectose; its characteristic property is that of being con
verted into pectin, by the influence of the weakest acids. It differs
essentially from cellulose in all its properties.
     2. Pectin exists in the juices of ripe fruits; it may be artificially
obtained by causing boiling weakly acid liquors to act upon pectose.
Pectin ought to be considered as a weak acid; it does not precipitate
the neutral acetate of lead, and changes into pectic acid under the
influence of soluble bases.
    3. Pectin, submitted for some time to the action of boiling    water,
acquires the property of precipitating neutral acetate of lead, and is
converted into a new substance which M. Fremy calls parapectin;

  .ruits.
     is neutral to test-papers, and occurs in the juices of perfectly ripe
     4. Parapectin is transformed, under the influence of acids, into a
  substance which the author calls metapectin; it has the properties
  of a weak acid, reddens tincture of litmus, and precipitates chloride
  of barium; it may be named metapectinic acid.
     5. The preceding substances form compounds which are soluble
 in a certain number of acids, and principally with sulphuric and
 oxalic acids. These compounds are crystallizable, and form gela
 tinous precipitates with alcohol.
     6. There accompanies pectose in vegetable tissues, a peculiar
 ferment called by M. Fremy pectase; this has the property of trans
 forming pectin successively into two gelatinous acids, which are the
 pectosic and pectic acids; this change occurs without the presence
 of air or the disengagement of gas, and constitutes the pectic fer
 mentation, which may be compared to the lactic fermentation. Pec
 tase exists in vegetables in two states, one soluble and the other
 insoluble.
     7. When pectin is submitted to the action of pectase, the acid
 first formed is a new acid, the pectosic; it differs from pectic acid in
 being completely soluble in boiling water.
     8. Pectosic acid is transformed into pectic acid by the prolonged
 action of pectase; the pectosic and pectic acids are also formed when
 pectin is added to an alkali either free or carbonated, or under the
 influence of lime, barytes, or strontia.
    9. Pectic acid dissolves in considerable quantity in neutral alkaline
 salts, and especially in ammoniacal salts, which contain an organic
 acid; gelatinous double salts with an acid reaction are then formed,
 which are precipitated in a gelatinous state by alcohol.
     10. Pectic acid, kept for several hours in boiling water, completely
dissolves, and is transformed into a new acid, the parapéctic acid.
    11. Parapectic acid changes, under the long-continued influence
of water, into a powerful acid, the metapectic acid.
    These two last acids arise under several circumstances, and prin
cipally by the reaction of acids, alkalies, or of pectase, pectin and
pectic acid; they possess the property of decomposing by ebullition
the double tartrate of potash and copper, like glucose.
    12. Gelatinous substances exposed to a temperature of 392°Fahr.
disengage water and carbonic acid, and are converted into a black
pyrogenous acid, which the author calls pyropectic acid.
    13. Gelatinous substances exhibit all the generic characters of
acids, the capacity of saturation and their power augmenting in
proportion as they recede from pectose; they appear to be all derived
from a ternary molecule C8 H* O7, and differ from each other only
as to Water.
    14. The properties of the gelatinous substances of vegetables
afford an explanation of the alterations which a fruit undergoes
when submitted to the action of heat, as well as of the formation
vegetable jellies. Vegetable jellies may be produced—1st, by the con
version of pectin into pectosic    º

of pectase; 2ndly, by the combination of pectic acid with the or
ganic acids contained in fruits.                                        -
   15. The pectose contained in green fruits is successively trans
formed, during ripening, into pectin, metapectin, and metapectic
acids. These changes are determined by the influence of acids and
pectase.
   It will appear from this summary, in the opinion of the author,
that after having ascertained the nature of the principal properties
of the substances which constitute the pulp of certain fruits, he was
led to observe that the gelatinous substances of vegetables undergo
modifications by the influence of reagents entirely comparable to
those to which they are subject during vegetation.—Ann, de Ch. et
de Phys., Septembre 1848.
ON SULPHoMoRPHIDE AND SULPHONARCOTIDE, DERIVATIVEs
   FROM MORPHIA AND NARCOTINA.                         B.Y. M.M. LAURENT AND
   GER HARDT.                            -
   In 1845 M. Arppe described a peculiar substance which he ob
tained by treating morphia with an excess of sulphuric acid. To
this compound he assigned the formula 4(C35 H40 Nº O6)+5SO,
which is not analogous to any organic compound.
   On considering the manner in which this compound is obtained,
the authors thought that its composition would resemble that of the
amides and anilides; and their experiments supported this suppo
sition: they obtained a similar compound with narcotina.
   Sulphomorphide.—This substance was prepared according to M.
Arppe's process, by heating morphia with a slight excess of sul
phuric acid. When recently prepared it is white, but eventually it
becomes green, even in closed tubes; this colour is especially deep
ened by drying the product at 266° to 302°Fahr.; it is permanent,
and does not appear to be owing to the action of the air, for the
corresponding product, prepared with narcotina, is immediately ob
tained of a deep green colour.
   Sulphomorphide is a fixed body; heated on platina foil it yields
a bulky charcoal, which is extremely difficult to burn. By analysis
 100 parts yield—
                          Carbon ...... 63-0
                          Hydrogen . . . . 5-8
                          Sulphur... . . . 5'4
These results lead to the formula C34 H36 N2O8 S, that is to say, to
the formula of neutral sulphate of morphia, minus two equivs. of
water, SO" (H2, C17H3NO2)—2OH*; these proportions require

                                       632
   It is to be observed, that the quantity of carbon obtained by ana

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                   397
 lysis is rather too small; but similar errors are inevitable with bodies
which are uncrystallizable and difficult to burn. M. Arppe ob
tained still less carbon (61.2) than the authors.
    Boiling nitric acid attacks sulphomorphide and forms sulphuric
 acid; water added to the solution precipitates a yellow flocculent
 matter, soluble in ammonia.             As no gas is liberated during the for
 mation of sulphomorphide, and as the sulphuric liquid contains no
 other substance, the formula given seems sufficiently controlled by
 the preceding analysis.
    Sulphonarcotide.—When narcotinamoistened with water is heated
 with a slight excess of sulphuric acid, a solution is obtained which
 becomes of a deep brown colour when more strongly heated, and
 eventually thickens. No gas is liberated during this reaction; the
 mixture is to be diluted with water and boiled, thrown on a filter
 and washed with cold water, in which it appears to be insoluble. It
 dissolves in alcohol, but it is not deposited from it in crystals.
    This product behaves like sulphomorphide; when calcined on
 platina foil, it yields much charcoal very difficult to burn; subjected
 to distillation, it yields water and oily matter of a foetid odour. By
 analysis 100 parts yielded
                           Carbon . . . . . . 59' 1
                           Hydrogen ....            5-3
                           Sulphur. . . . . .       3-6
 These correspond to a formula represented by neutral sulphate of
 narcotina, minus two equivs. of water,SO4(H2,2C*H*NO7)—2OH".
 This formula requires—
                     C40 . . . . . . . .  552 . . . . . . 60-2
                     H48. . . . . . ...    48 . . . . . .  5-2

                                          916
    Ammonia does not act upon sulphonarcotide, potash dissolves it
 with a brown colour, and acids separate in the green state. When
 boiled with nitric acid, sulphonarcotide gives sulphuric acid, and also
  a yellow matter soluble in ammonia.
     Sulphomorphide and sulphonarcotide evidently belong to the same
  class of bodies as the amides and the anilides; they are to the sul
  phates of morphia and narcotina, what sulphamide and sulphanilide
  are to the sulphates of ammonia and aniline. Certainly it has not
  been possible to separate morphia and narcotina from them; but it
  must be remembered, that with respect to the anilides this regenera
  tion requires the intervention of a high temperature, and that this ne
  cessarily acts destructively on non-volatile alkaloids, like morphia
  and narcotina-Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Septembre 1848.

    Uranite has therefore a composition similar to that of chalkolite,
 its formula being [PA O3, Caº O, 2U8 O* O-H-8 aq]. It is to be ob
 served that the formula long since proposed by M. Berzelius agrees
 exactly with that of M. Werther.
    M. Werther obtained chalkolite artificially by the following pro
 cess —He took the salt of uranium [Pº O3, H2O, 2U8 O2 O-H-8 aq],
 and boiled it for some time with a solution of subacetate of copper,
 decanted the liquid, digested the residue with acetic acid, and washed
it perfectly: he thus obtained a greenish powder, which presented
by the microscope the unaltered crystals of the phosphate of uranium
which he had employed.             This product contained 14.6 per cent. of
water, and 8.7 per cent. of oxide of copper.—Journ. de Ph. et de Ch.,

    SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES OF
                                       WIENNA,
   The Wiener Zeitung of the 28th September last contains a report
of the proceedings of a Meeting held at the Imperial Mint of Vienna,
on the 22nd of the same month, at which Bergrath Haidinger pre
sided.
    The President communicated to the Meeting that his application
to the Government respecting the formation of a Society of the
Natural Sciences had received the following favourable answer:—
“According to an announcement made by the Minister of the In
terior on the 22nd of July of the present year, His Majesty the
Emperor and King, by a Decree of the 18th of July, has been gra
ciously pleased to sanction the formation of the Society proposed by
you, under the appellation of The Society of the Friends of the Na
tural Sciences of Vienna (Gesellschaft der Freunde der Naturwissen
schaften in Wien).” Circumstances inevitably resulting from the
existing state of affairs, and the summer-months during which so
many scientific men and others interested are absent from the ca
pital, render it unavoidable to postpone for a time the General
Meeting which is necessary to be held for the formal constitution
of the Society. Notice of this Meeting will be duly given.                       -

 nature, one of which was from Dr. Friedrich Bialloblotzky of Hanover,
 giving an outline of his intended journey into a totally unknown
 part of Africa.    The position of the sources of the Nile is a problem,
 which, from the earliest ages down to the present time, has given
 rise to numerous geographical inquiries. Hypotheses of various kinds
 have been formed and rejected; and all that is certain is that nothing
 positive is known on the subject. The recent expeditions up the Nile
 have reached only the 4th degree of north latitude, beyond which, ac
 cording to the statements of the natives, the river extends a distance
 of thirty days’ journey further to the south. In a valuable commu
 nication made by Dr. Beke to the British Association for the Ad
 vancement of Science at the late Meeting at Swansea", the infor
 mation collected by himself in Abyssinia was compared with the
 results arrived at by other travellers; and it was clearly shown that
 the essential point to be determined is, whether the Upper Basin of
 the Nile is not bounded towards the east by a continuous mountain
 range, stretching from north-east to south-west, as far as the fourth
 degree of south latitude, or even further; the waters from which
 mountain range are received into the main stream of the river flowing
 from south to north. At the instance of Dr. Beke, Dr. Bialloblotzky
 has now undertaken the task of attempting the solution of this
problem by a method directly opposite to that hitherto adopted.
 For this purpose, he will proceed by the way of Aden to Mombás,
on the east coast of Africa, in about 4° S. lat. ; which place will be
regarded as the starting-point of his journey. Having hastily crossed
the unhealthy districts near the coast, the traveller will penetrate
more slowly into the upper country, making friends with the native
tribes as he proceeds, so as to ensure a more favourable reception
from those residing further in the interior. This is expected to oc
cupy him a twelvemonth: he then calculates on being engaged two
years more in exploring the mountain country; and should circum
stances prove favourable, the enterprise may possibly be completed
by a voyage down the Nile to the Mediterranean.
  ON THE DISTILLED WATERS OF CHERRY-LAUREL AND BITTER
                      ALMONDS.      BY M. LEPAGE.
   The author having made numerous experiments on the above pre
parations, the following is a summary of the inferences deducible
from them.
    1. Volatile oil and hydrocyanic acid pre-exist in large quantity in
the green leaves of the cherry-laurel; these two products are readily
separated by means of aether.
   2. Exsiccation completely dissipates the volatile oil and hydrocy
anic acid, and consequently deprives them of their medicinal and
poisonous properties.                                                 -
   3. There occurs, however, a principle in the dry leaves which
cold water is unfit to remove, but which is taken up by boiling
water, or still better by alcohol. This principle, put into contact
with milk of sweet almonds, acts like a solution of amygdalin.

October 1848, vol. xlv. pp. 221–251.

   4. There is no advantage in allowing before distillation the green
leaves of the cherry-laurel to macerate in water, even with the addi
tion of the milk of sweet almonds, for the purpose of preparing a
stronger distilled water; for the cold water does not dissolve the
substance contained in these leaves analogous to amygdalin, and
susceptible of being transformed by emulsion into hydruret of ben
zoyle and prussic acid.
   5. In the decoction remaining after distilling the leaves of the
cherry-laurel, the bitter matter described by Winkler always occurs;
this is susceptible of being transformed into essential oil and hydro
cyanic acid by almond emulsion.
   6. Cherry-laurel water distilled from dry leaves, first macerated
in boiling water, to which milk of sweet almonds is added when
cold, contains hydrocyanic acid and volatile oil, but in much smaller
quantity than that prepared with fresh leaves; the dry leaves ought,
therefore, never to be substituted for them.
   7. The water prepared with the dry leaves macerated in cold
water, before distillation, contains also a quantity of hydrocyanic acid,
but no quantity of volatile oil appreciable by the minutest tests.
    8. The various reagents which it is convenient to employ to ap:
preciate the quantity of distilled bitter almond and cherry-laurel
waters may be divided into two classes:
    First Class.—Reagents which serve to prove the presence of hy
 drocyanic acid; these are nitrate of silver, acid sulphate of ferroso
ferric oxide of iron and potash, and protosalts of mercury:
    Second Class.-Reagents which serve to prove the presence of the
 volatile oil; these are, ammonia, ammoniuret of copper, iodine and
 bromine: chlorine, which was not tried, might probably act like the
 two last.
    9. Ammonia, the sulphate and the sulphotartrate of quina, cannot
 be employed to determine the strength of distilled cherry-laurel and
 bitter almond waters; but chloride of gold employed cold and in
 proper proportion, appears suitable for this purpose. When this salt
 reacts upon the hot distilled waters, hydrochloric acid is formed and
 cyanide of gold is deposited by concentrating the liquors.
    10. The distilled waters above-named, when exposed to the action
 of the air in wide open vessels, simply covered with paper, lose,
 after a certain time, all the oil and acid which they contain; the
 bitter almond water requiring about a month, and the cherry-laurel
 water, which is more stable, ten weeks to three months.
     11. These distilled waters also undergo the same alteration in well
 closed vessels if partly empty; but when the vessel is small, and not
 too frequently opened, the waters scarcely lose their active principles
 in four or five months.
     12. At the expiration of twelve months these waters, kept in ves
 sels perfectly filled and with glass stoppers, lost none of their active
 principles. In this case, as also when kept in partially full bottles,
 there occurs, aftera certaintime, a deposit of a lightyellowishsediment.
     13. Lastly, a small quantity of an ammoniacal salt always occurs in
 these distilled waters when they have undergone change.—Journ.

           ON METALLIC CARBONATES.          BY M. J. LEFORT.
    The author obtained the metallic carbonates which he examined
by treating the salts with neutral alkaline carbonates and bicarbo
nates, both cold and hot.
    Carbonate of Manganese obtained by the above methods is always
represented by CO2+MnO-H HO. When heated it begins to lose
water at about 194°F; it may be rendered perfectly anhydrous
without any notable change of colour; it does not absorb oxygen
below 576°F.; it is a white powder with a rose tint.
    Carbonate of Cadmium.—Almost all treatises on Chemistry gives
CO2+ CdC as the formula of this compound; the author's analyses
prove that it always contains 4 to 5 per cent. of water, or half an
equivalent; this it loses between 180° and 248°F. Its composition
is then 2CO3 + CdC) +HO.
     Carbonate of Nickel.—Oxide of nickel forms three perfectly defi
nite compounds with carbonic acid:—
     1. A basic carbonate whenever cold solutions of the salts of nickel
 are precipitated by cold solutions of neutral carbonates. It is of an
 apple-green colour, and represented by 2GO2+5NiO-F8HO.
     2. A sesquibasic carbonate; the colour very nearly resembles that
 of the preceding; it is formed when the salts of nickel are treated
 with bicarbonates.     Its formula is 2CO2 +3NiO +6HO.
     3. A pentabasic carbonate, which may be prepared by boiling the
 two preceding salts, or still better precipitating the hot solutions of
 the salts of nickel by neutral carbonate of potash or soda. Its
 colour is meadow-green, and its formula CO2 +5NiO +5HO.
      Carbonate of Chromium.—The salts of sesquioxide of chromium
 give with the alkaline carbonates and bicarbonates, sometimes a pe
  culiar hydrate, and sometimes a definite compound represented by
 CO2+Crº O3-H4HO. When sulphuret of chromium of the green
 variety is treated with a neutral or alkaline bicarbonate, all the car
  bonic acid is disengaged, and hydrate of sesquioxide of chromium is
  at the same time precipitated; but if the operation be conducted
  with a salt of the violet blue modification, the salt formed is always
  that of the above-stated composition.
      Carbonate of sesquioxide of chromium, exposed to the action of
  heat, loses at about 167°F., 19:58 per cent. of water, which cor
  responds to three equivalents; it does not lose its last equivalent of
  water and its carbonic acid till heated to above 572°F.
      Carbonate of Bismuth exists in the anhydrous and hydrated state.
      It is anhydrous whenever a salt of bismuth, as neutral as possible,
  is treated with an alkaline carbonate either cold or hot; no carbonic
   acid is evolved, and the precipitate formed has always the formula
   CO2 Biº O3.    But if instead of a neutral carbonate a bicarbonate is
   employed, much acid is disengaged, and a white precipitate, much
   lighter than the preceding, is obtained, represented by CO2 Biº O3 +
   HO ; it loses its equivalent of water at 212° to 248°F.
       Carbonate of Lead.—Carbonate of lead obtained by treating a salt of
   lead with a neutral or bicarbonated alkali, possesses, as has been long
   known, the formula CO2+PbO; but when hot solutions are used, the
   composition is very different, and represented by 2GO2+3PbO-H-HO.

  402           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
     This composition is the same as that which MM. Mulder, Link and
  Hochstetter have found to exist in the different ceruses of commerce.
     The author states that some comparative trials made by artists,
  have satisfied him that this new ceruse covers as well as those of the
  best manufactures in France, and it is less hurtful to workmen than
  the common operation.—Comptes Rendus, September 4, 1848.
       META-ANTIMONIATE OF AMMONIA.                BY M. E. FREMY.
     The author observes that this salt has not hitherto been described
 by any chemist. It was prepared by first precipitating, with a great
 quantity of water, very pure perchloride of antimony, in order to
 obtain hydrated meta-antimonic acid; this acid was allowed to re
 main during several weeks in a concentrated solution of ammonia.
    The meta-antimonic acid dissolved slowly in the ammonia, and pro
 duced a meta-antimoniate of ammonia, containing one equivalent
 of acid and two equivalents of ammonia, corresponding to the bibasic
 salt of potash, Sb2O3, 2KO.
    The bibasic meta-antimoniate of ammonia appears difficult to se
 parate; but when a few drops of alcohol are added to the aqueous
 solution, a crystalline salt is precipitated containing one equivalent
 of acid and one of base, and corresponding to the acid meta-anti
 moniate of potash.
    It yielded by analysis 68.1 per cent. of meta-antimonic acid; repre
 senting the meta-antimoniate of ammonia by the formula Sb2O3,
Az H8, HO-H-6HO, theory gives 5.6 per cent. of azote, 68.2 of meta
antimonic acid, and 4.0 of hydrogen.
    This salt contains one equivalent of water less than the meta-an
 timoniate of potash, Sb2O3, KO, 7HO. This partial loss of water
is probably owing to the alcohol employed to precipitate the ammo
niacal salt.
    The meta-antimoniate of ammonia may be employed to charac
terise the salts of soda ; for it precipitates this base from its solutions
 with the same facility as the meta-antimoniate of potash.
    The author observes, that he has before stated that the antimo
niate of potash completely loses its solubility in water by being ren
dered anhydrous; the meta-antimoniate of ammonia undergoes a
similar transformation, becoming also almost insoluble by losing a
part of its water; this effect is produced by subjecting it to a very
slight increase of temperature.
   When this salt is boiled in water, it loses its crystalline appearance
and becomes a white powder, which is the insoluble antimoniate of
ammonia; in this case no trace of ammonia is given out.
   When antimonic or meta-antimonic acid is dissolved with heat in
ammonia, it is always the insoluble antimoniate of ammonia which
separates on cooling : the crystalline meta-antimoniate of ammonia
can be obtained only by the cold digestion of the meta-antimonic
acid in ammonia; yet it sometimes happens that a large proportion
of the meta-antimoniate changes into amorphous antimoniate of am
monia. This loss of water appears to be produced when too great
an excess of ammonia is employed. The meta-antimoniate of am

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                403
monia has the curious property of being spontaneously convertible,
at common temperatures, into insoluble antimoniate; all the speci
mens which M. Fremy prepared underwent this change.
   Crystalline and perfectly dry meta-antimoniate of ammonia was
put into well-corked bottles: after a lapse of some days, the crystals
had become slightly moist and farinaceous; they had completely
lost their solubility in water, and were converted into antimoniate.
   The formula representing this salt is Sb2O3, Az H3, HO,4HO; it
differs from the meta-antimoniate of ammonia by containing two
equivalents less of water.
   The authorconcludes from his experiments that there exist two anti
monic acids, requiring differentouantities of base to form neutral salts.
   The bi-meta-antimoniates are isomeric with the neutral antimo
niates; these two classes of salts are readily distinguished from each
other; the first precipitates the salts of soda and the second does
not.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Août 1848.
                          GRESHAM COLLEGE,
   “Of Gresham College it may be truly said that no foundation of
the present day is based upon more liberal and comprehensive prin
ciples.   The first of these is, that instruction in different sciences
should be given gratuitously to all who wish to receive it: the
second, that the professors be chosen with a sole regard to their
character and attainments, and without any reference to their attach
ment to, or dissent from, the established church.       The boundaries of
science have been largely widened since Gresham's time; but there
is nothing in his will to limit the range of his professors, or to prevent
any addition to their number.       The professor of geometry may em
brace the entire subject of practical mechanics, or the professor of
physic may lecture on chemistry, botany, or physiology.
   “Up to the year 1768, the professors resided and lectured at the
spacious mansion of Sir Thomas Gresham in Broad Street, There
Briggs, Barrow, Hook, Gunter, Sir William Petty, and Sir Christo
pher Wren, gave their lectures as professors of the College: there
Newton, Boyle, Halley, and other eminent men of science joined
them, and formed the Royal Society, which continued to meet for
fifty years under its roof. The rents and profits of the Royal Ex
change were bequeathed by Gresham for the support of his College,
the trustees being the Corporation of London, and the members of
the Mercers' Company.
   “It will hardly be believed that such an institution, beneficial to
all, burdensome to none, should have been destroyed by an act of
parliament.    But so it was.      The means employed to effect this
barbarous and nefarious transaction are not known, and can only be
conjectured. The result is, that the government of the present day
possesses a site in the most valuable part of London, equal in size
to that covered by the Bank of England, for about 150l. per year.
Meanwhile the professors were driven to lecture in a small room in
the Royal Exchange. Every motive to exertion was destroyed,
since any endeavour to assemble an audience in a room of such
scanty dimensions would have been absurd.          In such circumstances,

404           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the lectures ceased to excite any interest or attention, those for
whom they were designed being practically excluded from them.
   “In the year 1837 the Exchange was burnt down, and the cost of
erecting the new one devolved on the trustees, to whom, as a tem
porary lecture-hall, was offered the theatre of the City of London
School; a room capable of holding 500 persons. It now remained
to be seen whether Gresham College was a worn-out institution,
and unsuited to the present state of science and of society, or whether
it was still able to realize the intentions of its founder.
    “The trial exhibited a regular increase in the number of hearers,
varying according to the general interest of the subjects, but always
sufficient to show that the public attention, and especially that of
the citizens of London, was directed to the re-establishment of the
College. Several years elapsed before the building of the new Ex
change began; and by this time the rebuilding of the College was
no longer regarded as a doubtful or uncertain affair. A piece of
ground belonging to the Corporation, at the junction of Cateaton
(now Gresham) and Basinghall Street, was fixed on for the site, and
there Gresham College stands. It was opened on the 2nd of No
vember 1843. Since that time, the number of hearers has gradually
increased; having been in Michaelmas term of that year 2451, and in
the corresponding term of last year 2940; so that the four terms give
an aggregate attendance of from 10,000 to 12,000 persons per annum,
    “When Gresham College was razed to the ground by a decree of
the legislature, had the ground on which it stood, and by which it
was surrounded (reaching from Broad Street to Bishopsgate), been
let out on building leases, the income arising from it would now
have been nearly 10,000l. per annum, instead of the pitiful sum for
which it was bartered away. It might have been anticipated that
the present government of the country, having professed so much
zeal for popular education, would have gladly done an act of tardy
justice to an institution especially founded for, and dedicated to, the
service of the people, without distinction of rank, sex, or sect—an
institution fettered by no obsolete usages, but in active and useful
operation, as far as its means allowed. These, at present, are very
slender, owing to the heavy debt which the Gresham trust incurred
by building the Royal Exchange and the College.
    “That the munificent design of its founder has been but partially
 carried out, is true; but this has arisen from events which he could
not foresee. He left, in the Royal Exchange, what he regarded as
 an ample revenue for his College.        And such it was, till its de
 struction in the great fire of London brought on the trust the heavy
 charge of rebuilding it; and before this debt was liquidated, the
 second Exchange shared the fate of the first, and occasioned a re
 newal of the debt.     These were casualties which he did not con
 template; but still less would he have imagined that the govern
 ment of England would, by an act of the legislature, have compelled
his trustees to expend 1800l. of the revenues of the College in its
 destruction, and thus deprive London of his munificent bequest.
    “It is, however, satisfactory to reflect that the germ of the institu
 tion yet remains; that its advantages, even with its present limited

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              405
means, are extending; and that Gresham's generous wish of instruc
tion for all is, as far as it can be, realized.”—Chambers' Edinburgh
Journal, Sept. 30, 1848.
    Views of an entirely opposite kind to those expressed in the above
extract, in favour of the liberal and comprehensive character of the
Gresham trust, have been put forth in another publication.
     In a series of articles in the Mechanics' Magazine (July 22, &c.),
commenced on the recent occurrence of a vacancy in the Gresham
 Professorship of Geometry, and obviously written for the express
 purpose of urging the exclusive claims of one particular candidate,
 the narrowest possible limitation of the duties of the chair of Geometry
 is insisted upon, under the pretence that “by Geometry Sir Thomas
 Gresham meant GeoMETRY ;” that as there was an old ordinance that
 the lecturers should “read their lectures in their hoods, according
 to their degrees in the Universities,” therefore, “none but members
 of the Universities were eligible”; and then furthermore that “Mr.
 Potts was the only man in either University now fairly before the
 world with any legitimate claims,” &c.
     Professor De Morgan's testimonial in favour of the same candidate,
 is merely conditional, and commences with a very important “if,”
  which involves the question of the justice of this limitation. “IF,”
  says he, “the word Geometry be used in the limited sense [the an
  cient Geometry], then Mr. Potts has very high claims indeed; for
  he is one of the very few persons who have paid attention to that
  now rather neglected subject. In fact, the word being thus used, there
  are but two or three persons on whom the choice would properly
  fall.”—A testimonial thus qualified, and resting merely upon great
  proficiency in Geometry in the narrowest possible sense of the term,
  may probably have been considered as any thing but a recommenda
  tion, such a choice being likely to restrict the lectures in an institu
  tion essentially popular to a branch of the subject which engages
  the attention of “but two or three persons.”
      That the term Geometry, as connected with the Gresham College,
  was to be taken in no such narrow sense, appears certainly to have
  been the opinion of its distinguished ornament Dr. Barrow, who seems
  especially to have had in view the relations and applications of Geo
  metry to various purposes of science and of art, as Optics, Archi
  tecture, Navigation, Fortification, Geodesy, Mechanics, Geography,
   Astronomy, as well as Logic, and mental culture and delight. The
   conclusion of his inaugural discourse in Gresham College, 1662, is
   well deserving the attention of those who desire that these lectures
   may now be made extensively useful.
      “Quinimo institutum hoc nostrum quo lubentius aggrediamur, et
   persequamur laetius, animos addat timidis, et tardis subdataculeos,
   illius cui operam addicemus disciplinae ingens utilitas insignisque
   praestantia. Neque enim spinosis tenellas mentes subtilitatibus
      * Nothing can be more ridiculous than to assume on such frivolous
   grounds that the choice is limited to members of the Universities. Wood

   had already held the office of Gresham Professor of Physic for some years
   before he entered the University.—He is said to have been apprenticed to
   a linen-draper.

  LXIII. On the Atomic Weight of Molybdenum and some of its
         Compounds.      By L. Svan BERG and H. Struve”.

                               Introduction.
  FoRMERLY             all those minerals occurring in nature which
       possessed a leaden hue and rubbed off were designated
  by the name of molybdena. Under this name were therefore
  comprised, not only certain plombiferous minerals, but others
: widely different, as graphite, the native sulphuret of molyb
- denum, and manganese ore. With the progress of science
  these minerals were more carefully examined and distin
  guished from each other. Cronstedt was the first who separated
: plumbago from the sulphuret of molybdena as distinct,
  although closely allied minerals. The views respecting these
  minerals were however long divided. Many persons, from
  the similar action of heat upon them, both being volatilized,
  and their similar outward appearance, asserted them to be of
  the same nature. It was naturally impossible to decide this
  question by mere external characters; and it consequently re
  mained doubtful until chemistry made an advance, or in other
  words, until it became evident that all questions could not be
  correctly solved by the mere examination in the dry way:
     It was reserved for Scheelet, who may justly be termed the
  founder of chemistry in the humid way, and who showed what
  conclusions might be drawn from the combinations obtained,
  to establish, in a memoir which he laid before the Royal
  Academy of Stockholm in 1778, the differences between gra
  phite and the native sulphuret of molybdenum, by the disco

410      MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
very of a peculiar metallic calx. This metallic calx, so termed
by Scheele according to the then prevailing language in che
mistry, was said to occur in and characterise the sulphuret of
molybdenum. Scheele prepared the molybdena (molybdenjerd)
by treating the mineral with nitric acid, and showed that this
earth possessed the properties of an acid. It combines with
potash to form a salt which separates in small crystals, which
expels carbonic acid when treated with carbonate of potash, and
yields the neutral salt. In like manner it unites with the vo
latile alkali, and leaves a gray powder when this compound is
heated, the alkali being volatilized. Scheele showed that the
acid was volatile, and entered into easily soluble combinations
with sulphuric and muriatic acids, and that these solutions rea
dily assumed a blue colour when kept for some time, and also
when placed in contact with metals. This colour again dis
appears upon the addition of some nitric acid, and Scheele
thence explained the phaenomenon of the blue colour to be a
reduction, or as he expressed it, “this is owing to the circum
stance that the molybdenum calx readily absorbs phlogiston.”
Scheele showed that the molybdenum calx, which is obtained
by deflagrating the mineral with nitre and precipitation with
an acid, behaves differently from the pure acid, and proved
that this was owing to the retention of a small quantity of alkali.
He finally asserts that the mineral molybdenum consists of a
new metallic acid mineralized by sulphur.
    This subject engaged the attention of several chemists after
Scheele; however, they added very little to our knowledge of
the new body, but were principally engaged in confirming the
discoveries made by Scheele. Among these Pelletier” stands
first, in 1785. He could not explain the nature of graphite,
which mineral he likewise examined, but he showed that it
was perfectly distinct from molybdenum in its properties.
Pelletier prepared the calx by roasting the molybdenum ore,
and drew from his experiments the conclusion that the mineral
was a combination of a metal with sulphur. He was likewise
the first who attempted to produce molybdenum in the metal
lic state, and some alloys of it with copper, iron, silver, &c.
Ilsemannt worked upon the same subject in 1787, and contra
dicted the statements of all former chemists respecting the
volatility of the molybdic acid and the presence of sulphur in
the mineral. This induced Pelletier to return to the subject<U+017F>,
and so to substantiate still further his former observations.

   About the same time Heger* prepared the combinations of
molybdic acid with potash and soda, and stated that a portion
of the potash salt might be obtained in small, colourless cry
stals of the form of six-sided prisms having their terminal edges
truncated, but that the greater portion consisted of flattened
prisms. He asserted, in opposition to the earlier statements,
that a pure acid might be prepared by precipitating the potash
salt with nitric acid.          Ruprechti made some experiments
upon molybdenum in 1790 without adding in the least to our
stock of knowledge.
    During this period, from 1788 to 1792, Hjelmf published
his experiments on molybdenum. His principal object was the
reduction of the acid, and the obtaining a fused regulus of
metal, and also its alloys with other metals; but at the same
time he describes the behaviour of the acid towards several
metallic oxides. Hjelm's experiments clearly proved the me
tallic nature of molybdenum; and it may be said of these ex
periments, that they were the last which were made with this
substance, according to the phlogistic theory, to decide as to
the distinctness of the new metal.               The ease with which mo
lybdic acid is reduced, the fusion to a button of the metal
obtained, the metallic lustre, the specific gravity and brittle
ness, and the properties of the alloys were the objects of in
vestigation. It will be seen from this how slow the path
pointed out by Scheele was generally adopted. Scheele taught
us the moist way, to render the metals soluble, and to ascer
tain and determine from the phaenomena then presented the
chemical behaviour of bodies.
    In 1799 Richter § fixed his attention especially upon the
blue compound of molybdenum, and showed that it might be
produced most easily by the action of tin upon a solution of
molybdic acid in muriatic acid. He prepared the compounds
of molybdic acid with the oxides of lead and silver, ascertained
their sparing solubility in water, and their ready solubility in
dilute nitric acid; he moreover determined the saturating
capacity of molybdic acid with regard to magnesia and mu
riatic acid, and so prepared the way for those researches
which were subsequently to be carried out quantitatively.
    Thus for nearly a quarter of a century several chemists had
 experimented upon this new metal, and nevertheless at the end
 of this time little more was known of it than what its discoverer

412        MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
had described. An important contribution to a more accurate
knowledge of this metal was now published by Buchholz".
He directs the same method for the preparation of the mo
lybdic acid as that employed by Hjelm, without, apparently
being aware that it had been described by him. He like
wise states that the acid may be obtained pure and free from
alkali when the soda salt is treated with nitric acid.                   Two
years later Buchholzf published a more complete investi
gation of molybdenum, in which his attention was principally
drawn to its several oxides.           He admits six oxides, but is
not able to give good methods for preparing them pure. He
also analysed molybdic acid and the native sulphuret with
tolerable accuracy. He likewise describes a higher sulphuret
than the native mineral, but has no correct idea of the peculiar
nature of this compound; he was acquainted with its solubi
lity in caustic alkalies and in alkaline sulphurets. We see in
him how a man of science opens a new path in experimenting
in order to explain all the phaenomena, even to the minutest
details.
     The metallic nature of molybdenum was now ascertained
beyond all doubt; but there was wanting the man who should
lead us out of the labyrinth of white, blue, gray, yellow, brown
and red compounds which Buchholz had produced under dif
ferent circumstances. The exploring of this labyrinth was
connected with the theory which, under the name of the theory
of definite chemical proportions, will hand down the name
of Berzelius to a late posterity. By experiments which Ber
zeliusf made in the year 1818, he showed that molybdenum
required a certain quantity of oxygen in order to . In] O
lybdic acid; and by the analysis of the neutral molybdate of
lead, a subject to which we shall return in the third section of
our memoir, he ascertained the number representing the atomic
weight of molybdenum, assuming 100 as the atomic weight of
oxygen.
    After this was fixed, Brandes S published his analyses of
some molybdates. He showed that molybdic acid forms with
ammonia two distinct crystalline salts, although he gives merely
the analysis of one. He also analysed the neutral soda salt,
and prepared several insoluble salts by double decomposition.

of molybdenum should be admitted, which however, by com
bining with one another, were capable of producing several
intermediate combinations.        These combinations, which have
very peculiar and distinct characters, had confused those
chemists who had previously experimented with this metal.
The method of preparing these oxides, their characteristic
combinations with acids, formed the chief object of the me
moir.     Soon after Berzelius” examined the behaviour of mo
lybdenum towards sulphur, and that of the sulphuret of mo
lybdenum towards electro-positive sulphurets, when he disco
vered and accurately examined all that we have hitherto
known on this subject.
                               PART I.
              Behaviour of Molybdic Acid to Bases.
   After this historical introduction, we will now pass on to
our experiments, the principal object of which was the most
accurate determination possible of the atomic weight of mo
lybdenum. In the present state of chemistry, neither pains
nor time should be spared to determine the atomic weights of
the simple bodies as accurately as possible, for it is connected
with the important question, what elements have such num
bers for equivalents as may be expressed by multiples of the
equivalent of hydrogen, and how far can this be admitted as a
general law. §. if we find, in fact, that the atomic weights
of several simple bodies are multiples of that of hydrogen,
this must some day lead to a number of other conclusions,
the vast importance of which to the whole science of chemistry
is not now apparent. If, on the other hand, experiments
have indicated deviations from this law, these also lead to im
portant considerations.
   But in order to determine the atomic weight of a body, it
is first requisite to become acquainted with its properties and
some of its combinations.        We shall therefore, to avoid fre
quent repetition, first describe those combinations of molyb
denum which we have examined.
  The following atomic weights for the metal have been used
in the theoretical calculations:—
      Mo = 588'966. ... (a.)            Mo = 575-829.... (b.)
These numbers will be justified in the third part of this paper.
For the other bodies, we have employed the atomic weights
given by Berzelius in his Manual of Chemistry, vol. iii. Leipzig,
1845.

414      MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
   We employed in these researches a sulphuret of molyb
denum from Lindås in Småland, in Sweden, which was very
pure, and of which an abundant stock was at our disposal.
This mineral, which was mixed with but small portions of
gangue, was reduced to a fine powder, and then roasted on
a shallow earthenware dish over a charcoal fire, constantly
stirring it. From 100 to 200 grammes of the mineral were
roasted at a time, and the operation lasted a couple of hours,
when so much molybdic acid had formed, that the entire mass,
while hot, was throughout yellow and adhered to the dish.
 When it had cooled the mass was treated in a closed flask
 with ammonia, which took up all the molybdic acid and left
a considerable portion of the mineral and other impurities un
dissolved. These operations had to be repeated several times
with the insoluble portion. The solution of the molybdic acid
in ammonia was evaporated to a small bulk, and the fol
lowing process adopted to obtain a perfectly pure acid; the
solution contains besides molybdic acid, minute quantities of
alumina and oxide of copper, and what is more inconvenient,
phosphoric acid. To remove these impurities, the ammoni
acal solution of the molybdic acid is mixed with an excess of
carbonate of potash and evaporated; this separates a portion
of the alumina, which is removed by filtration. The clear so
lution is evaporated to dryness and heated to redness in a
platinum crucible. The ignited mass is treated with water, by
which a solution of molybdate, carbonate with some sulphate
and phosphate of potash is obtained, while alumina and oxide
of copper remain undissolved. The filtered solution of the
potash salts is again evaporated to dryness, the dry mass
mixed with twice its weight of sulphur, and the whole heated
to redness either in a porcelain crucible or in a glass flask,
the mouth of which can be easily closed with a glass stopper. .
We used a glass flask, placed it in a Hessian crucible, and
surrounded it with sand: the temperature is gradually in
creased and continued until no more sulphur burns away,
when the entire mass is at a low red heat. After cooling, the
whole is treated with hot water, which separates it into a
blackish green mass and a red solution. It is filtered as
hot as possible, pouring the solution only upon the filter and
adding more hot water to the residue. When this water is
no longer coloured yellow, a few drops of carbonate of potash
are added, and the whole heated with constant agitation until
it boils. This treatment with water, carbonate of potash, and
filtration, is continued until a little of the filtered liquid, on
being mixed with muriatic acid, neither deposits sulphur nor
smells of sulphuretted hydrogen. By this means all the phos

            of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.           415
phoric acid and excess of sulphur are removed from the sul
phuret of molybdenum, which gradually acquires a pure black
colour, and when pressed with a glass rod immediately ex
hibits the metallic lustre peculiar to the sulphuret. The
sulphuret is now treated with water containing muriatic acid,
and washed upon the filter with hot water. This sulphuret
of molybdenum is pure; and to prepare molybdic acid from
it, it may either be roasted or treated with nitric acid; the
oxidation by nitric acid is readily effected, as the sulphuret is
in a very finely divided state.
    In most cases this circuitous process is not requisite, espe
cially when the object is to prepare combinations with other
bases; a more simple plan may then be adopted, as will be
stated under the different compounds.
    Molybdic acid is easily tested as to its freedom from fixed
impurities; a portion exposed to a strong red heat in a cru
cible with free access of air, should be entirely volatilized.
                          Salts of Potash.
    As stated in the introduction, the potash salts have in part
been briefly described by various chemists, but many of them
have only been used for the preparation of some of the in
soluble compounds. All the statements respecting them are
very imperfect, and founded upon mere test experiments with
* any analysis. The following salts have been examined
     ll.S.
  'Niral Molybdate of Potash.-The formula             for the salt
dried over sulphuric acid is KaO, Mo.O’-- HO. We have
prepared this salt in different ways.
   A. Either of the ammonia salts is treated with an excess of
carbonate of potash, the solution evaporated by heat to the
consistence of a syrup, when the salt gradually separates in the
cold.      The salt however cannot be thus obtained free from
carbonate of potash, as will be shown by the analysis.
    B. Caustic potash is dissolved in alcohol of 0.815 spec. grav.
and small portions of moist trimolybdate of potash added,
and the whole shaken in a well-corked bottle.        The neutral
salt separates as an oily mass at the bottom of the bottle; the
supernatant alcoholic solution of potash is removed with a
pipette, the oily mass washed with alcohol, then poured into a
dish and left to crystallize over caustic lime and sulphuric acid.
    The neutral molybdate of potash crystallizes in four-sided
prisms having two truncations on the smaller lateral faces of
the prism. It is readily soluble in water after ignition. When
heated it parts with its water and falls to a white powder; it
requires the highest temperature which can be produced with
an Argand lamp to fuse it; it then flows readily, but soli

416 MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
difies into a crystalline mass as soon as the temperature is a
little lowered.      When it has become cold it falls to a white
powder. This peculiarity is very striking, and merits every
attention. The salt deliquesces when exposed for any length
of time to the air, greedily absorbs carbonic acid, and gra
dually passes into other salts. Although insoluble in alcohol,
it is only separated in the form of an oil by alcohol from the
most concentrated solution in water.
   Analysis.-I. Salt obtained according to the method A.

   It will be seen on comparing the found quantities of potash
  * The excess of 53 per cent. in this analysis is partly owing to the salt
having crystallized from a strongly alkaline solution, and partly to the mo
lybdic acid not having been entirely freed from every trace of phosphoric
acid and alumina.
  t Throughout this paper we intend, by the designation atomic weight, a,
that the atomic weight of molybdenum is 588966, and by b, the atomic

           of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.          417
with those calculated, that we have in each case obtained an
excess of potash. We nevertheless believe that this salt is
the neutral molybdate of potash, but the reason why no per
fectly pure product can be obtained is the mode of prepara
tion of this salt from a very alkaline liquid.
   In these analyses, and in all the subsequent ones, the potash
was determined according to the following method:—After
the salt had been heated to redness in a platinum crucible to
determine the amount of water of crystallization, it was dis
solved in water; but if the salt after ignition was insoluble or
sparingly soluble in water, we added to it a few drops of ammo
nia. The solution was then mixed with an excess of hydro
sulphate of ammonia and afterwards with muriatic acid, which
instantly precipitates tersulphuret of molybdenum, which, ac
cording to the concentration of the liquid, had sometimes a
brown, and at other times a black colour.       If care had not
been taken to add a sufficient quantity of hydrosulphate of
ammonia at the commencement, and the whole of the mo
lybdenum has not been precipitated (which is indicated by
the colour of the solution), this fault can only be made
good by redissolving the whole in ammonia and hydrosul
phate of ammonia, and again precipitating it. The precipi
tated sulphuret of molybdenum, which very quickly subsides,
is collected upon a filter and washed with water containing
sulphuretted hydrogen and muriatic acid. The filtrate is then
evaporated in a counterpoised platinum crucible, the excess
of chloride of ammonium driven off at a gentle heat, the resi
due dissolved in water and sulphuric acid, again evaporated,
and the potash determined with the usual precautions as neu
tral sulphate of potash. In most of the analyses an excess of
potash will be found, which is owing to the readiness with
which the sulphuret of molybdenum becomes oxidized.
   Bimolybdate of Potash.-We did not succeed in preparing
this salt, for on fusing together a weighed quantity of trimo
lybdate of potash with the requisite quantity of carbonate of
potash to produce the bimolybdate, we obtained after ignition,
the carbonic acid being expelled with effervescence, a white
mass which solidified in a crystalline state on cooling, and on
pouring water over the fused mass a small quantity dissolved
at first, but in a few minutes the liquid grew turbid, and the
whole salt was gradually decomposed into the neutral and the
tribasic molybdate of potash. We do not mean however, by
this experiment, to deny the existence of this salt, for it is
highly probable that it will be more stable when produced in
liquids of a certain degree of concentration, or in which other
salts are contained. This view is moreover confirmed by the

418      MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
fact, that we have succeeded in preparing the bimolybdate of
soda.
   Double salt of the Bimolybdate of Potash and Trimolybdate
of Potash.-The formula of the crystallized salt is 4KaO,
9MoO3 + 6HO, or 3KaO, 2Mo O” + 3KaO, MoC)” + 6HO,
or 3KaO, MoC)3 + 5.KaO, 3MoO3 + 12HO.
   When concentrated nitric or muriatic acid is added with
constant agitation to a solution of molybdic acid in carbon
ate of potash, on the addition of each drop a precipitate re
sults, which however soon redissolves.       The addition of acid
is continued until the precipitate no longer entirely dissolves,
and the liquid is slightly opalescent; it is then set aside, when
this salt gradually crystallizes; but if the solution is very
concentrated it is precipitated in a few minutes. The sepa
ration of this salt from concentrated solutions occurs even
though the liquid is strongly alkaline. The salt is collected
on a filter, not washed with water, but as soon as the mother
ley is drained off dried as quickly as possible between folds
of bibulous paper.
   On slow crystallization it separates in six-sided prisms, four
faces of which are very predominant, with truncations upon
the two narrow faces. When the salt separates rapidly, it
appears under the microscope in the form of rhombohedrons,
which mutually intercept each other in the centre, and so
form minute stars. The salt contains water of crystalliza
tion, which it loses when heated.        It melts at a red heat,
and solidifies into a crystalline mass on cooling, which dis
solves with difficulty in water. It is soluble in cold water,
but is very readily decomposed, so that it can only exist in the
perfectly dry state, or in those liquids from which it separated.
It is decomposed by water into the trimolybdate of potash
and the neutral molybdate of potash. We shall return again
to this phaenomenon.
   Analysis.-I. 15385 grm. salt obtained by precipitating

   IV. The salt for this analysis was obtained by evaporating
a solution of molybdic acid in carbonate of potash with a large
excess of alkali. A portion of the salt separated from the
hot solution, the other portion on cooling, when the entire
mass solidified.    On treatment with water this salt was left as

          of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.                  419
a white crystalline powder very sparingly soluble in water; it
was dried in the air; 1:0973 grm. afforded 0-0408 water and
0.4474 sulphate of potash = 0.2418 potash. We have also
  iven the per-centage composition of this salt; we leave it
  owever to other chemists to decide in how far this salt is
distinct from the others, especially in respect to the amount
ôf water. It appears to contain only 3 atoms of water.

    Trimolybdate of Potash.-Formula of the salt dried in the
 air KaC, 3MoO* + 3HO. This salt can be very readily pre
 pared in large quantities and in the purest state. Indeed,
 the combinations of molybdic acid with potash exhibit a great
 tendency to pass into this salt. It is prepared by adding
 water to the preceding double salt, and stirring frequently;
 complete decomposition then takes place, and the trimolyb
 date separates, being very sparingly soluble in water. This
 decomposition requires some days, but it is only requisite to
 warm the liquid to hasten it. When large quantities of the
 double salt are used, the liquid thickens to such an extent on
 the separation of the trimolybdate of potash, that the whole
 becomes a thick paste. When the precipitate no longer in
 creases, the entire mass is thrown upon a filter and washed
 carefully with water. The pure salt is best dried at first
 in the air and then at a gentle heat, for if exposed while moist
  to a temperature of 212° a portion dissolves in hot water. The

420 MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
precipitate, which is very bulky in the moist state, shrinks
considerably in drying. This salt is likewise always obtained
when an excess of nitric acid is added to a solution of mo
lybdic acid in carbonate of potash, and the whole set aside
for some time. Besides the trimolybdate of potash some other
molybdates separate, which are easily recognized by their cry
stalline form, and also some salts which are not crystalline,
and which we shall subsequently describe. As soon as the
separation has taken place, the whole is brought upon a filter
and washed well with cold water; this dissolves the other cry
stalline salts, a portion of which is even converted into trimo
lybdate. The precipitate is then treated with boiling water
which dissolves the trimolybdate, and the solution filters.
The salt subsequently separates gradually from the solution.
   When this salt has separated quickly it forms a bulky
white precipitate, which, under the compound microscope,
is seen to be made up of innumerable white needles. When
however the separation has been very slow, it is acicular
and with a beautiful silky lustre, especially when stirred
under water with a glass rod; the salt retains this lustre when
dry. When once separated it is almost insoluble in cold
water, but is dissolved in large quantity by boiling water, and
from this solution it separates very slowly, sometimes re
 .#       several weeks. In liquids containing other salts, as
 or instance nitre, it is almost insoluble even when boiling. It
contains water of crystallization, which it parts with on calci
nation, then melts, and solidifies on cooling into a crystalline
mass.     It is then very sparingly soluble even in boiling water.

   As above stated, this salt is obtained by the decomposition
of the previously-described double salt; and as the trimolyb
date separates in an almost insoluble state, we made the fol
lowing quantitative experiment.
   5-7178 grims. of the crystalline double salt were dissolved
in cold water and set aside in a covered vessel; after two days
the first flakes began to separate, and the decomposition pro
ceeded slowly. After twelve days the trimolybdate of potash
which had separated was collected upon a weighed filter, and
after being dried in the air, weighed 4-6087 grims. The fil
tered liquid was evaporated in the water-bath to dryness; on
re-solution in a little water it left 0.0053 grm. trimolybdate.
The filtered liquid was neutral, but absorbed carbonic acid
from the air, acquired an alkaline reaction, and gradually
deposited still more trimolybdate.
   100 parts of the crystalline double salt give, according to
this experiment, 80-695 parts trimolybdate of potash; the de
ºrion

               then takes place according to the following for

   According to this formula 100 parts of the double salt
should yield 81.438 parts trimolybdate, and this result agrees
as accurately as could be expected with the experiment.
   When trimolybdate of potash is exposed to a current of
hydrogen, there is no reaction until the salt is fused; reduc
tion then occurs, water is formed, and the fused mass gra
dually becomes solid, acquiring a shining brown colour.
   0.5525 grm, fused and pulverized trimolybdate of potash

422 MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
gave after reduction 0.519.5 grim. When the reduction was
complete, which was indicated by the weight remaining con
stant, the residue was exhausted with water, which dissolved
a portion, forming a colourless liquid; the insoluble portion
was collected on a filter. To the naked eye some portions
of the residue present a strong lustre and a tomback-brown
colour; this is still more distinct under the microscope. The
filtered solution was evaporated in a counterpoised crucible,
ignited and weighed. The salt forms a white powder, behaves
like the neutral molybdate of potash, and weighed 0-2496.
    100 parts of the trimolybdate of potash consequently lose
on reduction—
        5'973 oxygen, and yield
      45-176 neutral molybdate of potash and
      48.851 insoluble oxide (estimated from the loss).

    When the insoluble oxide which has been freed by water
from the neutral molybdate of potash is heated with a solution
of caustic potash, a large quantity of molybdic acid dissolves.
The same occurred on boiling it with muriatic acid; however,
it was far less violently acted upon by the latter. These ex
periments indicate that molybdic acid exists in the insoluble
oxide, and we have on that account admitted the formula
MoC), MoC)”, and not the formula 2MoC)”, both which for
mulae express the same relation between the oxygen and mo
lybdenum; it is however possible that by the action of the
potash, the insoluble residue may have passed into molybdic
acid, either by re-arrangement of the elements, or from having
 absorbed oxygen from the air. Nitric acid readily converts
 it into molybdic acid.
    By the careful addition of nitric acid to a solution of mo
 lybdic acid in carbonate of potash, the previously-described
 double salt is precipitated; on using a large excess of nitric
 acid, however, the   º:           are totally different. In this
 case a very bulky precipitate is instantly produced, which
 gradually increases. But in this precipitation different cry

            of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.              423
stalline and amorphous substances can be distinguished, as
was stated when treating of the trimolybdate of potash. All
the crystalline salts may be extracted with hot water, which
leaves an amorphous residue, that may sometimes be collected
on a filter and washed, but at other times it passes through
the pores of the filter. It is likewise a chemical combination of
molybdic acid with potash. It appears however that a tetra
molybdate or pentamolybdate of potash is precipitated ac
cording to the quantity of nitric acid. It is not a mixture of
molybdic acid with some molybdic acid containing potash, for
when heated in a platinum crucible it fuses, but not a trace of
molybdic acid is volatilized even with the strongest heat. We
have analysed two such precipitates.
   Tetramolybdate of Potash, KaO, 4MoC), forms a white cry
stalline powder, which is anhydrous, insoluble in water, readily
fusible, and crystallizes on cooling.

   The series of combinations of potash and molybdic acid
is certainly not closed with the salts here described. In
the course of this investigation we have observed several
other salts differing in their crystalline form, but did not
pursue the subject further, as it was beyond the object of this
paper; we will however mention three other salts, in order
that should any person take up the examination of the potash
salts he may direct his especial attention to these. One salt
crystallizes in small six-sided prisms, which when stirred

 424 MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
 under water exhibit a strong silvery lustre. It is readily soluble
 in water.
     Another salt crystallizes in beautiful acute rhombohedrons,
 which have an adamantine lustre, are very sparingly soluble in
 cold, more readily soluble in hot water; on evaporating its so
 lution it is converted for the greater part into the trimolybdate.
 It fuses at a red heat, and solidifies on cooling with a steel
 gray colour and a strong lustre.
     A third salt sometimes separates when the mother-ley ob
 tained after precipitating with nitric acid is somewhat warmed;
 it forms shining four-sided prisms.

    Neutral Molybdate of Soda.-Formula of the crystallized
 salt NaO, MoC)” + 2HO.
    To prepare this salt 5:491 grims. MoCº were fused with
4-074 grims. anhydrous carbonate of soda, being exactly the
proportion required for the production of the neutral salt.
On cautiously raising the temperature, mutual reaction takes
place with violent evolution of carbonic acid, and at a red
heat the whole mass forms a perfect liquid; the crucible was
placed over sulphuric acid to cool, when the whole solidified
to a crystalline mass. It dissolved easily and entirely in water,
and on evaporating the solution by heat, the greater portion
of the salt separated in a crystalline state. The crystals were col
lected on a filter, washed with very little water, dried as quickly
as possible between folds of paper, and then left for twenty-four
hours over caustic lime and sulphuric acid. They form small
rhombohedrons with very acute angles, fuse readily, giving off
their water of crystallization, and solidify on cooling to a cry
stalline mass. The salt is readily soluble in water.

 and solidified on cooling into a white crystalline mass, which,
on being pressed or agitated under water, fell into a number
of acicular crystals. The saline mass dissolved with great
difficulty in cold water, and only after a long time in hot.
The liquid was evaporated to a very small bulk, but no
crystals separated either by heat, nor after standing for three
days. The concentrated solution was further evaporated in a
platinum crucible in the water-bath, when gradually a white
crystalline mass separated, whilst another portion was left as
a syrupy liquid. The crystals were collected on a filter and
washed with a little water, when the greater portion of the salt
redissolved; it was then dried as quickly as possible by pressure
between folds of paper, and finally at a temperature of 176°F.
    The salt appeared to consist, under the microscope, of four
sided prisms; it dissolves readily in water, but with great
difficulty after fusion. When heated, it parts with its water
of crystallization, melts and solidifies on cooling to a yellowish
white crystalline mass.

    Reduction of the Trimolybdate of Soda by Hydrogen.—Wöh
ler first observed and described the peculiar behaviour of the
bitungstate of soda towards hydrogen, it became therefore
interesting to ascertain how this salt of molybdic acid would
behave under the same treatment. With the tungstate, a
curious compound of oxide of tungstenium and soda was
formed by the reduction; no such thing however happens in
this case. The molybdate of soda behaves precisely like the
corresponding potash salt.

    The amount of neutral molybdate of soda obtained does
not agree accurately with the quantity required by theory, but
 this is owing to the glass being very much acted upon by the
neutral salt in the operation.              In this experiment the reduc
tion was continued for some hours uninterruptedly, the entire
mass being kept at a red heat in order to ascertain whether

              of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.           427
the action might not gradually proceed further; this however
was by no means the case, as the results obtained show.
    We found on treating a soluble molybdate of potash with
an excess of concentrated nitric acid in the cold, that salts in
stantly separated with a greater amount of molybdic acid; this
is not the case with the soda salt.         When an excess of nitric
acid is added to a cold solution of molybdate of soda, no pre
cipitate results even after several days, but on heating the
liquid it instantly becomes turbid, and gradually deposits a
bulky yellow precipitate. On collecting this upon the filter,
it easily passes through the paper on being washed with
water, which may however be prevented by adding a few
drops of nitric acid to the water. The washing is very slowly
and imperfectly effected, as the precipitate adheres closely to
 the filter. When dry it appears amorphous and yellow, except
 at the edges and on the surface, where the colour is bluish
   reen, produced by the escape of the nitric acid in drying.
      hen a portion of the precipitate is heated in a platinum cru
 cible, the greater part is volatilized at a strong red heat.
 This had been observed by Buchholz, and may in some cases
 serve for the preparation of pure molybdic acid.
                   Salts of the Oride of Ammonium.
     The series of these salts is quite as numerous as that of the
 salts of potash. We have not examined these combinations
 so accurately, as in all the analyses the amount of molybdic
 acid only has been determined by carefully heating the salt
 in a counterpoised platina crucible, and in no instance that of
 the ammonia or of the water; by these determinations, and
 partly by the preparation of the corresponding salts of baryta,
 we are enabled to establish the following definite compounds.
     Neutral Molybdate of the Owide of Ammonium, NH4O,

 in an excess of highly concentrated solution of ammonia in a

  grav. . The salt so precipitated is collected as quickly as
  possible upon a filter and dried over caustic lime.
      When seen under the microscope, it has the form of small
  four-sided prisms with two truncations. When a little of this
  salt moistened with water is placed under the microscope, it is
  quickly seen to change into the acid salt. It is anhydrous.

    Several other salts may be prepared by the action of nitric
acid upon solutions of molybdic acid in ammonia; among
others there exists, as with potash, a double salt which on so
lution in water is decomposed into a readily soluble salt, and
an insoluble one, which separates in minute acicular crystals.
    By the partial precipitation of a solution of crude molybdic
acid, i.e. as obtained by exhausting the roasted mineral in .
ammonia, a nearly pure molybdic acid may be obtained; it
contains mere traces of phosphoric acid. This method is
very simple, and may be employed in many cases. . . . . ;

paration is in most cases easy, the corresponding baryta salt

small quantities of the potash or ammonia salt employed,

as the numbers found never agree accurately with the cal
culated composition of the pure salt. Besides this uncertainty
there is another evil, arising from the great difficulty of com
pletely decomposing the baryta salt. We adopted the <U+017F>ol
lowing method for the analysis of these compounds:—We first
determined the loss which the salt experiences at a red heat.
This loss is water, but if an ammonia salt had been employed
for the precipitation, water and oxide of ammonium. The
residue was then treated in a beaker with an excess of dilute
sulphuric acid and evaporated, so that, eventually, the highly
concentrated sulphuric acid acts upon the salt. It was left in
this state from two to three days upon the sand-bath, then
diluted with water, filtered, the precipitate treated several
times with hot water and a few drops of sulphuric acid, the
precipitate placed upon the filter and washed with hot water.
In the calculations no attention has been paid to the small ad
mixture of foreign salt, and on that account less baryta will
be found in all the analyses than theory requires.
    Neutral Molybdateof Baryta, Ba O, MoCº.—When a solution
of chloride of barium is added to any solution of molybdic
acid in an excess of ammonia, this salt instantly separates.
It should be filtered immediately, in order that the free baryta
in the solution may not absorb carbonic acid from the air
and accompany the precipitate. We proceeded as follows to
be certain of obtaining a pure salt:—
    I. A solution of the neutral molybdate of ammonia was pre
cipitated with chloride of barium, the precipitate collected
upon a filter and washed for a very long time, although the
salt is somewhat soluble in water.
    II. A solution of the above-described double salt was mixed

                                                                         -
430     MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
with an excess of ammonia, and then so much chloride of ba
rium added that a portion of the salt of ammonia was left un
decomposed. It was immediately collected upon a filter,
access of air being prevented as much as possible.
   This salt forms a fine crystalline powder, which is anhydrous
and sparingly soluble in water; on calcination it acquires a
bluish-green colour, owing to the reducing action of the traces
of ammonia which escape. It does not fuse; adheres very
firmly to the glass.
   Analysis.-I. 0.864 grm. of salt obtained by method I. lost
on ignition 0.014, and gave 0-634 sulphate of baryta = 0-4262
baryta.
   II. 1686 grm. salt, according to method II., lost on ignition
0.0273, and gave 12982 sulphate of baryta = 0.846 baryta.
   Assuming the loss by ignition to consist of ammonia, 100
parts of the salt contain—
                                          I.                 II.

   Although these analyses do not agree accurately in the
amount of baryta, we mention them because they show that a
certain amount of the oxide of ammoniuin salt always accom
panies them. The loss by ignition does not result either from hy
grometric or chemically combined water, as we have convinced
ourselves of the presence of ammonia, not by quantitative but
by qualitative experiments. Were we to attempt to deduce a
formula from these numbers, we should find that 1 at. of the am
monia salt is combined with about 12 ats. of the salt of baryta.
The composition of the neutral molybdate of baryta, according
to theory, is—
                             0.          Calc.           b.        Calc.

   Heine” has described a basic molybdate of baryta, of which
he gives two analyses, which however were made with the
same preparation. On comparing the characters which he
gives of his salt with those of our neutral molybdate of baryta,
they agree very accurately. We have also endeavoured to
prepare the basic salt according to Heine's description, but

    Trimolybdate of Baryta, BaO, 3MoO°4-3HO.—A solution
of the trimolybdate of potash was mixed with chloride of ba
rium, when a flocculent precipitate subsided. It is somewhat
soluble in pure water. After washing and drying, it forms
a yellowish white horny mass, which adheres very firmly to
the filter and is brittle. On ignition it parts with water, fuses,
and solidifies on cooling to a yellowish crystalline mass.
    Analysis.-0-98.54 grim. salt lost on ignition 0-0829, and gave
0.847 sulphate of baryta = 0.2261 baryta.

    On attempting to decompose the above-described double
salt of potash, in order to obtain the corresponding baryta salt,
by adding the dry potash salt gradually and with constant agi
tation to a dilute solution of chloride of barium, a bulky pre

432       MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
cipitate quickly forms, which appears under the microscope
to consist entirely of six-sided plates; but this salt is not very
stable, it soon loses its bulky appearance, sinks and forms a
mixture of two salts, which may be distinguished by the mi
croscope. One salt is amorphous, whilst the other crystal
lizes in minute distinct six-sided prisms. Whether in this
case a similar decomposition occurs as with the potash salt,
we are unable to decide, and we have not made any fur
ther experiments with it, as the mixture of salts cannot be
separated.
   The above salts were all prepared by double decomposition;
another long series of baryta salts may be obtained by treating
any one of the former with nitric or muriatic acid. .Various
acid salts are formed according to the amount of acid, some
of which are soluble, while others are perfectly insoluble. All
these compounds are remarkable on account of their being
crystalline. We have analysed only one of these salts.
   Molybdate of Baryta with 9 atoms of Acid, BaO, 9MoOº.
 +4HO.—We obtained this salt by treating the neutral salt
with nitric acid. It crystallizes in minute six-sided prisms.
This salt is insoluble in cold and in hot water, and in
dilute nitric acid. On ignition it parts with water, fuses, and
solidifies on cooling into a crystalline mass. As this salt is but
imperfectly acted upon by sulphuric acid or a mixture of sul
phuric with nitro-muriatic acid, it was fused in a platinum
crucible with bisulphate of potash.

                              Salts of Lead.
   Neutral Molybdate of Lead, PbO, MoCº.—Oxide of lead
does not appear to combine in more than one proportion
with molybdic acid; in all cases the neutral salt separates.
We prepared this salt by precipitating a solution of the tri

               of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.                 433
molybdate of potash with a solution of the nitrate of lead,
when a white flocculent precipitate immediately separates,
which is very sparingly soluble in water. After washing
and drying it forms a white powder, which fuses only at a
very high temperature. It appears to contain no chemically
combined water, for on ignition it lost only 3-380 per cent.
a<U+017F>ter having been dried at 212°, and this quantity only cor
responds to # atom of water. The analysis of this salt, if
it is desired not to employ hydrosulphate of ammonia, is at
tended with several difficulties, as a perfect separation of the
molybdic acid from the oxide of lead is impossible. In both
analyses we have obtained an excess of lead. We effected
the separation by treating the ignited salt in a beaker with
sulphuric acid and the application of heat. In the first ana
lysis we attempted to determine directly the molybdic acid by
evaporating the sulphatic solution, and subsequent ignition
with the addition of a few drops of nitric acid. In this deter
mination it is impossible to avoid a considerable loss.
    Analysis.-I. O-7867 grim. lost on ignition 0.023, and gave

     Neutral Molybdate of Silver, AgO, MoCº.—When a so
 lution of neutral molybdate of potash is mixed with nitrate
 of silver, a yellowish flocculent precipitate is obtained, which
gradually becomes darker under the influence of light. It
 is slightly soluble in water, but readily so in water containing
nitric acid.         After being washed and dried at 212°, it was
 analysed by dissolving it in ammonia, and then precipitating
 the silver as chloride, taking care to add an excess of mu
 riatic acid, in order to hold the whole of the molybdic acid
 in solution. We attempted to determine the molybdic acid
 directly, by evaporating the filtered solution, expelling the

 chloride of ammonium, and treating the residue with a few
 drops of nitric acid; but this determination is far more un
 certain than in the case of the lead salt, as a considerable
 quantity of molybdenum is volatilized in the form of some
 chlorine-compound, which was very perceptible, from the pa
 per covering the beaker being coloured blue.
    Analysis.-0.2431 grim. of salt gave 0-1862 chloride of sil
ver = 0.1505 oxide of silver. The evaporated liquid afforded
0-051 molybdic acid, corresponding to 20-971 per cent, so
that, compared with the theoretical composition, we expe
rienced a loss of 17.2 per cent. of molybdic acid.

    Acid Molybdate of Silver.—When a solution of the trimo

various compounds appear to be obtained under different cir

LXIV. On certain Functions resembling Quaternions, and on
    a new Imaginary in Algebra. By JAMES CockLE, Esq.,
    M.A., Barrister-at-Law. In a Letter to T. S. DAVIES, Esq.,
    F.R.S.L. & E. &c."
              To Richard Taylor, Esq., F.S.A. &c.
       My DEAR SIR,               Royal Military Academy, Woolwich,
                                           October 27, 1848.
      BELIEVE that Mr. Horner's attention was first directed
       by me to the consideration of what he has happily termed
“congeneric surd equations.” This was done in consequence
of a difficulty that I had found in discussing such an equation
which was accidentally brought before me; a difficulty which,
from the friendship that had long subsisted between us, I ver
 naturally referred to him. His reply was printed in the Phi
 losophical Magazine about a dozen years ago; and it has
 received proper attention from those algebraists who look
 with due care to the fundamental principles of their science.
     Almost every new difficulty in algebra is the precursor of
 more extended views respecting its principles; and often out
 of a case which may, at first sight, appear to be little more than
 a conundrum, very important improvements in our general
  theories often arise. All efforts to generalize our views, so as
  to include the “conundrum,” deserve, therefore, attentive con
  sideration; and for this reason I send you for publication the
  accompanying letter, which I have just received from your
  correspondent and my friend, Mr. James Cockle, of the
  Middle Temple.
     I hope you will be able to give Mr. Cockle's letter an early
  place in your valuable Magazine, as it contains much that is
  suggestive of inquiry.
                            I remain,
                                        Yours very truly,

        My DEAR SIR,                          October 26, 1848.
  Yº. are        aware that the new algebraical symbol, which I
        have recently discovered, was suggested to my mind by re
  flecting on the structure of congeneric surd equations—a sub
  ject on which I have lately been much engaged. Did I require
   any excuse for throwing the present investigations into the
   form of a letter to you, I should find it in the fact that the
   remarks of Horner on congenerics were put into a similar
   shape. (See Phil. Mag., S. 3, vol. viii. p. 43–50.)
                      * Communicated by Mr. Davies.

  436 Mr. James Cockle on a new Imaginary in Algebra.
   - In what follows, I propose to confine the term unreal to the
  imaginary quantities of ordinary algebra. When the word
  impossible is used, it must be understood as referring exclu
  sively to expressions involving the new symbol. So that

      Mr. James Cockle on a new Imaginary in Algebra.        437
pp. 364–367 of the current (49th) volume of the Mechanics'
 Magazine; I shall rather go on with the development of the
 properties of expressions which involve it.
  * For convenience, I shall denote the product of i and j by k;
 I shall assume that <U+017F>º is equal to unity. I say assume because,
 although I have reasons (not, however, free from objection,)
for making such a supposition, yet I wish to reserve to myself
full liberty to modify the assumption, and to discuss ab initio
the symbolj, and its symbolic relation to j. Then the follow
ing system of relations will, together with the second equation
given in this letter, furnish us with all the conditions requi
site for the formation of a theory of these three imaginaries,
That system is—                                                   -
                        i°= —j*=k*= –1,                 -       -
    -                   ij=k, jk= i, ki = -j.                 :
    Almost the first thing that strikes us, in examining the ex
pression for a tessarine, is, that, under the above system, the
product of two or more tessarines is a tessarine, Let us
confine our attention to the case in which two only are mul
tiplied together, and let the factors be t and t, where
  * * *                 t=w-ia-Hjy--kz,
and
                        t'=w'+ix'+jy'+ k2'.
    By actual multiplication, we obtain
                   tl'—ww'+*wa'+jºy-H k”zz' n
  . .   . .. .      +i(wa'+aw')-Hjk(yz'+xy')
                   +j(wy'+yw)+ik(rx'+za')
                    +k(wz'+ zw')+ij(ay'+ya').
    Suppose that
                   ww'—wa'+yy'—zz'-w",
                   wa'+aw'+yz' +zy'-a",
                   wy'+ yºv'—wz'—za'-y", X.
                                             |
and also that
                   wz'+xw' + ay'+ya'-x",     J
                      w"+ ir" +jy" + kz" = tº:
then we have, under the foregoing system of relations,
                              tt'=t";
and, if we had three or more such factors as t, the result would
still be a tessarine.
    The next point that arises is,--what is the tessarine law of
moduli ? or, more generally, what modular or quasi-modular

438 Mr. James Cockle on a new Imaginary in Algebra.
relation or relations exist between the constituents of the fac
tors and those of the product? Seeing that the operations of
algebra necessarily and inevitably conduct us to tessarine for
mulae, I cannot doubt but that some relations may be found,
such as to enable us to extend the boundaries of analysis.
I have not, however, time to pursue this inquiry further now
—more particularly as I wish to make one or two remarks
upon other parts of the subject of this new imaginary.j.
    For instance, I would observe that the product of two or
more factors of the form
                                 w-H<U+017F>y
is of the same form ; thus
                       (w-Hjy)(w'+jy')=w"+jy",
where
                              w"=ww' +yy',
and
                              3)"—wy'+yw.
    There are cases in which the impossible quantity.j altogether
disappears from a result. Thus, if s be the base of the Na
pierian logarithms, we have
             *=1+y+% +j}. #. +&c.,      +
 and
            sºv - 1–<U+017F>y--       º, #. #. —&c.;
                                 -      +
 hence
            **-*=2( +% #: +&c.)     +
 and
            ;" y—s-ju)=y+ 2.y”3 +&c..
                   . — a T.
             1 , =99
            —<U+017F>              -
                              -   -
    This last is a very simple case; but the nature of such a
 letter as this obliges me to have recourse to illustration rather
 than extensive investigation.
    I need not tell you how to read the second equation which
 occurs in this communication; still, I cannot   i. saying—to
 use words adopted on another occasion, by our friend Professor
 J. R. Young (Alg. 4th edit. p. 131), that we must read that
 equation as meaning that unity together with the plus [square-1
 root of j is equal to zero, and NoT that unity together with a
 square-root of j is equal to zero. The whole discussion is in
  volved in the correct reading of that fundamental equation.
     By way of conclusion, I will add that, if we had three inde

pendent imaginaries i, j, k, we should have to deal, not with
tessarines, but with what might be called octrines. These last
mentioned expressions would be of the form
                  w--iz-H <U+017F>y--kz+jp+ ikg+jkr--ijks,
where w, w, y, z, p, q, r, s are any real quantities. These
quantities might be termed the constituents of the octrine,
which could not vanish unless all its constituents were zero.
 So if we had four independent imaginaries (that is to say,
 imaginaries unconnected by any linear relation), the corre
 sponding expression would consist of sixteen terms, and would
 have properties analogous to those of the tessarine and the
 octrine. I must here break off, but I remain, always,

   the electric fluid, with the spheroidalistate, i-relations which
  appear to me not to have hitherto attracted the lattention of
  observers. In the face of incomplete and often contradictory,
  theories, by which this singular condition of bodies is attempted
  to be explained, it is necessary to accumulate new facts in order,
  to determine with certainty the part taken by the different"

      180. My first experiments were made with electricity of:
  tension. The apparatus employed is very simple, . It consists'
  of a support furnished with a moveable stem terminated by as
  ring, on which rests a tolerably thick platina crucible, almost
 flat, and of a diameter of 0”06. Another support carries, atº,
 the extremity of a metallic arm, a platina wire twisted on itself,”
 and which bends back below in a sort of eye, or elongated.
 slightly open loop, to 0”001 of the capsule. A chain attached tº
 to the arm serves to connect this wire with the external arma
 ture of a Leyden jar.
     181. After heating the capsule, some portions of liquid are
 projected on to it, which collect in a spheroidalized drop around
 the eye. The lamp is then taken away, and the knob of the
jar well-charged is rapidly approached to the lower surface of
 the crucible. The explosion determines different effects, ac
cording to the nature of the liquid and the temperature of the
 vessel containing it.
     182. Let us first raise the capsule to a degree of heat which
much exceeds the limit indispensable to the spheroidal-state.”
 If we operate on pure water, this is not traversed by the dis
charge, and its close or radiating form experiences no altera- «
tion. The spark, of a purplish colour, does not penetrate the
immersed portion of the platina wire, but glides over the con
vex surface of the drop.                                       -

    188. When the quantity of liquid has been greatly reduced
by evaporation, so that there no longer rentains more than a
small drop lodged in the lower part of the eye and suspended
above the capsule, the fluid projects it mechanically toward
the sides, and it is seen to re-descend immediately along the
concavity of the vase to resume its first position on the wire.
    184. But if the discharge is excited through the capsule
cooled to about 200°C., it acts in quite a different manner.
The cause which keeps the distilled water in the spheroidal
state having become very weak, the drop passes suddenly to
the state of a moistening liquid and disappears entirely, or at
least in great part, with all the characters of a brisk evapori
Zation.
    185. The same experiments were repeated on water ren
dered conducting by the addition of a little nitric acid. If the
temperature of the capsule is much raised (without however
attaining to a dull red), the spark is emitted through the drop
which is not sensibly affected by it, either in its state of gyra
tion or of repose, or in its limpid or mamelonnated, ellipsoidal
or stellate appearance.
    186. On the contrary, if the heating is near the minimum
necessary to the spheroidal state, the electricity destroys that
state, and the drop is converted into gas diffusing acid vapours.
    187. The second case to be examined was that of dynamic
 electricity. . . I employed a Grove's battery of five large pairs
 §.         moderately excited and provided with platina rheo
     188. With distilled water, we find that in the spheroidal
 p Ores.
 state, as in the cold, there is no decomposition.
     189. If we substitute acidulated water, this is electrolyzed
 when the two polar wires enter the drop without touching the
 capsule. The bubbles of gas, being produced at a              ..i.
 are more dilated than at the ordinary temperature, but their
 mass remains probably the same.
     190. When either one of the electrodes is put in contact
 with the vessel and the other is immersed in the drop, there
 is no decomposition, because the current does not pass”. A
    * Since the compilation of these notes, I have found that M. Poggen
 dorff made some similar experiments in 1841. He showed that no cur
 rent is established when a lamina of zinc is immersed in spheroidalized
 sulphuric acid, or a lamina of amalgamated zinc and a platina wire heated
 red-hot, is plunged simultaneously into cold acidulated water. That these
 results might not be attributed to unipolar phaenomena, that skilful experi
 menter reproduced them with a Saxton's magneto-electric machine pro
 vided with an inversor; the poles of the magnet were connected with pla
  tina wires, one of which was heated to redness by a lamp (Pogg. Ann, der
  Physik und Chemie, vol. lii. p. 539). MM. Peltier, De Kramer and Belli,
 subsequently observed the same fact (Boutigny, ouvr. cité, p.37).

 442     Prof. E. Wartmann’s Seventh Memoir on Induction :
 rheometer placed in the circuit shows that this is the case.
 This is an excellent proof of the character essential to the
 spheroidal state, that the drop does not touch the heated sur
 face. The excessively thin and very hot layer which separates
 it is not conducting. It would be interesting to ascertain the
 relation which exists between its isolating power and its tem
 perature, with various liquids placed on supports of different
 Inatures.
     191. When one of the rheophores touches any portion of
 the capsule externally to the liquid, and the other is immersed
 in the liquid and in contact with the metal, the passage of the
 current is established, and the drop evaporates rapidly pro
 ducing abundant bubbles accompanied by a certain sonorous
 vibration. This phaenomenon ceases as soon as the voltaic
 circuit is opened. It is presented not only when the extre
 mity of the rheophore rests on the capsule below the liquid
 which it traverses, but also when the contact takes place out
 side the lower surface of the drop. In both cases the two
 somewhat thin polar wires are heated for a great length till
 they cannot be longer handled. The heat thus disengaged
is the cause of the bubbles of vapour. This may readily, be
observed by immersing in pure spheroidalized water a very
massive silver wire.      A few instants after its contact with the
capsule ebullition is perceptible, resulting from its conducti
bility for heat”. This phaenomenon has considerable analogy
with that of the combustion of albumen under the influence
of very powerful currents (139.).                  -                       -
    192. Acidulated water was replaced by mercury, the con
ductibility of which is still greater. Contrary to the assertion
of Fischer, this body passes into the spheroidal state provided
it is reduced to very small masses. A rather large drop which
falls on a platina capsule at a dull red heat, boils at first in a
very remarkable manner. Its surface is furrowed with a
thousand wrinkles which deprive it of its mirroring aspect,
and it rapidly evaporates with a sort of crepitation. While
it is in this state, it touches the platina metallically, for it con
ducts the current of the pile. All at once the small quantity
of mercury which remains recovers its brilliant polish: it be
comes round in a nearly geometric sphere, the noise ceases,
and the evaporation continues with very great slowness: the
drop is then electrically isolated from its support.
    193. The discontinuous currents remained to be examined.
To study their influence on the spheroidal state, I produced with
the five Grove's pairs instantaneous currents of very great

electricity does not intervene, and which appear not to have
been before made. They are given here only on account of
their connection with the preceding details, and some practical
applications of which they will perhaps be susceptible.
    195. Five circumstances at least have an influence on the
general phaenomena of the spheroidal state: the nature and
the mass of the liquid, the nature and the thickness of the
 .      which supports it, lastly the degree of heat at which it is
  ept.                                                                    *
    196. At an equal temperature, pure water spheroidalized
and reduced to little drops, skips in a silver spoon with more
energy than on a leaf of platina. The syrup of sugar, also in
small spheres, rebounds more on the platina than pure water.
    197. It is known that a great mass of water may be brought
to the spheroidal state in a thick capsule of platina. When
the temperature is very elevated, the star-form is soon pro
   * This apparatus, constructed by M. Bonijol, demonstrates the influence
of the state of closing or opening of the circuit induced on the action of
the inductor current on itself (§ IV.). While the induced circuit is open,
the spring of the rheotome makes a sharp sound; but this sound falls
immediately a semitone, a fifth, and even an interval of a twelfth, as soon
as the induced circuit augments by its opening the electro-magnetic attrac
tion of the iron cylinders, which occupy the hole of the bobbin on the disc
of soft iron fixed above the spring. This variation in the musical sound
merits the attention of medical men who employ the machine for shocks.
The nervous sensibility may be so much weakened in certain paralytic
patients, that they may not perceive distinctly the passage of the instanta
neous induced currents. Before modifying the conditions of the experi
ment, or   ºf           the power of the battery (which might in certain
cases (143.) entail the most fatal consequences), the practitioner should
assure himself of the real closing of the induced circuit. For this purpose he
will consult the tone of the sound of the rheotome.       If the machine works
with a mercurial commutator, he will examine the diminution of the bril
liancy of the sparks at the time of the rupture of the inductor circuit (36.).
   t The want of apparatus sufficiently energetic has hitherto prevented
my trying an experiment which would be interesting in many respects.
Its object would be to ascertain whether, in the spheroidal state, liquids
are subject to the forces which emanate from the poles of a powerful mag
net. The beautiful discoveries of Prof. Plücker of Bonn, on the axial or
equatorial elongations which these forces impress on the primitive forms of
equilibrium of the liquids exposed to their action in ordinary circumstances,
are well known.—Poggend. Ann, der        {* und Chemie, vol. lxxiii. p. 549,

duced and persists for a long time. If the wick of the lamp
is lowered a little, the drop is seen to rise centrally and give
passage to a large bubble of vapour, which is immediately
followed by several others.     Each of these bubbles is unique
in the mass. The form of the liquid is no longer stellate, but
elongated. The drop turns as around a vertical axis, passing
through one of the focuses of the ellipsoid. A further decrease
of temperature sometimes causes the cessation of this gyratory
motion; then the drop presents itself as a beautiful biconvex
lens, which, by its immobility and its perfect transparency,
most completely resembles an object-glass.                   -
   198. This remarkable form suggested to me the idea of
submitting to a decisive and new proof a question still contro
verted. The question has been often asked, whether the
caloric which reaches the drop traverses it by radiation without
raising its temperature, or whether it is reflected by it. In
the first case, the refraction in the centre of the lens must
produce a focus at which the temperature will be        º
superior to that of the neighbouring points. In the second,
this lens will form a circular screen, behind which the tempe
rature will be lower than in the space submitted to the direct
radiations of the capsule. To decide between these alterna
tives, I operated with small thermometers open at the top and
furnished with a small ivory scale with arbitrary graduations.
The stem passes through a thick cork disc fixed into the hol
low of a glass funnel, so that their bulb makes a slight projec
tion at the extremity of the beak. The instrument thus
clothed, and placed above a drop On"O28 in breadth, demon
strates that the latter is not the seat of any refraction. Not
only is there no calorific focus, but the temperature increases
in proportion as the thermometer is raised above it, on account
of the radiation caused by the parts of the metal which are
not concealed by the liquid. . This radiation explains why the
heat near the surface of the lens is much higher than in its
interior.                                                 -
   199. The influence of a musical sound suitably chosen on
the constitution of a fluid vein is well known: that influence is
explained by the periodicity of the variations which are esta
blished in the diameter of the vein at its origin. A body in
the spheroidal state is often exposed to regular and periodical
movements, which give to it in particular a stellate form.
Numerous experiments have proved to me that this form is
not at all changed by the sonorous pulsations of a diapason
communicating with the support of the capsule, although those
pulsations be energetic enough to derange and alter the posi
tion of the capsule.

 Relations of Electricity with bodies in the spheroidal state 445
 º 200. I shall conclude by relating some experiments which
 appear to me to have a certain practical importance. M.
   Thury, my assistant during the winter session, remarked that
 water let fall upon a heated copper capsule only assumes the
spheroidal state for some seconds, and generally not at all when
the surface is coated with deutoxide of copper. I immediately
 suspected that this was not a property peculiar to the oxide,
 but an effect attributable to the rough state of the surface, as
 M. Boutigny has remarked *. Direct experiments have shown
that this opinion is well-founded.
... 201. A platina capsule was half coated with a paste formed
of oxide of zinc and water, and raised to a dull red.                 It then
presented the curious appearance of two surfaces, one of which,
being metallic and brilliant, spheroidalized instantaneously the
 pure water which now only evaporated with extreme slowness;
 whilst the latter, rough and of a beautiful canary-yellow, con
verted no less suddenly into vapour the drops of water which
were projected on to it.                    -
    202. The carbonate of protoxide of iron, reduced to the
state of peroxide by calcination, behaves like the oxide of zinc.
The colour and the chemical nature of the deposit do not
therefore take any part in the phaenomenon.
    203. English rouge mixed up with water covers platina,
but it does not absolutely prevent the spheroidal state from
being produced: its action seems to be limited to diminishing
considerably the duration of the evaporation f.
    204. The red oxide of manganese, obtained by the pro
longed calcination of the peroxide, is still less destructive of
the spheroidal state than the colcothar: moistened with cold
water it adheres much less to metallic surfaces.
    205. The colourless syrup of sugar readily assumes the
spheroidal state on platina. The drops appear at first opake,
especially if they are large, from a number of small bubbles
of gas traversing them; they subsequently become beautifully
transparent, and remain frequently immoveable, similar to
nearly spherical glass lenses. Lastly, when the syrup has
attained the maximum of concentration, it enters into a violent
 state of ebullition, without however spreading over the cap
 sule, or moistening it; it changes into caramel, passing from
a yellow to a brown colour, and finally leaves a bulky ball of
porous carbon.

    t M. Muncke has already observed, that a plate of iron oxidized by
 contact with air at a white red heat ceases to spheroidalize water which is
 poured on it—-Gehler’s Phys. Wörterbuch, 2nd edit., vol.x. p. 490, 1841.

decomposition commences, the liquid touches the metal and
covers it, at the end of the operation, with a slightly adherent
coating, which is of a beautiful glossy black. This crust of
carbon, heated even until the naked parts of the capsule are
red, absolutely prevents the production of the spheroidal state;
but pure or sugared water which is let fall on the platina, and
is coloured of a deep black colour by some particles of the
deposited carbon, behaves as if it had remained transparent
 and colourless.
    207. M. Fechner states” that water no longer becomes
 spheroidal when it has been tinged with ink, or rendered
 opake by charcoal suspended in it. I repeated these experi
 ments with care, and have found them inaccurate.               In the
 two cases the blackened liquid readily assumed the spheroidal
 state on a plate of platina, and remained so for several minutes,
until the solid particles from which it separates on evaporating
 unite into a small spongy ballf.
    208. Moist crystallized sugar spheroidalizes whilst dissol
 ving in its water of crystallization. It presents the same phases
 as the syrup from the moment of the caramelization.
    209. Butter and suet pass into the spheroidal state in melt
 ing: they soon take fire and give off a light soot which dis
 appears, being converted into carbonaceous gases.
    210. It is very generally thought at the present day that
 one of the principal causes of explosion of boilers is owing to
 the sudden conversion into gas, at a very high temperature,
 of water first spheroidalized by contact with over-heated sur
 faces. If this opinion is proved, this terrible danger will cer
 tainly be remedied by clothing with an appropriate coating the
internal surface of the generators, or by giving it a rough
surface, which is unfavourable to the production of the sphe
roidal state. This would be less costly, and would present much
less danger than the set of points proposed by M. Boutigny.
I have not had the means of making experiments on this sub
ject, which I must postpone till a more propitious moment.

 LXVI. On Pluquaternions, and Homoid Products of Sums of
    n Squares. By the Rev. THoMAs P. KIRKMAN, A.B., Rector
    of Croft with Southworth, Lancashire”.
 Th; following analysis is the fruit of my meditations on
       Professor Sir W. R. Hamilton's elegant theory of qua
 termions, and on a pregnant hint kindly communicated to me,
 without proof, by Arthur Cayley, Esq., Fellow of Trinity
 College, Cambridge, about the connexion between a system
 of triplets having no duad in common, and the property that
 the product of two sums of 2n squares shall be a sum of 2n
 squares. In a note with which the latter gentleman recently
 favoured me, he writes, “The complete test of the possibility
 of the product of 2" squares by 2” squares reducing itself to a
sum of 2" squares, is the following:—Forming the complete
system of triplets for (2”— 1) things, if eab ecd fac.fdb be any
four of them, we must have, paying attention to the signs only,
                  (+eab)(+ecd)=(+ fac)(+ fab);
that is, if the first two are of the same sign, the last two must
be so also, and vice versá, I believe that, for a system of seven,
two conditions of this kind, being satisfied, would imply the
satisfaction of all the others.   It remains to be shown, that the
complete system of conditions cannot be satisfied for a system
of fifteen things.”
   In the following investigation, the truth and completeness
of Mr. Cayley’s test of the property in question for sums of
2” squares are established, and the contradiction anticipated
by him for a system of fifteen is deduced; while ulterior results
about homoid products of sums of n squares are obtained.

 450.       The Rev. T. P. Kirkman on Pluquaternions,
 that can be formed with seven things, so as to have no duad
 in common, is seven.      Of these, there will be three in which
 ao is found; let the three be made all of one sign, by the in
 version of a duad if necessary, a change which can alter no
 value, since -a, b, co- + as cob. Neglecting subindices, let
 the three triplets be abc, ade, afg. We shall consider the order
 abcde<U+017F>g to be alphabetical, and shall inquire what the remain
 ing four triplets will be, when written out in the same order.
 Because
                         abc=ade= + 1 ;
                          bc=de,
 and                    —c-b.de.
 Now b.de, whether real or not, if b, d, e be any three imagi
 naries, cannot differ in sign from e.db; for if it does,
              b.de= —e.bd=d. eb- —b.de, Q.E.A.
 Therefore
                        — c-b.de =e.bd,

Ol'
                         bd=ec;
and for the same reasons,
                         be- ca.
Hence, in each of the following lines, any two equations are
implied in the third:—
             bc=de,      be-cd,       bd= —ce;
             bc=fg,      bg=cf.       bf– –cg; } . . . (A.)
             de=fg,      dg=ef,       df = —eg.
    It is necessary that three similar lines deduced from any
three triplets of the system, beginning with another imaginary
than a, should be consistent with these. Now it is readily
seen, that the system of seven triplets, of which three are abc,
ade, afg, must perforce contain either baf or ceg; and the
reader will convince himself with less pains than the perusal
of a demonstration would cost him, that the above conditions
can, and thus only can, be fulfilled, by giving to that triplet
of these two,   w; is found in the system of seven, a sign
contrary to that of the remaining three. Hence all possible
arrangements, if abc, ade, afg are in the system, are comprised
in the two following types, each of four systems:—

of which eight systems any one will satisfy the test invented
by Mr. Cayley, of which mention has been made, and which
is proved by the preceding considerations to be both neces
sary and complete for a system of seven triplets.
   The congruity of any of these, e.g. of those in the first type,
may be tested by taking some other order for alphabetical;
for instance,
                      +fga               -
                 1<U+017F>º-<U+017F>ºº),
                    U+fdb            8
which is still of the same type as before.
   One of these eight systems, being adopted, will furnish the
non-linear conditions among the seven imaginaries, by the aid
of which the product of two biquaternions is reduced to a bi
quaternion. The system of the first type, having the two
upper signs, for example, expresses that
                     ao-be co-do €o F/o go?
and
                     do-e, ao--f., bowgo ce.
Hence in the biquaternion Q., formed by this system,
   d  all-aw,--wa<U+017F>--(bcl-cb)+(de-ed) + (<U+017F>g.-gf),
an
      d=dw--wd--(ea,-ae)–(fb-bf)+(ge-cg);
for these are exactly the terms affected by as and d, in the
product Q, Q,. But if we adopt the system of the second
type which has the two lower signs, we should form the same
 unctions thus,
        an=aw, +wa,-(bcl-cb)–(de-ed)-(fg-gf)
        dº-dw-Fwd-(ea,-ae)–(gb-bg)–(fe, -ef);
where the given numbers ww, aa, ...gg, are in both cases the
Same.
   It thus appears, that a biquaternion Q., may be formed, that
shall be equal to the product of any two Q, and Q, in at least
eight different ways; and the eight different values of the pro
duct shall be equally congruous and consistent with our defi
nitions; the real quantities in Q, and Q, being any numbers,
and remaining unchanged in value, sign, or order.
   Let Q, and Q, now be pluquaternions of more than seven
imaginaries. If Q, Q, - Q2, there must be some complete
system of triplets into which the (6m + 1) or (6m-H3) imagi
naries are thrown. Let as do eo and aof go, both of one sign,

454.      The Rev. T. P. Kirkman on Pluquaternions,
containing he or io, and one of the seven imaginaries a, boco
do ec.f.go, none of which duads are in the system of seven
triplets.
   From what has preceded, we conclude that it is impossible
for pluquaternions of more than seven imaginaries to have a
product of the same form, if there are no limitations upon the
values of the real quantities, ww), aa. . . . . r.
   If we now suppose that there are eleven imaginaries, we
can form a fifth triplet beginning with as, viz. a., k, le; and
it can be proved, as in the case of nine imaginaries, that be lo,
colo, dela, e, le; f, lo, g, lo, have each of them an equivalent
duad, but that they cannot any of them be put equal to any
single imaginary, without a contradiction. F. equal values
of as, he is and kole, give also
           ho to-ko ls, ho le= i. ke, ho ko- —i. l.;        o  (D.)
of which neither he l, nor he ko can be equal to any of the
seven a, b, co d, e...f.g., ; for this equality is what we have just
shown to be impossible; nor can h, l, be equal to either is or
ko, nor he ko to either i, or le. Wherefore the product of two
pluquaternions of eleven (=2'2+7) imaginaries must of ne
cessity be of the form
                        Qa Q., Qa,-- Ra,
                                 -
where the condition-function R, contains, besides the six terms
of RI, the six following,             -
   +bol, B, +co le C, +d, le D,--eel, E,--f. l., F. --go lo G.,
with the additional pair of terms +ho le H,--i, l, I,.             -
   The six B, &c. differ from the six B, &c. only in this, that
for the real quantity h or i in the latter, is substituted k or l
in the former; and, in the same way, for h, or i, is put k, or li.
H, and I, are formed from equations (D.), and ku and lip the
two additional terms in Q, with the aid of the triplet ackolo.
   It can also be shown, as in (C.), that the additional duads
in R2, b, l., &c., have the property that be lo--l, boa 0.
   Suppose next that we have thirteen (=2' 3+7) imaginaries.
There is now nothing to hinder us from forming another system
of seven triplets, with ahiklmn, of the same type or not as the
former. We may, e.g. have the fourteen triplets following:
            +abc                    + ahi
            +ade—bdf+cag            + akl–hkm +ikn
            +afg+beg-H cef; +amn--hln +ilm;
for, although we have proved that no one of the seven ab ...g
can form a tenth triplet with any two of hikl, such a triplet can

           and Homoid Products of Sums of n Squares.                  455
be made with two of these and any twelfth imaginary n, or m.
In the case of thirteen imaginaries, then, we have the product
                            Q, Q, Q, + Rs,
                                   –
where Rs contains, besides the six to is B. . . g. i., G., and the
six bol, B. . . . g., l, Gl, another six, be no B, ... g., noGo but
it contains not the pair hol, H, and is le I, because the terms
(Hi) are now part of the function nu, and the terms (I) of mio
by virtue of our new triplets. It is hardly necessary to observe,
that the six duad equivalents of bºne ... g., no are deduced from
equating me no to the values of a, in the first system of seven,
as in equations (B.). The reasoning (C.) applies here as before.
    If there are fifteen (=2'4+7) imaginaries ab . . . . nop, Ra,

    We take first Q., the product of two biquaternions Q, and
Q. Considering the set (be, de fg) as one with .# de)
and with (ch, ed, gif), but distinct from (cb, de, fg) and from
(bd, ce, fg), we can form sixty distinct sets of three duads with
the six imaginaries b, c, d, e...f.g. , Prefixing as to the three
duads of any set (c., b, d, e., f,g), the resulting triplets, accobo,
as do ec, acf, go, can be completed in eight different ways into
a complete system of seven. For example, the three just writ
ten, considered as all of one sign, give for all the two following
values, taking all the upper or all the lower signs together:
         an=aw, +wa, H. (cb,-bc)+(de,-ed) + (fg,-gf);
to either of which values can be appended four distinct sets,
bu  #    enfig, two of either type.
    Therefore the biquaternion Q, the product of two given
ones, Q, and Q, has 480 distinct forms, each exhibiting a
different set of eight numbers, whalib, c, d, enfºgr                -

Q, and Q, are to be multiplied together. The product.
Q., HR, is determined completely, as soon as an eighth triplet
is added to a given complete system of seven.
    Thus, if we add to any one of the eight systems which give
either of the last written values of ap the triplet a, he i, of the
same sign with acco be, we obtain for an hi<U+017F> in the two sets of
values,

and the function R, the same for either set, is deduced from
the equality of the four values of ao. If the eighth triplet is
a, i, he, we obtain the two sets

  hu-hw,--whº-E (ai, -ia),
   in– iw, +wi,-- (ha,-ah);
 and a different function, R1, is given by the equal values of a.,
 and is the same for either set.
    To each of these four sets of all hi<U+017F> in can be appended four
 distinct sets of buch dº enfºgle two from either of our two types.
    But it is not necessary that either ach, i., or a, i, he should
 be the eighth triplet which is added to the given complete
 system of seven. It may be either f. h. i., or f. i., h., for ex
ample. Either of these will add to the value off, which is
exhibited by the biquaternion Q, (made by the given system
of seven), a binomial function of hi h<U+017F>il, while no such addition
 will appear now in all; and the values of hi<U+017F> and in will now
 contain f and f, but not a or ar. The function R, will in
either of these two cases be formed by the comparison of the
 four equal values off.
    It is clear then, that, if he is be the two imaginaries which are
excluded from the given complete system of seven, we can add
to any one of the seven terms (all ... gll) of any one of the 480
biquaternions that can be made with the given complete system
of seven, either of the quantities + (hi,-ih), and append to the
eight quantities wh all ... gh, thus increased, the corresponding
values of hu in and R1; that is, we can construct the sixteen
functions whall blo &c. in the product Q, + R1, in 7°2'480 ways.
If a, b, were the excluded duad, we should have another series
of as many different sets of whalibu, &c.; and, in fact, the
total number of ways of forming the product of two pluquater
nions of nine is 36.7°2'480=241,920.
    Since the case of fifteen or (24–1) imaginaries possesses some
interest, appearing, as it does, to follow next in order after
those of (2°–1) and (2°–1), it may not be considered mere
learned trifling, to assign the number of ways in which (Qa,--RA),
the product of two pluquaternions of fifteen, can be constructed.
This product is completely determined, when to two given
complete systems of seven triplets is added a fifteenth triplet,
containing an imaginary which is common to both the systems
of seven. Let a, be that imaginary; and of the fourteen,
be ce... mone, take any six, b, c, d, e...f.g., and any other six,
he is k, l, m, n., o.p., being the duad excluded from both the
sixes. With a, and the first six, form a complete system of
seven triplets, of which the three containing as shall be any

three, a, b, c., a. d. e., a...f.g., ; and with as and the other six,
form also   such a system, containing e.g. achcic, askele, as mono.
Then all will be one of the eight,

             + (hi-ik,) + (kl,—lk) + (mn,-mm,} + [op-po],
where the like brackets have all the same sign. If (Qa,--R4)
should reduce itself to a biquaternion, by the vanishing of all
the real quantities in Q, and Q, except the twice eight
(ww.aabb, ccddee, fºgg), we should have before us in the pro
duct only the eight functions (whalib/endmen,fig<U+017F>) belonging to
that one of the 480 forms of such biquaternion, which is deter
mined by the system of seven triplets made with a,b,c,d,eof.go;
and if all the real quantities were to vanish from Q, and        §.
except the twice eight (wwaa,hh,iikkºllmmpin), we should have
before us one of the 480 forms of another biquaternion, deter
mined by the triplets made with as he is k, l, m, no. And, since
any one of the latter 480 may be combined with any one of
the former 480, and since in every case the resulting value of
an may receive either of the increments + [op,-po], according
as the triplet a. o.p., is supposed of one sign or the other; it is
plain, that we can form our product (Q,4- R4), so that oc po
shall be the duad excluded from both the systems of seven,
and that the two sixes shall be any pair of sixes, from which
a. o. and po are excluded, and that a, shall be the imaginary
common to all the fifteen triplets, in 2. (480)” distinct ways;
although, be it remarked, the resulting values of an above
mentioned will not amount to a number so great as this. But
any one of the thirteen, from which oc and po are excluded,
may be the imaginary common to all the triplets, and deter
mine, in a different way, to which of all bucº, &c. the increment
 + [op,-po] shall be added; and we may combine any one of
 15-7 excluded pairs (o., p.) with any one of 11:42, pairs of
sixes which exclude (op.). Consequently, the total number
of ways in which the forty-six functions whalibu . . . . pl. may be
formed, in the product of two given pluquaternions of fifteen
 imaginaries, is 2 (480)” 13° 15'7: 11:42, or 290,580,480,000.
    In all these cases, the condition-function Rn is easily formed,
 being given by the comparison of the fifteen equal values of
 that imaginary which is common to all the fifteen triplets;
 and the values on and plp indicated by the pair of imaginaries
excluded from the two complete systems of seven, are given
 by the single triplet, which is added to those systems.

           LXVII.     On the Duration of a Solar Spot.
                      By W. PRINGLE, Esq.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    T is stated by Dr. Dick and other writers that “no spot
      has been known to last longer than one that appeared in
 the year 1676, which continued upon the sun for seventy days.”
 I am inclined to think that a large spot now going off the sun's
disc (21st Nov.), has lasted still longer.
    On the 19th of August last I observed a double spot, or
 two adjacent spots, near the sun's eastern verge, which as they
advanced increased in size, and on the 23rd were visible to
the naked eye as one spot. Their longest diameters were
 27,000 and 31,000 miles respectively, being each about a third
less in breadth, embracing the penumbrae. They were about
 10,000 miles apart, though for the first two or three days they
appeared to be linked together by a curved chain of minute
spots or shallows at their northern extremities, but which be
came eventually absorbed into the penumbra of the largest of
the two. They were both of an oval form, and were followed
till the 28th or 29th, when the nucleus of one had divided
into several parts. They probably disappeared on the 31st
of August.              -
    On September 16 I remarked a large spot (at 4 P.M.) so far
advanced on the sun's eastern limb as distinctly to exhibit
several black nuclei within the edges of the penumbrae, but no
great nucleus in the centre; and on the 17th, when it had
come more round, this peculiarity became more apparent, the
interior sides being studded with small dark spots, while the
centre showed nothing but one vast clouded space or shallow.
As I had been looking for the reappearance of the two spots
of August, it occurred to me that they might have become
conjoined, the conjunction of the two penumbrae forming the
central space of the spot now advancing. There being no
other traces of them, I conceived I was justified in this con
clusion. The smooth contour of the two oval spots had be
come since the contact a vast irregular polygon, as if by the
concussion of two forces the penumbrae had been dashed or
shaken into angular protrusions. The entire spot on the
17th measured about 50,000 miles in its longest dimensions.
A very fair engraving of its outline appeared in the Illustrated
London News of October 7th.        Its size on the 21st was esti
mated at 60,000 miles: I made it somewhat more afterwards.
It was quite perceptible to the naked eye for nearly a week

       Mr. W. Pringle on the Duration of a Solar Spot.        461
after the 17th. On the 27th it was about half a digit from the
 sun's western margin, and probably disappeared the day after;
but cloudy weather prevented it being followed.
    About a fortnight afterwards, on the 13th of October, I
descried a long lenticular-shaped spot about a quarter of a
digit .# on the sun's eastern limb. This I had little
doubt was the spot on its return; and, as it came on, the ge
neral resemblance confirmed its identity. It was, however,
 much contracted in dimensions, measuring about 44,000 miles
 when near the sun's centre. The irregular pointed outline
was still prominent, though the projections were less than on
its previous appearance.
    8. the 26th of October I saw it as a very dim dot or line,
 scarcely distinguishable from the line of circumference of the
sun's western limb.
    On the 9th of November, at some distance north of the point
 of Mercury's entering the disc, a faint depression, having the
 appearance of a spot of some size, was visible. This being the
 very time when the spot of October might be expected to re
 turn, I felt confident it was the same; and its further progress
 confirmed the identity. It was again contracted much in size,
being somewhat triangular in shape.
    If the inferences above stated be well-founded, the spot will
 have lasted about ninety-five days. Whether it will yet make
 another revolution, or half a one, remains to be seen; but I
 shall not probably have it in my power to make observations
 at the period of its next appearance. It may be looked for
 on the 4th or 5th of December.
    In many respects this spot was a remarkable one, and in all
 likelihood did not escape the observation of the illustrious
 author of the Cape Observations, whose chapter on solar spots
 is so interesting.
    I should be happy if you think this worth noticing in your
Journal as a report of some particulars to which my attention
 was directed, and which more profound observers may have
 overlooked.
    The opinion of Dr. Dick, author of The Sidereal Heavens,
 &c., to whom I submitted the observations of August, Sep
 tember and October, that in all probability the spots were
 identical, according to the grounds stated, has the more em
 boldened me to address you.

LXVIII. Further investigation of the Nature of Aërial Vibra
   tions. By the Rev. J. CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.,
   Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philo
   sophy in the University of Cambridge*.
BEFORE         I proceed with the inquiry carried on in several
      preceding Numbers of this Journal, I wish briefly to no     º
tice the views put forth by Mr. Stokes in the November
Number, respecting a supposed remarkable difficulty in the
Theory of Sound which he says that I have pointed out.
What he alludes to I have not myself called a difficulty, nor
do I so regard it. By an investigation contained in the Phi
losophical Magazine for last April, I found that the general
character of acrial vibrations is non-divergence, and that the
theoretical velocity of sound is different from that usually
adopted. Mr. Airy urged against these conclusions, that my
equations represent a particular case of the propagation of
plane-waves: in answer to which I proved, by a reductio ad
absurdum, that plane-waves are physically impossible. This
proof, which forms the subject of Mr. Stokes's remarks, is
given in the Philosophical Magazine, S. 3, vol. xxxii., from
line 16 of page 496 to line 12 of page 497. The absurdity to     º
which the hypothesis of plane-waves conducts is, that the
points of maximum velocity and of no velocity in the same
wave may be at the same point of space at the same time.
Mr. Airy did not reply. Mr. Stokes, however, undertakes to
maintain plane-waves by the following considerations. He
first finds that a point of maximum velocity of a wave travels
at a rate different from that of a point of no velocity, and con
sequently that there is at least great danger of one overtaking
the other. When this        ºãº       is on the point of being
consummated, the wave, as he conceives (for there is nothing
in the analysis to indicate such a result), is converted into a
breaker. What the subsequent motion is Mr. Stokes thinks,
it would not be worth while to inquire, but proceeds to sup
port by considerations, which it is not necessary to particula
rize, the possibility of the physical existence of a surface of
discontinuity at the position where the abrupt alteration of the
character of the wave takes place. How then stands the
question? According to my reasoning plane-waves are phy
sically impossible; according to Mr. Stokes's, plane-waves are
wholly incompatible with the transmission of articulate and
musical sounds. The only conclusion from either result is,
that the hypothesis of plane-waves is inadmissible.
   It may, however, be urged that spherical waves are physi

cally possible; and that as these become plane-waves at an
infinite distance from the centre, the latter are also physically
possible. I have already met this argument in the communi
cation above referred to; but as the reasoning is given briefly,
and may possibly have been overlooked, I will repeat it here.
I take the results of the hypothesis of spherical waves as they
are given in Poisson's Traité de Mécanique (vol. ii. p. 706,
2nd edit.), and as they are commonly admitted. The pressure
p being a”(1 +o], the following expression is obtained for the
condensation a at the distance r from the centre at the time t,
                           _f(at-r).
                          g=-º-;
and it is stated that there is no condensation wherever r is
greater than a t +s, and less than a t-s, 2s being the breadth
of the sonorous undulation. Hence, supposing 2s very small
compared to r, and putting for routside the function, its value
a t corresponding to the middle of the wave, the quantity of
matter existing at any time in the wave beyond what would
occupy the same space in the quiescent state of the fluid, is
very nearly

                                   a’t      2
the integral being taken from r=at-s to r=at +s. Calling
A the constant value of this integral, the expression for the
quantity of matter becomes 47. At. Hence the matter increases
in quantity with the time ! Now the very equations from which
this result is derived are founded on the supposition that the
quantity of matter is constant. There is consequently no dif
ficulty here which any physical considerations can explain,
but strictly a reductio ad absurdum, which necessitates the im
portant conclusion that the hypothesis of spherical waves is
inadmissible. The physical impossibility of plane-waves was
proved by the same kind of reasoning; and any attempt to
reconcile the contradiction in either case is simply illogical.
As neither the hypothesis of plane-waves nor that of spherical
waves is admissible, the theoretical value of the velocity of
sound which rests on those hypotheses necessarily fails of sup
port. I return now to the consideration of non-divergent
waves, or, as they may also be called, ray-vibrations.
   The general equation which gives the density p in any in
stance of fluid motion, the velocity V being known, is

 and p is a function of 2–ait.       Hence    # is also a function of
 2–ait, and a given state of the wave as to velocity is propa
   ated uniformly. Now it may be assumed that at some point
 of the line of motion, viz. at the commencement of the series
 of vibrations, the velocity and density vanish together; so that
 p = 1 where d8&*=0,and consequently,
                                  q     y from what has been shown
 above, where     # =0.      Hence it appears from equation (2.)
 that F(al, b, c, t) =0. Putting therefore f= 1 in that equa
 tion, it follows, since  #   and  # are each functions of z-alt,
 that p is a function of the same quantity. Thus a given state
 of the wave, both as to velocity and as to density, is propa
 gated with the same uniform velocity al. This result is in
perfect accordance with known facts respecting the transmis
 sion of articulate and musical sounds.
    I will take this occasion to advert again to a difficulty re
garding the supposed effect of the development of heat on
aërial waves, which I have pointed out in the Philosophical
 Magazine, vol. xxxii. pp. 283 and 498. Let the relation be
 tween the pressure and density, inclusive of the effect of tem
perature, be expressed by the equation p-a"p", as is allow
able. Then putting 1 + q for p, and supposing a small, we
have
                   dp    .2(1 + k)(1 + 2) k do'
                   is =a                    dz
                       =a”(1  +9% +ka +&c.).
    If now the terms ka +&c. be neglected, the equation is of
the same form as that derived from the relation p-a”p, and is
consistent with the uniform propagation of a given state of
velocity and density. But those terms stand in the way of
such a result; and though they are of small amount, yet their
effect on the form of the wave is accumulative, and must in the
end entirely alter its character. This is the nature of the
difficulty I have alluded to, which, as we have seen, does not
exist in the case of ray-vibrations.

 AMºº the multitude of sublime inquiries embraced by natural
       science, there is none more interesting than that of the duration
 of species of animated beings; none more attractive, through the
 variety of knowledge demanded for a reasonable theory of the intro
 duction, continuance, and withdrawal of species, and of their func
 tions as active agents or passive subjects in the existing oeconomy
 of life; and none more impressively demonstrative of the infinite
 resources of creative intelligence.
    Geology makes known to us a succession of epochs during which
 there flourished, not only particular species of animals and plants,
 but also certain genera and families, which, after performing the
 functions allotted to them during a space of time immeasurable by
 us, have finally disappeared, and have been succeeded by other and
 new races as perfectly adapted as their predecessors to the physical
conditions under which they were placed. In these vast and myste
rious operations we can read and, to a certain degree, comprehend
 the changes of physical condition, by means of our knowledge of the
 structure of these ancient extinct forms when compared with their
recent analogues; thus deriving a reasonable inference regarding
the external circumstances—the existence of land, of sea or of fresh
water, of heat, light and air, and of the nature and probable variety
of minor and subservient beings.
   The work before us relates to beings which have lived almost in
our own day, and have disappeared through causes and under cir
cumstances altogether different to those just referred to. Their ex
tinction has been brought about through the agency of a species
whose power and predominance over all others is the effect of the
combination of a moral and higher intellectual nature, with an amount
of activity and physical strength, inferior to those of many con
temporary species. The beings referred to, so conspicuous from
their size, so defenceless, and so incapable of escaping the assaults of
more powerful and predacious species, could only be adapted to the
peaceful security of those sunny isles abounding in the richest pro
fusion of vegetable life, where successive generations of these happy
birds had continued in the undisturbed enjoyment of an indolent and
luxurious life, for which their heavy and bloated forms were only
adapted.
   Notwithstanding the direct testimony of the first discoverers of
these birds, and the evidence of numerous others who had either seen
them in their native islands or had beheld specimens brought to
Europe, and whose descriptions and figures were published to the

468                 Notices respecting New Books.
world; and notwithstanding the preservation of portions of such
specimens, and those the most important in determining the zoolo:
gical characters of the bird to which they belonged, some naturalis
of the past and present century have not scrupled to deny the reality
of the Dodo itself, and have attributed the whole to the inventive
imagination of voyagers and artists. Scepticism in matters far more
important has frequently been productive of the greatest benefit, by
exciting attention to the subject in dispute; and thus have we become
indebted to the authors of the present work, on which they have
exercised much labour and ingenuity, and have brought to their aid
the most skilful delineation which modern art could yield.
   Much contrariety of opinion has existed among naturalists, who,
believing in the reality of the Dodo, have been unsuccessful in their
attempts to reconcile the anomalies presented by its form and struc
ture. To both of these subjects our authors have addressed them
selves; and they have divided their researches into two distinct
parts; the first containing the history and external characters of the
birds, by Mr. Strickland; and the second part consisting of a minute
osteological investigation, by Dr. Melville.
   The first part comprises three chapters; the first being devoted to
the consideration of the Dodo from the Mauritius, the second to the
Solitaire of the island of Rodriguez, and the third chapter to the
allied birds of the Isle of Bourbon. The evidence used in treating
of the Dodo is of three kinds,-historical, pictorial and real, agree
ably to the plan adopted by a preceding writer, Mr. Broderip.
Although the discovery of the Mauritius was made during the first
half of the sixteenth century, yet no published account of the island
or of its natural history is known prior to the voyage of a Dutch
fleet under Admiral Van Neck in 1598.                                          -
  “In the published narrative of this voyage it is stated that they found in
the island a variety of pigeons, parroquets, and other birds, among which
were some which they denominated Walckvögel, the size of swans, with a
large head furnished with a kind of hood; no wings, but in place of them
three or four small black quills; and the tail consisted of four or five curled
plumes of a gray colour. The Dutch sailors called them Walckvågel, or
disgusting birds, from the toughness of their flesh, as might be expected in
the strongly developed crural muscles of a cursorial bird, though they
found the pectoral muscles more palatable.”—P. 9.                        -
   Accompanying this notice of Van Neck's discovery is a fac-simile
of plate 2 of his work, in which the voyagers are represented in
bustling activity in their several occupations; and the figure of a
large bird resembling the above description forms a conspicuous
object in the drawing. By diligent research among the works of the
voyagers and writers in natural history of the seventeenth century,
especially the earlier ones, a very considerable amount of evidence
has been collected and carefully inserted in the work; and though
the descriptions and drawings of that period are not so precise and
faithful as those of the present day, yet they are sufficiently exact
to leave no doubt in the mind of a candid reader both as to the reality
and identity of the subject described under different names, as Walck

vögel, Dodo, Dodar, Dodaersen, Dronte, besides various specific
names under the genera Cygnus, Gallus, Raphus, Struthio and Didus.
In about a century from its first discovery, the Dodo had become
extirpated through the direct and indirect agency of man —
    “In 1644 the Dutch first colonised the island Mauritius; and it is pro
bable that these gigantic fowls, deprived of flight, slow of foot, and useful
for food, were speedily diminished in number, and finally exterminated by
the thoughtless rapacity of the early colonists. Their destruction would be
further hastened, or might be mainly caused, by dogs, cats and swine, which
accompany man in his migrations, and are speedily naturalized in the forests.
- -  - - - - - - That the destruction of the Dodos was completed by 1693,
may be inferred from the narrative of Leguat, who in that year remained
several months in Mauritius, and enumerates its animal productions at some
length, but makes no mention whatever of Dodos."—P. 27.
     In the second series of evidences, the pictorial, we find five oil
paintings described as extant in different cities of Europe; two of
which are in this country, one of them in the British Museum, the
other in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. “Three of the five pic
tures bear the name of Roland Savery, an eminent Dutch animal
painter of the beginning of the seventeenth century, and one is by
John Savery, the nephew of Roland.”—P. 28. As to the fifth paint
ing, or the one in the British Museum, it is said, “Unfortunately
there is neither name nor date upon the picture; but from the style
of execution, and the identity of the design with the picture next to
be noticed (that in the Royal collection at the Hague), it may be
 attributed to one of the two Saverys.”—P. 29.          These pictures are
justly claimed in support of the historical evidence, which is itself
partly pictorial from the numerous engravings introduced into the
works of several of the earlier writers; and which, though for the
 most part rude, and in some degree discordant, are highly corrobo
 rative of the accompanying written evidence, and also of the inde
 pendent pictures under consideration.                               -
      Of the third kind of evidence, the real or anatomical, there is
 but a very small number of specimens to appeal to, a foot in the
 British Museum, a head and a foot in the Ashmolean Museum, and
 a mutilated head in the public Museum at Copenhagen, are all the
 known relics of this extraordinary bird.
      Few and imperfect, however, as these latter sources of evidence
 unfortunately are, we shall see that they possess well-defined cha
 racters indelibly stamped upon them, by the deciphering of which
 the Dodo, with all its strange anomalies, has been assigned a fixed
 position in its class, after having been tossed about among various
 families, none of which were content to receive it with much cor
 diality.
      It is not a little startling (so apt are we to be misled by size and
 general configuration) to find this uncouth and unwieldy bird, after
 having been deemed too inactive for the Raptores, too awkward for
 the Gallinaceae, and too slow for the Struthionidae, at last settling
 down among the graceful, gentle, and volatile Columbidae. Yet such
 is the conclusion formed by a minute examination of the anatomical

 470                 Notices respecting New Books.
characters of the detached remains of the bird, in connexion with the
 other sources of evidence; a conclusion which it is freely conceded
had been previously arrived at by Professor Reinhardt of Copenhagen,
but which does not detract in the least from the merit of our author,
who attained the same point by a different and independent path.
   The alliance of the genus Didus with the Columbidae, through the
genera Treron, Verrulia and Didunculus, appears to be satisfactorily
made out; the points of difference, which are candidly set forth in
the work before us, being few and comparatively unimportant.
   The second chapter is devoted to the Solitaire, the brevipennate
bird of the island Rodriguez,-the Didus solitarius of Gmelin, and
named by our author Pezophaps solitaria.
   Historical information respecting this bird is almost entirely con
fined to the account published in 1708 by Francis Leguat, a French
voyager, who furnishes many interesting particulars of its history
and habits, from which it appears to have been closely allied to the
bird of the Mauritius, though belonging to a distinct genus. The
Solitaire has long since disappeared; and the only real evidences of
its form and structure now existing, are some bones preserved in the
Paris Museum, and others in the Museum at Glasgow. The former
consist of
“a femur, a tarso-metatarsal, a humerus, the medial portion of a sternum,
and a portion of the cranium. Unfortunately they are all incrusted uni
formly over with stalagmite from ºth to ºth of an inch in thickness, which
prevents all examination of the surface of the bones, or any minute descrip
tion of their structure. They nevertheless supply us with several important
elements to guide us in reconstructing the skeleton of this lost bird.
   “The Glasgow series of bones are all portions of the hinder extremity,
and consist ºthree femora, a tibia, and two tarso-metatarsal bones. Their
appearance as well as their history, proves them to have been obtained under
different circumstances from those last mentioned. They still contain
nearly the whole of their animal matter, present a glossy surface, consider
able specific gravity, and are neither changed in colour nor incrusted with
extraneous matter.”—P. 53.
   Figures of these bones are given in the plates, and a copy of Le
  uat's engraving of the bird accompanies the text.                          -
   The third chapter contains a notice of the brevipennate birds of
the Isle of Bourbon, which “is proved by indisputable evidence to
have been inhabited by two species of birds, whose inability to fly,
and their consequent rapid extinction, brings them into the same
category with the Dodo of Mauritius and the Solitaire of Rodriguez.”
—P. 57.       No less than six writers between the years 1613 and
1735 are quoted in support of the existence of one or both species
down to the latter date. No specimen or detached bones are known;
nor does any figure of the birds accompany the descriptions of these
writers. One of them, a Sieur B, in an unpublished manuscript
journal belonging to the Zoological Society of London, thus describes
the two birds:—
   “1. Solitaires. These birds are so called because they always go alone.
They are the size of a large goose, and are white, with the tips of the wings

                     Notices respecting New Books.                          471,
and tail black.  The tail-feathers resemble those of an ostrich; the neck is
long, and the beak is like that of a woodcock, but larger; the legs like
those of turkeys. This bird has recourse to running, as it flies but very
little.
   “2. Oiseaua bleus, the size of Solitaires, have the plumage wholly blue,
the beak and feet red, resembling the feet of a hen. They do not fly, but
they run extremely fast, so that a dog can hardly overtake them; they are
very good eating.”—P. 59.
   In reviewing the structure of the Dodo in connexion with other
anomalies occurring in all classes of the animal kingdom, and glan
cing at the unphilosophical notions held by some naturalists, of the
imperfection of certain species presenting such anomalies, the author
thus expresses a far more sound and consistent interpretation of the
laws of organization.
   “It may appear at first sight difficult to account for the presence of organs
which are practically useless. Why, it may be asked, does the Whale
possess the germs of teeth which are never used for mastication? Why has
the Proteus eyes when he is especially created to dwell in darkness? And
why was the Dodo endowed with wings at all, when those wings were use
less for locomotion ? This question is too wide and too deep to plunge
into at <U+017F>º I will merely observe, that these apparently anomalous facts
are really the indications of laws which the Creator has been pleased to
follow in the construction of organized beings; they are inscriptions in an
unknown hieroglyphic, which we are quite sure mean something, but of
which we have scarcely begun to master the alphabet. There appear, how
ever, reasonable grounds for believing that the Creator has assigned to each
class of animals a definite type or structure from which he has never de
parted, even in the most exceptional or eccentric modifications of form.
Thus, if we suppose, for instance, that the abstract idea of a Mammal im
plied the presence of teeth, the idea of a Vertebrate the presence of eyes,
and the idea of a Bird the presence of wings, we may then comprehend
why in the Whale, the Proteus and the Dodo, these organs are merely
suppressed, and not wholly annihilated.”—P. 34.
   The second part of the work consists of an elaborate account, by
Dr. Melville, of the osteology of the Dodo and Solitaire, so far as a
most minute and skilful examination of the few bones extant could
be rendered available. This important service to science has been
greatly facilitated through the enlightened and liberal feeling of the
trustees and curators of the museums of Paris, Glasgow and Oxford,
who not only permitted free access to these anatomical treasures,
but allowed, in the two former instances, the bones themselves to be
conveyed to this country for examination.
   The evidence of Dr. Melville derives additional weight from its
being free from prejudice, and unshackled by previously declared
opinions: to use his own words, “My testimony is that of an im
partial observer with no hypothesis to defend, and who claims no
share in the merit due to those who have succeeded in restoring the
Dodo to its proper rank.”—P. 70. The first chapter is occupied by:
a detailed statement of the structure of the bones of the Dodo, and
a comparative view of that of birds belonging to the several orders
and families to which this bird has been hitherto regarded as allied.
   It results that the characters indicate a close alliance with the

472                 Notices respecting New Books.
 Columbidae; and the examination of the osteology of the Solitaire in
the second chapter tends to the same conclusion. The characteristic
features of both birds are clearly set forth in a most complete and
beautiful suite of lithographic plates executed by three artists (Ford,
Dinkel and West).                      -                                º

  "Although the names of Sprat, Birch and Thomson, together with
 that unkind cutter, Hutton, have long been classed as historians of
 the Royal Society, we cannot but at once say that Mr. Weld's pro
duction is the only one which is really deserving of the designation
of a history of that well-known Body. Bishop Sprat's work was
published in the early days of the Society, and can only be ranked
as an apology for its conduct; Dr. Birch's is an abstract of its papers;
Dr. Thomson's is a rapid sketch of the progress made by the several
sciences since its establishment; and Dr. Hutton's Jeremiad, in the
first edition of his Mathematical Dictionary, is statement rather than
history, and moreover is strongly influenced by personal irritation.
A clear unbiassed account of the rise, advance, and present state of
the institution was therefore open to Mr. Weld; and his situation
as Assistant Secretary and Librarian, together with his intercourse,
with the Fellows, eminently qualify him for the task.          -      :-
    It is usual to commence the foundation of the Royal Society with
the troublous times of the Commonwealth; when weekly meetings
took place at Dr. Goddard's lodgings, in order to discourse on sub
jects connected with mathematics and natural philosophy. But were
its real origin strictly searched after, it might, we think, be justly
dated half a century before that time. The real founder was Lord
Bacon, who by his Instauration of the Sciences opened the gates of
the Castle of Knowledge; and in his philosophical remance of the
New Atlantis, distinctly planned and set forth such an institution;
hence old Aubrey's marked recognition, secundum mentem Domini
Baconi. Still to the aforesaid weekly meetings, and the strenuous
exertions of Wilkins, Wallis, Ent, Goddard, Haak, Boyle and others,
must be ascribed the stand which procured the charter of incorpora
tion from Charles II. in 1662. Since that period the affairs and pro
ceedings of the Society have been matter of public history; and its
efforts are shown in that invaluable series of papers, the 138 volumes
of Philosophical Transactions which it has published. This work
is a truly important chronicle of the discoveries made by the Fellows,
or their correspondents, together with a vast quantity of varied and
profound information in every branch of science and art. By this
grand series, the establishment of the Royal Society is proved to have
been beneficial to the human race; and though often assailed from
without, and torn by intestine broils, it is still the intellectual gem
of Great Britain, and wields a mighty power over the scientific des
tiny of the country. For the whole view of the rise and advance of

 "Nurtured in the Civil Wars, when party and sects had sickened
people of divinity and politics, the constitution of the Royal Society
was independent in its form and support, and liberal in its association.
On the subject of religion they were more especially cautious, not
only in the days of their infancy, but even when under the direction
of Newton himself: in this spirit, says Sprat, “they have freely
admitted men of different religions, countries, and professions of life;
not to lay the foundation of an English, Scotch, Irish, popish, or
protestant philosophy, but a Philosophy of MANKIND.” And,
when the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge were desirous,
of holding their meetings in the Royal Society's rooms, Newton,
who was a bit of an autocrat in his way, drew up a number of sound,
arguments against their admission. By this sturdy stand the Prin
ceps Philosophorum wished to preserve the body under his charge
from the passions of the age. “It is a fundamental rule of the
 Society,” said that illustrious President, “not to meddle with reli
gion; and the reason is, that we may give no occasion to religions,
bodies to meddle with us :” and he refused to comply with the re
quest, lest the compliance might “dissatisfy those of other religions."
     And did this wise policy actuate the great men of a century and
a half ago? Alas for the march of intellect so proudly boasted of!
Compare this with the conduct of the present magnates in the for-,
mation of an Architectural and Archaeological Society in the year
 1848, of which the President is the Lord Bishop of Oxford. The
constitution of this body is entirely exclusive, and the door is closed.
to all religions, persuasions, and sects but their own; this being the
published form of admission :-                                                     tº n - ::

     The earlier functions of the Royal Society appear to have been
the scraping together of information, some of it jejune enough ; but
it soon created that keen spirit of experiment which has placed it on                          *
the highest plinth of utility, and for which it is justly entitled to the
unfeigned gratitude of the world. At the period of its formation,
the diffusion of new discoveries was an affair of difficulty and delay,
and a first step therefore was to publish periodically al<U+017F> discoveries
which came to their cognizance.                  A man of science could not then
well appear before the world unless he had a book to publish: but
9Idenburg, the Society's first secretary, soon taught how every new
fact might be readily communicated. Nay more, however useless,
or even trifling, some essays may have appeared at first sight, expe
rience has shown that the same investigations, pursued by abler men,
have frequently led to discoveries of the greatest import. Hence

 the fitness and utility of furnishing inquisitive minds with easy op
 portunities of communicating the progress and effects of their re
 spective researches, in what manner soever they may have been con
 ducted, or to whatever purpose they may have been originally intended.
 Now the Society, which has largely, by these means, promoted the
 advancement of knowledge, surely merits to be recorded as a benefi
 cial acquirement to the general public.
    Although the Royal Society has subsisted on the voluntary contri
 butions of its own members, it has not been without munificent gifts.
 Among the earliest of these was the present of the celebrated Arun
 delian Library, consisting of several thousand printed volumes and
 numerous manuscripts. On this occasion, it is whispered, that the
 Society were as much obliged to Evelyn as to Mr. Howard,—but we
 dislike looking a gift horse in the mouth. Other presents and con
 siderable benefactions have followed; still Mr. Weld shows how often
 the proceedings have been interrupted, and even the fraternity en
 dangered, by pecuniary difficulties. Indeed it is painful to notice
 the loss and inconvenience even now occurring to the establishment
by the mean backwardness of some of its members in paying their
 moderate subscription. Much pseudo-sentimentality has been ex
pended on this topic, and we believe idly expended; our own opinion
 being, that it is those who can that won't pay; and that in 98 cases
 out of 100, the defaulter is more deficient in principle than purse,
 and exercises sheer and prepense fraud. If a person is so pressed by
 his circumstances that he cannot pay, surely he ought to resign;
 but such is only the exception to the rule of defaulting, and we think
 that the energies of the laws have been allowed to slumber too long.
 As to all those who wilfully cheat the Societies to which they have
 signed obligations, we hold that they forfeit the character of gentle
 men in the act, and should be proceeded against. In the present day
 the Councils have little excuse for allowing any losses of the kind,
 since there is the ready aid of the County Courts, the which, we
 are happy to state, have just been appealed to with great success by
 the Zoological Society.
    Constituted as the Royal Society is, a sort of democracy ruled by
an oligarchy, it is no marvel that there should be frequent “flares
 up;” and that they should so often have happened, the more 's the
pity. Mr. Weld gives a very fair statement of the most serious of
these, though he does not pronounce upon the animus of each ; still
 his means of ascertaining and showing the interior management and
 oeconomy of the Society, render him the best authority on the sub
ject. One thing is clear, namely, that the medical men, who form
 a legion, and the scarcely less numerous naturalists, are ever mighty
 desirous of ruling the roast”. And a long run they had of it, when

L. "A conclusion very different from that which is here adopted by the
 esteemed friend to whom the editors are indebted for this interesting No
 tice seems to be warranted by Mr. Weld’s account of these disputes, in
 which a violent and domineering spirit seems not to have been evinced so
 much by the Naturalists as by the opposite party, headed by Horsley, whose
 conduct and motives appear in no favourable light.—R. T.

the small corps of mathematicians and astronomers were defeated
under the dictatorship of Banks. On that occasion it was that Dr.
Horsley uttered his indignant oration to the President; and which,
though frequently interrupted, he delivered with great force. As
Mr. Weld has not given this speech, an extract may serve to show
the nature of the argument.
   “We see that great numbers may be occasionally brought down to ballot
upon particular questions, who do not honour the Society with a very regular
attendance. We are well aware, Sir, that oppressive statutes may be framed
in the Council, and with this support in the Society at large, received. We
understand that motions personally offensive and injurious may be brought
forward, and perhaps may be carried; and by these means the remedies
which the scientific part of the Society would wish to apply to the abuses
which exist, may be prevented. But, Sir, I am united with a respectable
and numerous band, embracing, I believe, a majority of the scientific part
of this Society, of those who do its scientific business. Sir, we shall have
one remedy in our power when all others fail : if other remedies should
fail, we can at least secede. Sir, when the hour of secession comes, the
President will be left with his train of feeble amateurs; and that toy (point
ing to the mace) upon the table, the ghost of that Society in which Philo
sophy once reigned, and Newton presided as her minister.”
   Apropos of this toy. It is well-known that in 1663 Charles II.
presented the Royal Society with a mace; and that the same practice
respecting this official symbol exists at the Royal Society as is observed
in Parliament, namely, that it is put on the table when the chair is
taken. Now this mace was confidently asserted to be the identical
one referred to by Cromwell when he expelled the Commons from
their house, by ordering his soldiers to “Take away that bauble;”
and which was therefore an eyesore to the king. Such was the
assurance; and the story was as popular as accredited. In this state
of happy ignorance in comes Mr. Weld, and with his meddling among
the papers destroys the long-cherished illusion; for he shows that it
was ordered to be made for the Society, and produces an every-day
kind of warrant for its being prepared and delivered. We know not
how this dissolution of the bauble of the Long Parliament will be
relished by the Fellows at large; but we think they must approve of
the perseverance with which our author followed up his chase after
truth, and of the candid manner in which he has related it...,
    An attentive perusal of the pages before us leaves the quaestio
 vea'ata as to the best composition of the Royal Society—whether it
 should consist of emerito members only, or the mixed leaven it now
exhibits—pretty much where it was ; there being, according to the
 sage observation of Sir Roger de Coverley, much to be said on both
 sides. Still it certainly does appear outré that the phalanx of
 science should contain such discordant elements, and admit of so
 many counterfeits; and it is unfortunate that these many are palmed
 on the country with F.R.S. to their name, for no other reason than
 the homely one of their money being required. To be sure, public
 opinion settles this in some degree, since the necessity of so strange
 amixture is pretty well known ; and though the troAAoi are noisy and

rudent at elections and the like, they are of course excluded from
 the honours and consideration of the Society; that is, from their
 state and condition they are not likely to be selected by the Council
 to read the Croonian or Bakerian lectures, which are followed by a
 small pecuniary reward; nor are they likely ever to aspire to the
 Copley, the Rumford, or the Royal medals.
    Mr. Weld gives a very elaborate insight of the composition of the
body at large, and its statistics, together with a lucid retrospective
review of its labours from the commencement to our present time.
 And however trite the matter may be to a large class of our readers,
there may be many who will like to see the form and ceremony ob

 June 9, TYISCOVERY of a new Satellite of Saturn”. By W.
   1848.          Lassell, Esq.
       “In communicating to you the particulars attending the discovery
 of an eighth satellite of Saturn, I shall adopt the proper names pro
 posed by Sir John Herschel for the seven hitherto known satellites,
 namely, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan and Japetus,
beginning with the closest, and proceeding in order of distance from
 their primary. The new satellite I have proposed, in conformity
 with this nomenclature, to call Hyperion.                    * *
      “On the 18th of September, while surveying the planet in the
twenty-foot equatoreal, and looking out for Japetus (which I ex
pected to find following the planet and not far from the plane of his
ring), I remarked two stars exactly in the line of the interior satel
lites. Not being certain at the time which of these was Japetus
 (although the nearer of the two certainly seemed too faint), I made
atocareful                fixedpositions
             diagram of their
       some neighbouring         stars. with respect to Saturn,
                                                              tº gº
                                                                       and also
                                                                              -
      “The next night, the 19th, proved fine, and I was astonished to
find that the two stars had both moved away from the fixed stars to
which they had been referred, and were still accompanying Saturn ;
the more distant of the two had also gone northward, in conformity
with the orbital motion of Japetus, while the nearer and fainter, re
maining precisely in the line of the inferior satellites,
have slightly approached the planet.             , sº      A.
                                                                   appeared to
      “A consideration of this appearance suggested the idea that the
more distant was Japetus, and that the nearer and fainter must be
a new satellite of Saturn. To verify the suspicion, I took differences
of right ascension between each and a fixed star, and found that in

 1 * The new satellite was, it is said, discovered at the observatory of Cam
bridge, U.S., on Sept. 16, but no account has been received from Professor
 Bond.                                                                     -

2h 36m the suspected satellite had moved westward 2*46, and that
in 1" 24" Japetus (the identification of which was now certain) had
also moved westward 1*27.          It is true that these differences are
somewhat greater than is consistent with the orbital motion of Saturn,
yet perhaps not greater than is consistent with reasonable errors of
observation during so short a period. Moreover, as the suspected new
satellite was situated precisely in the line of the satellites interior to
itself, I took micrometrical measurements of its situation at two
epochs, four hours apart, and was satisfied that during that interval
no perceptible change whatever took place in its position in the line
of the satellites.   As the motion of Saturn southwards in the same
period amounted to 18", he must have left the suspected satellite
obviously behind if it had been a fixed star. I could therefore now
arrive at no other conclusion than that I had discovered a satellite
hitherto undetected.
   “I regret that since the 19th of September the weather has been
remarkably unfavourable. I obtained a good set of measures of the
elongation of the satellite on the 21st, and two very hasty measures
on the 22nd, caught between clouds, which, with an estimation of
its elongation on the 18th, are all the data I have hitherto obtained
towards the determination of its period.       Since the latter date the
weather has been uniformly cloudy.
   “If these observations should be thought worthy of being recorded
until better can be obtained, they would stand thus:—
            Sept. 18, Elongation east of Saturn (estimated
                         comparison with Titan)

                   21, Elongation, measured .....................  3 54
                   22,    Ditto      ditto   ................. ... 3 27
   “These observations would, I believe, be best satisfied by a period
of about twenty-four days, which may at least serve as a guide in
looking for the satellite. Its magnitude is very small, perhaps not
intrinsically so great as that of Mimas, though it was much easier
to see, on account of its greater distance from the planet.
   “During this autumn I have twice been gratified with a sight of
the whole seven satellites of Saturn at one time, viz. on the 19th of
August and on the 16th of September, at 11° 15". The observa
tions of the latter evening were very interesting. I first saw the
planet a little before 10", when Tethys was behind the planet, and
Enceladus and Dione absolutely in one.          I immediately recognized
Mimas, and in a very short time Enceladus emerged from conjunction
with Dione, and then appeared with the latter as the most delicate
double-star possible. At 11" 30” Titan had approached close up to
the ball, and was apparently in contact with it. At 11° 35" it had
become occulted. At 11° 5" I observed Tethys just emerging from
behind the ball, and noticed that he emerged evidently south of the
line joining the other satellites. As the present position of the ring
requires that, if revolving in its plane, the satellite should appear
rather to the north on its emergence, this fact seems to afford some
evidence that the satellite does not revolve precisely in the plane of
the ring.    Moreover, at 11" 50", when Tethys and Mimas formed

                       Royal Astronomical Society,                     479
an exquisitely delicate double-star, Tethys was still south of Mimas,
although, as Tethys was receding from the planet and Mimas ap
proaching it, the reverse ought to have been the case if the former
really revolves in the plane of the ring.
   “At 10* 5" this evening (September 16) Mimas was, as nearly as
could be estimated, at his greatest elongation eastward; and on the
16th of October 1847, at 8" 35", I observed him at or very near his
greatest elongation westward. The interval elapsing amounts to
336:045 days; and supposing him to have made in that time 356-5
revolutions, 22" 37" 22*6 will be the period of one revolution.”

   “I am happy to tell you that I have at length brought my polish
ing machine to do all that I ever hoped or purposed it should do. I
had previously obtained very good surfaces with it, but they were
obtained with some anxiety and uncertainty. I wished to be able to
repolish a known good surface without hurting it, as well as to turn
a bad one into a good one with certainty and expedition. This, I
am happy to say, I can now do; and by certain rules, varying with
the proportion of the focal length to the aperture, I can produce a
parabolic surface which shall have the same focus in every part of its
surface to the hundredth of an inch. The improvement in regula
rity of curve is not less than in the truth of its general form. I am
about to make some experiments on the further shortening of focus,
viz. a 12-inch metal of 7-feet focus, more, however, as a curiosity
than for utility*.”

P the pole of the heavens, Z the zenith of the observer, and S the

be the apparent excess of the north polar distance of the object com
pared, above that of the star of comparison, and A the true north
polar distance of the latter, or, more correctly, the mean of the north
polar distance of the two objects; and let pº'—tº be the excess of

   For calculating x, which depends both on the zenith distance and
on the barometer and thermometer readings, the following empirical
 formula is sufficiently accurate and of ready computation:—

 where log k is log 2" (in Bessel's table, pp. 198 and 199 of the work

 reading in English inches, and T is the thermometer reading in de
 grees of Fahrenheit (Bessel's log a' takes account approximately of
 the variation depending on zenith distance of the factor A in the
 expression, A tan zen. dist, for the total refraction). - To select the
 proper value of log k, the argument zenith distance (z) is first ob
 tained by the formula, sec z = sec QZ sec (A–PQ). The calcula
 tions are much facilitated by the formation of two tables; one con
 taining the values of PQ, log sec QZ, and log       tan15QZ,° for every ten
 minutes of hour angle from 0" to 6", whence, by interpolation, and
 by proper attention to changes of sign, the values may be obtained
 for any given hour-angle; the other, a table of values of log k, in
 which the argument is 2, or, which is preferable, log sec 2, the dif
 ference between the consecutive logarithms being 0-01.                -   tº
    In an instance in which the apparent difference of north polar di
 stance was 32°1, the hour-angle 3° 49*7, and the zenith distance
 82°3, the corrections calculated by the above approximate formulae
 were 18" 12 and 0.769. By exact calculation they were found to
 be 18"–27 and Q5'762.
   When differences of right ascension and north polar distance are
measured while the equatoreal is carried by clock-movement (which
is sometimes done with the Northumberland equatoreal), it is ne
cessary to compute exactly the total refractions in right ascension
and north polar distance of each object, no other method appearing
to possess sufficient accuracy.

vatory at Stonyhurst College.

     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal. º a º
        GENTLEMEN,                               Sidmouth, Nov. 15, 1848.
IF   you think the following simple and ready way of producing
     tools for grinding lenses likely to be of service to any of the

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               481
readers of the Philosophical Magazine, you will oblige me by making
it known. I was led to employ this method in consequence of an
injury done to a lens, for the regrinding of which I had no corre
sponding brass tool. Rather than take the trouble of making a set
of brass gauges and also a set of grinding-tools, I took a cast of the
lens itself by pressure upon the cooling surface of some fusible metal
contained in a frame of card. On this tool, thus readily formed, I
reground and polished the lens; and where great accuracy of figure
is not required, have found the method to answer very well. Hoping
that this plan may be useful to others who may meet with a similar
casualty, I communicate it. Perhaps I may also be allowed to men
tion, that I have found zinc exceedingly useful for the formation of
ordinary grinding-tools, being readily cast and turned ; and though
not equal to brass, yet being in many respects superior to the soft
metal tools sometimes employed.

DR. BIALLoBLotzky's Journey To THE sources of THE NILE.
    Letters have been received by Dr. Beke from Dr. Bialloblotzky,
whose intended exploratory journey into Eastern Africa was noticed
in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine”, by which letters
that traveller's proceedings are brought down to the 8th of Novem
ber, when he was at Alexandria.
    Before Dr. Bialloblotzky quitted Vienna on the 7th of October,
the Imperial Academy of Sciences granted him the use of some valu
able instruments made by M. Kapeller of Gumpendorf and selected
by M. Schaubl of the Imperial Observatory, and the Government
procured for him and his son a passage gratis from Vienna to Trieste
by the railway, and from Trieste to Athens, Syra and Alexandria,
by the steamers of the Austrian Lloyd's.
    It was his intention to quit Suez for Aden on the 23rd of No
vember by the East India Company's steam-packet, by which a free
passage has been granted to him by the Court of Directors.
                    ON THE ARSENITES OF. IRON.
    M. Filhol made a few experiments on the arsenites of iron with
the view of discovering a certain method of ascertaining the state in
which arsenic exists in chalybeate waters and the deposits which they
form; the author states that he did not find what he looked for,
but still he observed some facts which he deemed not unimportant.
    Arsenic does not always exist in chalybeate waters in the state
either of arsenite or arseniate, and its presence in certain ferruginous
deposits may not be recognized, on account of the state in which it
exists.
    In proceeding to analyse a deposit from a spring at a little distance
                             * See page 399.                            :

4.82           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
from the baths of Rennes, called Eaua rouges d'Alet, the author ob
served, that this deposit, which he at first thought completely free from
arsenic, contained a small quantity of it, but could only be detected by
washing the gas furnished by Marsh's apparatus, bypassing it through
a solution of gold or silver. For this purpose the deposit previously
carbonized must be employed, for if the water employed to wash was
used instead, not the smallest quantity of arsenic was obtained; and
when the deposit was used in the apparatus, so small a quantity of
arsenic was obtained in a given time, that no spots were procurable.
   The arsenic exists therefore in these deposits in very minute quan
tity, and in the form of a compound insoluble in boiling water, even
when rendered strongly acid by sulphuric acid : the author ad
mits, that not having obtained any arsenic by his first analysis, he
stated that these waters did not contain any; but he afterwards found
that he had been deceived by the process which he employed.
   It was demonstrated by experiments, that if in certain cases the
arsenic existed in the chalybcate waters in the form of a compound
soluble in acids, in other cases it is found in the state of an insolu
ble compound; it was also found that the insoluble arsenical com
pound was so slightly attacked by nascent hydrogen in Marsh's ap
paratus, that it did not contain enough to yield even very slight
spots, and that it was requisite to condense it in solution of gold or
silver to ascertain its existence.
   It remained to determine the nature of the arsenical compound
which acted in this manner, and the author suspected that it might
be sulphuret of arsenic; the deposit had imbibed water containing
sulphates, and itself contained a large proportion of them, besides a
great quantity of organic matter; it will then be readily imagined
that part of the sulphates might be converted into sulphurets under
the influence of the organic matter, and these acting upon the arse
nical compound which previously existed in another form, might
convert it into sulphuret.
   Another considerable difficulty however remained; sulphuret of
arsenic is considered by chemists as perfectly unacted upon by nas
cent hydrogen, and if this be the case it must be admitted that the
ferruginous precipitates examined did not contain sulphuret of
atSenlo.             -
   The author endeavoured, but in vain, to isolate the suspected sul
phuret of arsenic by ammonia; and it afterwards occurred to him to
determine whether the natural sulphurets of arsenic were acted upon
in Marsh's apparatus; for this purpose very pure orpiment and
realgar were reduced to fine powder, and it was ascertained that
the water with which they were washed contained no trace of
arsenic; each of the sulphurets was then subjected to examination in
Marsh's apparatus, the gas liberated having been passed before add
ing them, through solution of nitrate of silver for half an hour with
out producing any change in it. In a quarter of an hour after adding
the sulphurets, the solution of silver began to be turbid; the turbid
ness at first increased very slowly, but at the expiration of six hours,
a considerable quantity of black precipitate was formed; this solu

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                4.83
  tion was set aside, and the gas disengaged from the apparatus was
  passed through a fresh solution, which became immediately turbid,
  and gave in a few minutes a very evident precipitate; when the ap
  paratus was uncorked, M. Filhol was surprised on finding that the
  gas disengaged had the odour of hydrosulphuric acid : the operation
  was discontinued till the next morning, and the current of gas was
  then passed into a third solution of nitrate of silver, which became
  immediately turbid; in a few minutes nearly the whole of the silver
  was precipitated, the gas emitting a strong smell of hydrosulphuric
  acid.
     The author states he always employed very dilute sulphuric acid,
  in order to avoid the production of hydrosulphuric acid pointed out
  by MM. Fordos and Gelis.
     The black precipitates obtained, evidently contained sulphuret of
  silver, but it was possible that arseniuretted hydrogen might also be
  disengaged, independently of the hydrosulphuric acid; to ascertain
  this hydrochloric acid was added to each solution, the chloride of
  silver was separated by filtration, and the filtered liquids were treated
  with hydrosulphuric acid; in all of them a yellow precipitate was
| formed, which was found to be sulphuret of arsenic.
     M. Filhol is of opinion that from these experiments he may con
  clude that the natural sulphurets of arsenic are not absolutely unacted
  upon in Marsh's apparatus, as hitherto supposed; that they are very
  slowly decomposed, and that the quantity of arsenic brought over by
  the hydrogen is too small to produce arsenical spots; that it requires
  a long time to ascertain its presence in the metallic solutions which
  have retained it; that nascent hydrogen acts on both elements of
  these sulphurets, and always contains traces of hydrosulphuric acid
  and arseniuretted hydrogen.
     The author observes that M. Chevallier's experiments on the natu
  ral sulphurets of arsenic are nowise in opposition to the preceding
  facts, since the washings of the sulphurets in the experiments of
  M. Chevallier contained traces of arsenious acid, which M. Filhol’s
  did not; and he thinks the slowness of the action on the sulphurets
  of arsenic will account for their having been supposed, to be not
  acted upon at all.
     From the experiments detailed the author is of opinion, that
  though he has not succeeded in rigorously demonstrating the pre
  sence of arsenic in the cases alluded to, he has shown that it may
  exist in the state of sulphuret in the deposits of certain natural
  chalybeate waters, and that it ought to be searched for in those which
  contain sulphates; the same remark applies to the searches for arsenic
  in the earth of cemeteries.—Journ. de Chim. Méd., Octobre 1848.
          ANALYSES OF DIFFERENT WARIETIES OF EPIDOTE.
                             BY M. HERMANN.
     The author has subjected to analysis a great number of the varie
  ties of epidote, such as zoisites, pistazites, orthites, &c., found in part
  in the Ural.

  with the orthite of Miask, but the former is much the denser (450).
  Several trials gave M. Hermann numbers varying between 3:4 and
  3:6 for the density of the orthite of Miask. By analysis orthite

    oN THE PREPARATION of BLACK sulphur ET of MERCURY.
     M. C. Vogler remarks, that the usual method of preparing Ethiops'
  mineral consists in triturating pure metallic mercury with washed
  flowers of sulphur in a porcelain or marble mortar. The mixture is
  sprinkled occasionally either with water or spirit of wine, and the
  trituration is continued until globules of mercury are no longer dis
  coverable by the glass. Such a process ought not, however, to be
  recommended; for when the mixture ceases to be moistened suffi
  ciently, part of it rises in dust, which not only occasions loss of
  material, but exposes the operator to the inconvenience of respiring
  mercurial vapour.
.    To remedy these inconveniences the author proposes the following
  plan:—Take a thick glass vessel, capable of holding twelve to sixteen
  ounces, put into it four ounces of mercury and one ounce of finely
  powdered flowers of sulphur; shake them continually for about two
  hours, then add another ounce of sulphur, removing the cork of the
  vessel occasionally; shake again until globules are no longer visible
  with the naked eye; lastly, add two more ounces of sulphur and

continue the agitation till particles of mercury are no longer visible
with a glass.
   According to M. Vogler, this method is particularly to be recom
mended, because it requires less time than trituration, is more con
venient and less hurtful. At all events, the process which includes
warming the mortar before trituration should be abandoned; for by
these means a still larger portion is lost in dust, and the mercurial
vapour becomes more hurtful to the operator.—Journ. de Ph. et de
Ch., Sept. 1848.

 IN a paper read at the meeting of the British Association at
      York in 1844, I showed that the two rings seen to pass
through a luminous body, when viewed through certain spe
cimens of calcareous spar, were produced by a great number
of minute tubes parallel to one of the edges of the primitive
 rhomb. When the light is incident on a natural face of the
rhomb, two rings are generally seen, varying in magnitude as
the angle of incidence varies. At one incidence in the plane
of the principal section, one ring vanishes by contracting into
a luminous point; and at a different incidence the other ring
vanishes in a similar manner, the rings always passing through
the luminous body, and vanishing in a point coincident with
it. At another incidence the luminous rings are equal, the
place of the luminous body being at their point of contact,
and a ring on each side of it. If we now incline the rhomb
in the plane of the principal section, one of the rings will
vanish, as already described, while the other enlarges itself;
and by continuing the inclination, the vanished ring will re
appear within the other ring, and touching it at the place of
the luminous image. As the inclination increases (the refracted
ray approaching the axis of the rhomb) the rings increase in
size, the lower ends disappear, and the upper segments, where
they are in contact, become almost rectilineal.
   Beside these two primary rings there are two secondary
ones; one of them a complete ring, and the other only a large
segment of one. The complete ring commences at the centre
of the lesser ring in a red spot at an incidence of 57°; and as
the angle of incidence increases, yellow, green, blue, and violet
tints successively emerge, till we have a beautiful circular
      º

490 Sir D. Brewster on the Phaenomenon of Luminous Rings
spectrum with a violet disc in its centre. As the inclination
increases the spectrum becomes a ring, which gradually ex
pands and approaches to the luminous body or to the primary
ring in which it is inclosed, the red rays being on the outside and
the violet on the inside. The other secondary ring or segment
lies beyond the primary rings. It has a curvature of contrary
flexure at its extremities, and gradually approaches the lumi
mous body, or the primary ring beyond which it lies. It is also
highly dispersed, but less so than the other secondary ring,
 and its violet side is on the outside of the ring. These two
secondary rings are very feeble in the intensity of their light;
                                                                        !
but their intensity increases with the angle of incidence, and
at the greatest possible inclination their intensity becomes
equal, and finally superior, to that of the two primary rings,
which almost disappear.
    The ring E, or that formed by the Extraordinary image of
the spar, vanishes at an incidence of 19° from the perpendi
cular, or 109° from the surface of the rhomb between the
point of incidence and the obtuse angle of the rhomb, and in
the plane of the principal section. The ring O, or that formed
by the Ordinary image, vanishes at an incidence of 33° or 123°,
similarly reckoned. The two rings E and O are equal at an
incidence of 26° or 116°. The inner secondary ring com
mences or disappears at an incidence of 57°. These results
prove that the fibres or tubes, as I have shown them to be,
are parallel to one of the edges of the primitive rhomb.
   The two secondary rings are produced by the duplication
of the ordinary and extraordinary pencils when they are re
flected from an interrupting line or stratum, in the manner
which I have described in the Philosophical Transactions for
1815*.
   The light of the two primary rings is polarized like that of
the two pencils from which it proceeds; the light of the com
plete secondary ring is polarized like that of the ring which
incloses it ; and the light of the secondary segment is polarized
like that of the adjacent primary ring, in conformity with the
results given in the paper now referred to.
   If we incline the rhomb in a plane perpendicular to that of
the principal section, commencing at the incidence where the
two primary rings are equal, both of them expand equally,
the rings intersecting each other, and the point of intersection
keeping in the plane of inclination. The remote portions of
both rings soon disappear, and the visible portions, with the

them in some specimens of Iceland Spar, p. 270. See also Malus, Théorie
de la Double Refraction, p. 194.

luminous body at their intersection, become rectilineal. In
this case the secondary rings are not visible.
   The phaenomena of colour accompanying the rings are very
interesting. In the plane of the principal section, when the
two rings are on different sides of the luminous body, the inside
of each ring is red and the outside violet. When one of the
rings passes to the other side of the luminous body, its inside
becomes violet and its outside red. The degree of dispersion
at any point of the rings increases with its distance from the
luminous body. The colour of the secondary rings diminishes
as they approach to the primary rings. When the rings inter
sect one another, by inclining the rhomb in the plane of the
principal section they are perfectly white at their intersection,
and the colour gradually increases towards the middle part of
their different segments.
   These various phaenomena depend on the law of dispersion
in Iceland spar. I have long ago shown that the dispersive
power accompanying the extraordinary refraction is much
greater than the ordinary dispersive power of the mirror, a
result subsequently confirmed by Rudberg; and Malus * and
others have described the general phaenomena of dispersion
when the ray is incident upon the natural face of the rhomb.
At a perpendicular incidence the ordinarily refracted ray is
neither refracted nor dispersed, while the extraordinary one
is both refracted and dispersed, the violet rays being those
which are least refracted. At a few degrees of incidence in
the principal section both rays are refracted; but in the ordi
nary ray the red rays are least refracted, while in the extraor
dinary ray they are most refracted. At an incidence of 16°
45', according to Malus, the extraordinary rays cease to be
refracted, but continue to be dispersed, the violet rays being
always the least refracted. At an incidence of about 40° both
rays are refracted, but the extraordinary one is not perceptibly
dispersed. At incidences above 40° both rays are refracted
and dispersed in the same manner, the violet rays being most
refracted. When these rings are produced by a well-polished
specimen of Iceland spar, and in a dark room with the sun as
the luminous body, they form one of the most beautiful opti
cal phaenomena which can be seen. If the luminous body has
some considerable breadth, and is crossed with dark or differ
ently-shaded or coloured spaces, the phaenomenon becomes
still more beautiful.
    The phaenomenon of luminous rings has been very recently
observed in a specimen of Beryl, brought from India by the
 Marchioness of Tweeddale, who was so kind as to present it

  492 Sir D. Brewster on the Phaenomenon of Luminous Rings
  to me. In cutting the crystal Mr. Sanderson found that one
  end of it was foul, and produced a luminous ring round a
  candle. I have examined it with particular care, and have
  found that the rings are produced by tubular cavities, and that
  several of these cavities contain the two new fluids, while others
  have contained them, and have been emptied of their contents
  by being cut through by the lapidary at one or both ends.
  These tubes are accurately parallel to the axis of the six-sided
  prism; several of them have irregular shapes like some of those
 which I have figured in my papers On the two New Fluids in
  Minerals". In the opened tubes their interior is covered with
 an indurated crust which the fluid has left behind, while in
 others the fluid is distinctly visible with high magnifying
 powers. In two or three parts of the specimen there are
 spaces or strata of fluid cavities perpendicular to the axis of
 the prism, and of a hexagonal form. Hundreds of these ca
 vities are like mathematical points, which the highest magni
 fying powers are unable to resolve, but many of them are suf
 ficiently large to exhibit clearly the two new and immiscible
 fluids which exist in the same cavity, and the great expansion
 by heat of the volatile fluid. In the many hundred specimens
 of topaz and other minerals in which I have had occasion to
 examine the physical character of these fluids, the denser of
 the two which occupies the angles and narrow portions of
 cavities is much smaller in quantity than the volatile fluid,
 which flies off in a gaseous form when the cavities are opened
 or burst by heat. It is quite otherwise, however, in the beryl
 cavities. The volatile fluid, with its apparent air-bubble or
 vacuity, floats in a small quantity of the denser fluid, and ex
 pands so as to fill that vacuity at a temperature of 60°. In
 several of these cavities there are minute crystals, but I have
 not ventured to apply such a degree of heat as to determine
 whether or not they will melt and recrystallize like those in
the topaz cavities.                                             -
    As the tubular cavities in this remarkable specimen of beryl
are larger than those in calcareous spar, the luminous ring which
they produce is not such a smooth and regular band of light as
it is in the latter mineral. The ring is composed of a number
of radial lines closely packed together, and in particular lights
it derives from this structure a great degree of beauty. As
there is no unbalanced dispersion, the ring is perfectly white;
and at three points of its circumference 120° distant, there is
an image of the luminous body. The ring of course does not
consist of polarized light like the rings in calcareous spar, but
is composed of two rings oppositely polarized. If the cavities

 had been considerably inclined to the axis of double refraction,
 the images might be sufficiently separated to produce phaeno
 mena analogous to those in calcareous spar. When the spar
 or the beryl is bounded by planes perpendicular to the axis of
 the crystal, the rings become straight lines.                       -
    In the uniaxal negative system of polarized rings which I
 discovered many years ago in Beryl, I noticed an imperfect de
 velopment of the black cross near its centre. In the system of
 polarized rings shown by the present specimen, the black cross
is still more imperfectly developed, the arms of the cross being
slightly curved and separated, as if there was a very feeble axis
of double refraction perpendicular to the real axis. This effect
is produced by a very interesting cause, to which I have had
occasion to refer at some length in another place”. When
 the beryl was in a soft state from heat, the fluids or gases con
tained in the tubular cavities had compressed the substance
of the beryl to a certain distance around them, and thus mo
dified the double refraction due to the forces of aggregation
by which the crystal was formed. Different degrees of com
pression have been produced by different cavities; but the tint
resulting from them is generally a full white of the first order,
and in some cases a yellow of that order. When in the pola
rizing microscope the light is incident obliquely to the axis of
the crystal, and nearly in the plane of primitive polarization,
the regular tints are singularly modified and serrated by those
produced by compression.
    In the sapphire or asterial corundum, where we have three
systems of cavities, each parallel to the sides of an equilateral
triangle, the three systems of luminous lines give us by re
flexion the beautiful hexagonal radiations which are so much
admired. These systems of lines will be converted into rings
when the sapphire is cut by planes that are not parallel to the
direction of the cavities.

 discovered several years ago, for the case of three imaginaries;

 &c. is called by him Division of Quaternions, so may the ex
 tension of the process to cases of more than three imaginaries
 be called Division of Pluquaternions.
   We have here arrived at these remarkable results by purely
d priori reasoning; and we accept them at once, without ask
ing for the application of any test, or troubling ourselves about
 the multitude of vanishing terms.
   In our first definitions of the imaginaries, and in the sup
position that, if possible, the product of two pluquaternions
shall be a pluquaternion, irrespective of all limitations upon
their real quantities, we have found it to be of necessity im
plied, that the form of that product should be in general, for
(2m+7) imaginaries,

and, from thecondition that this product is congruously formed,
(a condition imposed by our first supposition), no matter in
which of the various practicable ways the multiplication is
consistently effected,—before we have examined, before we
have constructed, before we have even learned how to construct,
the functions wh all blo &c.—we conclude inevitably, that

   After what has been delivered concerning the different forms
of the product of two pluquaternions, whose constituents are
all given positive numbers, it becomes an easy problem in
combinations to find the number of ways in which the sum of
squares, u<U+017F>?--13°, can be assigned equal to the product pºp.”.
For instance, gº, the sum of the squares of the constituents
of Q, any one of the 480 forms of the product of two given
biquaternions Q, and Q, whose constituents are (wa ...g),

change the signs of all the sixteen together, obtain in every

  squares of the constituents of Q', any other of the 480 above
  mentioned forms; because who and the terms of ambu ... gh
  which contain w and we will vary through all these sets, while
  they are invariable through all these forms. If, in the con
  stituents of Q, the first here mentioned, we change the signs
  either of all of wa . . g, or of all of war... gº, we shall sim
  ply reverse the signs of all the roots in pºliº, if we change the
  signs of the eight wabcwa,b,c, indicated by any triplet a, b, c,
  in the system of seven, or if we change the signs of the eight
  bcdeb,c,d,e, indicated by any two triplets a, b, c, as de ec, ha
  ving any common imaginary, we shall merely reverse the signs
  of certain of those roots. Finally, after making all these va
  riations of sign of the constituents of Q, and Q, we may essen
  tially alter Q, and Q, by exchanging in either or in both of
  them any other constituent, as c or cp for the real term w or

    *The product of any two sums, each of 8n squares, is always

    (mº.--$3.) is always forty-six squares, which is therefore
not the least number to which the product of two sums of

where R, S, &c. are in every line the same, as to the form and
number of their imaginaries; inasmuch as each of them, when
first it appears, is supposed to contain all those of its own
degree, or equivalents of all those, which cannot be reduced
to simpler forms. This follows of necessity, although we
know nothing as yet about the number ofterms in Sin, T., &c.,
from the property already proved, that no duad be me, or rev.,
made with any two imaginaries taken from any two complete
systems of seven triplets, can be reduced to a monad, or to an
imaginary of the first degree. In the product, therefore, of
three or of four pluquaternions, if b, n., p., and be is revo be a
triplet and a quadruplet, of which neither contains two monads
taken from the same system of seven triplets, b, n., p., or both
b., nep, and b, i., r. v., or else their equivalents of the same
degree, must be exhibited; since no substitution can be made
that will reduce either of these to a multiplet of a lower degree.
And since i(=6n + 1, or 6n—3) imaginaries must be arranged
either in n complete systems of seven, or in (n-1), and one
additional triplet, the product of n pluquaternions, Q, &c.,
 will exhibit Zn, a function of multiplets of the nth degree.
    If we now multiply the above expression for the product by
 Q"), any (n+1)th pluquaternion of the same order, it is not
at first sight impossible, or improbable, that, since we have
only n complete systems of seven triplets at the most, all the
 (n + 1)plets of this product may reduce themselves to multi
plets of a lower degree; so that the same expression shall re
present the product of (n+1), and consequently of (n+1),
pluquaternions of the order i.
    The importance of the question, how far such reduction can
 be made, will appear from the following reasoning.

 is always reducible to 2*** terms.

 reducible to a sum of 2* squares.
    The product of (n+1) sums, each of any 6n squares, is redu

   These results, formidable as they appear in extent, and in
the labour which would be required to verify them, are capable
of demonstration, if it be true that every multiplet imaginary
is equivalent, either with or without a change of sign, to every
permutation of itself; and if it be allowable to substitute, in
any multiplet, for any two contiguous imaginaries which be
long to the same system of seven triplets, that monad from the
same system to which their product is equivalent.
    I will not undertake to demonstrate that the first is true,
and that the second is allowable. I will not even say that the         w
argument is conclusive whereby I have endeavoured to prove
that, in any imaginary triplet,
                        b'np= nºpb=p'bn.
 It is certain, however, that to deny this property of odd mul
tiplets in general, implies a contradiction.
    Let it be supposed, for the present, that it is possible to
determine the signs of all the permutations of any irreducible
 multiplet, or that the signs of certain of them may be so as
sumed, as congruously to fix those of all the rest.
    Let the i (=6.n + 1 = 2m+7) imaginaries be a and the n
 sixes, bed fg, bic, ...gi, bºca . . g . . . ba-1 cm-1. . . gn-1, with
 which n similar systems of seven triplets are constructed, a
 being the imaginary common to all the systems.
    Let A=fic cagee, be any quintuplet and irreducible imagi
 nary arising in the product of five pluquaternions of the order i.
 The multiplication of these by any sixth pluquaternion will
 include the operation QA, of which it will be here sufficient
to attempt (b+c+ bi + c + ba-H cz +bs--cº) A : the triplets being
               abc                   able, . . . . cielfi,

    The equal values of a give a series of conditions
                 be cg = ca bg        be eg = ca. de
                 be bg. = -c, eg      be da = -c, eg, &c.
    If A were fics, a duad in Rn, the operation bºfica, which
 by definition offics is bºf ca, would be of doubtful sign; for
 there is no reason why b fi ca should be considered either as
 bºfics or as bf' ca, the one rather than the other; and it has
 been shown, that bfi'cs=–b ºf ca, is a consequence of
                        b:fics=f'cgb-ca'lf.
    In all probability, the sign of b" A, or bºficscºgge, when

            and Homoid Products of Sums of n Squares.          507
  considered for convenience of reduction (when possible) as
  bf"cacagger, is arbitrary, whatever multiplet A may be, by an
  indeterminateness like that which we have met with in con
  structing a system of seven triplets.   Let us leave it undeter
  mined thus:
        +b^ A = (ºf 'cºagge;=-cgi' cºagge;=) + (gic.cºgger,
  because ba<U+017F>s = –ce gg; and we do not stay here to ask
  whether the transformation of cg<U+017F>' cºcagee, into cºic,cagger in
  volves a change of sign or not. We suppose that the question
  is capable of being congruously decided, either in one way or
  in two ways.
         + c A = (cf. cºcage, -lgi'escºgge, =) + bgcºagger,
  because b.ga =c.f. The object is here to show, that there
  is no necessity that b, d, or f with any subindex, should ap
  pear except in the first place of the resulting irreducible mul
  tiplet, when the subindices are arranged in ascending order.

   assert that baáa, with one sign or other, is equivalent to the
   quadrupletgicagger.
      Enough is here done to show, that, on our suppositions,
   the operation Q. A will give rise to terms affected with sex
   tuplet, quintuplet, or quadruplet imaginaries, each reducible,
   with one or the other sign, to an equivalent, in which the sub
   indices shall ascend, and which shall exhibit b, d or fin no
   place except the first, and in the other places, no letters ex
   cept repetitions of c, e, g. If A were a quintuplet having c, e,
   org, in the first place, instead off, it would be easy to show
   that the multiplication Q. A would yield results of the same
   forms. Generally, if Vn be the function of e-plet imaginaries,
    the operation Q, W, will produce all the (e-- 1)plets of the
    system which have (e-F1) different subindices, together with
    a number of e-plets and of (e– 1)plets, the whole of which can
    be reduced to equivalents which shall exhibit b, d or f only

in the first place. If Zn be the function of n-plets, n being
the number of different subindices, Q, Z, can yield only n-plets
and (n-1)plets, since every imaginary in Q; can be made to
coalesce with some one having the same subindex in every
term of Z, as in the products baá and ca/A, above considered.
   The number of irreducible e-plets in the product of e plu
quaternions of 6n-H | imaginaries is obtained, by writing out
all the 3° permutations that can be made with repetitions of
c, e, g, taken e together, and then under each permutation
writing every possible combination of e different ascending
indices that can be made with 0 1 2... (n-1). The first
letter, if c, may then be exchanged for b, if e for d, if g for f.
in every permutation, which doubles the number of them.
   The no-plets made with ceg are the two first terms in Qa, ;
whence

is the number of terms in the product of n pluquaternions of
(6n + 1) imaginaries. This, at the most (I apprehend that,
in general, this exactly), is also the number of terms in the
product of n pluquaternions of (6m–1) imaginaries.
    If we now suppose the addition of two imaginaries more,
making 6n + 3, it is clear that the product of e pluquaternions
of 6n + 3 will exhibit all the e-plets already found, besides
those made by the combination of all our former (e–1) plets
with one of the two new monads. This, reckoning the two
new one-plets, doubles our former result, giving the number of
terms = 2***; or the number of terms in the complete pro            *
duct of n pluquaternions of 6n—3 imaginaries is 2*.
    The reasons above given will shield me from any charge
graver than that of a pardonable credulity, if I confess my
 belief in the existence of this complete pluquaternion product :
and I hope that, instead of incurring the blame of presumption
 in touching upon questions which can be conpletely discussed
only by far better analysts, I may even earn the thanks of the
 mathematical reader for pointing out the connexion between
 such a product, and the remarkable properties of products of
 sums of squares, to which it must conduct us. For whatever
is obscure, unfinished, or even illogical, I trust to receive every
 indulgent allowance to which the confessed difficulty of these
 subjects may entitle those, who, while they are not forbidden
to speak on them, are yet not expected to bring to their dis
 cussion the powers of mind possessed by such writers as the
distinguished inventor of quaternions, or to exhibit his brilliant
results in rich and varied applications.

               LXXIV. On the passive state of Iron.
                    By REUBEN PHILLIPs, Esq.*
 IN a small platinum crucible 7 inch high I placed 35 grains
      of chromic acid and 62 grains of water, and having incor
porated the acid and water, the crucible was connected with
one end of the wire of a galvanometer and a piece of iron wire
with the other end, and then part of the iron was immersed
in the acid; the needle of the galvanometer was thrown about
45° from its place of rest, and settled at 0°. Having caused
the needle to have a barely perceptible motion about 0°, the
circuit was closed and opened through the galvanometric wire
at such times as should increase the motion of the needle, sup
posing the iron to act as zinc to platinum; a vibration of 10°
was easily obtained. A copper wire rather smaller than the
iron wire was now substituted for it; on its first immersion
the current was so strong as to cause the needles of the galva
nometer to rotate, then a constant current was established
which held the needle at 43°.
   The acid was now diluted with about six times its bulk of
water, and the crucible nearly filled with this dilute acid,
everything else remaining as before. The iron wire caused
the needle to move about 30° and then to stand at 0°; a swing
of the needles could however be obtained by closing and
opening the circuit as before, but the current was weaker.
The copper wire caused a permanent deflection of 21°. In
this and the following experiments the crucible was filled to
                     * Communicated by the Author.

510        Mr. R. Phillips on the passive state of Iron.
about the same height as before, and the metals were clean
and similarly immersed.
   The acid was again diluted with six times its bulk of water.
The iron wire at the moment of its entering this acid moved
the needle 20°, which then rested at 0°; a swing could only
be communicated with still greater difficulty than in the fore
going experiment. The copper wire caused the needle to
mark permanently an angle of 12°. In these experiments with
chromic acid the iron remained perfectly bright.
    With nitric acid, specific gravity 1:39, instead of the chromic
acid, the needle of the galvanometer was permanently deflected
5°. I found it advisable to screen the galvanometer from the
 violent initial current of the arrangement, by opening another
circuit besides the wire of the galvanometer for this first
 Current.
    40 grains of iodic acid and 65 grains of water were placed
 in the crucible; and when the acid was dissolved and mixed,
 the crucible was connected with the galvanometer as before.
 The iron wire at the first moment of its introduction acted
 very powerfully, and then the needle stood at 4°; the iron
 remained perfectly bright. A copper wire of the size before
 mentioned gave a permanent deflection of 45°, notwithstanding
 a dense film which formed on the surface of the copper.
    The action of chloric acid on iron was best observed with a
 galvanometer far less sensitive than that before used, which
 consisted of a pocket-compass having a few turns of insulated
 copper wire round it. The metals and acid were employed
 as before; the chloric acid was a rather concentrated solution.
  When the iron was put in its place in the acid the needle re      \
 mained quite stationary; but on touching the iron with a piece
 of active iron or a copper wire, the needle was strongly affected,
 and ultimately stood at 40°. This is an example of the pro
  duction of passiveness without the powerful initial current
  which is generated by iron and nitric acid. With the first
  mentioned sensitive galvanometer the needle stood at about
  35° when the passive state existed, but was remarkably un
 steady.
    The foregoing experiments were performed without any
 considerable interruption, and with the same piece of iron wire,
  which was gºth of an inch thick.
    A dilute sulphuric acid consisting of one of acid and five of
 water, when cold was mixed by degrees with moist hydrated
 peroxide of barium of the consistence of cream, until the bulk
 of the acid had increased from one to three; no gas was
 evolved. The sulphate of baryta was isolated on a filter, and
 the fluid evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid until it had

           Mr. R. Phillips on the passive state of Iron.    511
acquired an oily appearance. This acid was now placed in
the platinum crucible which was connected with one end of
the wire of the less sensitive galvanometer, an iron wire com
municating with the other end; the needle showed the passive
state was readily assumed by the iron and this mixture of per
oxide of hydrogen and sulphuric acid. When the iron having
no connexion with the platinum was plunged into this mixture,
it produced gas; but after having brought the iron in contact
with the crucible, the evolution of gas on the surface of the
iron ceased; gas continued to be produced, as before contact,
on the platinum, which arose from its action on the oxy
genized acid. The acid was now increased to about four times
its former bulk by the addition of water, and was found still
capable of assuming the passive condition. The current from
active iron, platinum and oxygenized sulphuric acid, produced
a much larger deflection of the needle than sulphuric acid,
either dilute or concentrated. The peroxide of barium was
prepared by Wöhler and Liebig's process, and contained no
chloride, nitrate or chlorate.    I found it advisable, when I
wished to observe the passive state with oxygenized sulphuric
acid, to be careful not to remove any portion of the iron from
the acid when once wetted by it; and to avoid using the iron
when at all heated, as it is apt to become by being cleaned
with sand-paper.
   It was observed by Daniel, that a mixture of nitric and sul
phuric acids does not act on iron; and I have found that when
to a dilute sulphuric acid, one measure acid and six water, a
little bichromate of potash is added, the acid and iron can
easily be made mutually passive by contact with platinum; so
that if a substance can exhibit the passive state, its mixture
with sulphuric acid does not annihilate this property. The
nard found iron was without action on peroxide of hydrogen.
That this is really owing to the formation of the passive state
is, I think, shown by the action of oxygenized sulphuric acid,
in which I look upon the peroxide of hydrogen as acting
towards the iron as nitric or chromic acid would under similar
circumstances.
    There are now, then, the following bodies with which pas
siveness has been developed,—nitric acid, peroxide of hy
drogen, chromic acid, iodic acid and chloric acid. Peroxide
of hydrogen is an electrolyte, and was found so, I think, by
Thenard; and solutions of nitric, chloric, iodic, and chronic
acids are electrolytes; all these substances are also easily de
composed by giving up their oxygen, so that their molecules
have a tendency at an anode (but not at a cathode) to combine
with the iron entire, and also to decompose and so oxidate

512        Mr. R. Phillips on the passive state of Iron.
the iron. I think from this, that the passive state results from
these two forces acting simultaneously and balancing each
other. A parallel case is perhaps presented by hydrocyanic
acid, which readily decomposes when pure with the formation
of a brown substance and ammonia; and by concentrated
mineral acids it is rapidly converted, together with the elements
of water, into formic acid and ammonia, while with a certain
small quantity of a strong mineral acid neither of these two
modes of decomposition appear.
   In these experiments with nitric, chloric, iodic and chromic    *
acids, it is seen that the passive state is not absolute; the
mixture of peroxide of hydrogen and sulphuric acid was not
examined in this particular, but I cannot doubt it forms no
exception. The current between passive iron and platinum
was always the same in direction as between zinc and platinum
in sulphuric acid. When two clean iron wires were immersed
in a mixture of about equal volumes of nitric acid, specific
gravity 1:39, and sulphuric acid, the galvanometer always
showed that one of the wires could act to the other as zinc to
platinum, the current being in different experiments various
both in force and direction.
   The following experiment shows, independently of the gal
vanometer, the existence of chemical action during the passive
condition. I took a piece of clean iron wire gºth of an inch
thick, and about 1% inch long, and twisted some platinum
wire about one end of it, leaving a portion of the platinum
wire projecting; then laying hold of this projecting portion,
the iron was placed in half a fluid ounce of nitric acid, specific
gravity 1-39, and left there for about two hours; the iron was
then removed by means of the platinum to another half-ounce
of the same acid, in which it was well-stirred about to wash
it, and then the metals were thrown into a vial containing a
similar quantity of the same acid; the whole of the iron lay
beneath the surface of the acid, and the vial was closed and
put away in a dark place. Examined at the end of two days,
 the acid was found to be rather coloured; it was poured off
 the iron, evaporated nearly to dryness, and a solution of am
monia added, which caused an abundant precipitate of the ses
 quioxide of iron.
    The comparative perfection of the passive state with chromic
 acid, even when very dilute, suggests that bichromate of
 potash would be a useful addition to the nitro-sulphuric acid
 employed in Schönbein’s voltaic pile.

DR. SIMSON might, possibly, have alluded to his intention
         of publishing the Euclid in a letter which is, unfortu
nately, missing from this series, the date of which appears
(from the following one) to have been Feb. 5, 1753. It is
very probable that Dodson retained the letter, with Nourse's
permission, as a memorial of the aged geometer; but I am
altogether ignorant as to what became of Dodson's papers,
and have hence no clue for tracing this letter, even if it be in
existence. The chief curiosity of the letter would, however,
in all probability turn out to be—the particular “problem *
which it contained; and as the Doctor's correspondence is, I
believe, preserved in a tolerably complete state, this may pro
bably be learnt from Dodson's enclosure through Nourse, of
May 29 that year. The following letter of this series is the
first that contains a reference to that work. Though the
whole of the letters are upon matters of business, there is so
much that is characteristic in them, that I shall give a small
number entire, and extracts from others. They relate, too,
to that publication which forms an aera in our mathematical
literature; and any circumstances, however slight, attendant
upon the publication of the Euclid will be of interest in mathe
matical history.

in answer to mine of Febry. 5th that same year, and as you delayed
writing near four months because, as you say, you had little to write,
the like apology must be made for my delaying to write near two

    t Most likely the “question” was some one relating to “chances.”
 Simson was a great devotee to whist (see Trail, p. 76); and Dodson's forte
 lay in this direction. The problem no doubt (if such were its character)
 originated in his “club,” and involved an inquiry why he should so often
 be a loser (as Dr. Trail reports him to have been) when he ought to have
 been the winner.      There are two or three orders in these letters for
 “Blanchard's cards,” which he bought by the dozen. In one letter (the
 last of the series) he denominates them his “little books; ” and in another
 he complains that those last sent “were vile trash, so soft that they would
 serve but for one or two mights, whereas those you used to send before
 these served at least four or five times.”

the way he proposes, to him, especially now when I am so old, and

appears to have been engaged somewhat in the business that
is now denominated a “commission-agency;” but at the same
time he appears also to have been an intimate personal friend
of Dr. Simson's.      He is described in the letters as a consider
able traveller. It was probably through him that Simson
negotiated with Nourse the entire business, which is not de
tailed in the letters, relative to paper, &c. for the quarto edi
tion of the Euclid. This, at least seems to be implied by the
next letter.

   “SIR,--I wrote to you when I sent a copy of the proposals for
printing the 8 Books of Euclid, and believe that you thought it
needless to write to me when you could advise me of anything that
was proper by means of Mr. Ruat. I designed that you should have
gotten as many of the receipts as you wanted as soon as they came
   • Dr. Simson was then in his sixty-eighth year, and the first edition of
the Euclid was not then published or even printed.

  but by what he wrote me after he had gotten them, I found he had
  not given you any, and I believe did not for a good time, at which
  I was much displeased, as I signified to him, and told him I designed
  to deal with you as my good friend, and not merely as a Bookseller.

  be some more than 50 in it, and I have caused make a new font of
  types for it, exactly like those in the proposals, both which will be
  no disadvantage to the Subscribers. They are but printing the 3d
  Book of the Elements and but 2 sheets in the week, by which means
  even the English copy which I print before the other cannot be ready
  against the time mentioned in the proposals; and I desire your ad
  vice if it will be proper to make an apology by way of an Advertise
  ment in the newspapers, for the delay.
     “I wish you could give me a guess of the number of Subscriptions
  for the two kinds of paper. Mr. Ruat sayes he knows of 28 for the
  best paper including Earl Stanhope's 10, whose generosity I have
  been much ashamed of, and these with 20 I know of, 8 of which are
  from Holland, and 9 for Stationers hall included, make 48, So that
  the number 50 which you advised me to print by Mr. Ruat will be
  too small. Mr. Foulis urged me to print 200 which I thought too
  many by far, but have yielded to print 96, because I expect some
  from Dublin and other places in Ireland and Britain.

   Simson appears from the next letter of the series to have
determined upon keeping back the English copy till the Latin

sheets of the Latin were printed at this date; viz. –

Sir,

   “I do not dedicate the book to Earl Stanhope for a reason you
will know afterwards.”
   Cowley's book is but little known; and though it is probable
that Dr. Simson would be somewhat surprised at its appear
ance, and disappointed with its contents, it is a production of
some value to the student of the Geometry of three dimensions.
Its value is simply this: that it contains a series of well-de
signed models of planes and solids, such as occur in the earlier
parts of the Geometry of Space. The work was constructed
for the use of the cadets in the Royal Military Academy (in
which Cowley was Professor of Mathematics); and I believe
the practice of employing such illustrative models has more
or less prevailed in this institution ever since. The idea itself
was, however, by no means new, and had been used by a
writer then so familiarly known as Ward. The method was
probably first used in explaining the principles of perspective,
and is still much employed by writers on that subject.       I am
not alone in wishing it were more freely used by modern writers
on pure geometry, and especially in geometrical instruction, by
our teachers.
   It is stated by Dr. Trail (Life, p. 31), on the authority of
some of Simson's letters to Earl Stanhope, that a private act
of parliament was contemplated for preventing the importation
of any copies (especially of the Latin edition) from abroad,
after the example of Buckley's edition of Thuanus. No traces
of such an intention exist in these letters, and hence it must
have been completely abandoned before he entered upon the
printing. There is, however, abundant proof of Simson's great
care and circumspection as a man of business, and the most
rigid attention to a compliance with the terms of the statute
of Anne, by delivering and registering the nine copies required
 by that act to be placed in the hands of the Stationers' Com
 pany. Nay, so scrupulous was he, that he sent not only nine
 copies of the work, but nine copies of large paper and nine
 of the small—as though the size of the paper might consti
 tute the larger a different edition from the other
    It is altogether unnecessary to give the further letters, or
 those parts at least which relate to mere business details,
 such as the number of copies sent off, speculations as to the
 mode of disposing of them, and the prices to be charged. A
 few occasional passages, however, possess interest.
    A great object of Simson's solicitude was the manner of

518      Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
binding and presenting certain copies of his work. The issue
to the public was kept back for some time for this purpose;
probably till some time in the following spring (1757). Three
short passages are worth transcribing.
   “Also give me your advice about giving a copy to the Royal
Socitie, one to the E. Macclesfield President, and one to Mr. De Val
Secretary whether it be proper to give these or not.”    (Letter, 26th
Nov. 1756.)
   “Notwithstanding of what you Say about books given to the R.
Societie, which I know is true, I incline to send to the Societie and
to the President and to Mr. Duval.” (Letter, 10th Dec. 1756.)
   “You may cause bind up three copies, one, the large Latin, to be
presented to the Royal Societie, a 2", the large English to be given
to the Earl of Macclesfield, and a 3" English Large or Small paper
as you incline, but I think it ought to be large to Mr. Du Val the
Secretary. I leave the binding entirely to your discretion and judg
ment in every point, and I request you will be so good as to present
them Yourself with my best compliments in the manner you think
suitable to each of the three.” (Letter, 31st Dec. 1756.)
   Dr. Simson was deeply impressed, even for his time and
country, with “the greatness of the great.” His fastidious
ness about binding and presenting copies sometimes approaches
the ludicrous. He never suspected the possibility of the gra
cious reception given to his book by the then Prince of Wales
being a cheap and courtly mode of repaying the loyalty of a
Scotchman in those days, La Scotchman, too, who possessed
such extraordinary influence as Simson did amongst the intel
lectual classes of Glasgow.
    Earl Stanhope was an object almost of veneration to Simson;
and there is good proof that the Earl venerated the great geo
meter in an equal degree. For once it has happened that the
Lord did not “lord it over * the man of science.             The fine
monument erected to Simson's memory in the publication (at
his own expense) by the Earl, of the Opera Reliqua, is the
best proof that Simson's estimate of that nobleman was not
higher than his lordship deserved. The Earl is often men
tioned in these letters; and, as I have said before, he was
probably the originator of the intercourse between the author
and the publisher.
    In the first of these papers I alluded to the feud between
Nourse and Andrew Millar. The following passages some
what illustrate its extent.
   “I hear that Mr. And. Millar (but not from himself) wants to take
some copies, [of the Euclid] about which, and any thing else proper
to promote the sale of the book your friendly advice is very necessary
and will be most obliging to me.” (Letter, 20th Oct. 1756.)

        Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.            519
   “The character you give me of a certain Bookseller is the same
which he has in this Country, and I would never have entered into
any bargain with him.” (Letter, 19th Nov. 1762.)
   Most of my readers are more familiar, probably, with Sim
son's Euclid than with his other writings (perhaps, indeed,
we all are); and no doubt many of them will have formed,
from the somewhat dogmatical tone of his “notes” on that
work, an opinion that Simson was an imperative and over
bearing person. Nor does the character of him, as given by
Dr. Trail, tend altogether to remove this impression (Life,
p. 75–77). In his criticisms he speaks positively and empha
tically, as was the stilted custom of didactic writers of the class
familiar to him, then to speak; but a perusal of these letters
has convinced me, that even his severities upon the hypothe
tical Theon himself, as the great perverter of Euclid's work,
were honestly uttered, and formed upon preceding models of
 controversy. He, in several of these letters, invites “the cor
 rection of any errors he might have committed,” and desires
 to know the “views of the learned ” on his performance. He
 placed great confidence in Nourse's judgement, not only as a
  man of business but as a geometer; and some stray papers
 in Nourse's hand, in my possession, show that the publisher
 was himself a really superior geometer.
    Dr. Simson, anxious as he was to see his work brought into
 general circulation, never adopted any means to gain for it
 a spurious reputation or a forced sale; but, on the contrary,
 over and over charges Nourse, though he may “go to the
 expense of 4 or 54 for advertising in the newspapers” to
 avoid all “puffing.” “Be sure,” says he (1st Nov. 1756),
 “to put nothing like a puff into    the advertisements which I
 believe you like as little as I do: I fancy the Title will serve,
 but if you shorten it, I shall not   be against it, tho' I see not
 how it can be much shorter.”         In a subsequent letter, he
 thinks that some intimation of the “notes" should be added
 to the advertisement.
    He was very solicitous to know what the “Reviews” said
 about his work; and he says in a letter 23rd Jan. 1761–
 “Montucla gives me a good deal of amusement; I am obliged
 to him for mentioning me 4 or 5 times very discreetly.” Other
 passages show that though he was the very reverse of a vain.
 man, he was still sensible to the approbation of competent
 judges, and alive to his own permanent reputation. Yet he
 claimed no infallibility, and never paraded or vaunted his own
 great powers.
    These letters contain a few mathematical criticisms well
 worthy of preservation. One passage occurs in the letter of

520 Mr. T. S. Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
 1st Feb. 1765, short but to the purpose: “Forget not to send
 me Lawson's Translation of Apollonius concerning Tangen
cies as he improperly names it.” The work was in reality a
translation of Vieta's attempted restoration of that treatise of
 Apollonius, and was most imperfectly executed. . Many sub
cases were omitted altogether; and the determinations in
    eneral were very loosely given, even where given at all. Nor
are all the lemmas given by Pappus, as necessary to the solu
 tion of the problem employed by Vieta or his translator, the
 celebrated vii. 117 for instance. I may, however, refer to a
paper printed in the Mathematician, vol. iii. pp. 76–78, for
 some further remarks on this subject.                     *...*  * **
      Meanwhile it is proper to keep in view that the restoration
of the solution given by Apollonius is not necessarily getting
 the best solution. Indeed as regards this problem, it is cer
tainly not getting the best. By taking different routes, several
foreign geometers have arrived at constructions of great sim
plicity and beauty: for instance, Cauchy, Gaultier, Durrande,
 Poncelet, Steiner and Gergonne. The last is very remarkable:
but there is a total absence of all attempts to fix the deter
minations and discriminate the special sub-cases in all these
solutions. In short we have neither a complete restoration
nor a completed solution of this one of the Apollonian series
of problems. Yet it is worthy of both.                                -     º
... The commentaries on Jack's edition of the Data, though
slight, are certainly correct and interesting; though there are
some geometers who still think that a perfect restoration of
 Euclid's Data has not been accomplished, even by Simson
 himself.         *:  * *     ** * *
... “I thank you for what you write about Mr. Jack's Edition of the
 Data which good or otherwise let me have a Copy by the first occa
 sion; and in the mean time in your next, which pray let be as soon
 as you can, let me have his translation of the first paragraph in page
 512 of Gregory, viz. a part of Prop. 73." Also let me know if he
 has put in the translation of the 24 Demonstration of Prop. 24, which
 is a mere paralogism.” (Letter*, 10th Dec. 1756.)                 -

   “You need not be afraid that Mr. Jack's Edition will have the
least influence on me to delay giving another when I get leisure, but
when I see the book I will be able to tell you more about it.” (Let
ter, 31st Dec. 1756.)
    Dr. Simson published the Data as an appendix to the 8vo
edition of Euclid in 1762, and indeed began printing imme
diately. It appears that 1000 copies of this edition were pub
lished; and Nourse and Balfour bought them and the copy
right together. The terms for the whole do not appear; but
for the copyright alone 150l. appears to have been given (Let
ter, Nov. 19, 1762).
    Nourse appears, after the publication of the Data, to have
raised some objection to the character of the notes; to which
the Doctor replies—
    “I know not well what you mean by remarks on the Data, there
are but very few. for the sake of Young Geometers I have given
the compositions to all of them but the easie ones in the first part of
the book, and have added some that were wanting.” (Letter, 19th
April 1762.)
    In a subsequent letter, however, the apparently sharp tone
of this is moderated.
    “I believe the Data will fall a good deal below your expectation,
to have added as many problems as would have been proper to show
the use of them, would have made a good large book, but however
you shall think of them, I will be glad to have your impartial opinion
and censure of them.” (Letter, 18th Oct. 1762.)
    “I am very glad that you receive any Satisfaction by what you
have read of the Short notes on the Data, and that the notes on the
29th Prop. Book 1st seem to be right. but I request you to give me
your censures on any thing with the utmost freedom, for they will
be very acceptable.” (Letter, 19 Nov. 1762.)
    Another slight reference to the Data occurs in the letter of
 25th June 1763.
    I have already given the principal part of the letters dated
 11th April and 29th June 1767; and I shall close this series
 with extracts from that of the 30th March, 1764.
    “I am pleased you have sent me Castiglione's Commentary.          I
 had about 20 years ago a letter from Castiglione when he resided at
 Vevay on the lake of Geneva in which after commending the Conick
 Sections very much he asked my leave to translate into Latin a book
 of Mr. Thomas Simpsons by which I saw he took us for the same
 person, but I think it strange he should have again fallen into the
 same mistake. I shall give you some opinion about his book when
 I have read some of it, for my age will not allow me to peruse fully
 such large treatises on subjects that require a good deal of thought.

     “I desire you to let me know in what respect you think that Dr.
Stewart has deviated Something from the Antients, for he gives the               f
Analysis as well as the Composition of the Theorems, for I do not
 observe that he gives any of his Propositions as Problems, and so has
no occasion to make use of Euclid's Data. When I get your next,
 I shall more fully let you know my opinion of his great merit.
    " I am warned by my own paging in the MS. to abstain from making
some remarks here which I fully intended to give as a note on the Porisms.
It may be as well this should be deferred ; for though the general principle
of the porismatic system has been, beyond all doubt, established by Dr. Sim
son, there remain difficulties sufficiently formidable about this class of in
quiries to inspire caution in speaking dogmatically on the subject. When
ever I may offer an opinion on either the principle or the details of the
porism, I shall at least have had the advantage of the criticism and discus
sion of the most eminent geometers (in strictness of language) in Europe,
both as opposed to, and as coinciding with, my own views. The seventh
 book of Pappus is not entirely unravelled yet.
     t The only instance I find in all these letters of “marking for italics.”
 Even here it is not underscored but overscored—an instance, I think, not
often found.
    f This has reference, without doubt, to Stewart's Propositiones Geome
tricae, published in 1763; a work which contains a most remarkable series of
 properties of circles and triangles, which are often referred to a later date,
 and many of which are even now but little known to geometers. A great
 number of these properties, slightly varied in their enunciations, hold good,
 too, in the comic sections; and I cannot point out a more useful exercise
 for the young geometer than to attempt the extensions here suggested.
 Very many years ago I myself found this exercise most beneficial; and I
 venture to predict, that whoever follows the same steps will find himself in
 a position to follow with little difficulty, one of the most important sections
 of the géométrie supérieure of the modern French School.
     It is singular enough that whilst Dr. Stewart’s writings are of a kind cal
 culated to render them peculiarly attractive to the non-academic school of
 English geometers, they remain to this day less generally known than the
  writings of any geometer of these kingdoms. Even his “physical tracts,”
  and the supplementary one on the “sun's distance,” though admitted to
 be of little physical value, are yet as replete with specimens of geometrical
  skill, as even the Principia itself. Besides his separate works, however,
  there are some stray pieces of Dr. Stewart. One is a discussion and ex
  tension of Pappus, iv. 4, which was printed in the “Essays Physical and
  Literary, read before the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh,”—the parent
  of the present Royal Society of Edinburgh (Ed. 3 vols. 8vo, 1754–71).

matical Repository (vol. vi). The paper is, however, most remarkable for
some properties of the comic sections (the enunciations only of which are
given) that are commonly considered to be discoveries of more recent
times. Besides these, the propositions in the second edition of Simson's
Conic Sections (4to, 1750), which are marked (r), are due, as Simson
states in his preface, to Dr. Stewart. It is the more important to notice
this, from the great philosophical historian, M. Chasles, having not re
marked this circumstance, and hence having considered them to be Simson's
own; whilst their importance in the géométrie supérieure renders it but an
act of common historical justice that Stewart's name should be attached
to them. Several of Simson's Porisms were the discovery, too, of Stewart
 (and some of Trail), which were, with Simson's characteristic honesty, duly
 acknowledged in the MS. on the Porisms. Stewart was a pupil of Sim
 son's; and there is good reason to believe that he had also divined the
 true character of this class of propositions at a very early period. In fact,
 as I have shown in “An Analytical Discussion of Dr. Stewart's General
 Theorems” (Edinburgh Transactions, vol. xvi.), a large portion of the
 propositions which he published in 1746 (he being then a candidate for the
 chair vacated by the death of Maclaurin) are, in the strictest sense of the
 word, Porisms—even the formal enunciation being only disguised to the
 extent of not interfering with Dr. Simson's restoration of Euclid's definition
 of them.
    The remark quoted from Simson's letter is important, too, in respect to
 its bearing upon another question—which, however, the length of this
 note forbids my entering upon here, as it would be impossible to do justice
 to the subject within the prescribed space.

ºbehaviour of Molybdic Acid towards Phosphorio Acidº
ALTHQºI he heliº of molybdic acid towards
** phosphoric acid was not intimately connected with the
object of our investigation, .* were so frequently led to i
that we considered it necessary to make some experiments
upon the subject. This behaviour is so peculiar and so com:
 plicated that it requires a far more minute examination than
   e were able to devote to it, but since we have noticed some
  hanomena which have not hitherto been described, we con
  ider it important to communicate in this place all that we
have observed. The curious behaviour of molybdic acid to:
wards phosphoric acid has been briefly noticed by some che
mists. Berzelius" says, “When moistinolybdic acid is mixe
with phosphoric º it instantly becomes of a lemon colour;
heat then dissolvesi. "The filtered liquid is colouries, and
on evaporation leaves a tenacious transparent mass, which
exhibits not the least sign of crystallization, and possesses a

very astringent taste. Both water and alcohol dissolve it
readily, the latter with a yellow colour, which on evaporation
changes to blue, and leaves a brown opake residue, which
 dissolves in water with a blue colour. "When an excess of
 molybdic acid is digested with phosphoric acid, the latter is
!.             and forms with the molybdic acid a lemon-co
  oured basic salt which is insoluble in    water.”           - - - - -
   These observations are quoted by Gmelin+, who has added
to them the following:—“When a very little phosphoric acid is
added to a concentrated solution of the molybdate of ammonia,
and then large quantities of muriatic, sulphuric, or nitric acid,
or first one of these acids and then a little phosphoric acid,
a lemon-coloured crystalline powder falls, the more quickly
the more concentrated the liquid ;   this powder contains besides
molybdic acid some ammonia, but none, or extremely little,
phosphoric acid; it forms with potash a colourless solution with
evolution of ammonia, from which it is again precipitated by
muriatic acid by long boiling; but if the solution in potash is
evaporated to dryness, and the residue dissolved in water, mu
riatic acid then merely gives it a yellow colour, but muriatic
acid and chloride of ammonium precipitate a yellow powder.
The yellow powder gives with hot sulphuric acid a colourless
solution which is not precipitated by water... It is but very
sparingly soluble in cold water, dilute sulphuric, hydrochloric,
or nitric acid, it dissolves, slightly in boiling water without
colour.”                       -              -
   When molybdic acid, obtained by calcining a pure molyb
date of ammonia, is mixed with an excess of phosphoric acid,
scarcely a trace is dissolved at the ordinary temperature; but
on heating the mixture, a perfect and .. solution soon
results, which forms, when quickly evaporated, a colourless vi.
treous non-crystalline mass. But if some water is added to this,
9r it is allowed  to absorb moisture from the air, it acquires s
beautiful blue colour,     .."...". disappears on

is employed, ail<U+017F> gradually some drops. of phosphoric and
nitric acid added to it (we employ niric acid to be sure of
having all the mol ybdenum as molybdic acid), on the applica
tion of heat the colour of the molybdic acid first becomes lemon
}. then gradually the solution acquires also a yellow co
 our; a portion of the molybdic acid remains unaltered, whilst
another portion is converted into a yellow powder. When
nothing further is dissolved the solution is filtered; on evapo
rating it to dryness to expel the nitric acid, a yellowish-white
amorphous mass is obtained, which dissolves in water, and also

in weak and in strong alcohol, with a yellow colonr. But if the
dry mass is heated for some time, it gradually assumes a dark
yellow colour, but still continues soluble in water. On treating
molybdic acid with a little phosphoric acid, a portion separated
as a yellow insoluble powder; more of this is formed every
time the solution is evaporated, whether the evaporation be
carried on in the water-bath or on the sand-bath. If the dry
mass be heated somewhat more strongly in a platinum crucible,
it turns green, and on increasing the temperature, fuses to a
liquid which solidifies on cooling into a vitreous dark blue or
dark green mass. If the temperature be raised so high that
the crucible is incandescent, some molybdic acid is volatilized.
This coloured mass dissolves with difficulty in cold water;
with boiling water it forms a coloured solution, which, when
evaporated with access of air, first becomes colourless and
then reacquires the yellow colour. This colour may be in
stantly produced by the addition of a few drops of nitric acid.
   This more or less yellow compound of phosphoric and mo
lybdic acid dissolves readily in ammonia, forming a colourless
liquid.' But if to the concentrated solution either sulphuric,
muriatic, or nitric acid is added (the last is best), a lemon
coloured precipitate is formed as soon as the liquid has an
acid reaction. In this case, therefore, none of the phaeno
mena previously described as occurring in the treatment
of pure molybdic acid and ammonia take place; there acid
salts, partly crystalline, partly amorphous, separated with a
white colour whatever acid was used, whilst here, however
great an excess of acid is employed, the yellow precipitate
only is obtained. Moreover all the compounds of molybdic
acid with the alkalies are very readily soluble in an excess of
muriatic acid, whilst this yellow precipitate is insoluble.
   When this yellow precipitate is collected upon a filter, the
mother-liquor passes through with a yellow colour, and, fur
mishes on evaporation more of the yellow salt, so that at last
the liquid becomes perfectly colourless. On washing with pure
water, the precipitate goes through the filter, which may how
ever be prevented by the addition of a few drops of nitric acid.
The colourless mother-liquor, which contains a large excess
of nitric acid, furnishes on evaporation, a colourless vitreous
mass, from which ammonia and nitric acid precipitate no more
yellow salt; but this residue nevertheless contains molybdic
and phosphoric acid, and is acted upon by heat in the same
manner as the yellow salt; however, the aniount of the preci
pitate is far greater; but further experiments must show how
this different behaviour is to be explained. Perhaps the state
of the phosphoric acid in these compounds acts a very import

         We adopted this method for the preparation of the inso
 luble yellow compound in order to be perfectly certain of ob
 taining a pure preparation; however, as the following analyses
 will show, the salt can be prepared more quickly in a much
 more simple manner, Molybdic acid is dissolved in an ex
 cess of ammonia and a few drops of a solution of phosphate
 of soda added, the liquid heated and mixed with an excess
 of one of the above-mentioned acids, when the yellow salt is
 instantly precipitated. To ascertain the composition of this
 salt we made the following analyses:–                                            -

 in the filtered solution, after it had been somewhat evaporated

 difficulty of oxidizing the residual mass, which consisted
partly of oxide of molybdenum.

    This salt, which is insoluble. in water and acids, appears
amorphous even under a high magnifying power, and to con
sist of minute spheres. When treated with potash, ammonia
is expelled, and a colourless solution obtained. When this
salt is heated for some time in a closed platinum crucible, at a
temperature below. red heat, the whole of the ammonia,and
water escape, and a confused mass remains, which is partly of
a brown, partly of a green colour. On treating this residuez
with concentrated nitric acid, very little reaction occurs at the
ordinary temperature, but on heating it, nitrous acid is given
 off; the reaction, however, lasts only for a few moments; the
 liquid has now a beautiful yellow colour, and the sediment,
 a grayish-blue powder, is not further acted upon by nitric
 acid. The insoluble residue behaves like molybdic acid, dis
 solves in potash and in ammonia, and upon the addition of an
 acid, again furnishes the yellow salt. But the yellow solutious

   From the analyses of these salts and the phaenomena de
scribed, it is quite evident that but a very small quantity of
phosphoric acid is contained incombination with molybdic acid,
and that its amount is apparently variable. Hence arises the
question, What part does the phosphoric acid act in these
compounds, and how are we to view the molybdic acid thus
metamorphosed ? Can we admit a different allotropic state
in this molybdic acid 2 and should we distinguish it from the
ordinary molybdic acid by the sign of b-molybdic acid 2
   We have made numerous experiments to convert molybdic
acid into this different state by means of other bodies besides
phosphoric acid. It is unnecessary to relate the experiments,
as we came to the result, that, when perfectly pure molybdic
acid was employed, in which the absence of phosphoric acid
had been ascertained, no change could be effected. But the
tendency of phosphoric acid to produce yellow precipitates
or yellow solutions with molybdic acid is so great, that we
look upon molybdic acid as the most sensitive test for phos
phoric acid, since in cases in which we obtained mere in
distinct signs of the presence of phosphoric acid by other
reagents, the reaction with molybdic acid was quick and per
fectly distinct.                                       º
   Phosphoric acid, which acts so important a part both in the
vegetable and animal organism, we have found, with the as
sistance of this reaction, to be most generally distributed in
nature. All the rocks, all the felspars which we have exa
mined, contain phosphoric acid, and to prove this by means
of molybdic acid 'is exceedingly simple. The sulphuret of
molybdenum which we used in our investigation was remark
ably pure ; only minute traces of gangue, consisting of frag
ments of quartz and felspar, were here and there perceptible,
but the molybdate of ammonia prepared by roasting this
mineral and exhaustion with ammonia contained a little
phosphoric acid. To detect this impurity, it suffices to add
to the concentrated solution of the salt an excess of muriatic
or sulphuric acid, when instantly the solution assumes a
yellow colour, and deposits in the course of a few minutes a
yellow precipitate of b-molybdate (phosphomolybdate) of
ammonia. Or if we take the alumina which has been obtained
                                                  -

          of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.           531
in the analysis of any felspar, dissolve it in an acid, then add
some pure molybdate of ammonia, and afterwards an excess
of an acid, a copious yellow precipitate instantly falls. If we
attempt to demonstrate the presence of phosphoric acid in the
same alumina by a solution of magnesia (preventing the preci
pitation of the alumina by ammonia by the addition of tartaric
acid), the reaction only occurs after several hours, and is then
always very imperfect.
   Phosphoric acid has so great a tendency to accompany mo
lybdic acid in all its combinations, that we are unable to direct
any other plan for procuring pure molybdic acid than by
preparing an artificial sulphuret in the dry or humid way.
In the decomposition of the potash double salt (obtained by
acting with nitric acid upon a solution of molybdic acid in
potash) by water, into trimolybdate of potash, which separates,
and a neutral salt which remains in solution, traces of phos
phoric acid accompany the insoluble compound. The pre
sence of the phosphoric acid in this salt is best proved by
converting it into the silver salt. On decomposing this
salt with muriatic acid, separating the chloride of silver and
evaporating the filtered solution, with the addition of a few
drops of ammonia, a yellow precipitate of the ammonia salt is
always formed: its amount is very small, and it has no in
fluence upon the analysis; but it is quite sufficient to show the
presence of the phosphoric acid.
  III. Determination of the Atomic Weight of Molybdenum.
   We shall here describe a large number of experiments
which we have made in order to determine accurately the
atomic weight of this metal. Although most of these expe
riments have not led to the desired result, they will never
theless be of scientific interest. If, from their not being so
accurate as we had reason to expect, they did not assist in
fixing the atomic weight, and exhibited in several instances
differences from the theories previously admitted,—they never
theless remain quantitative results, which show in what manner
various compounds of molybdenum behave towards different
reagents.       -                2
   The atomic weight of molybdenum was ascertained by Ber
zelius in 1818, by precipitating a certain quantity of nitrate
of lead with neutral molybdate of ammonia, and calculating
the atomic weight from the quantity of molybdate of lead
thus obtained. Berzelius, however, says of this determination,
“that it is far from being trustworthy, and the number found
is far more erroneous than the atomic weight of chromium
ascertained in the same manner. The atomic weight of mo
              -

 532          MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
 lybdenum requires, therefºre, further experiments. It is pro;
 bable that molybdic acid may be reduced by hydrogen, and
 then the atomic weight might be obtained with                                                 º:              ac
 curacy, especially if the acid after being weighed was saturated
 with ammoniacal gas to prevent its volatility, the ammonia
 salt decomposed by heat, and the residual fixed-oxide ignited
 in hydrogen.”                                       , , º, .    .. .    .     .;          fe         1: 3 if   yº;
  • It is seen, therefore, that Berzelius places no great reliance
 upon his determination, which, moreover, is based upon one
 single experiment; and it is remarkable that he should have
 deduced the number 596. 101, which differs but very little
 from the atomic weight we have found. As Berzelius points
 to the reduction of molybdic acid by hydrogen, we began with:
 this experiment; we shall now proceed to describe it., Ji priº

    Experiment I.--Molybdic acid was heated in a reduction-,
tube in a current of dry air, to deprive it of all moisture, and,
to be certain that the whole of the molybdenum was in the
state of molybdic acid. . We may observe that molybdic acid
is not a very hygrometric substance. . . . . . . ºn
    3.0388 grims. of this molybdic acid were heated in a current,
of hydrogen over an ordinary spirit-lamp. Reduction imme
diately ensued, a large quantity of water was given off, which,
however, soon decreased, and in the course of an                                                 hour and a
half had almost entirely ceased. When this point had been
attained, the tube was allowed to cool, the hydrogen in it ex
pelled by dry air, and the residue weighed ; it amounted to,
2.6846 grms., and was reddish-brown. Upon this the re
duction was continued with an Ar nd lam !, when again.
considerable quantities of water were given off; and although.
the reduction was continued for eight hours under these
conditions there was still a deposit of water. By this con
tinued intense red, heat the glass had gradually become so
brittle and crystalline that the tube on cooling cracked.
The contents of the bulb were partly brown, partly gray,
and had a metallic lustre. The acid employed for the ex
periment had lost, according to the first weighing, 0.354.8%
oxygen, or 11-656 per cent. ; but this result agrees tolerablye
well with the supposition that the molybdic acid, on reduction
with hydrogen at a low temperature, loses 1 atom oxygen;
and is converted into the oxide which Berzelius calls oxide off
molybdenum. But it may also be conceived that 2 atomss

  and trimolybdate salts of potash with sulphuretted hydrogens

  sent various interesting phaenomena. ºoºº dº a                         to .mºzo

  hydrogen.” As soon as the gas came into contact with thes
  acid, heat was evolved and the colour of the acid changed
  to black, but this soon stopped. If the bulb is now heated,

534      M.M. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
there is immediately a disengagement of water; and the action
of the sulphuretted hydrogen is so emergetic, that when the
current of gas is not too rapid, all the sulphuretted hydrogen
is absorbed. The experiment lasts very long; at first a small
spirit-lanip suffices, but gradually the temperature must be
increased, and, finally, the strongest heat which an Argand
lamp can give must be used. It appears that at first an oxysul
phuret is formed, which is very difficult to decompose. After
the operation had been continued for twenty-one hours, no
further formation of water could be observed; but neverthe
less no two weighings agreed. The difference between two
weighings amounted to as much as 0.0006 grim. At the time
we were unable to explain the cause of these differences, but
we subsequently discovered it and shall allude to it in the
following experiments.
   When the reduction-tube had become perfectly cold, the
sulphuretted hydrogen in it was expelled by dry air, and it
was then weighed as quickly as possible; two successive weigh
ings gave 8.0545 and 3.0551 grms. ; the mean of the two is
3'0548.
   Assuming that in this experiment the whole of the molybdic
acid has been converted by the action of the sulphuretted hy
drogen into sulphuret of molybdenum MoS*, we find the atomic
weight of molybdenum by the following equation, in which
the atomic weight of sulphur is admitted to be 200-75, and
also 200:                                               -
             2-739 : 3'0548 = a + 300 : z + 401'5

                               a = 56.7°231.

 We made a similar experiment with molybdic acid which
had been prepared from native sulphuret from a different
locality, when 2-855 grims. molybdic acid gave 3. 1652 sul
 phuret of molybdenum, or 110-865 per cent. Even though
 this experiment is not perfectly in accord with the preceding
 one, it at all events proves the identity of different molybdic
 acids.

           of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.          535
         Experiment with Neutral Molybdate of Potash.
    Calcined neutral molybdate of potash was heated in a cur
rent of dry air in a counterpoised reduction-tube, weighed after
cooling, and then connected with a sulphuretted hydrogen
apparatus. The dry sulphuretted hydrogen acted instantly,
and with considerable evolution of heat, upon the potash salt,
water was formed, and the salt assumed an orange-red and
gradually a dark reddish-brown colour. After some time the
reaction ceased, the bulb became cold, and it was now gently
heated with a small lamp; a considerable disengagement of
water immediately ensued, and the sulphuretted hydrogen was
so rapidly absorbed that not a bubble passed through the
 apparatus. It is necessary to raise the temperature gradually
 towards the end, that the entire mass may be incandescent:
 a portion of the contents fuses. At the commencement the
 action of the sulphuretted hydrogen is very energetic, but it
 soon decreases and proceeds very slowly, so that much time
 elapses before no further formation of water is perceptible.
 On attaining this point the bulb was allowed gradually to
 cool, and here a peculiar phaenomenon occurred,—as soon as
 the bulb had acquired a certain lower temperature, the whole
 of the sulphuretted hydrogen was absorbed by the mixed
 sulphurets: not a single bubble past through for some time.
 This condensation of the sulphuretted hydrogen we first ob
 served in making this experiment; it is probable, however,
 that the differences in the weighings in the former experiment
 were owing to    the same cause.
     As this condensation must give rise to an error, we ex
 pelled the sulphuretted hydrogen by a current of dry carbonic
 acid, keeping the bulb at a gentle heat; but although we
 passed carbonic acid through the tube for an hour, sul
 phuretted hydrogen was constantly given off, but not a trace
 of sulphurous acid was perceptible. As this led to our object,
 we expelled the sulphuretted hydrogen, immediately after the
 cooling, by dry air, and then weighed it as quickly as possible.
  At the end of the experiment the contents of the bulb were fused
 partly to a reddish-brown mass, which had acted very much
 upon the glass, and a portion had formed a mass with a plombi
  ferous hue. The contents were now treated with water, which
  gave an orange-red solution, while sulphuret of molybdenum,
  Mo Sº, separated; it was collected upon a filter, washed, dried
 at 212°, and its weight determined.         On evaporating the
  filtered solution, and slow crystallization, we obtained the
  beautiful compound described by Berzelius under the name of
  sulphomolybdate of potassium; but besides these crystals the

 536     MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
 microscope detected in the mother-liquor a salt which sepa
 rated in white, minute rhombohedrons.
   Experiment I.-2: 1188 grms. neutral molybdate of potash

lybdenum.
   Erperiment IL-1: 1305 grim. neutral salt furnished 1582
grm. sulphurets.
   Consequently 100 parts of the neutral molybdate of potash
furnish—

in which is contained, according to experiment I., 51-019 per
cent. sulphuret of molybdenum, Mo Sº.
            Eaperiment with Trimolybdate of Potash.
   Sulphuretted hydrogen does not act upon the trimolybdate
of potash in the cold, but if the apparatus is warmed, water
is instantly disengaged and sulphur absorbed. The same
phaenomena occur as in the preceding experiment; after sul
phuretted hydrogen had been passed for ten hours over the
salt, and two successive weighings exhibited but a slight
variation, we looked upon the experiment as terminated, espe
cially as in this case the glass was very much acted upon by
the partially fused mass. In this case we also treated the mass
with water and estimated the sulphuret of molybdenum.
   2:51 17 grims. trimolybdate of potash furnished 3-030 sul
phurets, which contained 2-1656 grims, sulphuret of molyb
denum.
   100 parts of the trimolybdate consequently furnish 120.635
sulphurets, in which are contained 86-221 parts MoS3.
   The quantitative results which we have obtained in these
three experiments it is difficult to explain and to connect with
any theory. This is not merely owing to the bulb of the
reduction-tube being so acted upon by the partially fused
mass that the values are thereby rendered uncertain, but
rather to the phaenomena of decomposition being more com
plicated, so that to obtain a complete explanation it would be
requisite to have likewise a quantitative determination of the
sulphosalts and metallic sulphurets extracted by the water.
However, as this would lead us far from the special object of
this investigation, we did not make this quantitative exa
mination, especially as we must then have entered upon new
questions, for instance, what phaenomena take place, and
what combinations are formed in the treatment of potash or
carbonate of potash with sulphuretted hydrogen at a high tem

           of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.            537

heated in a current of carbonic acid.                            -* -
   The only result which we are at present able to deduce
from these experiments is, that although sulphuret of potas
sium is present, the molybdenum cannot be obtained in the
state of tersulphuret (MoS”), but that a portion is converted
into bisulphuret (MoS”), whilst at the same time a portion of
the potassium is converted into a higher sulphuret, and that
a certain excess of a higher sulphuret of potassium is requi
site to form a certain quantity of sulphomolybdate of potas
sium, and to retain it as such.

   These experiments were made in the following manner: the
alkaline carbonate was heated to redness in a platinum crucible,
and after cooling over sulphuric acid, weighed. This was
repeated until two successive weighings entirely agreed. In
another counterpoised crucible the amount of molybdic acid
was weighed off, and a large excess of the alkali shaken into
the crucible containing the molybdic acid, the whole mixed
with a small platinum wire which had been previously coun

538      M.M. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
terpoised with the crucible, and the wire left in the crucible.
The crucible with the residual alkali was heated to redness
and weighed to see how much had been taken for the expe
riment. The crucible with the mixture of molybdic acid and
carbonated alkali was now exposed to a slowly-increased heat,
and as soon as the mass was perfectly liquid, the temperature
was raised as high as it was possible with an Argand lamp and
chimney. This heat was continued for half an hour, when
the crucible was allowed to cool over sulphuric acid; the dif
ference in weight gave the quantity of carbonic acid expelled.
This ignition, cooling and weighing, had to be repeated five
to six times with every experiment, and we took the average
of all these weighings as being nearest to truth. The reason
why we were compelled to take the average of the weighings
is, that no two successive weighings were found to agree,
there being sometimes an increase, at other times a decrease
in weight. We are not able to explain the phaenomenon, but
it cannot be ascribed to the uncertainty of the balance, for this
does not amount to more than Tºth of a milligramme.
   Although these experiments have led to an atomic weight
for molybdenum which agrees very well with one arrived at
by another method, we cannot, on account of the variations in
the weighings, place perfect confidence in the experiments.
             Eaperiments with Chlorine Compounds.
   We hoped to arrive at good results by the preparation and
examination of the chlorine compounds of molybdenum; in
this we have not succeeded, it being very difficult to obtain
any one of the chlorine compounds perfectly pure. Besides,
phaenomena occurred which had not been previously observed
and investigated; and, finally, we found it to be perfectly
impossible to determine the chlorine accurately in the form of
chloride of silver.
   Although for these reasons we have not followed up the
subject further, we shall describe our observations, as they
are not without interest. Oxide of molybdenum, prepared
by calcining a mixture of molybdate of potash with an excess
of chloride of ammonium and subsequent exhaustion with
water, had sometimes a brown, sometimes a gray metallic
colour, according to whether a larger or smaller quantity of
sal-ammoniac had been used; in general it consisted of a mix
ture of the two. This oxide was employed to prepare the
biacichloride of molybdenum. For this purpose we used a
glass tube furnished with two bulbs, about an inch apart; into
one of the bulbs 4 grammes of the oxide were conveyed, and
it was then heated quite gently in a current of hydrogen, to
expel all humidity, and the tube connected with a chlorine

             of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.                  539
  apparatus so that only dry chlorine gas could pass over the
  oxide. When the apparatus had become filled with chlorine
  gas at the ordinary temperature at which no action is exerted
  upon the oxide, we applied a very gentle heat to the bulb
 containing the oxide: chlorine was absorbed with great avi
 dity; biacichloride of molybdenum was formed, which was
 driven by a very gentle heat into the other bulb. When in
 this manner the greater portion of the oxide had been con
 verted into the volatile chloride, the bulb was allowed to cool,
 and a current of dry air then passed through the apparatus for
 some time, to expel all chlorine gas, and the bulb containing
 the biacichloride melted off. This portion of the tube and its
 contents was weighed, the one extremity of the fused tube cut
 off, the contents dissolved in water, and after the tube had been
 well washed with water, dried and weighed, the loss furnished
 us with the amount of biacichloride taken for analysis. This
 chloride is readily soluble in water, but gave a faintly opalescent
 solution. When the solution had been very much diluted
 with water, we added a small quantity of nitric acid and then
 some nitrate of silver. At first pure chloride of silver fell,
 readily recognisable from its colour and external appear
ances; but on adding some more of the silver solution, the
precipitate became very bulky and assumed a yellowish colour.
 On heating the solution, to cause the chloride of silver to sub
side and to dissolve the molybdate of silver which had been
precipitated with it in the nitric acid, the liquid became more
and more turbid, the precipitate increased, and the liquid,
after twenty-four hours standing, still remained turbid. We
now filtered, but with the precaution of pouring only the
liquid on the filter; and after the precipitate had been washed
several times in the beaker with hot water containing nitric
acid, the whole was dissolved in dilute ammonia, and then
nitric acid again added. These operations of dissolving, pre
cipitating, and reprecipitating were repeated several times, for
this was the only way of separating the whole of the molyb
date of silver; finally, the chloride of silver was poured upon
the filter and determined in the usual manner.
   3-0881 grims. of biacichloride of molybdenum furnished
4'3245 chloride of silver = 1.069 chlorine.
   If we compare the per-centage composition according to
analysis and theory, we have—

540      MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
    H. Rose, who first quantitatively examined this compound.
 and determined its formula, found in two analyses 34-295 and
 35'001 per cent. chlorine.
    This biacichloride of molybdenum forms yellowish-white
 shining laminae, which exhibit no crystalline form even with a
 compound microscope.
    We have prepared the biacichloride according to this me
 thod several times, but have never noticed the simultaneous
 appearance of any other chlorine compound. Although it is
 difficult to determine accurately the chlorine, owing to the
 molybdate of silver accompanying the precipitate, yet we be
 lieve that the principal source of uncertainty is to be ascribed
 to the difficulty of preparing pure biacichloride. This com
 pound is generally mixed with traces of molybdic acid, for
when perfectly pure, in which state it is only accidentally and
 very rarely obtained, it dissolves entirely in water, while in
general it furnishes an opalescent solution. If this is the
correct cause, it is readily explained why H. Rose, as well as
ourselves, have found so small an amount of chlorine in the
compound. This explanation is further confirmed by the
circumstance, that when dry hydrogen is passed over the biaci.    <
chloride and the bulb gently heated, nearly the whole of the
chlorine compound is volatilized; but a small residue is left,
which most probably consists of the molybdic acid contained
in the biacichloride.
    As we could not obtain a satisfactory result from the ana
lysis of the biacichloride, we made the following experiment
to obtain some other chloride.
    A glass tube about 2 feet long, curved somewhat anteriorly,
was filled, first with a considerable stratum of well-calcined
fragments of charcoal, and then with a mixture of molybdic
oxide and charcoal powder which had been previously well
calcined; the straight end of the tube was connected with a
chlorine apparatus, and dry chlorine passed for a considerable
time through it. That part of the tube with the charcoal was
now heated until the charcoal was incandescent, when the
other portion of the tube containing the mixture was gradually
heated to redness.      The current of chlorine was continued
during the whole operation; it was rapidly absorbed and
various chlorine compounds formed, of which we were able to
distinguish the following:—
   The most volatile compound which condensed in the most
anterior curved part of the tube was the biacichloride of mo
lybdenum; the quantity was small ; immediately behind this
was the compound described by Berzelius under the name of
chloride of molybdenum; it formed dark brown, shining cry

           of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.          541
stals resembling iodine. The fragments of charcoal were coated
 with a black crust; and on allowing the tube to cool, its whole
length was covered with a yellowish crystalline mass which
did not appear to be very volatile. Of these compounds,
which we will designate by the letters A, B, C, and D,
A consists of biacichloride, gives a clear solution with water,
   and deliquesces in the air;
 B appears in fine, dark brown, shining needles, gives with
   water a blue solution, from which ammonia precipitates a
   brownish red oxide;
 C is not altered by exposure to the air, possesses a black
   colour, is very slightly and slowly acted upon by alkalies,
   and insoluble in water;
D is readily soluble in water; the solution gradually becomes
   blue, but nothing is precipitated by ammonia.
   These statements, which are in the highest degree imperfect,
are merely intended to show that we know very little of the
chlorine compounds of molybdenum, and that the subject
requires a thorough investigation.
          Experiments with Sulphuret of Molybdenum.
   Starting from the fact that sulphuret of molybdenum, when
heated with sufficient access of air, is gradually oxidized and
converted into molybdic acid, we imagined that if we were
able to prepare artificially a pure sulphuret of molybdenum
with exactly the same composition as the native mineral, and
converted this by roasting completely into molybdic acid,
which remains, and into sulphurous acid, which is volatilized,
it was to be expected that an accurate atomic weight of molyb
denum might be calculated from the difference in weight of
the sulphuret of molybdenum employed. No objection can
be urged to this method d priori; it is simple, and the simpler
an analytical method the more certain the result in general.
If we assume that the oxidation can be effected completely,
the method consists in three weighings:–1, counterpoising the
glass tube in which the roasting is to be effected; 2, weighing
with the pure sulphuret of molybdenum; and 3, weighing the
molybdic acid obtained. We shall now prove that our theor
was correct, and that we have succeeded in determining .
certainty the atomic weight of molybdenum based upon the
atomic weight of sulphur.
   The artificial sulphuret of molybdenum was prepared ac
cording to the method described in the first part of this inves
tigation for obtaining pure molybdic acid, with this difference
only, that the sulphuret was dried over sulphuric acid under

542 MM. Svanberg and Struve on the Atomic Weight
the air-pump. If this precaution is omitted, by drying it in
the air or at 212°, the sulphuret always exhibits an acid re
action, owing to the formation of some sulphate of the protoxide
of molybdenum. It soon dried under the air-pump, where it
was kept until no further loss in weight could be observed.
We thus prepared two different quantities of sulphuret of
molybdenum, using the following proportions:—
    For sulphuret A we fused together 4 grims. molybdic acid,
8 grims. sulphur, and 6 grms. carbonate of potash; for the
sulphuret B we used 11 grims. trimolybdate of potash, 20 grms.
sulphur, and 6 grms. carbonate of potash.
    After we had thus prepared a pure sulphuret, the expe
riments were made in the following manner:—a glass tube
provided in the centre with a bulb was stopped at one end
with a little asbestos, and the whole then heated to redness in
a current of dry air, and when cold counterpoised and the sul
phuret of molybdenum weighed in it. Upon this the bulb with
its contents was heated in a current of dry hydrogen, when a
small quantity of water was expelled, but we were never able
to observe any disengagement of sulphurous acid. But if the
sulphuret of molybdenum had not been dried under the air
pump, there was always some sulphurous acid liberated on
heating it in hydrogen. When the sulphuret had been per
fectly dried in this manner, the hydrogen was expelled after
cooling by dry air and the weight of the sulphuret again
determined.     The difference between the first and second
weighing never amounted to more than from 1 to 2 milligrammes
at the furthest. That part of the glass tube in which theasbestos
was, was connected with an aspirator, and the bulb heated
gently with a small spirit-lamp, ordinary moist atmospheric
air, and only at the end of the operation dry air being allowed
to pass over the sulphuret. This operation does not require
a very high temperature, but the contents of the bulb must be
frequently shaken, so as constantly to present fresh surfaces
to the reaction, in order that the mass may not cake into one
lump. If these precautions are neglected, a portion of the
molybdic acid encloses some undecomposed sulphuret and pre
vents the complete oxidation, as we shall show further on. If
dry air is allowed to act upon the sulphuret from the very be
ginning of the operation, the roasting is just as complete, but
it is slower. The operation, when from 1 to 2 grammes of
sulphuret is employed, lasts from two to three hours. It is not
advisable to employ larger quantities, as the oxidation is then
effected with greater difficulty, and it is impossible to be cer
tain that no portion has escaped decomposition. When
the sulphuret was converted into the yellow molybdic acid we

              of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.                        543
 passed dry air through the tube, first with the application of
 heat, and afterwards when it had cooled; it was then weighed.
 This operation of roasting was repeated twice, each time
 for half an hour, to be certain that the oxidation was com
 plete. The difference in the weight between the first and
 third weighing never amounted to more than half a milli
 gramme, and the second and third weighings always coincided.
     To convince ourselves finally that the whole of the sul
 phuret had been really converted into molybdic acid, we dis
 solved the acid in ammonia, and always obtained a perfectly
 clear solution. The following are the experiments.

     We must exclude from this series of experiments as erro
neous V., VI. and IX., the shaking having been omitted.
    If we compare the other seven experiments and take the
average, we find that 100 parts of sulphuret give 89.7523 mo
lybdic acid. But before we proceed to draw further con
clusions from these experiments, we must first show that the
artificial sulphuret used in these experiments has the same
constitution as the native mineral. For this purpose we have
analysed specimens of native sulphuret from two different lo
calities in Sweden; the one was from Lindås in Småland, and
the other from the district of Bohus. The analyses were
likewise made by roasting, and when this was finished the mo
lybdic acid dissolved in ammonia, when the insoluble gangue
was left behind and could thus be estimated : of the sulphuret
from Lindås we made three determinations, viz. –
  I. l 4847 grim. native sulphuret gave 1.3382 molybdicacid & 0.0427 gangue.

IV. 1371 native sulphuret from Bohus gave 1.2348 grim. molybdic acid and
             0.0430 gangue.
    We have moreover examined the artificial sulphuret ob
tained by treating the neutral molybdate of potash with sul
phuretted hydrogen.

   If we deduct the quantities of gangue found in the native
sulphurets of molybdenum, 100 parts of native sulphuret
yield, according to—

and these results prove beyond a doubt the identity of the na
tive sulphuret, and the artificial sulphuret of molybdenum. If
we calculate the per-centage composition of the sulphuret of
molybdenum according to theory, it consists of
                             (1.          Calc.          b.         Calc.

   It is evident that the gangue in the sulphuret of molyb
denum is a mere mechanical impurity, from its quantity vary
ing in the mineral. If in calculating the analyses we take the
gangue into consideration, we find—
                      I.               II.             III.             IV.

These analyses differ from those made by Buchholz, Brandes,
and Seybert; but these chemists never determined accurately
the amount of gangue in the native sulphuret, and, moreover,
the atomic weight employed by them was less certain.
    Having shown the identity of the native and artificial sul
phuret of molybdenum, we will now return to the first ex
periments of roasting the artificial sulphuret, where we found
 that 100 parts sulphuret (MoS*) furnished 89.7523 parts
 molybdic acid. This result is founded solely upon experi

           of Molybdenum and some of its Compounds.            545
ments; but if, starting from this, we wish to calculate the atomic
weight of molybdenum, it must be based upon the number
representing the atomic weight of sulphur. Berzelius deter
mined the atomic weight of sulphur to be 20075, by convert
ing a known weight of chloride of silver into sulphuret.
Erdmann and Marchand have arrived at the number 200,000
by the analysis of the sulphuret of mercury. The starting
point for Erdmann and Marchand's number is not only de
pendent on the atomic weight of mercury, but the most
important question is, Were these chemists perfectly certain
that the sulphuret of mercury was free from any mechanical
admixture of metallic mercury P As this was not ascertained,
we do not think that the atomic weight of sulphur found by
them, although highly probable, can be admitted uncon
ditionally. With regard to Berzelius's atomic weight for
sulphur, it is liable to the objection, that perhaps a minute
quantity of chloride of silver surrounded by sulphate of
silver was withdrawn from the action of the sulphuretted
hydrogen. We therefore treated 5'5967 grims. chloride of
silver with sulphuretted hydrogen and obtained 4-8395 sul
phuret of silver. Whence, admitting Berzelius's atomic
weights for chlorine and silver, that of the sulphur is found
to be 200-71; but on dissolving the sulphuret of silver in
pure nitric acid, a small quantity of undecomposed chloride
of silver remained undissolved, and, consequently, the number
200-71 must be too high. We wished to decide this im
portant question, but have been prevented by various circum
stances, and, on that account, all the theoretical calculations
we have made, and also that of the equivalent of molybde
num, have been calculated with the two different atomic
weights for sulphur.
   Now, if we calculate the equivalent of molybdenum from
the quantity of molybdic acid which we obtained from 100
parts of sulphuret of molybdenum, we have, when the atomic
weight of sulphur is assumed to be 200-75,-
             100 : 89°7523 = a + 401'5 : z + 300
                           a = 588'966       .  .  .  .   .  . (a.)
and when the atomic weight of sulphur is 200.000,—
              100 : 89°7523 = a + 400 : a + 300
                         a = 575:829 .       .  .   .  .  .  . (b.)
Although the difference between the two atomic weights here
assumed for sulphur is not very great, its influence in calcu
lating the atomic weight of molybdenum is very considerable,

  units, consequently to more than 1 entire equivalent of hydro
  gen. That the equivalent a must be too high is not merely
 evident from the objections which we have made respecting
  the atomic weight of sulphur, but is also confirmed by the
 following circumstances:—
     I. Without laying too great stress upon the reduction of
 molybdic acid by hydrogen, we may nevertheless direct at
 tention to experiment II., this agreeing much better with the
 numbers calculated according to the atomic weight b, than
 according to a.
     II. The analyses of the trimolybdate of potash, the only
 salt which can be obtained perfectly pure, agree much better
 with the numbers calculated according to b, than with those
 according to a.
    III. The most decided proof for the lower atomic weight
 of molybdenum is derived from the results of the experiments
 of fusing molybdic acid with carbonated alkalies. These
 results agree with each other, and likewise with the atomic
 weight b very well. The atomic weight deduced from these
 experiments is founded upon that of carbon, which it may be
 admitted is determined as accurately as possible in the pre
sent state of chemistry. Even should a small uncertainty
exist with respect to this number, it would have very little
 influence upon the atomic weight of molybdenum. We there
fore consider ourselves justified in drawing the conclusion,
that the atomic weight of molybdenum is 575-829, and the
per-centage composition of molybdic acid

          LXXVII. On a Property of the Hyperbola.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    GENTLEMEN,                                                 -
THººgh I am but an equation, and as such, more accus
        tomed to be solved than to solve, I cannot any longer
endure the injustice which is done to me with respect to the
curves I have the honour to control. Want of long suffering
cannot be imputed to me, or to any of my species; we even
carry the Christian maxim further than the Christian law re
quires: for in what manner soever any one smites us on one
cheek, we not merely turn to him the other also, but insist
upon his treating it in the same manner, and cannot be satis
fied until it is done. Coupled as we are with the very notion
of justice (for what do the scales represent but an equation be

                 On a Property of the Hyperbola.              547
tween weights?) I can no longer bear it should be thought
that I have made a wrong balance, or consented to an unequal
division of property.
   All who have made me their study are generally aware of
the impartial manner in which I have managed that every pro
perty of the ellipse should be accompanied by another of pre
cisely the same character, belonging to the hyperbola. Why
then should they allow that cases of palpable non-symmetry
do sometimes occur: and, which is even worse, why do they
suppose that I have allowed the ellipse, in certain cases, to rob
the hyperbola of its birthright withofft any compensation?
For an example of the first: in the hyperbola, the diagonal of
the parallelogram described on semiconjugate diameters has,
for the locus of its fourth point, the asymptotes, an extreme
case of the hyperbola itself; while, in the ellipse, the corre
sponding point has an ordinary ellipse for its locus, having
the semiaxes of the former increased in the ratio of W2 to 1.
How can any one imagine there is not a word to be said upon
this? Again, the circle on the major axis is, in the ellipse,
the locus of the intersection of the perpendicular from a focus
upon the tangent; and this same circle is still the locus, when
an hyperbola on the same major axis is substituted for the
ellipse. Now symmetry would require that, in this second case,
the equilateral hyperbola should take the place of the circle:
why did not the mathematicians, when they discovered that
such was not the case, bestow no pains on the clearing of my
character? Did they suppose that I would allow the ellipse
to take and hold the share of the hyperbola in any property,
 without restoring the equilibrium by giving to the hyperbola
the share of the ellipse in some other? I do not go for da
 mages: but I think I have a right to such reparation as can
be made by inserting demonstration of the following proper
ties in future works on conic sections:—
    1. Every ellipse, and every hyperbola, has, the first two
ellipses, the second two hyperbolas, related to it. One of them
is an extreme case, having vanishing axes: it is the centre in
the ellipse, the asymptotes in the hyperbola. The other is .
 ordinary, having axes increased in the proportion of W2 to 1.
 Each of either pair has this property, that if a chord PQ of
 the original cut either of the related curves in R, the rectangle
 under R P and RQ is equal to the square on the semidiameter
 parallel to that chord. The extreme case in the ellipse corre
 sponds to the ordinary case in the hyperbola, and vice versä :
 and thus the fourth point of the parallelogram above mentioned,
 has the asymptotes for its locus in the hyperbola, and the other
 sort of ellipse for its locus in the ellipse.

  548                       Royal Society.
     2. A line being given, let the line which makes with an
 axis of coordinates the supplement of the angle made by the
 first be called the supplemental line of the first. Take an
 ellipse and hyperbola with the same major, and any minor,
 axis; draw a tangent to either, and from the focus of the other
 draw the supplemental line of the perpendicular to that tan
 gent. . The locus of the intersection of this supplemental line
 with the tangent is the equilateral hyperbola which has the
 same major axis as the given ellipse or hyperbola, to which
 ever of the two the tangent was drawn.
     Thus you may see that I have not, in this instance at least,
 favoured the ellipse at the expense of the hyperbola, without
a corresponding reparation to the hyperbola at the expense of
 the ellipse. Should any similar reflections be cast on me in fu
 ture, I shall take some opportunity of answering them, before
they have run for 2000 years.
                     I am, Gentlemen, yours to command,

Nov. 23, “        N the Chemical Nature of Wax.”—Part III. “On
   1848,           Myricine.” By B. C. Brodie, Esq.      Communicated
by Sir B. C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
    This paper is the last of three papers on the chemical nature of
wax, and contains the investigation of that portion of bees-wax
which is soluble only with difficulty in boiling alcohol. This body
could never be rightly investigated before the discovery of the true
nature of the other constituent of the wax, namely, the cerotic acid,
for the absence of which no test was known, and the products of the
decomposition of which would materially interfere with any experi
ments on the nature of the myricine. When the cerotic acid has been
absolutely removed by repeated boiling of the wax with alcohol, a sub
stance remains, which is saponifiable, but with difficulty. From the
products of saponification the author isolated palmitic acid, Cas Has O,
and a new wax-alcohol, analogous to, but yet different from cerotine,
described in a former paper. This alcohol, melissime, has the formula
Cºo His O. By oxidation of this substance by means of line and
potash, the acid Cao Hso O, melissic acid, was obtained; and by the
action of chlorine, a body analogous to chloral, a substance, that is,
of the aldehyde series, but with a substitution of between fourteen
and fifteen equivalents of chlorine for hydrogen. In its conversion
into this substance the alcohol loses two equivalents of hydrogen,
without substitution. The author also investigated the products of

 the distillation of myricine. From these he procured likewise pal
 mitic acid and a solid hydrocarbon, which, rectified over potassium,
 had a melting-point of 62°, and contained, as shown by analysis,
 carbon and hydrogen in equal equivalents. The analogy of the mode
 of formation of this substance to cerotine from Chinese wax shows
 that it is the hydrocarbon, melene, Co, Hon. By repeated crystalliza
 tion from ether a substance was obtained from the impure myricine,
 of a crystalline character, melting at 72°; the analysis of which
 agrees with the formula C, H, O, which explains the reactions of
 the substance.
    The general conclusion from this investigation is, that waxes are a
 class of bodies which, chemically speaking, stand in the same rela
 tion to fat as do fatty bodies to the alcohol and acetic acid of vinous
 fermentation; all which bodies are members of one chemical series,
 possess an analogous chemical character, and are susceptible of
 analogous transformations.
    “An account of Astronomical Observations proposed to be made
 in South America.”       By S. M. Gilliss, in an extract of a letter to
 Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.      Communicated by Lieut.-
 Col. Sabine.
         DEAR SIR,                          Washington, October 25, 1848.
    During the month of April last I sent to you, through the Royal
 Society, a printed report from one of the naval committees in con
 gress, recommending a grant of funds for the purpose of sending
 an astronomical expedition to the most available point in South
 America, to make observations which should have for their object
 the improvement or verification of the solar parallax. The basis of
 this report was a correspondence between Dr. Gerling of Marburg,
 other astronomers, and myself, that had been presented for con
 sideration by the Secretary of the Navy, and, in accordance with the
 views of the Philosophical Society and of the Academy of Arts and
 Sciences, had been laid before congress for their decision.
    Conformably with the recommendation of the committee, an ap
 propriation was made, and the Honourable Secretary of the Navy
 directed to employ it in making the observations requested by the
 two societies just named.    The command of the party has been as
 signed to me, and a plan of operations submitted to the societies
having received their sanction, has been approved by the Secretary.
This is briefly as follows:–
    To embark the instruments and their assistants by the 1st of June
next for Valparaiso, for which place Ishall leave New York per steamer,
vid Chagres and Panama, at the same time. As the voyage by this
route may be readily made in thirty-five days, I shall be able to se
lect a suitable station and make all necessary arrangements prior to
the arrival of the instruments; but it is very probable that Santiago
or Talca will be chosen for our operations, and from the solicitude
expressed by the residentChilian Chargé d'Affaires, the preponderance
is on the side of Santiago. Moreover, it is thought that if Santiago
is chosen and we remain nearly four years, as contemplated, the Chi
lian government will be induced to establish a permanent observatory
there.

  550                         Royal Society.
      The observations I propose to make are, Mars on the meridian
  and extra-meridian, during the oppositions of 1849 and 1852; and
  Venus under analogous conditions at the inferior conjunctions and
  stationary terms of 1850 and 1852. These observations will be dif
  ferential, and (as the grant of congress implies) are the paramount
  objects of the expedition; but as they will occupy only a portion of
  our time, the following series have also been decided on:—
      1st. With a view to improvement in the constant of lunar parallax,
  Burckhardt's semidiameter, and the local longitude, the moon and
  culminating stars on the meridian; both limbs at opposition and
  near conjunction.
     2nd. The smaller planets on the meridian.
     3rd. A catalogue of stars to the 8th magnitude inclusive, within
  60° of the south pole.
     Three hours of every suitable night will be given to this work,
 and the arrangement is such that the whole 60° may be examined
 and three observations made of each star within the proposed term
 of residence.
     4th. Lunar occultations. Longitudes resulting from culminations
 as compared with occultations, have exhibited an extraordinary dif
 ference, to be accounted for perhaps by an error in the assumed
 semidiameter; this series of observations is considered necessary.
    5th. It has been thought that useful information to terrestrial re
 fractions will be obtained from observations in the two hemispheres
 on circum-zenith stars at each place of observation, and six stars
 have been selected which are near the zeniths of Talca and Wash
 ington to be observed on the meridian.
    6th. Comets when discovered in the course of other observations,
 and at their periodic returns.
    7th. Magnetical observations.     The term-days of such observa
 tories as continue to keep them has been set apart to obtain the three
 elements of the earth's magnetic condition, and on occasional term
 days the observations would be made uninterruptedly during twenty
 four hours with the declinometer.
    8th. Meteorological observations at three stated hours (9 A.M.,
 3 P.M. and 9 P.M.) of each day; to embrace records of barometer;
 dry, wet, radiating and registering thermometers; rain-gauge; wind
 vane and clouds. Hourly observation on equinoctial and solstitial
term-days.
    9th. Earthquakes, the registrations of a seismometer.
    A meridian circle of 3 feet diameter, with a telescope of 52 lines
aperture, has been ordered from Pistor and Martins; the Smithsonian
Institution has just authorized me to obtain an equatorial of 6 (French)
inches aperture, with clock motion, which they will lend me; in ad
dition to which I have a 48 lines equatorial by Fraunhofer; these,
with a clock and one or two portable instruments, comprise my astro
nomical equipment. In magnetism I am most especially desirous of
your advice. Pray give me all possible information, and recommend
such instruments, times and methods of observation as our limited
grant from congress and the number of assistants will enable me to
obtain and use as designated.                              -

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               551
   Such of the meteorological instruments as we do not possess will
be ordered in a few days; but for a proper seismometer I know not
where to go, the only account seen being in one of the earlier volumes
of the British Association.      The instrument is to be obtained at
the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, and if you will do us
the favour to confer with some of the members of your Association
or of the Royal Society who have taken interest in the investigation
of earthquakes, you will especially oblige Professor Henry and myself.
The opportunity which my residence in Chili will offer to make ac
curate notes of these occurrences may perhaps be productive of use
ful results.  I do not doubt that the instrument will be ordered the
moment I hear from you.
   Whilst I have asked your views especially on magnetism, I shall
be grateful for counsel respecting any of the observations which are
contemplated, or for suggestions of new series which the locality
offers peculiar advantages for making.       I have planned this expedi
tion and embark in it with a desire to render the greatest possible
amount of useful data to science; and you may be assured of hearty
zeal in whatever yourself or any of the Fellows of the Royal Society
may propose.
                  Believe me, dear Sir, very respectfully,

             CALCULATING CUBES.           BY J. E. fty FFEL.
 A    SIMPLE, novel, and efficacious method of instructing children
       in the elements of arithmetic has just been published by Mr.
Ryffel (Ackermann, Strand), in the form of a box, containing one
hundred coloured cubes.      Their intention is to realize to a child's
mind the idea of numbers by visible and tangible objects, illustrating
by their juxtaposition the first rules of arithmetic. But “besides teach
ing younger children how to count,” says Mr. Ryffel, “these cubes
may be used in various other ways, all tending to prepare and exercise
the child for more serious studies in arithmetic as well as the higher
branches of mathematics.” The pamphlet which accompanies these
cubes contains instructions for their use, and lessons so fully worded,
that elder children may with a little application easily master the
system, and apply it in giving instruction.

   DISCOVERY OF COLUMBITE IN THE ENVIlt ONS OF LIMOGES.
                                     BY M. DAMIOUR.
   The specimen of this substance was found in a quarry near Chan
teloube, belonging to M. Alluaud, Sen., collected by M. Mathieu, a
mineral dealer of Paris, and confounded with specimens of wolfram,
triplite, heterosite and dufrenite, brought from the same place.
    Its colour, hardness and great density, induced M. Damour to
think that it did not belong to any of the preceding species; and a
qualitative examination proved that it was almost entirely composed
of columbic acid and oxide of iron, with a small quantity of oxide of tin.
   This specimen had the form of amorphous nucleus, of the size of
a hazel-nut, imbedded in yellowish-white felspar. Superficially it
was of a tarnished bluish-black colour, with a shining, smooth fresh
fracture The powder was of a grayish-black colour. It scratches
glass readily; its density was found to vary from 7:640 to 7-651. It
is infusible by the blowpipe. When reduced to powder and mixed
with tartrate of potash and carbonate of soda, it fuses on charcoal,
and yields some globules of tin. When fused with borax and phos
phoric salt, it reacts like iron. Acids do not act upon it.
   To analyse this mineral, it was reduced to powder and fused with
eight times its weight of bisulphate of potash, and the fused mass
when cold was treated with a large quantity of hot water. The
oxides of iron and tin were almost entirely dissolved in the liquor:
the columbic acid was deposited in the form of a white powder, but
still retaining a little oxide of tin and iron. It was digested in hy
drosulphate of ammonia, by which the oxide of iron was converted
into an insoluble sulphuret, and the sulphuret of tin remained dis
solved in the sulphurous ammoniacal liquor, which was filtered and
saturated with acetic acid, and the sulphuret of tin precipitated was
collected. The columbic acid, blackened by the sulphuret of iron,
was treated with hydrochloric acid; by this the iron was dissolved,
and the columbic acid after washing was perfectly white; it was
dried, ignited and weighed.
   The liquor separated from the sulphuret of tin was treated with
ammonia and its hydrosulphate; by this all the iron was obtained in
the state of sulphuret; the liquor separated from it contained no
earthy base whatever.
   The sulphuret of iron was dissolved in aqua regia; by evaporating
the solution and treating the residue with water, a minute quantity
of silica was left. The ferruginous liquor was saturated with am
monia, and the quantity of protoxide of iron was inferred from that
of the peroxide obtained.

    M. Damour observes, that               although       the columbic acid is reckoned
as pure, it may possibly contain a small quantity of the niobic and

  pelopic acids recently discovered by M. Rose in the columbiferous mi
  nerals of Bavaria and America.         The columbite of Limoges is denser
  than these, of which the former has a density of 6-390, 6-078, 5.976,
  and the latter of 5’708, 5'495.        That of Tamela in Finland, which
  M. Rose considers as pure columbic acid, is of density, 7 197, 7476,

                    AND SODA.         B.Y. M. A. DAMOUR.
     This substance was recently found imbedded in pigmatite near
 Limoges.
     Its colour when viewed in mass is clove-brown ; its fracture is
 laminated and shining, and in some parts, which seem to have un
 dergone some alteration, it is chatoyant like hyperstene. Fracture
 indicates a right rectangular prism as its crystalline form. It
 scratches fluor spar, and is scratched by a steel point; the powder is
 brownish-yellow. Its density is 3:468.
    Moderate-sized specimens appear occasionally to contain accidental
 admixtures of peroxide of iron and black oxide of manganese: they
 are sometimes associated with green phosphate (dufrenite) and blue
 phosphate of iron.                                                         !
    By the blowpipe, in platina forceps, this mineral fuses very readily
 with intumescence, into a black globule, which is not magnetic ; in          :
 the oxidizing flame, it dissolves entirely in phosphoric salt and indi
cates manganese ; heated in a tube, it decrepitates and disengages a
 small quantity of neutral water.
    When in fine powder it dissolves readily in cold hydrochloric acid;
the solution at first is of a blackish colour and evolves chlorine; if the
temperature be raised to 140°F., the liquor becomes bright, and of
a brownish-yellow colour. Sulphuric acid diluted with four times
its bulk of water does not act upon it cold. At 212°F. it dissolves         *
slowly, and the solution is of a reddish-violet colour; this colour
indicates manganese of a higher state of oxidizement than manga
nous oxide, but it occurs only with the chatoyant portions of the
specimen.
   Nitric acid acts upon it with difficulty, but oxalic acid when heated
dissolves it completely; when the solution is suffered to evaporate
spontaneously, granular crystals of oxalate of manganese and peroxa
late of iron are deposited.

    M. Damour proposes the name of alluaudite for this mineral, in
honour of M. Alluaud, well-known for attachment to the sciences.
