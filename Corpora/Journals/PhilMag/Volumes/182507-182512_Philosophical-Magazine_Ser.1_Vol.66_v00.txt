INready   hinted at the connexion between the pressure, den

                on the Laws
degree of success.
                                         of   the Condensation
                  An investigation instituted on the principles
  have endeavoured briefly to explain, promises at least some
     ut a preliminary investigation seems necessary.   In what
                                                                                     and Dilatation
manner do the elasticity and density of a mass of air depend
upon the heat combined with it in a latent form, and the heat
of temperature sensible to the thermometer? It is evident
that the latter quantities completely ascertain the condition of
a given body of air.                If
                            both of them remain constant, no
change can take place in the air's elasticity or density.                                                     If
both, or either of them vary, an alteration .# the elasticity or
density, or of both together, will necessarily ensue.     In the
present communication I confine myself to this preliminary
intºe have    no knowledge, in any instance, of the absolute
quantities of the heat of combination, or of the heat of tem
perature; we can reason only about the differences that occur
in the same body placed in different circumstances. For this
reason it is always necessary to refer the air, or gas, under
consideration, to some original or standard condition. I shall
suppose that the elasticity and density are each originally equal
to unit; and     I
                shall put p for the relative elasticity, or pres
sure, and g = 1 + w for the relative density, in any other state.
Thus if h be the barometric pressure of the original body of
air, and h' the like pressure when the air has varied in any
                     f
manner, then
                 # = p ; and if D and D' be the densities in
                                             D/

                                                                                                      -   -

temperature being r, and the difference of temperature 3, the
actual temperature will be r + 6. If x denote the dilatation
for one degree of the thermometer, we have this fundamental
equation between the quantities defined, viz.
and      I

factor, or the function, for temperature. Lastly, shall                                          I        de
note by + i the degrees of the thermometer evolved or ab
sorbed, when             air
                          gas passes from the original
                               or   a                         any                                    to

that I — a will likewise represent the elasticity within the ves

by the dilated air will produce a certain degree of cold, and
consequently a diminution of elasticity. Taking the letters r

depression of the thermometer within the vessel at the instant

II.Observations on the Notes of Birds, including an              Inquiry
  whether or not they are instinctive. By Mr. John               BLAck
  wall.”               -
ITtoois much  to be regretted that the study of ornithology is
        frequently confined solely to the perusal of the best
authors on the subject, and to the examination and arrange
ment of preserved specimens, whose faded plumage and dis
torted forms convey very imperfect ideas of the elegance and
symmetry that so eminently distinguish this beautiful and
highly interesting part of the creation. To those whom busi
ness or inclination leads to reside chiefly in large towns, such
are almost the only means of information that offer themselves;
but who that enjoys the opportunity of observing the free
denizens of the fields and woods in their native haunts, would
exchange their lively and unrestrained activity, their curious
domestic economy, their mysterious migrations, and their wild
but delightful melody, for the fixed glassy eye and the mute
tongue of the inanimate forms that are crowded together in
melancholy groups in the museum? Let me not, however, be
inisunderstood: I do not mean to insinuate, that those collec
tions of birds that enrich the cabinets of the curious are of
small utility; on the contrary, I am willing to allow that their
                                            I
importance is very considerable: but would anxiously guard
against an exclusive attention to the collecting and arranging
of specimens, to the neglect of what is much more instructive
and valuable;     Imean the study of their habits, manners, eco
nomy, instincts, and notes. In these important particulars the
history of birds is still very defective: the majority of authors,
foreign as well as native, having limited themselves to the
simple enumeration of specific characteristics and distinctions,
and the occasional introduction of a few anecdotes, which from
frequent repetition have, in general, lost much of the novelty
they once possessed.       We must except from this remark,
however, the excellent works, in natural history, of our             in
genious countryman the late Rev. Gilbert White, of Selborne
in Hampshire, which abound with new and interesting facts.
 This diligent observer, whose example in investigating nature
cannot be too highly recommended, instead of confining him
 self to the mere classification of natural objects, ranged the
 extensive wood, the tangled brake, the solitary sheep-walk,
 and the treacherous morass, to contemplate the manner of
life, dispositions, and peculiar characters, of their fathered       in

bear ample testimony how well his researches were repaid. .
The subject, however, is still far from being exhausted: know
ledge is acquired slowly; and even the most careful and inde
fatigable inquirers are liable to errors and omissions. Much
yet remains to be supplied, much to be corrected, before the
history of British birds can be pronounced complete.

great powers              of

18    Mr.      J. Blackwall's            Observations           on the Notes    of Birds,
 first, he states, “belonged to Mr. Matthews, an apothecary at
 Kensington, which, from a want of other sounds to imitate,
 almost articulated the words ‘pretty boy,’ as well as some
 other short sentences;” and the owner assured him that it had
 neither the note nor call of any bird whatsoever.              The gold
finch had      acquired   the song   of the  wren,   without  appearing    to
have a note or even the                      .#
                                     of the goldfinch.
     From these experiments and observations, of which I have
 given a concise, but I trust impartial account, Mr. Barrington
 was led to conclude, that “notes in birds are no more innate
 than language is in man, but depend entirely upon the master
 under which they are bred, as far as their organs will enable
 them to imitate the sounds which they have frequent oppor
 tunities of hearing.”                  I
                                am not aware, however, that he has
 brought forward a single fact, from which such an inference
 ean be fairly deduced.          The main tendency of his researches
is  merely    to prove  (what was before perfectly well known) that
some birds have very extraordinary powers of imitation, and
may be taught, when young, to sing the notes of other species,
whistle tunes, or even pronounce a few words.               If his remarks
 on this    subject  contain  any   novelty,   it      that birds    is,
                                                                       edu             so
cated sometimes remain satisfied with these imitations, never
blending any         oftheir own notes with them; and, indeed,                                     on
                                                                                          of is,

that powerfully tend            invalidate almost every thing           im              of
portance that has been advanced respecting this bird.
     In  order    toascertain whether nestlings when taken very
young will      orwill not have the calls and songs          their species,of
they should       bekept        in
                              situations where      they  have      oppor         no

them; but this, believe, has never yet been attempted.

    It is well known to most persons who have the care and
 management of poultry, that ducks, guineafowls, &c., hatched

 as  they have been able                      to at
                                  pick up casually; which,          course,                         of

young green grosbeaks,—a cock and two hens; which, as they
did not see     the fourth day after they were taken from the
nest, must then have been only two days old *.
   These birds were reared by hand, in a house situated in the
town of Manchester, where they had no opportunity of hear
ing the notes of any bird, except, perhaps, the occasional
chirping of sparrows; nevertheless, they had      their appro                       all
priate calls, and the cock bird had the song peculiar                                                  to   its
species.

 their parents, which they imitated         soon     they had acquired

 thologist with an excellent method of distinguishing species,
 under all the various circumstances that are liable to affect
 their plumage; though it must be observed, that the great si
 milarity so evident in the songs of birds of the same species is
 more in tone and style, than in the individual notes of which
 they are composed”.                          -
      I
      shall here remark, that it is highly probable that no bird,
 in a wild state, ever borrows the notes of others, or becomes a
 mocker.     I am well aware that several of our native birds (as
 the pettychaps and sedge warbler) have usually been termed
 mocking birds; but this is certainly improper: as they con
 stantly use their own natural notes, and no others, they do not
 at all merit this appellation.      The fine strain of the first has
 been thought to bear a striking resemblance to those of the
 swallow and blackbird: this, however, must be entirely ima
 ginary, as it is totally different from them in manner and notes:
                                                                                   º,
if it be possible to trace any similarity between them, it will
 be found to consist in tone merely. The song of the sedge
warbler is wonderfully varied, and appears to be chiefly com
          º
 posed of passages borrowed from the songs of the
 titlark, white-throat, whinchat, lesser redpole, swallow, &c.
 Now if any bird is entitled to the epithet of mocker, surely it
is this: yet these resemblances are common to the songs of
the         species, which inhabit situations very unsuitable for
acquiring some of them. In short, these fancied imitations are
not studied, but purely accidental, consisting of their own
notes ab origine.
    The singing of birds has been very generally attributed to
the passion of love, and a desire of pleasing their mates.
                “”Tis   love creates their melody, and             all
                    This waste     of
                                  music    the voice
                                              is       love;  of
                    That even to birds and beasts the tender arts
                    Of pleasing teachest.”
Thus the great poet                 of
                           nature elegantly expresses the idea.
This opinion, however,                   does not appear
                                                    well founded:  to    be
their language     love,  of
                         their amorous    strains, consist     low                   of
intermitted tones, accompanied with ridiculous gesticulations;
and are altogether different from their ordinary songs, which
seem      to   be
             occasioned                 by
                                 exuberance   an   animal spirits,       of

  observe, that I have known many instances of birds having
  nests after they have entirely ceased singing; and that some
  species (as the woodlark, redbreast and wren) sing long after
  they have done breeding: caged birds also continue in song
  much longer than birds at large, though they have no mates
  to solace and amuse; and it is remarkable that almost any
  kind of continued noise is sufficient to stimulate them to sing.
  That birds of the same species distinguish each other by their
  notes, better than by any other circumstance, and that the
  songs of the males serve to direct the females where to seek
  their society, as Montagu has suggested, appears to me highly
 probable; but I must differ from this ingenious writer when
 he asserts that love is the sole cause of their songs”. In sup
 port of this opinion he states, that the males of our warblers,
 before they pair in spring, sing almost incessantly, and with
 great vehemence; that from the time of pairing till the hens
 begin to          sit
                they are neither                         so

             before; that during the time
                                                                    as of

26     Mr.    J. Blackwall's       Observations    on the Notes    of Birds.
     This long catalogue of birds,
                                 most of which, it appears, are
                                              º
to be found in this immediate neighbourhood, composes the
feathered choir that enlivens the pastoral scenery of England
with a rich and varied melody of          which probably is not
surpassed in any part of the known globe.                    -
   The following poetical description of the vernal chorus, with
which     I
          shall close these observations, is from Thomson's
Seasons,—Spring.
                                         “Up springs the lark,
              Shrill-voiced, and loud, the messenger of morn;
              Ere yet the shadows fly, he mounted sings
              Amid the dawning clouds, and from their haunts
              Calls up the tuneful nations. Every copse
              Deep-tangled, tree irregular, and bush
              Bending with dewy moisture, o'er the heads
              Of the coy quiristers that lodge within,
              Are prodigal of harmony. The thrush
              And wood-lark, o'er the kind contending throng
              Superior heard, run through the sweetest length
              Of notes; when listening Philomela deigns
              To let them joy, and purposes in thought
              Elate, to make her might excel their day.
              The blackbird whistles from the thorny brake;
              The mellow bullfinch answers from the grove:
              Nor are the linnets, o'er the flowering furze
              Pour'd out profusely, silent. Join'd to these,
              Innumerous songsters, in the freshening shade
              Of new-sprung leaves, their modulations mix
              Mellifluous.    #.  jay, the rook, the daw,
              And each harsh pipe, discordant heard alone,
              Aid the full concert; while the stock-dove breathes
              A melancholy murmur through the whole.”
are so mean, that I am inclined to believe that he has attributed the song
of the sedge warbler to this species, especially as he remarks, in a note,
that it sings in the night, an error by no means uncommon among orni
thologists,   yet, if this is the case, he has greatly underrated it; for though
harsh in tone, and hurried in manner, and though the same note is repeated
frequently in succession, it certainly possesses great variety, and        is,
                                                                            upon
the whole, rather agreeable.
t    I  have included the Dartford warbler, and the water ouzel, on the
authority     ofMontagu.. (See the Supplement          to    his
                                                              Ornithological Dic
tionary.)    The former I      never saw alive, and therefore could have no
means    of estimating  its  song; and though     I am well acquainted with the
latter, have never had
      I                       an opportunity  of hearing    its
                                                             notes.

              Obs.    In this place an opportunity is afforded of
          making a few additional and useful remarks respectin
         two species of this genus, which were first
         in my Suppl. Pl. Succ. and in my Revis. Pl. Succ. from
         weak or incomplete examples: viz.
              1. The stem of C. elata described in Suppl. Pl.
         Succ., p. 20, was tied up and appeared firm; but my
         own plant has ever had a “caulis subdebilis, basi ra
         mosus,” and will probably so remain, although it is a
         radical offset from the plant I described; because
         gooseberry bushes, &c. raised from decumbent suckers
          are said never to make upright plants.
             2. Cotyledon coruscans, Suppl. Pl. Succ. p. 21, was
         described from a young green plant in a very hot stove
          at Kew, glittering in the sun's beams very much;
         but grown in a greenhouse it glitters not at all, and
         usually becomes “farinoso-alba, ramosa, vix pedalis;
        foliis decussatis confertis incurvo-recurvis canaliformibus
         semipedalibus unciam latis crassis; apice tenuioribus

                                                                 bellato

exact comparison of those results with my own so interesting,
that I have long formed the desire of applying to Mr. Pond's
original observations the same method of calculation which                                         I
applied to my own. Taking therefore advantage of the nu
merous observations (direct as well as reflected) contained in
the volume of 1822,                  to me by Mr. Pond through
the kind intervention of Dr. Tiarks, I requested M. Olufsen,
who is now here, to assist me in their reduction.      I now com
municate the results of these labours to the lovers of astro
nomy, since the explanation which they give, respecting the
difference between Mr. Pond's standard catalogue and mine,
is calculated to establish the true state of the case.

    Hence it follows that the value of a, in the Greenwich in
    strument, must be very small. Mr. Pond, indeed, considers it
    as vanishing altogether.  However, by keeping entirely to the

    been removed only by reversing the instrument; a measure

  On comparing this list, we find that the differences of the
new calculation and the Königsberg catalogue are both smaller
and more uniform, than the difference of the two Greenwich
catalogues compared with one another. The reason of the

 meter; in which Bradley's rule perceptibly deviates from the
 truth.    The regularity hereby obtained is of about the same
 magnitude as the probable errors would lead us to expect.—
 The reason of the greater deviation at 22 Capricorni is un
       j
 known to me; that of a Piscis austr. may arise from the centre
 of the long coloured spectrum (which this lowly culminatin
 star presents) having been differently determined by two dif
 ferent observers.
    The constant difference of both series of observations has
 been so greatly diminished by this calculation, that it is no
 longer so striking as before. But, whilst the casual errors of the
 single observations are reduced to a trifle, by the increase of
 their number, the goodness of the instruments, and the care
 in their use, the imperfections of the elements of reduction,
 hitherto unnoticed, distinctly appear.              after the increased  If,
 certainty          of
                Mr. Pond's observations         (by  the application                                       of   t

 count the intensity of light that strikes the eye of the observer
 is still very small. Nor is it possible entirely to rectify the
 deviation of the rays occasioned by the spherical forms of the
 reflecting surfaces of these telescopes;–reasons           which, with
 various   others, have rendered the mirror telescopes of little
 value for mathematico-astronomical observations, and have
 caused their rejection as meridional instruments, &c.

      Although the largest achromatic telescopes hitherto used

although the sky may appear clear, and the air in that respect
be but slightly imperfect, no observations can be made with

object, fixed for this purpose; as by this means the space of

perspective view, from the side     which the clock-work                on                                          is a

       When the instrument was sent off to Dorpat, the microme
   ter, &c. belonging to it were not completed; but they will be
   there before the instrument can be entirely set up.
       In the line micrometer belonging to the instrument, both
   threads may be separately moved by means of a screw; partly
   for the purpose of placing each thread where it may be re
   quired, partly for enabling the observer to make a kind of
   repetition in the observations with micrometers, which, with
   the use of the clock-work that moves the refractor, is much

   more practicable than it is in the common way of mounting.
. In the same sense the eye-glass is separately moveable, in or
   der to make the two threads stand always equidistant from
   the centre of the field of view, which makes them both equally
   distinct.     That part of the micrometer containing the threads,
   supports, besides the necessary correction-screws, &c., two
  verniers, in opposite positions, moving upon a                         cir
   cle, made for the purpose of measuring the angles of position.
   The verniers read off to one minute. The micrometer may
  be gently moved with respect to the position-circle, with the
  hand or with a screw. The lines only are capable of being
  illuminated, so as to leave the rest of the field of view quite
  dark.      As the position-circle must remain unalterable with
  respect to the position-axis, but the micrometer, together with
  the apparatus for lighting the threads, must be capable of be
  ing turned, I was obliged to make a disposition of it different
  from that which         I  had hitherto employed with micrometers
  without a position-circle.         The whole field may also be lighted.
                                                                       -
  This micrometer has four distinct eye-glasses.
      The refractor will receive moreover a lamp circle-microme
  ter with four eye-glasses; a lamp net-micrometer with three
  eye-glasses; and finally, four ring-micrometers, two of which
                                                                -
  contain double rings.                               -
      As distinctness can only be properly obtained by the axis
  of the object-glass and that of the eye-glass being exactly in
  the same line, and a deviation in this respect being more              in
 jurious in large object-glasses than in small ones, a particular
  instrument will be added to the refractor, by which this de
  viation may be found and corrected.                              -

Noerror,
    part of astronomy is more abstract, or more liable to
         than what regards computations in time. In the
Conn. des Tems 1825, M. Bouvard has calculated the diffe
rence of longitudebetween ParisandGreenwich, by means of the
moon's observed motion in right-ascension in the time elapsed
in passing between the two meridians. This calculation is ani
madverted on in the Quarterly Journal of Science published in
                                       I
 March last; and as observe that, in the discussion, what is
true is mixed with notions not quite correct, it may be per
mitted to bestow a few lines on the subject.
    M. Bouvard’s method of calculation may be thus explained.
 Conceive a fictitious sun moving equably in the equator at the
rate of 360° 59'8"; in 24 hours, and consequently marking
mean solar time by the arcs which it describes.       Let the fic
titious sun and the moon be upon a meridian at the same                                                      in
stant of time; and, after a given interval elapsed, the moon
having come to a second meridian, the fictitious sun will be
past that meridian.     It is manifest that the time of describing
 the arc of the equator between the fictitious sun and the se
cond meridian is equal to the moon's variation in right-ascen
sion estimated in mean solar time.          the moon's change of        If
 right-ascension in sidereal time be equal to a, and the ratio
of sidereal to mean time be equal to r, then the mean time of
describing the arc of the equator between the fictitious sun
and the second meridian will be equal to a r. Again, let
          9.                                                                                                 fic

titious sun separates from the first meridian in an hour of
mean time: and if h be the moon's motion in right-ascension
                                                                             15°   --   m

scribed in the first number of these Researches: and as the
most rigorous comparisons and examinations have confirmed
my original views, regarding the natural affinity of this ani
mal, I shall now concisely detail their result.                         -
   “For the purpose of following me in one of the most
 essential points of this description, I beg the reader to take
 before him the plate of illustrations contained in the first
number, and that which is annexed to the present number, of
these Researches.        It will then be perceived that between the
grinders of the Felis gracilis, and of the Mangusta javanica,
there is a great resemblance. In the grinders of the upper
jaw of the Felis gracilis this resemblance appears, indeed, only
partially.    The view, which, in making the delineation, was
taken from the specimen prepared for the Museum, did not
exhibit the tuberculous tooth with the minuteness of detail
that would have been desirable; and what appears a single
posterior tuberculous tooth will probably, on an inspection of
the naked cranium, be found to consist of two teeth placed in
close contact: but the contour and separate parts of the other
teeth are given with a degree of accuracy sufficient for my
present purpose.        In the grinders of the lower jaw this re
semblance is     strong  and apparent: thus, with the exception of
the additional heel of the base of the first three false grinders,
these teeth, in both animals, are perfectly similar; and in the
most characteristic tooth, the fifth grinder, being the true car
nassier, or carnivorous tooth, it is difficult to perceive any dif
ference whatever.        But if the comparison be extended to the
front teeth of these two animals, they will be found to be
perfectly dissimilar.       The front teeth of Mangusta javanica
have all the characters of the Viverrine animals enumerated;
namely, Genetta, Viverra (as above limited), Suricata (agree
ably to Desmarest and Illiger), and Mangusta; while those of
the Felis gracilis will be found strictly to agree with the teeth of
 Feline animals. After these remarks relating to the teeth alone,
I proceed to compare the other characters of Felis gracilis with
those of Viverrine animals generally.           The Felis gracilis, ex
clusive of the     lengthened     muzzle and slender body, has the
general physiognomy of Feline animals.              Its claws are com
pletely sheathed and retractile, and        its feet have precisely the
same covering, disposition, and attitude          as
                                                   those     Cats; with
                                                            of
this  difference,   that Felis  gracilis has five toes to the hind feet,
while the genus Felis,         previously known, has only four. To
afford a   distinct view
                         of asthis most essential character, care has
been taken both     in   the plate  of   details and   in  the figure of
Felisgracilis. This animal further agrees with the Feline tribe,

 in the absence of the anal folliculus, or pouch. Of this I am
 enabled to judge, by the complete absence of all odour during
 the period I had it in confinement. The Viverrine animals
hitherto known, and particularly the Mangusta javanica, have
long, naked, horny claws, which, although defined semi-re
tractile, and semi-vaginate, possess this property in a very
slight degree, and are more properly fitted for burrowing in
the earth, which many of them, and particularly the Man
gustae, perform with great dexterity.         They have, without ex
ception, either simple follicules, gradually larger in size in the
successive genera; according to the order in which they have
been enumerated, or an extensive anal pouch or sack. Their
tail is in a greater or less degree acuminated, which contri
butes, with their other characters, to give them a physiognomy
essentially different from that of Feline animals.
    “From these details it appears, that although the Felis gra
cilis agrees with the Mangusta javanica in the structure of the
grinders, particularly of those in the lower jaw, it is in other
respects entirely different, as well from this animal, as from
Viverrine animals generally; while, with a slight modification
of characters, it agrees with the Feline animals hitherto known,
 particularly in the general physiognomy, in the structure and
disposition of the feet and claws, in the absence of an anal
pouch, in a cylindrical tail, and even in the external marks on
the skin.     We have thus an agreement in one character, or
a relation of analogy, while in the aggregate of the other
characters, which should regulate us in the classification of
the animal, we have an indication of                      its
                                                  relations     affinity.

  complete the series which is still interrupted. In the Viverrine
  animals, which are apparently better known, the series is more
  regular. According to the relative development of the grinders,
  it has been arranged above in the following order: Genetta,
   Viverra, Suricata, Mangusta. The proportional development
  of the anal folliculi also confirms this disposition: in Genetta,
  it constitutes a simple excavation; in Viverra it is a pouch,
  divided into two sacks; in Suricata, and particularly in Man
  gusta, it consists of an extensive portion of integument, with                                                         -º

       NEW INSTITUTION                        FOR THE PROMOTION                OF ZOOLOGY.
     The foundations of nearly all     the modern scientific institu
tions of this  country   have been recorded in the Philosophical
Magazine; and it has also been our good fortune, in most                                              in
stances, to report their successful progress, and the influence
they have exerted on the general diffusion and extension of
knowledge.      The new Society whose formation and objects
we have now to state, is one of those honourable associations,
peculiar, we believe, to the present century, the more imme
diate purpose of which is the direct application of science to
the arts of life, the reduction to practical usefulness of the
principles of knowledge acquired in the investigation of nature.
This purpose, which is no doubt the greatest science can have
in view, -next to the auxiliary support given to          true religion          all
 by  the  rightly-conducted     examination         the works       theof                    of

      UR   readers must be already acquainted with the loss sus
       tained by Sir T. Stamford Raffles, of the most valuable

have also heard, it is probable, of the valuable collection he
succeeded in forming and bringing safely home after that dis
astrous event.     We are now happy to state that Sir Stamford
has  just  received from his correspondents at Bencoolen a con
siderable addition to his collection, including the Ursus ma

72       Account of the Mummy dissected by Dr. Granville.
     Dr.Granville next proceeded to draw some conclusions as to
 the age at which this mummified female died, and respecting
  the disease which destroyed her.      The bones of the ilium ex
 hibit that peculiar  thinness of their osseous plates which shows
 the individual to have exceeded her fortieth year, and to have
 borne children; and as there are no characters of age or of
 decrepitude about the skeleton, the author considers her to
 have been about fifty. The ovarium and broad ligament of
 the right side were enveloped in a mass of diseased structure,
 while the fallopian tube of the same side was sound; but the
 uterus itself was larger than natural, and the remains of a sac
 were found connected with the left ovarium,_all which, in
 conjunction with the appearance of the abdominal integuments,
 leave no doubt of ovarian dropsy having been the disease un
 der which the individual suffered.—Judging from the excava
 tion out of which the mummy was taken, and according to
 the best authorities of the present day on Egyptian Antiquities,
 the period at which the woman lived must have been about
 three thousand years ago.
     The author concludes this communication with some ob
 servations respecting the method of embalming practised by
 the ancient Egyptians, and the nature of the substances em
 ployed in the process; from the details of which, in conjunc
 tion with the results of his own researches and experiments,
 as well synthetical as analytical, he draws the conclusions fol
 lowing: That the abdominal viscera were more or less perfectly
 abstracted either through an incision on one side of the ab
 domen, or, as in the present mummy, through the anus. The
 thoracic cavity was not disturbed.       That the contents of the
 cranium were removed,—sometimes through the nostrils, and
in others through one of the orbits. The body was then pro
 bably covered with quicklime, to facilitate the removal of the
 cuticle, the scalp and nails being however left untouched;
 after which it was immersed in a melted mixture of bees’-wax,
resin, and bitumen, until thoroughly penetrated; and, ulti
mately, subjected to a tanning liquor, probably made with the
saline water of the neighbouring natron lakes. The bandages
were then applied, with the occasional interposition of melted
resin, or wax and resin, the lumps of resin, myrrh, &c., having
been previously placed in the abdomen.
                                                     -
    In order fully to establish these conclusions respecting the
mummifying process, Dr. Granville had prepared several imi
tative mummies by    its  means; some   of  which bore the closest
                       Egyptian,   and had withstood putrefaction

to be  sufficient, either singly or conjointly, without the wax, to
preserve the body, or convert it into a perfect mummy: and

not a gas or vapour, known.          When analysed, it was found
to consist of one   proportional    of carbon 6, and one of hydro

bined and condensed, as to occupy only one half the volume

MR. Donov AN’s APPARATUS        FOR FILTERING OUT OF CONTACT

   Where alkaline solutions in their caustic state are to be                                        fil
tered, and where it is required that the solution, after filtra
tion, should still be in the caustic state, it becomes a matter of
some difficulty to exclude the atmosphere in such a way as to
prevent the absorption of carbonic acid from it by the alkali.
   Thus in the process for preparing pure potash, when the
carbonate of potash, the hydrate of lime, and the water, have
been exposed to each other's action, during a sufficient period,
it is found difficult to separate the lime by the ordinary pro
cess of filtration. The mass is of so absorbent and pasty a na
ture, that the liquor passes through the filter very slowly and
with great difficulty; hence it is generally carbonated in                                           its
passage, and the contrivances commonly resorted              cover                      to,   of

high.      The following is an outline of the process by which
it   was isolated.
     Upon the slag,    when pulverized, nitric acid was digested,
until it ceased to exert any further solvent                 When
filtered, the solution was nearly neutralized, and sulphate of
soda added, while any precipitate formed.         The precipitate,
which was sulphate of lead, was collected on a filter.       To the
filtered  liquor  caustic ammonia was  added,  which at first threw
down a copious precipitate; the greater part of which was
 subsequently re-dissolved, by an excess of the precipitant. The
 insoluble portion, which was oxide of iron, was separated by
a filter.    The ammoniacal solution was submitted, on a sand
bath, to evaporation; by which the oxides dissolved in the
ammonia were gradually thrown down.              These were then
dissolved in muriatic acid, and to the solution carbonate of am
monia was added. A copious precipitate at first occurred,
which was considerably reduced by adding the carbonate of
ammonia in excess, in consequence of the property this salt
possesses of dissolving the oxide of zinc, which was present in
 considerable quantity. The undissolved residuum, when well
 washed, was re-dissolved in muriatic acid, and then introduced
 into a platinum capsule, containing a slip of zinc. When exa
mined next day, the bottom of the capsule was found lined with
 a dark lead-coloured metallic coating, which adhered so firmly
 as to admit of being repeatedly washed with distilled water
without being displaced. This experiment, as is well known
to chemists, was first made by Dr. Wollaston. It was again
dissolved in a drop of muriatic acid, and a small quantity of
the solution put in a test tube, into which a little hydrosul
phuret of ammonia was subsequently introduced. This threw
down an orange precipitate. To another portion of the solution
caustic potash was added in excess; the white precipitate at
                                 -
first formed was not re-dissolved.
    The identity then of this metal with cadmium is fully es
tablished—by the solubility of            its
                                       oxide     ammonia;

there are no circumstances connected with these facts, except
what we have mentioned, it seems to be impossible to account
for the heat which disappears from the thermometer in the
one case, and again becomes sensible in the other, unless we
suppose that it enters into combination in a latent form with
the dilated air, and is again evolved when the same air reco

 step by calculations almost purely conjectural.          But no ex
 perimental research could entirely fail in such able hands;
 and although the Professor has not been successful in the prin
 cipal object he had in view, yet in another point he has added
 to science, or at least to the rules for calculation. His for
 mula certainly does not accomplish what is the express pur
É.      of his research: it does not enable us to compute the
   eat evolved when air is suddenly condensed, or absorbed
when it is suddenly rarefied. Thus it completely fails when
applied to correct Newton's calculation of the velocity of sound,
although it is now known that, in this instance, theory is suffi
ciently reconciled with experiment, when a proper estimate is
made of the increased elasticity of air arising from the heat
disengaged by compression.             hat the formula does enable
us to  compute,  is the temperature   at a height in the atmosphere
where the   given  elasticity prevails.   According to Dalton this
temperature ought to be equal to the cold produced by an
equal rarefaction at the earth's surface.       But here the hypo
thesis of the philosopher of Manchester is at variance with
nature; for air rarefied at the earth's surface is colder, by

makes the heat of the atmosphere decrease more rapidly than
the altitude increases.         It is difficult to determine this point
in a satisfactory manner by a comparison of actual measure
ments, if we confine our attention to small heights above the
earth's surface.     The irregularity in such cases is so great,
that  by  a proper   choice ºinstances the result may be made
to favour either an accelerating or a retarding scale of heat”.

gradation, or to one continually decreasing in               rate. Thus                     its

        Mr. J. Ivory   on the Constitution       of the   Atmosphere.     87
   Now this passage does not authorise an indefinite accelera
tion in the decrease of heat, as Dr. Young supposes, but only
a limited acceleration to a certain height; beyond which the
decrements of heat become less for a given variation of altitude.
All that is said will be explained by supposing an anomaly
arising from the vicinity of the earth, which ceases at such             al
titudes where the temperature of the air is little affected by
terrestrial objects.
    3. Having now premised such observations as seemed ne
cessary for removing obstructions, and for introducing clear
ness into the discussion,         I
                                shall next apply to the present re
search the   equations  which have been investigated in the last
Number of this Journal. The elasticity and density of the
air at the earth's surface being each represented by unit, and
the relative quantities of the same things at any height in the
atmosphere being respectively equal to p and g = 1 — w, the
                                                             -
 equations may be thus written,
            p = 1 + 2 r — a i N3 X 1 + 2 + — a. i + cz4 3.
                  (                    )

                                      )
 Here r is the temperature at the earth's surface; i is the
number of degrees of the thermometer that measures the heat
absorbed when air passes from the density 1 to the density
 1 — w; and 3 stands for all the accessions or diminutions of
 heat proceeding from extraneous sources, and affecting the
temperature of a mass of air at the given height. These for
 mulae determine the equilibrium of the atmosphere, which will
 take place when the external pressure is equal to the elasti
 city. One equation more is still necessary for expressing the
 relation between the pressure, the density, and the elevation.
 Let h denote the length of the mercurial column which ba
 lances the pressure of the atmosphere, and D the density of
 the air at any height w; and let h' and D' stand for the same
 things at the earth's surface; then we have
                              h   =   <U+017F>—   D dar.

Suppose that l is the length of the homogeneous atmosphere,
or of a column of air having the uniform density D', and equal
in weight to the mercurial column       then,  =l D'; and

librio will have more acquired heat than the              ImaSS
when it comes to    occupy  the same place; and the difference
will be more considerable when the velocity is greater. Now
the pressures being the same in both cases, it follows that, in
 the former case when more heat is acquired, the elasticity,
 which in a state of rest balances the external pressure, will be
 greater than the elasticity in the latter case. . Wherefore the

author has ascertained             be the case, and that the laws which
                                         to
govern this peculiar action are               regular, that there can re

98            On the Magnetism developed by Rotation.
in developing signs of magnetism were, copper, zinc, silver,
tin, lead, antimony, mercury, gold, bismuth, and carbon in
that peculiar metalloidal state in which it is precipitated from
carburetted hydrogen in gas works.      In the case of mercury,
the rigorous absence of iron was secured.       In other bodies,
such as sulphuric acid, rosin, glass, and other non-conductors,
or imperfect conductors of electricity, no positive evidence of
magnetism was obtained.
   The comparative intensities of action of these bodies were
next numerically determined by two different methods, viz.,
by observing the deviation of the compass over revolving
plates of great size cast to one pattern, and by the times of ro
tation of a neutralized system of magnets suspended over them;
and it is curious that the two methods, though they assigned
the same order to the remaining bodies, uniformly gave op
posite results in the cases of zinc and copper, placing them
constantly above or below each other according to the mode
of observation employed.
   Our authors next investigated the effect of solution of con
tinuity on the various metals: in the course of which M. Arago's
results of the diminution of effect by division of the metallic
plates used were verified; and the further curious fact ascer
tained, that re-establishing the metallic contact with other
metals restores the force, either wholly or in great measure;
and that even when the metal used for soldering has, in itself,
but a very feeble magnetic power, thus affording a power of
magnifying weak degrees of magnetism. The law of diminu
tion of the force by increase of distance was next investigated.
It appears to follow no constant progression according to a
fixed power of the distance, but to vary between the square
and the cube.
   The remainder of this paper was devoted to some able and
elaborate reasoning on the facts detailed.—The authors con

                       extremely transient. The experiment was
                      to
varied    by combining the revolving magnets differently, and
the results were stated.
   The next experiments                       of

                                             and magnets increases.
It seems      follow from these experiments, that when thick
             to                                                                                   a

and inversely         the fourth power       the distance; but that
when magnets         considerable size are made       revolve under                to
thin copper discs, the diminution follows more nearly the
ratio   of the inverse square         the distance,    of
                                                        between the                    or

exact power.
   The author then investigated the law          force when copper          of
discs  of different  weights  are set    rotation,  which, for small

  plate; on causing the spindle and plate to revolve, the needle
  was considerably deflected, and more and more as the velocity
  was increased; so that, when the plate was put into rapid       ro
  tation, the needle also began, after a few vibrations, to re
  volve, and at length with considerable velocity.
     “1. In order to repeat this experiment, I connected the
 wheel of my turning lathe with a vertical spindle, which could I
 make revolve forty-five times per second; and on this placed I
  a thin copper plate, about six inches in diameter, and over
  this a needle about five inches long, shut up in a close box,
 about one inch, or rather less, above the plate. When putting
  the lathe in motion,   I  found it to deflect the needle about five
 points, the deflection being always in the same direction as
 the motion of the plate, but we could not cause it to revolve.
 The needle was, therefore, partly neutralized by a bar mag
 net, and the experiment repeated.         We then very soon ob
 tained a considerable     rotatory motion in the needle; and, by
 using a larger and heavier plate, the same was produced after
 wards without neutralizing the needle.
                                                                      |
     “2. Another experiment, which was mentioned as one of
                             I
 M. Arago's, and which repeated, was, by interposing a plate
 of iron between the copper plate and the needle. In this case,
 no effect could be produced on the needle by the rotation of
 the copper plate, the iron clearly intercepting the action.
                                               I
      “3. The only other experiment that am aware of as ori
 ginating with M. Arago, at least that        I   repeated, was the
 rotation of a  plate cut into radii like a star,  which was said, as
 I  understood, to produce no effect: this, however, was not the
 case in my experiments,      -it certainly produced a less effect,
but,   I think, not less than might have been anticipated, from
 the quantity of copper thus taken away.
          I
     “4. now tried a zinc plate instead of a copper plate, and
the effect was nearly the same as before, but a little less.
     “5. An iron plate was now substituted, and the effect was
considerably greater than with the copper plate.
     “6. The copper plate was again replaced, and a brass needle
placed in the box.       Some motion was obtained, but it was
                           I
very equivocal, so that cannot venture to say that it was cer
tainly due to the rotation.
    “T. A heavy horse-shoe magnet was now suspended by a
line from the ceiling; and it was put in rotation by the revo
lution of the copper plate, a paper screen having been first
interposed between them.
    “8. One copper plate was suspended over another, but no
motion was obtained; and the same took place when the cop
per plate was suspended over an iron one.

copper plate, was fixed horizontally to the upright spindle;
and being made to revolve, the plate very soon acquired ro
tation. A paper screen was, in this, as in the preceding ex
periments, interposed between the plate and magnet.

the lathe, so as to cause it to revolve vertically, and the needle
placed near to        but     it;

every possible way the n contemporaneous equations require.
   It should be observed, that one of the two above methods
may under certain very simple circumstances give a resulting
equation of identity, in which i<U+017F> a eliminates itself; but I be
lieve this can never happen with both methods at the same
time. We may likewise add, that though no constants or sym

     Ishall now exemplify the above results with two or three
cases, which will give me an opportunity of correcting an                                                        in

   Suppose fir is a particular solution of any functional equa

for Q, a in the given equation, the properties of this equation
will restrict the unlimited generality of 2 just as much as the
complete solution requires.    For example, in the equation

  Edinburgh, July 12, 1825.                WM. GALBRAITH.
  The velocity of sound transmitted through the atmosphere
has lately attracted some attention. The results deduced from
experiments presented several discrepancies which it was de
sirable to remove. This could only be accomplished by new
and varied series of experiments, under a variety of circum
stances and in different climates.    Among the early investi
gators of this problem, the effect of barometric pressure, tem
                                                                                      be to,
perature, and moisture was not sufficiently attended        and
consequently their theoretical conclusions could only      con
sidered     rude approximations.

and       by
          several considerations relative         the nature and con
                                                                to

                                                the conclusion       Der             of
ham; namely, that sound moved                 the rate at   1142 feet          of              in
a   second           of
                   time.    He immediately adds, however, that

mercury is heavier than air be taken, then v = 202.88 W p

   Now, since in general terms v = n w p, the variation of v
for a change of pressure is as                   vy

nearly; and for one inch, 8v = 0.092.1 m. But n = 202.88 ;
therefore 8 v = 0.092.1 x 202.88 = 18.8 feet, .... (5) for one
inch of the barometer, at about its mean state.
   Again, since according to the continental mathematicians
w = c V1+0-00375t, t being the temperature by the centi
grade thermometer above zero;
   This becomes by Fahr. above 32°, v = c WI-Forooz.083-
or v = c (1 + 0-001042 t) = c + 0-001042 ct.          -
   But c = 333-44   metres, of 32809 feet  each,   or 1094 feet.
   Hence v = 1094 + 1-14 t ; and therefore the variation de
pending upon the change of temperature is 1-14 t . . . . (6)*

 114                  Mr. Galbraith             on the Velocity           of Sound.
      On considering the results obtained from this comparison,
 it  may be noticed that the greatest deviation of the formula
 from observation is about 14 feet, sometimes in excess and
 sometimes in defect.        To what cause to attribute this it is at
 present difficult to say.
    Future observation will perhaps show how much ought to
 be attributed to the formula, to the error of observation, to the
 effects of wind, and to the variable nature and constitution of
 the atmosphere, which our best instruments are yet unable to
 detect.    This is perhaps countenanced by a comparison of
 the September and October observations, in which the pres
 sure, temperature, and moisture are very nearly the same; yet
 the velocities differ no less than 24 feet, while the results by
 the formula differ only about half a foot *.
    This is the season at which the monsoons change their                                             di
rection: and as from an examination of the plan of the grounds
accompanying the observations, it may be inferred that the
wind in the one case tended to augment the apparent velocity
of sound, while in the other it tended to diminish             we may                     it,
reasonably conclude that this                great degree the cause
                                                     is

                                     It   is             February and      as   in
March the same circumstances             occur,   with nearly the same
effects, though          somewhat slighter degree.
                            in      a
    Mr. Goldingham's allowances for pressure and moisture
differ considerably from those stated here, though that for
temperature        nearly the same.

    Mr. Herschel was aware that to deduce the differential
formulae in the usual way had very much the appearance of
“an inductive process:” and to evade the difficulty he resorts
to a method equally inductive—“the calculus of generating
functions *.” In the proof by this method, were no other                                                       in
ductive principle involved, there is yet the binomial theorem.
But there are other inductions mingled up in the investiga
tion: for instance, the assumption of a series to represent the
development of pt; which series, especially as following a re
gular and successively dependent law, we do not know to be
always possible.         It is true Mr. Herschel attempts to parry
this objection, by assuming the series as the “definition” of
the function pt. but even in this view, except considered as
induction, it is inadmissible; for how can we define any func
tion, except by stating some constantly observed quality or
circumstance belonging to                        it,
                                       and which may serve             dis                           as   a

XVI.    Chemical Eramination of some Antiquities found in the
 Vicinity of Brool, on the Rhine. By Dr. Rudolph BRANDEs.
      HE   importance of the vicinity of Brool to the antiquarian
     is  sufficiently  known, as well as the great discoveries made
there    by  the  diligence of M. Dorow. It was through his
kindness that I obtained the antiquities considered in this me
moir, with the request to analyse them as speedily as possible;
a request, however, which                  I
                                 have not been able to fulfill until
now.
        I. A Fragment of Roman Glass found near Brool.
    The invention of glass is known to be very ancient; never
 theless few antique remains of it have come down to us, or
 have been analysed.
    Although the art of manufacturing glass was not carried to
 that degree of perfection among the ancients to which it has
 been brought in our days, still in some branches of it they
 had gone very far, as has been sufficiently shown by the learned
 investigations of Winkelmann.
    The piece of glass which I obtained from M. Dorow was
a fragment of a round vase, and weighed about 10 grains. Its
colour was of a milky-white with a very blueish cast. A pel
licle of a brilliant gold-colour covered         exterior, andits   part                in
its
                                                                                              it of
     interior surface. This had            much the  so  appearance
gilding, that without        achemical trial one would have taken
to    begold; but shall show below that this was not the case.

The    long period       time during which the glass had been ex

somewhat resisted the destructive effects that had acted upon
the rest, being       still. Wherever the glass was covered with

metallic pellicle which was on the inside. This shows that the
cause of this tarnish was the same as that which acts upon
glass long exposed to the weather, such as in old church win
dows for instance; and which has a similar appearance. How
ever, to convince myself completely of the absence of gold,                                          I
heated as many as possible of the shining glass leaves in nitric
acid, by which process the gold-coloured covering entirely dis
appeared, and the leaves remained without colour.
   In order to find out the component parts of the glass, sub                              I
mitted it to the following process:
   a) A portion of the glass was reduced to a powder and
boiled in nitric acid, the liquor filtered off and saturated with
ammonia, which threw down a precipitate that was again dis
solved in nitric acid, and which gave no precipitate with sul
phuretted hydrogen.        Nor did sulphuric or muriatic acid pro
duce any turbidity in                it:
                                but when that part          the solution of
which had been treated with         sulphuretted     hydrogen    was sa
turated with ammonia,          blackish-green precipitate was pro
                                     a
duced, which, after being again boiled with nitric acid and
mixed with ammonia, gave whitish precipitate, which became
                                           a
browner      byexposure      the air. This was again dissolved
                                 to                                                              in
nitric  acid, the  product   neutralized and mixed with benzoate
of potash, which gave         precipitate                   of
                                                    brownish-white:

    e) The residue treated with potash in (d) had left some
 traces of a reddish powder and of a few shining metallic leaves,
 of the appearance of mica. This residue was heated with three
 drops of nitric acid and a little water; by which the reddish
    wder was dissolved, but the metallic leaves still remained.
 The solution of nitric acid was poured off, neutralized with a
little ammonia, and a black turbidity was imparted to it by a
current of sulphuretted hydrogen.        It is therefore probable
that the reddish powder was a little more red-lead. The re

sealing-wax consisted for the most part of common wax, to
which a little gum and turpentine had been added, and which
seemed to have been coloured principally by red-lead; con
taining besides a few leaves of gold, which seemed to have been
added to enhance the beauty of the wax, although in very
small proportion.

Baden. Among these were, on a piece of slag
of a furnace, several small cubic crystals of a middle tint be
tween gold-yellow and copper-red, and with a strong metallic
lustre. Some of them exhibited striae parallel to the sides of
the cube, and seemed to be of a darker hue. They were very
hard, scratching glass very strongly, and rock-crystal visibly;
but at the same time so brittle that the blow of a hammer re
duced them to powder.     Owing to the very small quantity in
 my possession,     I
                   could not determine their specific gravity.

This reaction became more apparent when the melted pearl
was touched with nitre. Acids had no effect on these crv

treated, left them untouched.

ticles of iron attached to them, whilst the crystals preserved

with nitre, they were oxidated.              I
                                        took advantage of this cir
cumstance, in order to procure a solution of the oxide, by
melting a small quantity of the crystals (which had been pre
viously freed as much as possible from every particle of iron
by means of aqua regia) with nitre, borax, and a little soda,
and dissolving the mass in muriatic acid. The solution was
colourless, and deposited, whilst boiling, white flakes. Caustic
and carbonated alkalies gave a white precipitate; triple prus
siate of potash with a little excess of acid, a dirty-green pre
cipitate, which, when ammonia was poured over                became              it,
white; tincture       galls, copious precipitate
                     of         a                     dark  orange    of
colour; oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, arseniate potash, white      of a
precipitates; metallic zinc produced blueish-black flakes, which,
on    freeing them from the air-bubbles with which they were
covered, became white. Hydrosulphuret-           potash gave bot

through the continent of Africa to Senegal and Egypt. The
species which constitute this small group have as yet not been
clearly defined; and by several ornithologists of the first emi
mence the adult and the young bird are described with different
denominations. Although in the Systematic Description of                             Ja
vanese Birds the Bubut has been enumerated as a distinct spe
cies, a re-examination of the various specimensin our collection,
and a comparison of the varieties in size and external marks
with the figures of Buffon and Le Vaillant, have induced me,
at least for the present, to unite it with the Centropus Philip
pensis of Cuvier. It tends to confirm the near relation which
exists between the species composing the small group above
mentioned *; their note has suggested nearly the same name
in the most distant countries: it is Bubut with the Javanese;
Houhou in Egypt; and Toulou in Madagascar.            They like
wise resemble each other in their manners and their food. In
the islands of the Indian Archipelago, as well as in Egypt,
they are seldom seen in forests, but frequent low bushes; they
live solitary, or in single pairs, and they feed chiefly on                           lo
custs. Their external covering is similar, both regarding the
distribution of colours and the particular properties of the
plumage. The feathers of the head, neck, back, breast, ab
domen, and tail, have a very dark blue tint inclining to black,
with a strong gloss, which is purple on the summit of the head
and neck, yellowish-green with a metallic lustre on the tail,
and more uniform and dark underneath.              But it varies in
        º:
different individuals according to their age, and according to
 the light to which they are exposed.        A peculiar property of
 the            covering the head and neck, which belongs to                             all
 Centropi, shows itself more strongly        the group which com
                                                      in
prises the Bubut. The plumes are very rough and rigid, and
 the barbs are separated and again subdivided, constituting,
 according        Illiger, decompound plumes with bristly late
                      to
 ral filaments. The tail gradated, and consists

     It is                                   I
          contended, and as believe most truly, that the present
means for the acquisition of knowledge, which various ad
mirable institutions afford to the most intelligent classes of
 artisans, are likely to produce a more favourable change in the
 state of society than any thing hitherto proposed with a view
 to enlarge the usefulness of a most valuable class of men: if
 this be so, there can be no reason why such advantages should
be withheld from the miner; unless it can be shown that it will
do his art no service, or that the persons who are to be taught
are incapable or unworthy of such education.
    On both these points                 I
                                  may first observe, that they seem to
have been settled         long ago  by the example of the Germans
and Hungarians, who have, until lately, been deemed, and
perhaps justly, the masters of the art. Their colleges of Frey
berg and Schemnitz have been long in existence, and have
always been organized for, and devoted to, the purposes                  re                       I

  advantages, the door of improvement yet remains in a manner
  closed: they hear indistinctly of the progress of others, but,
  not having the means of judging rightly, they are too apt
  to fence themselves in with prejudice and conceit, and to resist
 what has not originated with themselves. Nothing, in my mind,

  as a School of Mining, where young men, while they could
  continue their practice underground, might hear those sciences
  explained which would be most useful to them, and might de
  vote some of the spare hours which a miner's life affords, to
  seeing and comparing the practice of others in a place where
  their art has reached the greatest perfection.

now greater than          any former period; our deep mines are
                              at
most extensively worked, from the increased call for the me
tals they produce, and the facility with which capital                    ob       is

machinery, before unnecessary, must be applied and depended
upon. The mines of distant countries are passing into the
hands of English possessors, and they must rely more or less
for their success upon the talents of the agents they employ.
A School of Mines will not only be the means of instructing
such agents, but it will be a place where character will be de
            and as it were put upon record;—it will be a point
to look to by those who require good agents, and it would in

                 of a School of Mines in Cornwall.              148
casion for the knowledge of the principles which ought to-
guide their practice.
   The art of mining the pupils would be supposed to under
stand from their previous practical education and habits; but
if a proper teacher could be found, to describe and point out'
the reasons for established practices, to direct attention to such
matters as may call for improvement, and generally to sum up
the application of the elementary studies to the art itself, it
would be most desirable to have such an one. Probably a
professor of this sort duly qualified could, at present, be found
                      j
with difficulty, but the institution itself might very
                                                     -    probably
supply one at no very distant period.
   2. The class of persons who     I propose should receive be
nefit from such an institution would be principally those young
men who, after having by actual labour qualified themselves to
understand the practice, might be desirous of understanding
what it is proposed to teach, and who might thus more per
fectly qualify themselves for the important task of managing
mines, or for becoming agents; to which duty a certain num
ber are continually            I  would not, however, be under
stood to draw an exclusive distinction in this respect; but,
while the school is intended principally for miners,       I would
certainly have it open to artisans who work in other branches,
and particularly in those which are useful to mining.
                                                                   <U+017F>
   It is probable that a class of pupils of somewhat higher rank
might desire to avail themselves of instruction, fitted not only
to such as may wish to understand mining, but to those who
follow other occupations in which the sciences taught might
be usefully applied.
   Such students might be admitted, but under special provi
sions that the great object of the institution be not impeded or-
weakened in its effect.
   I would propose that each miner and artisan should pay a
small sum for each course of lectures, and be permitted to
choose which he would attend.                      -   -
   Students of a higher class should pay at least so much as
that they should be considered to be under no obligation to
the funds of the institution.
   As the periods of labour of the working miner are not very
long, and so regulated as often to afford them considerable
time during the day, the lectures might be regulated so as to
be convenient for their attendance, without much interruption
                                                                     -
to their necessary duties.
   3. The Professors.-Much of the success of the plan must
doubtless depend on the choice of teachers; and though the
branches of learning seem to be varied, yet          I cannot help
          -                                                thinking

 thinking that a     deal might be accomplished by a small
 number of professors duly qualified. I have arranged under
 one head, in the description of the three classes of instruction,
 those branches of science which are not unusually attended to
 by the same person; I think, therefore, that with three pro
 fessors the institution would be tolerably perfect, and, if funds
 cannot be found for so many,                           I
                                           even think that, two would
 produce a most beneficial effect.
    4. The proper situation for a School of Mines must neces
 sarily be where mines are most numerous and extensive, where
 the greatest variety and the largest quantity of mineral pro
 ducts are raised, where veins are most perfectly traced and
 explored, where the difficulties attendant on mining most fre
 quently occur, and, where they are overcome by the largest
 application of the power of machinery, and by the adoption of
 varied contrivance and skilful device. No part of England
 that      I
          know of presents these requisites in an equal degree
 with that of the mining district of Gwennap and the surround
 ing country, Thomas's map of which may be referred to as
 confirming this opinion.        The town of Redruth, nearly in the
 centre of this    map,         think,
                                    is,

   The third class, from whom should hope some help might
be expected, would be that large number of enlightened indi
viduals who are ready to promote any rational                    for the
extension of scientific     knowledge,    and  particularly  those who
take part in the studies to which the art of mining contributes,
or to which it is allied. If regular contributions cannot be
relied upon to any great extent from such, or ought not per
                                I
haps to be expected, yet may be permitted to remind them
that in other ways their assistance may be most usefully ex
tended to the institution; donations of books, of apparatus,
of specimens in various departments, may be given, and in
many instances important advice and information.
   There is another class of persons,          and a most numerous
and     important   one, who   perhaps    might   not think the school
unworthy their support,         I mean the smelters of England, and
                                              º
those who are connected with the various processes of metal
lurgy for which the country is so celebrated.          I have proposed
that in the course of instruction the      principles   upon  which the
assay, the reduction, and the refining of metals depend should
be taught, and the different processes elucidated; and it will
only depend upon the means afforded how far this may be ex
tended or how beneficially it may be
    I   trust I might look to the proprietors of our great copper
smelting works, to the lead and tin smelters, and to many
others, for some permanent assistance.

        will proceed to show that from such extensive sources an
income sufficient for the purpose may be derived without be
       burdensome to any; and        I                            I

 calculate the necessary income, because         I hope the sum which
may be requisite to create the establishment would be readily
given in the first instance in the way of donations.

154       New Comet.—Pastoff on the Solar Spots and Clouds.
Brisbane, the merit of re-discovering the remarkable comet of
Encke has been ascribed to Mr. Dunlop. On the authority of
that paper, and of a private letter from Sir Thomas Brisbane,
we afterwards contradicted a statement of Baron Von Zach,
who attributed the discovery to Mr. Rumker. We have re
ceived, however, recent letters both from Sir Thomas and Mr.
Dunlop, in which      the merit    all

observed several interesting phaenomena relative          the spots                  to
 on   its
       surface, their penumbrae, and the phosphoric clouds. He
observes, that the penumbrae                        of
                                  the spots resemble mass       the                  a     of
empty eggs        of
                 the Bombia   neustria, which surround the black
spots concentrically and with different breadths.      These appa
rent eggs are contiguous and,         were, agglomerated the one
                                                     as   it

                                                                                           *

they are near the margin of the sun; and he thinks that it is
probably these phosphoric clouds which, in the interval of
some hours only, form this great variety of spots. On the 1st
December 1823, M. Brioschi of Naples observed a large spot
equal to 1; our globe, surrounded with an irregular and
branching elevation, into which thereseemed to be precipitating
great masses of fire. The whole surface of the sun he saw
like an ocean on fire agitated by a storm. M. Pastorff saw
this same spot on the same day, when the phosphoric clouds
were in great motion; but though he has often seen the agi
tation of the phosphoric clouds much greater, he did not con
sider it as resembling an ocean on fire. Almost always, when
the spots approach      a.margin of the sun's disk, they divide
themselves into several groups, or they re-unite if they have
been previously subdivided. Very near the margin, the spots
appear totally altered, and they almost always appear as if
they were dissolved and changed into luminous clouds, though
that dissolution is only apparent; for it is quite evident that,
in proportion as these spots approach the margin of the disk,
the penumbra or the nebulosity which encircles them, covers
them more and more till they totally disappear. There is then
only seen the luminous nebulosity, which is sometimes sur
rounded with phosphoric clouds. The sun always appeared
more bright at    its
                    centre than towards     edge.—Edin. Journ.

DR. GRANT on THE ExistENCE of THE PANCREAS IN SOME SPE
 CIES OF THE CUTTLE-FISH TRIBE, AND IN THE DORIS ARGO.
  Dr. Grant     lately read   apaper before the Wernerian Society
on    certain glandular organs       the Loligo sagittata Lam., the
                                       of

                                          the Frith     Forth. These
glands are situate      atthe lower and fore part       the liver, are
two   in number, consist      ofnumerous distinct lobes,              of
                                                                   rose   a
red colour, and were formerly considered                 as
                                                      the ovarium                of
this animal.    It  appears, however, that they surround the two
biliary canals during their whole course from the liver              the   to
spiral stomach, and communicate freely with the interior                         of
these canals     by  numerous small ducts.         They are always
present, and equally developed,            the male and female, and
                                             in

fills these glandular lobes       in   its
                                      passage. From the connexion
of  these  glands  with the   biliary  system, Dr. Grant considers

 nature of the glandular vermiform appendix opening into the
 stomach of several gasteropodous mollusca, as the Aplysia,

 caecum to the    biliary  system and alimentary canal of these
 animals, and from                         its

 and also two preventive capstans, commenced working, each
 propelled by twenty-four men. To preserve an equanimity
 [equability?] in the rotatory evolutions of the two principal cap
 stans, a fifer played several enlivening tunes, to keep the men re
 gular in their steps; for which purpose they had been previously
 trained. The chain rose majestically, and the gratifying sight
 was enthusiastically enjoyed by each individual present. At fifty
 minutes after four o'clock, the final bolt was fixed, which com
 pleted the whole line of chain. From the casting off of the raft,
 to the uniting of the chain, took up only two hours and twenty
  minutes.
    This splendid specimen of British architecture will be a
 lasting monument to the discernment of the present govern
 ment, for having called into requisition the transcendent talents
 of Mr. Telford, who was present on the occasion.
    Upon the completion of the chain, three of the workmen
had the temerity to pass along the upper surface of the chain,
 which forms an inverted curvature of 580 feet. The versed
              *.
 sine of the arch is 43 feet.
    The following is a summary account of the dimensions of
 the bridge           extreme length of the chain, from the fasten
ings in the rocks, is about 1600 feet. The height of the road
 way from high-water line is 100 feet. Each of the seven small,
 piers, from high-water line to the spring of the arches, is 65
 feet.   The span of each arch is 52 feet. Each of the two sus
pending piers is 52 feet above the road. The road on the
bridge consists of two carriage-ways, of 12 feet each, with a
footpath, of 4 feet, in the centre. The carriage-roads pass
through two arches, in the suspending piers, of the width of
9 feet, by 15 feet in height to the spring of the arches. . To
counteract the contraction and expansion of the iron, from
the effect of the change of the temperature in winter and
summer, a set of rollers are placed under cast-iron saddles,
on the top of the suspending piers, where the chains rest.
The vertical rods, an inch square, suspended from the chains,
support the slippers for the flooring of the road-way, the rods
being placed 5 feet from each other. The chains, 16 in num
ber, contain 5 bars each; length of the bar 9 feet 9 inches;
width 3 inches by 1 inch square, with 6 connecting lengths at
each joint 1 foot 6 inches by 10 inches, and 1 inch square,
secured by two bolts at each joint, each bolt weighing about
fifty-six pounds. The total number of bars, in the cross sec
tion of the chains, is eighty.
    A second chain was drawn over on Thursday morning, the
28th ; and there are fourteen other chains in readiness to
be drawn over when the tide will serve, which will complete
the line of suspension.—-Edin. Journ. of -Science.

from near Bustletown, Pennsylvania, was tried with the blow
pipe. The globules were formed with difficulty, probably
owing to      its

 and finger, in the palm of my hand.         Although they were in
 the focus for nearly  half an  hour,  they did not melt, diappear,
or alter their form; it appeared, however, on examining the
gas, that they had given up a part of their substance to the
 oxygen, for carbonic acid was formed which gave a decided
precipitate with lime-water.”
    That this experiment is equivocal appears certain, as parti
cles of the support might have been attached to the globules;
for, from my own observations, I found that in a great num
ber of instances, some of the white globules at É. point of
junction with their support had small dark particles attached
to them; and when the surface from which they were detached
was magnetic, they were attracted by the magnet when it was
presented to those parts:             I
                                could not disengage those particles
by rubbing the globules with my fingers against one another.
 It is very evident that, as the globules underwent no change
(unless a reduction of volume, which is not mentioned), as the
description clearly shows, the carbonic acid obtained might
have been produced by the combustion of portions of the sup
port adhering to them externally, and penetrating them to a
certain extent.                                                    -
    In the experiment detailed in vol. v. p. 363, of the same
Journal, the carbonic acid found probably had a similar ori
gin, and the disappearance of the globules may have been
 owing to their incorporating themselves with the piece of brick
 upon which they were placed, as the brick was vitrified at the
 point where they were placed.
    Professor Silliman seems disposed to lay great stress on the
 loss in my examination of the globule sent by Dr. Macneven.

      the moon's parallax, inasmuch as that the object producing
      it (viz. the earth) would, if viewed from the moon, appear
     bounded by a curve, though of less convexity, as the parallax
    |.
     increases; hence the augmentation could not amount to a mi
     nute, although the parallax were increased to any extent: it
     may therefore, as before observed, be considered a constant
-                  or only affected by the variation of the sun's semi
        lameter.
          Let us now consider the reason why the moon when totally
     eclipsed is on some occasions entirely invisible, while on other
     occasions, she appears considerably illumined with a sort of
     ruddy light. The cause usually assigned for this variation is
     the different distances of the moon from the earth: but               can    I
     affirm from     my  own   experience    that this solution is unsatis
     factory, having seen the eclipsed portion of the moon very                        di
     stinctly both when she was near her apogee and her perigee.
    I    apprehend that this variation will be found to depend entirely
     on them oon's declination; and that she will be always very
     visible when near the equator, and quite invisible when near
    either of the tropics.       To explain the cause of this, let us                  in
    quire what appearance a lunar eclipse would present to a
    spectator in the moon. This lunarian observer would evi
    dently have a total solar eclipse; and, on directing his view to
     wards the place of the sun, he would see nothing but a                            lu
    minous ring nearly two degrees in diameter, but so very slen
    der as probably not to exceed a minute in thickness: this ring
    would be the effect of the earth's atmosphere refracting the
    rays of the sun; and      its degree      brightness would,
                                               of                   imagine,
                                                                        I
    be less than that of the sun when             the horizon. Now

    moon were vertically over the earth's equator, the two poles
    would be     in  the circumference         of
                                              the earth's disc, and the                lu
    minous ring would         bybe
                                   vastly brighter      those parts conti
                                                           in
    guous   to    the poles,      reason       of
                                               the great refraction        the    of
    earth's atmosphere       in the polar regions:           if,   on
                                                              the contrary,
    the moon were     in   the tropic, one       of
                                                the poles would        turnedbe
    away from the moon, and the other would fall considerably
    within the disc;    so   that the luminous ring would not appear
    particularly bright     in  any part, and therefore would not                      il
    lumine the moon sufficiently           render her visible
                                       it to
                                                                        at

    If   this solution be   admitted,     follows that the  visibility     the    of
    moon   in   eclipses depends     on the position         of
                                                          the lunar nodes,
    the moon being always most visible when the nodes coincide
    with the equinoctial points, and least visible when they are                       in
    the solstitial points. The eclipse          June 10, 1816, was

     To     the     Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
            Sir,
            R. DAVIES's                    remarks in your last Number on some                                  of
               Mr. Herapath's mathematical writings are tinctured
 with so much good feeling, that   cannot believe the incorrectI
 views he has given  of Mr. H.’s demonstration of the binomial
 theorem could be occasioned by any thing but haste or mis
 conception.   It is however a fact, that his statement of Mr.
 Herapath's demonstration is by no means just; and as         his                                       all
 other observations are founded     this,   trust you will allow   on            I
 me    small space

  Serve.
          After slightly commenting                           on   Mr. Herapath’s proof for po
 sitive integers, which      too much       the axiomatic kind
                                           is                       of

     found his inferences; viz. that because       was true when      and         it                  r
     were integers,       must     true when they are fractions, and

stance produced 5-6 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, at a
temperature of 60°, and pressure 29.98 inches; and 0:58 grain
of water were collected. The 5-6 cubic inches of gas are
equivalent to 0-71 1704 grain of carbon by calculation, and
the 0:58 grain of water to 0.064444 of hydrogen.

far removed from 12, or two proportionals.

   Sulphuric acid acted much more powerfully upon this sub
stance than upon the bi-carburet: great heat was evolved,
much discolouration occasioned, and             separation took place    a
into  a thick black acid, and         yellow lighter liquid, resisting

but as the substance must have contained much bi-carburet
of hydrogen, it is evident that, if in a pure state, the carbon
would fall far short of the above quantity, and the compound
would approximate of course to a simple carburet of hydro

pale blue flame, and seems to be a product of too rapid action.
Great heat is produced during the action; no sulphurous acid
is formed; the acid is much blackened, has a peculiar odour,
and upon dilution generally becomes turbid, but no gas is
evolved.     A permanent compound of the acid with carbon
and hydrogen is produced, and enters as before mentioned
into combination with bases.
    A mixture of 2 volumes of this vapour with 14 volumes of
pure oxygen was made, and a portion detonated in an eudio
meter tube.     8:8 volumes of the mixture diminished by the
spark to 5:7 volumes, and these by solution of potash to 1-4
volume, which were oxygen.          Hence 7-4 volumes had been
consumed, consisting of

    This is nearly as if 1 volume of the vapour or gas had re
quired 6 volumes of oxygen, had consumed 4 of them in pro
ducing 4 of carbonic acid gas, and had occupied the other
2 by 4 of hydrogen to form water. Upon which view, 4 vo
lumes or proportionals of hydrogen = 4, are combined with
 4 proportionals of carbon = 24, to form one volume of the
 vapour, the specific gravity of which would therefore be 28.
 Now this is but little removed from the actual specific gravity
 obtained by the preceding experiments; and knowing that this
 vapour must contain small portions of other substances in so
 lution, there appears no reason to doubt that, if obtained pure,
 it would be found thus constituted.                          -
    As the  proportions  of the elements in this  vapour    appear to
 be the same as in olefiant gas, it became interesting to ascer
 tain whether chlorine had the same action upon it as on the
 latter body.   Chlorine and the vapour were therefore mixed
  i.
 in an exhausted retort: rapid combination took place, much
 heat was evolved, and a liquor produced resembling hydro
  chloride of carbon, or the substance obtained by the same
  process from olefiant gas. It was transparent, colourless, and
  heavier than water. It had the same sweet taste, but ac
  companied by an after aromatic bitterness, very persistent.
  Further, it was composed of nearly equal volumes of the va
   our and chlorine: it could not therefore be the same as the
                  of carbon from olefiant gas, since it contained
  twice as much carbon and hydrogen.        It was therefore treated
  with excess of chlorine in  sun-light:  action slowly took place,
                                                                more

more chlorine combined with the substance, muriatic acid was
formed, and ultimately a fluid tenacious triple compound of
chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen was obtained; but no chlo
ride of carbon. This is a remarkable circumstance, and as
sists in showing that though the elements are the same, and
in the same proportions as in olefiant gas, they are in a very
different state of combination.

 .   In   some guns the stroke          of the cock, which is in the shape
 of a    hammer,       falls   immediately       on the fulminating powder
 strewed in the above recess.               In order to protect the powder
 from   wet,   small balls of it were covered over with wax, and
 placed sometimes in the conical recess, and at others fixed to
 the cock itself.        In both instances the ball was kindled in the
 recess just mentioned, by means of the percussion.

and pour six drachms (measure) of pure nitric acid on the
mercury: this I place in a stand over a spirit-lamp, and make
it boil, till the quicksilver is taken up by the acid;—when
nearly cool, I pour it on an ounce (measure) of alcohol in an
other flask: sometimes immediate effervescence ensues, with
the extrication of nitrous aether; and often I have been obliged
to place the mixture over the lamp, till a white fume begins
to rise, when the effervescence follows. I suffer the process
to continue (removing the lamp) till the fumes assume a red
dish hue: when I pour water into the flask, and the powder

 the water is poured off, so as to free the substance as much as
 possible from the acid; and then I pour it on a piece of                 fil
 tering paper, and place the powder in an airy room to dry.
 It should be kept in a corked (not stoppered) bottle.”
      For the filling of the caps he makes use of an ivory pin,
 which has a scoop at one end for the purpose of receiving the
 powder, and at the other is cut flat. With it he puts in as
 much fulminating mercury as will cover the bottom: he then
 dips the flat end into a strong tincture of benzoin, and rubs
 this substance gently about the case; by which means the pow
 der is set fast and covered as with a varnish.                       -
     Professor Schweigger, speaking of these kinds of experi
 ments in his chemical lectures, observed on the practicability
 of kindling gunpowder by the admixture of other substances,
as has been shown in a criminal investigation that took place
                                                                      -
at Munich a few years ago. .
     A box filled with gunpowder was sent to an individual pro
vided with fulminating papers, which were to inflame on the box
being opened. Fortunately, however, the murderous design was
frustrated; for although the papers exploded, they did not
kindle the powder. The assassin was discovered and punished.
M. Gehlen, who had been examined at the trial, was led by
the circumstance to make several experiments for the purpose
of kindling gunpowder by means of Brugnatelli's fulminating
                   in all
silver, but they        failed.                      -
  It    seems that     England, too, difficulties had been found           in
igniting gunpowder with fulminating mercury; for Mr. Wright
observes,  “If     any one doubts the practicability      firing gun
                                                          of

gas companies united, or, so to speak, leagued together, against
this too dangerous competitor.
    Oil gas possesses some characteristic properties which have
procured it this preference which is given to it in England over
coal gas.    These properties not being generally known,                         I
shal<U+017F> state some of the most remarkable. One single cubic foot
of oil gas gives as much light as 3} cubic feet of coal gas”.
By this important fact the capacity of the gasometers (the most
inconvenient part of the former system of lighting) is now
reduced to less than a third part; the pipes to one third of
their former capacity ; the size of the retorts, stoves, and ap
paratus for purifying and condensing, to one sixth ; the cost
of the apparatus generally, and the expense of keeping them
up, to one third; lastly, the labour to less than the eighth
part of that which it costs in a large establishment to feed
tensity. It will     pº,
with coal gas an equal number of burners of a given
                              be objected to me, that the first
                                                                                in
material, the oil, on the one hand, is a dear and valuable com—
modity, whilst, on the other, coal is much less so in proportion.
I  grant it as regards certain countries; but I will add, that the
daily expenses of a gas establishment are of two natures,—
either permanent, or susceptible of variation according as the
 sale of the gas diminishes or augments: the first are princi
pally composed of the interest on the capital employed, of the
rent of premises, and of the labour, as the labourers cannot be
dismissed during the summer months, who have been                               in
structed at an expense during the winter. Now these perma
nent expenses are inconsiderable in an oil gas work, and, com
paratively, very great in a coal gas establishment. The second
class of expenses includes the raw material, the consumption of
which follows in exact proportion the sale of gas; and on this
head gasworks of each kindenjoy the same advantage. The win
ter season, which brings with it long evenings and revives balls,
concerts, masonic meetings, &c., augments and often increases
tenfold the demand for light. A gas establishment ought to be
prepared to meet those often unexpected calls, all of which
decrease, and partly disappear with spring. Here then is what
happens to the two kinds of lighting establishments, as Dr.
Ricardo has judiciously observed before me: it          that  is,
                                                                the       in
coal gas work the greatexpense remains the same, and the lesser
expense diminishes; whilst        the manufactory
                                  in                        gas the

lesser  expense   continues, and the great expense  decreases,                  or
even ceases,   in equal proportion with the sale     light.  of

 indeed complete and without smoke, but there is a partial de
 struction of light. (This last point is the most delicate in the art
 of lighting, since the phaenomenon is not directly perceptible

we suspect that a part of the inconvenience found by jewellers
to attend the use of coal gas arises from this cause:
    The most formidable of the compounds of sulphur present
in coal gas is sulphuretted hydrogen. The presence of this
   as is hurtful in two ways.         If it escape unburnt, it offends by
 its insupportable odour, and attacks silver and paint with great
readiness. When consumed,                     forms sulphurous and sul

of   which we can     give     decisive answer.

     We are satisfied that sulphuretted hydrogen may                    wholly       be
 removed; for we have repeatedly examined the Edinburgh
 coal gas         by
                 the most delicate tests, without detecting               trace       a
 of    it. Of course we              do

  Philosophie chimique, ou Notions générales sur la physique

                 Preparing for Publication.
  The  following Proposals have been circulated for Publish
ing a Work to be called “Records of Mining.”
      o question has been more frequently asked by those who
are interested in the mines of Great Britain, or who wish
for information on the art of mining, than “What books are
thereupon the subject?” To which no other answer can be given
than that scarcely any exist, and that, of the very few extant,
there are certainly none which describe the mines in their ac
tual state, or which explain the various improvements of later
...
times. That the relations of various matters concerning under
takings so important are devoid of interest is not to be pre
           and, as the eager spirit of speculation which marks
the present period will stimulate inquiry into subjects con
nected with mining, it is probable that a work, having for                                                   its
object    to  supply the want            this department
                                                   in            practical               of
science, would meet with encouragement,                  conducted             if                       in
manner        to   do
                  justice      the subject.
                                 to             France has long had                                          its a
Journal des Mines           and though that country possesses but
                             ;
few mineral      treasures,    yet not only has         periodical publi      a

blishments for mining education; while England, which pro
duces     a greater bulk,         least,

                                                           of
all other countries combined, possesses neither writers on the
subject, nor        school

216                       Notices respecting New Books.
 mination will precede the publication of any facts which may
 be connected with concerns that may seem to invite public
 attention.
    The topics which may be proper for publication are suffi
ciently various, particularly as it is not intended to restrict the
papers within very narrow limits. They may embrace re
ports upon particular mines, statements of the produce of
metals, notices on geological facts, discoveries of ores and mi
nerals, applications of mechanical improvements, and descrip
tions of existing processes of the treatment of ores and of the
 operations of smelting, or other modes of reduction. Extracts
 may be made from foreign or scarce publications which re
 late to mines: the history of mining would furnish some                                            in
 teresting matter; the natural history or geographical de
 scription of countries celebrated for their mines might rea
sonably be admitted; and a fair and careful investigation of
the merits of projected improvements in the machinery or im
plements destined to the service of the mines would usefully
 occupy a part of the work.           Such a publication may thus be
 the channel of communication between our miners in the
different districts of England and those who are directing ope
rations in other parts of the world, by which the improvements
introduced in either region will be made known to the other.
    It is proposed to make this publication useful rather than
popular; it would therefore be limited in bulk, and regulated

    A  new monthly work, in elucidation of that very beautiful
and   interesting  department of science, the Natural History of
the Nests and Eggs of British Birds. The descriptions, which
are calculated for the naturalist as well as general observer,
are intended to comprehend every useful trait of information
respecting the nidification, eggs, and incubation of the nu
merous species of the feathered tribes that inhabit the British
Isles; and are throughout accompanied by a series of ele
gantly-coloured plates, comprehending figures of the eggs of
every species, with their most singular varieties, so far as they
can be correctly ascertained. The whole exclusively executed
from nature, and disposed according to their respective genera,
by E. Donovan, F.L.S. W.S. &c. author of the Natural            Hi
story of British Birds, in ten volumes, and other approved
works.
    The amount of the plates included in each monthly part,
and also the number of the subjects comprised in each plate,
will vary from three to four or five, according to the extent of
the species appertaining to each genus respectively; every
genus being purposely separated from the rest, in order that
the whole, when completed, may be distributed into systematic
order without difficulty.      The descriptions will be also com
prised in the same manner into distinct genera; and an index
of the whole will be given at the conclusion, for the purpose
of a general arrangement.
                  3.
    The subjects will be selected with every attention to that
degree of variety which is expected in a periodical production,
 without being              too promiscuously.   One plate will be"
 constantly devoted to the representation of subjects which
 are of more than usual rarity; another to that class of the
feathered tribes which are commonly denominated “birds of
 sport;” and a third to the warblers and other inhabitants of
 our groves. The indigenous species of our sea coasts, those
 of our desert heaths and plains, and of our Alpine regions,
 will appear occasionally, as well as those which are only acci
 dental visitors in the British Isles,

                                COMETS.
 Nocourseless than four or five comets have been discovered in the
                of the present year, and have engaged the atten
 tion of foreign astronomers.
    The first was discovered by M. Gambart,       at Marseilles, on
 the 19th of May, between the constellations Cassiopea dromeda,

dromeda.            It   was visible              till July 14: and
                                                             was observed by
many astronomers.                     Its elements have been computed by M.
Carlini.
       second was discovered by M. Pons, at Marlia, on the
     The
15th of July, in the constellation Taurus ; and was afterwards
observed by him and M. Inghirami at Florence.
   The third was also discovered by M. Pons, on the 9th of                                            Au
gust, in the constellation Auriga. This is probably the one now
visible near Aldebaran.                                                                                      *
   The fourth, which is the most important of the whole, is the
celebrated Comet of Encke, and appears to have been disco
vered by M. Valtz at Nismes, on the 13th of July, according
to one of the French journals.       However this may be, it was
certainly seen by M. Plana on the 13th of August; and sub
sequently by M. Pons, M. Inghirami, and Mr. South : so
that no doubt can exist as to  - the
                                      re-appearance of this singu
lar body.
   It seems that a fifth was discovered by M. Harding on the
23rd of August; but           motion was    its

Gehlen, and published in 1813, afforded results similar to
each other—very different, however, from the results obtained
by other analysts.     The analyses of several varieties, which
were   subjected   to the rigid examination here noticed,        af                                all
forded results which coincided very nearly with the analyses
of Gehlen.        appears therefore that the accuracy

  A     large buck rabbit was introduced into the cage.                  The

to  walk about the cage. The snake suddenly, but almost im

 proached the ambushed head.              The snake dashed          him like                   at

 in consequence of the difficulty presented by the awkward po
 sition of the rabbit, the dilatation and secretion of lubricating
º
 mucus was excessive.      The serpent first got the fore legs into
 his mouth; he then coiled himself round the rabbit, and ap
 peared to draw out the dead body through his folds; he then
         to dilate his jaws, and, holding the rabbit firmly in a
 coil as a point of resistance, appeared to exercise, at intervals,
 the whole of his anterior muscles in protruding his stretched
jaws and lubricated mouth and throat at first against, and soon
after gradually upon and over his prey.      The curious me
chanism in the jaws of serpents which enables them to swal
low bodies so disproportioned to their apparent bulk is too
well known to need description; but it may be as well to state
that the symphysis of the under jaw was separated in this case,
and in others which                   I
                        have had an opportunity of observing.
When the prey was completely ingulphed, the serpent lay for
a few moments with his dislocated jaws still dropping with the
mucus which had lubricated the parts;–and, at this time, he
looked quite sufficiently disgusting. He then stretched out
his neck, and at the same moment the muscles seemed to
push the prey further downwards.      After a few efforts to re
place the parts, the jaws appeared much the same as they did
previous to the monstrous repast.—?oological Journal.

affairs, a man of great value to this country—able, upright,
scientific, and with a great turn for mining. . He is assisted
by one or two London merchants, who, with him, form a
Board of Management here. The Anglo-Mexican is under
the direction of Mr. Williamson, who resides at Guanaxuato,
a gentleman who, some time since, undertook the working of
the King of Persia's mines, but was obliged to leave that
country in consequence of the treatment he received there.
He is a man of great talent, judgement, and exertion. The
Real del Monte is under the direction of Captain Veitch, an
officer of engineers, and son [brother], of a physician in
London of that name.      He appears to be a very able man,
equal to the trust reposed in him, and is very much esteemed.
Besides these there are three or four other smaller Companies.
The effect of their several labours must be soon felt in this
                       I
country, and guess it will not be many years before it is felt
in Europe.—Courier, Sept. 26.
   Note.—The information contained in the above letter agrees
in the main, we understand, with other accounts of these im
portant undertakings which have from time to time been re
ceived.       It may, however, be calculated to convey an erro
neous   impression      in regard to a circumstance which forms one
of     principal
      its            features, viz. “the different courses        proceed                 of

 motions in Mexico, they experienced a fatal blow by the             in
 terruption to industry produced by internal war".” To what
 a vast extent the application of the steam-engine has raised
 the produce of mines in Cornwall, which had been nearly or
 wholly abandoned for the want of means to keep out the water,
 no one in this country can be at a loss to learn. Of the Mexi
 can system of malacates alluded to by the writer, we have the
 following account by Humboldt:
     “We have already spoken of the truly barbarous custom of
 drawing off the water from the deepest mines, not by means
 of pump apparatus, but by means of bags attached to ropes
 which roll on the cage of a whim. The same bags are used
 in drawing up the water and the ores: they rub against the
 walls of the shafts, and it is very expensive to keep them in
 repair.      At the Real del Monte, for example, these bags only
 last seven or eight days; and they commonly cost five, and
 sometimes seven and eight shillings a piece.            A  bag full of
 water, suspended to the cage of a whim with eight horses
 (malacate doble), weighs 1250 pounds: it is made of two hides
 sewed together.        The bags used for the whims called simple,
 those with four horses (malacates sencillos), are only half the
 size, and are made of one hide.           In general the construction
 of the whims is        extremely  imperfect;   the bad custom also
 prevails of forcing the horses, by which they are made to go
 at far too great a speed.       I  found this speed at the shafts of
 San Ramon at Real del Monte no less than ten feet and a
 half per second; at Guanaxuato, in the mine of Valenciana
from thirteen to fourteen feet; and every where else I found
it more than eight feet.          Don Salvado Sein, Professor of
Natural Philosophy at Mexico, has proved in a very excellent
paper on the rotatory motion of machines, that, notwithstand
ing the extreme lightness of the Mexican horses, they produce
only the maximum of effect on the whims, when exerting a
force of 175 pounds they walk at a pace of from five to six
feet in the second.
     “It is to be hoped that pumps, moved either by horse-engines
 of a better construction, or by water wheels, or by pressure
engines, will at last be introduced in the mines of New Spain.
If   wood and coal, which has only yet been discovered in New
Mexico, should be found sufficiently abundant for employing
the steam-engine, the use of it would be of great advantage
in the inundated mines of Bolaños, as well as in those of
Rayas and Mellado.

feel the indispensable necessity of having plans drawn up by

subterraneous surveyors (geometres). Instead of stopping the
course of the water, and bringing it by the shortest road to
the shaft where the machines are placed, they frequently direct
it to the bottom of the mine, to be afterwards drawn off at a
great expense. In the district of mines of Guanaxuato nearly
two hundred and fifty workmen perished in the space of a few
minutes on the 14th of June 1780; because, not having mea
sured the distance between the works of San Ramon and the
old works of Santo Christo de Burgos, they had imprudently
approached this last mine while carrying on, a drift in that
direction.     The water of which the works of Santo Christo
were full, flowed with impetuosity through this new gallery of
San Ramon into the mine of Valenciana.             Many of the work
men   perished   from the sudden     compression    of the air, which,
in  taking  vent,  threw to   great  distances  pieces  of timber and
large masses of rock. This accident would not have happened,

 contain beds of porphyry, which, with respect to their relative
 antiquity, differ a          deal from one another. The rock
 which forms the roof and the wall of the argentiferous veins
 is a decomposed porphyry, of which the base sometimes ap
 pears clayey, and sometimes analogous to splintery hornstone.
 The presence of hornblende is frequently announced, merely
 by greenish stains intermingled with common and vitreous
 feldspar.    At very great elevations, for example in the beau
 tiful forest of oak and pine of Oyamel, we find porphyries
 with a base of pearl-stone, containing obsidian in layers and
 nodules.
    “What relation exists between these last beds, which several
 distinguished mineralogists consider as volcanic productions,
 and the porphyries of Pachuca, Real del Monte, and Moran,
 in which nature has deposited enormous masses of sulphuret
 of silver and argentiferous pyrites? This problem, which is
 one of the most difficult in geology, will only be resolved when
 a great number of zealous and intelligent travellers shall have
gone over the Mexican Cordilleras, and carefully studied the
 immense variety of porphyries which are destitute of quartz,
 and which abound both in hornblende and vitreous feldspar.
    “The district of mines of Real del Monte does not display—
 as at Freiberg in Saxony, Derbyshire in England, or as in the
 mountains of Zimapan and Tasco in New Spain—a great
number of rich veins of small size, on a small tract of ground.
 It rather resembles the mountains of the Hartz, and Schem
nitz, in Europe, or those of Guanaxuato and Potosi in Ame
rica, of which the riches are contained in a few mineral de
positions of very considerable dimensions.         The four veins
of Biscaina, Rosario, Cabrera, and Encino, run through the
districts of Real del Monte, from Moran and Pachuca, at
extraordinary distances, without changing their direction, and
almost without coming in contact       .#   other veins which tra
verse or derange them.                        -
    “The veta de la     Biscaina, of less considerable dimensions,
but   perhaps  still richer than the vein of Guanaxuato, was
successfully wrought from the sixteenth to the beginning of
the eighteenth century. In 1726 and 1727, the two mines of
Biscaina and Xacal still produced together 333,969 ounces of
silver. The great quantity of water which filtrated through
the crevices .#the porphyritic rock, joined to the imperfection
of the means of drawing it off, compelled the miners to aban
don the works when they were yet only 65 fathoms in depth.

Moran; but he died before completing this great work, which

this wretched plan of drawing off the water by        proper
pump apparatus, put in motion by horse whims, by hydraulic
wheels, or by machines moved by a column of water (colonne

Gazave in the valley of Mexico, would have exhausted the
mine of Biscaina at the pit of San Ramon, for a depth of 202
fathoms.            The   same object could be attained at less expense
by following the project of M. D’Elhuyar, in placing the
mouth of a new level near Omitlan, in the road which leads
from Moran to the place of amalgamation at Regla. This last
level, before reaching 12,466 feet in length, would cut the vein

    “The mines of Moran, formerly of great celebrity, have been
abandoned for 40 years on account of the abundance of water,
which could not be drawn off. In this district of mines, which
is in the vicinity of that of Real del Monte, near the mouth of
the great level of Biscaina, there was placed in 1801 a machine
d colonne d'eau, of which the cylinder is 10:23 inches in height,
and 6'29 in diameter. This machine, the first of the kind ever
constructed in America, is much superior to those of the mines
of Hungary. It was executed agreeably to the calculations

acquirements. The merit of the execution is due to M.           La
chausée, a Brabant artist of great talents, who has also fitted
up for the School of Mines of Mexico a very remarkable col
lection of models, for the use of students of mechanics and
hydrodynamics.       It is to be regretted that this fine machine,
in which the regulator of the suckers is put in motion by a
particular mechanism, was placed in a situation where there
is great difficulty in procuring a sufficiency of water to kee
                   I
it going. When was at Moran, the pumps could only wor
three hours a day. The construction of the machine and the
aqueducts cost 10,937l, sterling: they did not at first calculate
on more than half of the expense, and they imagined the mass
of water to be very considerable; but the year in which the
water was measured being exceedingly rainy, it was believed
to be much more abundant than it actually was.          It is to be
hoped that the new canal which was going on in 1803, and
which will be 16,404 feet in length, will remedy this want of
water, and that the vein of Moran (hor. 9; inclined 84° to the
north-east) will be found as rich at great depths as the share
holders of the mine suppose.         M. del Rio, on my arrival in
New    Spain,  had no other view but that of proving to the
Mexican miners the effect of machines of this nature, and the
possibility of constructing them in the country.       This object
has been in   part attained;   and it will be much more evidently
attained when such a machine shall be placed in the mine of
 Rayas at Guanaxuato, in that of the Count de Regla at Real

    The benefits described as being conferred on the mining
 districts by putting their industry in motion were thus justly
 anticipated in the Report to Congress of Don Lucas Alaman,
 minister for foreign affairs, dated Nov. 1st, 1823.

    Portsmouth, Sept. 24.—On Monday the Nassau, Tremayne,
 arrived from Sierra Leone with a cargo of timber, being one
of the last ships of the season. She left the colony on the
 25th of July, just as the rainy season commenced.           The
colony was generally healthy. New barrack apartments have
been completed for the troops. The trade of the colony had
greatly increased. Not less than 20,000 tons of shipping,
trading in timber and gum, had left the colony this season.
Since the Ashantee war, the traders in gold-dust in the inte
rior had taken a new course to Sago (the capital of Bambarra,
about a month's journey from Sierra Leone), thence to Tim
boo (the capital of the Fulla country), and down to Sierra
Leone : the trade is now very considerable by this route.
General Turner had returned from his first visit to the settle
ments on the gold coast, made with a view principally to the
extension of trade.
    An English establishment has    been formed in the island of
Mombass, on the east coast of Africa, where a trade in ivory
and gum copal is extensively carried on. It appears that
Capt. W. F. Owen, of the Leven, who has two surveying
ships under his orders, put in there in February 1824 for
water, when he found the place under strict blockade by the
Imaum of Muscat's vessels.        On his landing, the chiefs and
principal inhabitants of the place escorted him to the castle,
when they solicited from him permission to put themselves
under the flag and paternal government of His Majesty
George the Fourth; with which request Captain Owen com
plied (until His Majesty's pleasure should be known), as a mea
sure most likely to conduce to the total suppression of the
slave-trade on the coast, where it had been carried on to a
most lamentable excess. Lieut. Emery, R.N., with a party of
men, was left in command, since which several dows have
been captured, the poor slaves released, and the cargoes of the
vessels, consisting of grain, cocoa-nuts, and ivory, restored to
the owners. The following account of this new establishment
(extracted from a private letter just received) must prove ac
ceptable to our readers:—
   “Mombassa is an island in 4° 3' South Lat., and 39° 41'
East Long, about 14 miles in circumference, situate at the
mouth of two rivers, distance from the nearest part of the
main about two hundred yards; at low water you are able to
walk across: it is very fertile and very high. . It was at one
time in the possession of the Portuguese, who fortified

place very strongly; but now the fortifications are going fast
to decay, they having been driven out by the Arabs in the year
                  I
1720; and firmly believe that nothing has been done to the
battlements since that time. The Arabs are now intermarried
with the Sochilles, the native tribe of the place. The harbours
are very fine: the chief commerce is ivory and gum copal,
which articles are brought into the island by an inland tribe
called Whanekas.      On the main we have numbers of wild
beasts, but none on the island, excepting hyaenas: the hippo
potami are in great numbers up the rivers.”
  We have received accounts of a recent discovery in Central
Africa, which will soon be laid before the public in greater
detail, but of which the following outline is sufficiently cu
rious:–Major        Clapperton and Captain Denham, in the course
of their late    expedition    in that quarter of the world, arrived
in the territory, and subsequently resided for some weeks, in
the capital of a nation, whose manners and history seem likely
tö occupy, to no trivial extent, the attention of the public of
this country—we might safely say of the whole civilized world.
They found a nation jet black in colour, but not in our sense
of the term negroes, having long hair and fine high features.
This people was found to be in a state of very high civiliza
tion; and above all, the British travellers witnessed a review
of seven thousand cavalry, divided into regular regiments,
and   all clothed        complete armour.
                           in                  Six thousand wore the
perfect hauberk mail             the early Norman knights: most

                                     which this has     given   rise are
various.      We confess for ourselves, that, looking            the po           to

         appears from what has been said in this Journal for
               last, that when a mass of air rises upwards in
the atmosphere, the heat absorbed by the rarefaction is greater
than the loss of temperature. In the course of          ascent                                 its           it
receives heat from the contiguous fluid, which     part balances                      in

 there is no restriction to the arbitrary number m, which may
 vary from zero to infinity. But it has here been attempted to
 deduce the laws of elastic fluids, established independently by
 experiments, from the relations that subsist between the varia
 tions of the bulk of a mass of air, the heat that enters into
combination in a latent form, and the heat of temperature sen
sible to the thermometer.            From this view of the subject it
follows that m cannot be less than 3; for this is

pare these equations with observation.                        By combining them

     As r is the temperature at the earth's surface, and t the
 temperature lost in ascending, if we put r = r — t, then º' will
 be       actual temperature in the atmosphere; and we shall get
                      log.

that the heights in the atmosphere are ascertained with much
greater exactness than the temperatures, which are subject to
so many causes of irregularity.     The great obstruction to our
knowledge of the constitution of the atmosphere is the want of
thermometrical experiments of a sufficient degree of exactness,
by means of which to correct and guide the determinations of
theory.
    Although the atmosphere determined by the equations (a)
agrees with nature as far as the observations in our possession
enable us to judge, yet this is proved only with regard to
altitudes that do not pass a certain limit.      The tota<U+017F> height
does not exceed 25   miles, which is  probably  less than half the
extent of the earth’s atmosphere.     Allowing therefore that the
two atmospheres coincide in their lower parts, yet they must
ultimately diverge greatly from one another.                 If
                                                        instead of
taking m = 4, we make it 5, which is a supposition not                 in
consistent with observation, the objection will still remain,
as the total height would be increased only to 30 miles. This
then is the objection to an atmosphere in which the decrease
of heat is proportional to the height, that the total altitude
does not quadrate with experience. The gradation of heat
that obtains in nature must therefore follow a different law.
                                                                   .
According to what has already been observed, there can be
no doubt that, as we ascend higher, the height requisite to
depress the thermometer one degree continually increases,
although the irregularity of the observations is so great as
to render it impossible to ascertain the rate of increase with
any tolerable precision.    To illustrate this point, let us again
have recourse to the  experiments   recorded by Ramond,
may be partitioned in two classes; one containing 16, in
which the height is less than 2000 yards; and the other
22 of greater altitude.     The mean height for depressing the
centigrade thermometer one degree deduced from the first
 class is 144 metres or 78 fathoms; and the same height in
the other class is 180 metres, or 98 fathoms. The                 #ºn.
of these two determinations is considerable, and proves                in
contestibly a retardation of the decrease of heat in ascend

  in this atmosphere will agree with the mean result deduced
  from the experiments recorded by Ramond.
      We may now generalize the conclusion at which we have
 just arrived.—Every atmosphere in which the laws of elastic
 fluids are observed, and in which the initial gradation of heat
 is made to coincide with that which obtains at the earth's sur
 face, will represent terrestrial experiments taken at a mean
 with sufficient accuracy.       Unless we can push our experi
 ments to heights in the atmosphere hitherto inaccessible, or
 remove the accidental irregularities of the thermometrical ex
 periments in that part of it within our reach, it may be said
 that the present research is brought to a conclusion.         Many
 atmospheres may be found in which the pressure, the tem
 perature, and the density, shall agree with nature in a mean
 of many experiments.
     The same atmospheres likewise represent the astronomical
 refractions with considerable accuracy.        In this respect they
 agree with one another and with nature, unless at very low
 altitudes.     Even the horizontal refractions are not much dif
ferent in the several cases, and approach nearly to the quan
tity found by observation,--if indeed we can affirm any thing
of an element hitherto ascertained with so little precision. But
the atmospheres vary more from one another in the celestial,
than in the terrestrial, phaenomena. In the one case, the light
of a star traverses the whole of the earth's atmosphere; in the
other, our experiments are confined to a very limited altitude.
It is sufficient for the terrestrial phaenomena, that an atmo
sphere coincide with that of nature in         lower part; but the
                                                 its
astronomical refractions require that both coincide nearly                  in
their whole extent.
     Ofall  the atmospheres which agree with terrestrial experi
ments, that determined      by the equations (a),    which the gra

amounting only to a few seconds at the horizon. And                                                           al

                                                                                                Indeed,

          Mr. Riddle   on   Mr. Burns's Nautical Problem.      251
  Indeed, Mr. B. altogether misapprehends the nature of the
problem: for he assumes, as known, not only the interval of
time between    the observations, but the true apparent time at
each observation, both of which data, he says, may be obtained
with the greatest exactness from the improved state of chro
In Ometers.
   Now it may be observed on this,—that        if the apparent time
at either observation were     known,  the other observation and
time would be superfluous data; as the problem would then,
without their aid, become one of the simplest in nautical astro
nomy.     But it is not, as Mr. B. has incautiously inferred, the
object of chronometers to point out the time at any place at
which an observation may be made; but to show, at any instant,
what the time is at some individual meridian: and therefore,
though the interval in mean time may be correctly obtained
from a chronometer, the actual times as shown by a chrono
meter may differ in any way from the apparent times at the
place of observation;–it is sufficient for the computer, if he
know the Greenwich time nearly enough to take out the de
clination with requisite correctness. The times A.M. and P.M.
in the examples which Mr. B. has re-computed are by no
means intended to represent the true apparent times of obser
vation; their only use is to determine the elapsed interval, and
to find, with the aid of the estimated longitude, the approxi
mate Greenwich time for determining the declination.               -
   In fact, Mr. Burns has proposed to himself the solution of
one problem; and he has, unknowingly, given the solution of
another,-and of one for which, in nautical practice, the ne
cessary data cannot be obtained.                            -
   I have only to add, that      Ibelieve the simplest solution of
this useful problem that has yet been given, was deduced by
º:
myself from formulae that were first investigated by Mr. Ivory.
      solution was first published in the Philosophical Magazine,
and has been copied into other works in general use among
nautical men. It is direct, accurate, and perhaps as concise
as from the nature of the problem any solution of it can be ex
pected to be. Mr. Burns's proposed solution, as we have seen,
is not a solution to the problem at all.
   The true answers to the examples which Mr. Burns has
recomputed, are 27° 59' 16", and 9° 59' 32".
   The same answers by Dr. Brinkley's approximate method
of solution, are 27° 59', and 10°     1'.
   Mr. Burns makes the answers 27° 0', and         8°  58'; and he
notices the discrepancies between his results and Dr. Brink
ley's with    mark
              a     of   admiration.   The difference certainly
                                                        is

                by way of introduction, a short account of some
     experiments on the subject, made some time since at this
university, and which were occasioned by the following pass
age in Berzelius's excellent Instructions in Chemistry (Lehr
buche der Chemie).        Berzelius mentions in the second volume
of this  work,   p. 152  (according   to Palmstedt's translation), the
chemical detection of      poisoning   by arsenic, for which he gives
the following process as proposed by Rose, with some addi
tions of his own: “Cut up the coats of the stomach, and place
them in the liquid, which is boiled with a few drachms of
caustic potash, in order to dissolve any arsenious acid that might
be contained in            The solution obtained
                          it.                            filtered, heated
                                                                       is

rates, and till the liquid has become strongly acid, clear, and
of a   bright yellow colour.            filtered

 which showed that arsenite of lime could not be dissolved
even by a great excess of alkali.      In these experiments, to                                    li
                                                                    iº
quids poisoned with arsenic, caustic potash as well as soda and
ammonia were purposely added; and immediately on adding
lime-water, a very copious precipitate of arsenite of lime was
produced.
   Prof. S. considered this subject the more worthy of being
investigated, as it surprised him that so                    a che
mist as  Berzelius, -who is so   justly respected as the first ana
lyst of our age, should be opposed to nature in so simple a
process. Besides, the rule laid down by this careful naturalist
had been already pretty generally admitted. Thus Geiger, in
his new and valuable Handbuche der Pharmacie, p. 43i, says
“that the precipitate produced by lime-water in a pure aqueous
solution of arsenious acid might be dissolved by free acids or
alkalis.” And Buchner, in his Towikologie, p. 405: “Lime
water will produce a white precipitate as well in arsenious as
in arsenic acid. In order to produce this effect, neither any
free acid nor free lime-water must be in it.” In reality there
may be a great excess of lime-water, without the result being
disturbed by            it;   on
                       the contrary,      beneficial   apply lime
                                                        it   is                to

than the reverse, because the lime-arsenic            dissolved even is                            by
an excess of arsenious acid.           But since neither arsenite nor
arseniate lime are dissolved, with any predominance
              of                                                   potash,              of
soda,   or   ammonia; how was             that Berzelius obtained no

—in which, however, we must suppose       a much stronger affinity
between the arsenic and the ammonia than between the arsenic
and the potash or soda,      I have been requested by Professor
Schweigger to make a series of experiments on the decom
position of arsenite of lime by the salts of ammonia. The fol
lowing are the results.
        I
    A. precipitated some arsenious acid with lime-water, and
added to this liquid, in which the arsenite of lime was suspended
in white flakes, the following ammoniacal salts in solution;
viz. the muriate, nitrate, acetate, and sulphate. Each of these
produced a solution of the arsenite of lime and clarified the
                     I
liquid. But when added to this liquid containing the arsenite
of lime in flakes, phosphate or carbonate of ammonia, an effect
was produced on the lime, but a deposit always remained.
This shows evidently the existence of a double affinity, since
the phosphoric and carbonic acids became precipitated in com
bination with the lime, but with the other ammoniacal salts the
solution remains clear, as may be seen from the following ex
periments.                            -
    a. The precipitate formed by carbonate of ammonia effer
vesced in acetic acid, and diluted with water gave with    -
                                                              oxalic
acid a white precipitate of oxalate of lime.
    b. By adding, sulphuretted hydrogen to the clear superna
tant liquid a yellow tinge was produced; with nitrate of silver
a yellow, and with lime-water a white precipitate.
    c. The solution above the precipitate produced by phos
phate of ammonia, gave with sulphuretted hydrogen a yellow
tinge; with nitrate of silver a yellow, and with lime-water a
                                                                     -
white precipitate.
    B. Arsenite of lime newly precipitated was filtered off, and
washed with distilled water: this pappy substance was then put
into solutions of acetate, muriate, nitrate, and sulphate of am
monia, and completely dissolved; but in phosphate or carbon
ate of ammonia a precipitate remained, as described above.
     .
    C. The arsenite of lime being well dried was not dissolved
by nitrate, acetate, or muriate of ammonia, at common tem
peratures; but when boiled the solution became quite clear.
 But if boiled with natural phosphate of ammonia, a precipitate
 of phosphate of lime remained.
    2. On the Detection   of Arsenic by means   of Iodine-starch.
    Brugnatelli was the first who stated that iodine-starch might
 be          as a re-agent for arsenious acid.    His essay on the
 subject may be found in the Journ...f. Chem. u. Phys. vol. xx.
 p. 56.   According to him, iodine-starch is deprived of co
 lour  by arsenious acid and by solution of sublimate;

   blue colour is restored by the addition of concentrated sul
   phuric acid when the experiment has been made with arsenious
   acid, but not when sublimate has been used.           Thus iodine
   starch will serve as a true criterion to distinguish between
  those two kinds of poison.
      Being one day present with my friend Moritz Hecker, at a
  judicial investigation of an alleged poisoning by arsenic, and
   the absence of both arsenic and sublimate having been ascer
   tained by the acknowledged re-agents, we also tried iodine
   starch. The liquid under examination having completely de
   prived it of colour, we were led to make a series of experiments
   on the decolorization of iodine-starch and the restoration of its
  colour.     They completely confirmed what had already been
  affirmed by Stromeyer in Gilbert's Annalen, vol. xlix. p. 150,
   and by Colin and Gaultier de Claubry (Journ, vol. xiii. old
   series, p. 453—457); and nothing can be added, according
  to our experiments, to the substances mentioned by these che
  mists as decolorizing the iodine-starch, except prussic acid
  and prussiate of mercury. That protonitrate of mercury as
  well as sublimate would deprive it of colour might have been
  expected. But it deserves to be noticed, that whilst arsenious
  acid quickly decolorizes the iodine-starch, pure arsenic acid
  does not, although arseniate of potash and arseniate of am
  monia render it colourless; after which, an addition of sul
  phuric acid restores the colour. The fuming sulphuric acid
  of Nordhausen, concentrated or somewhat diluted, completely
  decolorizes iodine-starch; wherefore the blue colour, if de
 stroyed by arsenious acid, cannot be restored by the addition
 of fuming sulphuric acid, but only by the rectified acid.

258       Prof. Giseke's Observations on the Tests for Arsenic.
such as had been for a fortnight in an open glass. The starch
in glass a was decolorized by four drops of a solution of
arsenic, and that in glass b by twelve drops; whilst twenty
four drops of the same solution did not perfectly decolorize
the iodine-starch in glasses c and d. After two hours the                               li
quid in glass c was completely colourless, but that in d was
still violet. The restoration of the colour was perfectly ef
fected in glass a by eight drops of sulphuric acid, and in 5
less perfectly by twelve drops; the liquid in c and d received
its blueish colour again after the addition of sixteen drops,
but did not assume a full blue even with a greater addition of
sulphuric acid. It would perhaps not be easy to determine
what change may have taken place in the iodine-starch by a
 short exposure to the atmosphere, in which the colour suffers
no alteration whatever.—Perhaps      I shall find an opportunity
to make further   experiments  on the subject.
     3.Affinity of the Decoction of Onions for some Re-agents.
     As it has been frequently said that the decoction of onions
bears the same affinity for the re-agents as arsenious acid (See

All similar tables which have hitherto seen are extremely
                                            I
erroneous, being calculated                         on
                                     the supposition that the sha
dow  is cast from the centre      the sun; and therefore any dial
                                                of
constructed from such tables must invariably err one minute
of time from the truth. The following table              computed on                is
the principle that the shadow        cast from      point
                                                    is        the sun's    a               in

sun's centre.   The  shadow    therefore     coincides with the  meri
dian  at one minute        time from noon. This remark must
                                      of

        XXXVII.        Errors in PIAzzi's Catalogue of Stars.
 THE         high reputation
        so justly maintains,
                               which M. Piazzi's catalogue of stars
                               and the constant use which is made
 of it in  every  active  observatory,         render it necessary that the
 detection of    any  errors should be as widely circulated as pos
 sible. We      trust,  therefore, that we need not apologize to our
 readers for the insertion of the following list. A considerable
 portion of the errors, therein stated, were communicated to a
 gentleman in this country (highly distinguished for his ma
 thematical and scientific attainments) by M. Piazzi himself;
 and some others by M. Cacciatori, his worthy successor at
 the observatory at Palermo: the remainder (which are distin
 guished by an asterisk annexed) have been communicated by
 one of our correspondents, who has had frequent occasion to
 refer to this valuable work.

         XXXVIII.       On Tungsten.       By F. WöHLER*.
               describing some combinations of tungsten, which
BEFOREin my opinion have not hitherto been known, I will indicate
one of the processes Iemployed to procure pure tungstic acid.          I
had noticed that on heating a mixture of tungstate of potash and
of hydrochlorate of ammonia, the tungstic acid is reduced into
oxide by the hydrogen of the ammonia, which separates on the
                                                     I
mass being dissolved in water. This property have applied in
the preparation of tungstic acid in the following manner: The
mixture of pulverized wolfram and carbonate of potash being
melted together, the tungstate of potash is dissolved in water,
and a sufficient quantity of hydrochlorate of ammonia added;
the mass is then evaporated to dryness, and ignited and fused in
a Hessian crucible till the sal ammoniac be entirely decom
posed or evaporated. On dissolving the melted mass in hot
water, a black and heavy powder is obtained, which is the ox
ide of tungsten. This is boiled with a weak solution of pure
potash, for the purpose of carrying off a small portion of super
tungstate of potash difficult of solution.         When it is desired
to have tungstic acid, this oxide is to be heated in an open
crucible: it takes fire and burns vividly, changing into a yel
low powder.
                         Owide   of Tungsten.
    This oxide was    discovered by M. Berzelius,       who obtained
it by heating tungstic acid in hydrogen                   The acid at
first turns perfectly blue, then gradually ãº.    dark brown.       As I
employed for this experiment the crystalline tungstic acid,
 such as is obtained by the decomposition of crystallized tung
 state of ammonia, I obtained a crystalline oxide of a lustre
 almost metallic, which after burnishing preserved this lustre,
 and had a dark copper-colour. It may also be obtained under
 the same form, but with a perfect metallic lustre, and of the
 most beautiful copper-colour, by bringing into contact a mix
 ture of tungstic acid and zinc filings with diluted muriatic
 acid.    The hydrogen at first turns the tungstic acid blue, and
 afterwards reduces it to brilliant laminae of a copper-colour.
 The oxide thus obtained is only preserved under water; for
 by contact with atmospheric air it instantly turns blue, and
 soon changes completely into a yellow acid.
    On comparing the character of this oxide of tungsten with
 the black powder obtained by the treatment of tungstate of
 potash with salammoniac,-which, as           I have said, is oxide of

Heated in chlorine, a slight incandescence takes place; chlo
ride of tungsten which volatilizes, and of which I shall speak
hereafter, is formed. The other product of the combustion is
a greenish mass, which, treated with water, gives chloride of
sodium crystallized in cubes.   The insoluble green powder is
a mixture of tungstic acid with a little oxide; but the quantity
of the acid is much larger than that of the chloride and oxide
together. The result therefore seems to be, that the com
bination contains oxygen, the whole quantity of which, before
the action of the chlorine, was distributed so as to form soda
 and oxide of tungsten, and which, by the combination of the
 chlorine with the sodium, entirely united with the tungsten in
order to form tungstic acid.                      I
                                        obtained exactly the same
result in  employing    the chlorine in a perfectly dry state; and
by avoiding the least mixture of atmospheric air with the chlo
rine, in such manner that the formation of the tungstic acid
could proceed neither from the oxygen of the water nor from
that of the atmospheric air, 0.873 grain of the combination,
decomposed by chlorine, gave 0-157 grain of chloride of so
dium = 0.089 grain of soda; consequently, 10-6 parts of soda
in 100 of the combination.                                  I
                                    But as expected to have ob
served that the half-fused state of the chloride of sodium pre
vented the complete action of the chlorine on the combination,
I  tried another manner of analysing this body; viz. by sulphur,
 —which entirely decomposes                     it.
                                        0.487 grain    the combina       of
tion were melted with      pure   sulphur         closed crucible
                                                             in   a                           of
porcelain.     The resulting mass had the appearance             sul                    of
phuret        of
             tungsten, and weighed 0-55 grain.         No sulphuret
of   sodium could be discovered, either with water          muriatic            or
acid.    .   It
            was therefore treated with      aqua-regia,  which con
verted     into pure tungstic acid. The fluid was made
             it                                                  eva                    to
porate        on
              the acid, and then the whole mass ignited. The
tungstic acid, placed        filter, was washed till
                                  in
                                   a                    the sulphate     all
of  soda which had been formed was dissolved. The pure
acid, dried and heated, weighed 0.45 grain.           This quantity                               .
corresponds with 86.2 parts          oxide  oftungsten     160 parts

of tungsten must be employed; and consequently                            a   corre
sponding part of tungsten set free, and combined (as have said        I
before) with chlorine. From this reason it is evident that this
new combination can only contain the tungsten in the state of
                                         -
oxide.
  I  have tried without success to produce this body by the
direct combination of the oxide of tungsten with soda. By
heating those bodies together               I
                                    obtained metallic tungsten
and tungstate of soda.
   Lastly,      I
              also tried to produce an analogous combination
with potash, and treated the super-tungstate of potash in the
same manner as the corresponding salt of soda.       obtained a   I
metallic mass of a whitish colour, being pure metallic tung
Sten.
                     Chloride of Tungsten.
   Sir H. Davy   was the first who found that tungsten heated
in chlorine burns and produces a white substance, which is
decomposed by the action of water into tungstic acid and hy
drochloric acid : but nothing further seems to be known on
the subject.          I
                have found that there are three different com
binations of tungsten and chlorine.
                     Perchloride of Tungsten.
   This is always  produced,  and nearly in a pure state, on heat
ing the black oxide of tungsten in chlorine;—with the brown
oxide, tungstic acid is formed at the same time. The combi
nation is effected with an evolution of light; the glass globe in
which the operation is performed is filled with a thick yellow
smoke, which is condensed into scales of a yellowish-black
colour, and which at last forms a thick sublimate that ex
teriorly perfectly resembles native boracic acid. In contact
with atmospheric air this chloride changes, according to the
hygroscopic state of the air, within some hours or some days,
..º.
into tungstic acid; and at the same time hydrochloric acid is
               With water this decomposition is more rapid,
although not instantaneous; very pure tungstic acid is de
posited, and weak hydrochloric acid is formed at the same time.
In ammonia it dissolves with a slight noise and an evolution
of heat. It volatilizes in a low temperature without first melt
ing, and       its
             vapour              of

grammes. It was inflamed by heat, giving out a smell of sul
phurous acid, and leaving as a residue sulphuret of lead
mixed with a little iron, which weighed 1'58 gramme.
    The first substance, weighing 61%, grammes, treated with
muriatic acid aided by heat, gave the latter a reddish-brown
colour, and produced a slight effervescence, with the smell of
chlorine.    As the heat increased, this effervescence also               in
creased, and a fine violet-colour was soon developed; when,
in order to preserve this violet matter, the vessel was imme
 diately withdrawn from the fire.
    At the bottom of the acid remained a yellow substance con
taining gray particles, which were dissolved in the hot water
with which the substance was washed.
    This water had acquired a reddish-brown tinge, and the
property of imparting to a solution of starch a fine blue
colour.                                                          -
    Suspecting, although the circumstance appeared so extra
ordinary, that this violet vapour was produced by iodine, the
above muriatic solution, after having been a little diluted with
water, was submitted to distillation.     It was with pleasure we
saw our supposition realized: for soon the violet vapours, on
rising, crystallized against the sides of the adopter and balloon
adapted to the retort, assuming the acicular form and the co
lour peculiar to iodine; but the acid was not entirely de
colorized.   Although the yellow substance had been boiling
for some time with the muriatic acid, it was not entirely decom
posed; for having melted 2.38 grammes of it with potash, and
washed the produce with water, we obtained an alkaline so
lution, which, saturated with sulphuric acid and mixed with
starch-water, produced, with the addition of some drops of
solution of chlorine, a very fine blue colour. The substance
which did not dissolve in the water was metallic silver in
the state of powder, weighing 1-63 gramme.
   Assured therefore, by the preceding experiments, of the pre
sence of iodine in the argentiferous mineral, we endea
voured to obtain it by a more direct process, which would
                               it its

washed  itout   water; and after having decanted the latter,
                  in

iodide of silver is precipitated on which the nitric acid has no
action, we are led to believe that the iodine is combined
with the silver.     Moreover, this opinion appears fully con
firmed by the circumstance that a certain quantity of iodine
may be extracted from the silver ore by boiling it for some
time with ammonia: besides, it is known that iodine, like chlo
rine, has a great affinity for silver.

round the staff, it is out of the diagonal line in any other posi
tion, and of course throws both the diagonal and perpendicu
lar out of their true directions.        -
    In measuring diagonals, &c. by means of the chain and
common cross, Mr.Newton says, “The young practitioner fre
quently is obliged to prick his staff in six or seven different
places before he can succeed in finding the diagonal, &c., but
in using the above he will seldom find it requisite to ground
his staff more than once, in order to answer the same pur
pose.” Now it is evident this new instrument can be placed
the first time only 18 inches, at most, nearer to the required
point than the common cross (18 inches being the length of the
revolving arm F H). This distance on the diagonal on either
side of the point where the true perpendicular falls, will cause
a difference in the lengths of the perpendiculars, supposing
them to be one, two, three, four, and five chains in length re
spectively, of #, Tº Tºr, gº, and ºr part of an inch only, in
their respective lengths; and if a cross can be placed within
the distance of 18 inches, on the first trial, of the true point
where the perpendicular falls on the diagonal (as Mr. Newton
says it is seldom requisite to ground his staff more than once),
I  really cannot see the necessity for pricking the staff in five
or six different places afterwards. Errors, I may say, of                   al
most infinitely greater magnitude arise from inattention to the
correct length of the chain, and to the chain-leader not putting
down his pins in a perpendicular direction, &c.
    The difference of 1-5th of an inch, or even of an inch or
                                                              I
two, will make little or no difference in the result, as believe
it is not very usual for even professional -)surveyors to read off
 to the fraction of a link.

did not at   all
               surprise me,     as
                                 Ihad for some time hesitated
which construction       put upon

                                                         the two

                                             considered,  Ichose

                                                thatunder which
the author himself would have         viewed.   By considering

no such values of v and r had even been in the most distant
 manner suggested), was not only the most natural course, but
 seemed to       far the least objectionable mode of proceeding.
 It is true the title of the article led us at once to see the ulti
 mate object of the inquiry; but it by no means intimated that
 in the stage at which we had arrived, a different class of values
 from that we had been previously considering was to be given to
 the indices. It is not usual to employ quantities in an elemen
 tary investigation with a new import, without expressly stating
 that the import of them is changed at that step, nor can a due
 regard to perspicuity be consistent with such an omission.
 Every one conversantwith subjects of this nature must be aware
 how vaguely and imperfectly the mere title of a paragraph
 must necessarily define the character of the symbols which
 are introduced into an investigation. It will be recollected that
 not the slightest intimation had been given that it was con
 cerning the symbols r and v that the ultimate results were
 sought; and in reality, the passage quoted by P. Q. in sup
 port of those symbols having been introduced as fractions, ap
 pears quite as much like an extension of the signification
 which they had previously possessed,—if indeed that be the
 meaning which Mr. Herapath himself wished to convey by                                           it.
    However,         it matter

XLII.         Correction in Dr. URE's Paper on the latent Heat                           of
                   Vapours.  By T. TREDGOLD, Esq.

  N. Dr. Ure's paper on the latent heat of vapours in the
    Philosophical Transactions for 1818 (see Phil. Mag. vol. liii.
p. 193) a considerable error in the mode of calculating the re
sults of the experiments has not been noticed. When it is
corrected, we have for the latent heat of steam, 888° instead of
96.7°, for that of alcohol 355.1° instead of 442°, &c.               The
error occurs in the second operation. “From 42.5° to 212°
there are 169'5°; one half of which = 84-75°, or in round

    This salt therefore contains more carbonic acid than the
carbonate, and less than the bi-carbonate.               The carbonate                                        of

   The urao salt is used in the country as a kind of mordant
to an extract of tobacco, which, when held in the mouth, pro
duces a secretion of saliva: this preparation is called chimo or
moo.   At Merida they mix four arrobas of urao with eight of
tobacco; at Varinas           à.
                          urao forms but one-fourth of the pro
portion of tobacco. The moo contains less urao than the
chimo.

XLV.       On Mr. BURNs's          Method of finding the Latitude by
         Double Altitudes.        By Thomas HENDERson, Esq.
  To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    Sir,
  N your Number for       September, art. xxx. there is professed
   to be   given a short,  direct, and accurate method of finding
the latitude at sea  by   double altitudes and the time between.
     I
But believe that the following considerations will show, with
out difficulty, that this method is altogether inefficient, and
produces erroneous results, which may often lead to serious
consequences.                                 -
    The author first assumes the trigonometrical formula for
determining the altitude of a celestial body by means of the
latitude, declination, and horary angle, on which the solution
of this problem in the Requisite Tables depends, and which be
ing transformed gives the well-known equation for expressing
the cosine of a side of a spherical triangle in terms of the sines
and cosines of the opposite angle and the other sides.       This
equation, which Delambre and other late writers make the
foundation of all spherical trigonometry, might have been as
sumed at once, without being deduced from one of                its
                                                              own
corollaries.   The author next finds         an
                                           equation  for determi
ning the latitude from the observed altitudes and the times            or
horary angles, which,        he
                            says, from the improved state       of
                                                               our
  -                          N       n 2            chronometers

chronometers and other instruments may be known with the
greatest exactness.        But he must be aware that, if the horar
angles can be ascertained at sea with such precision, two alti
         are not necessary for finding the latitude, one only
with   itshorary angle being sufficient.              well known, how
                                                                   It   is

curacy, the times           horary angles
                                or              sea, independent
                                                              at                                     of   a
knowledge            of
                   the latitude      longitude; and accordingly all
                                               or
the solutions        the problem
                         of           double altitudes hitherto given
                                                   of
suppose only the difference         the horary angles,
                                               of            the elapsed             or
time,   to          be

 be  seen       by
               differentiating the author's equation,             even by                 or

there, states that platina has also been found in them.
     “I had made two years ago,” says M. de Humboldt, in a
letter which accompanied the specimens of which we are speak
ing, “fruitless attempts to procure this Russian platina: I have
succeeded at last through the goodness of M. the Baron de Schil
ling. It is curious to see that the platina of the Oural is found in
the midst of fragments of diorite (grunstein, or an intimate mix
ture of feldspar and amphibole), like the platina of Choco. The
  rains, which are rich inosmium and iridium, appear to me geo
 ogically interesting. At Choco each grain contains          the me                         all

THE   action of the acids on steel depends on the degree of
  hardness which the steel has received. Steel, hardened to

Diluted muriatic          sulphuric acids have scarcely any effect

                                                      of
acid, aided by         boiling heat, produces
                           a                               solution without  a
leaving any residuum.                        acid, under similar circum
stances, leaves some carbon                      of
                                       black colour and with metallic

duced, together with the other circumstances just mentioned.
   Very different from this are the habitudes                 gray raw iron      of

muriatic acid without leaving  Strong sulphuric acid, em  it.

                                   at
 effects are produced which appear                 coincide, sometimes with

 those exhibited                 by
                           hard steel, and sometimes with those cha
 racteristic       soft steel. The former appear
                      of                                      the darkest and       in

 of the former, if held against the light, appear transparent in
some places, and exhibit a peculiar fibrous structure, which the
non-calcined graphite does not possess.      Melted with nitre,
the graphite produces  no vehement     detonations,  but is con
sumed slowly, and the remaining salt dissolved without resi
duum by water.               I
                   did not succeed in converting sulphate into
sulphite of potash by means of graphite. . Thus then the gra
phite in gray raw iron is not what it has been supposed to be,
a combination of carbon and iron; but pure carbon, or its
metallic base.  Whether natural graphite be also a pure car
bon-metal, or really a combination of carbon and iron, is yet
to be determined.
XLIX.       Extract from a Letter addressed by Professor BEssel
     to Professor Schumacher, relating to the Greenwich Obser
     vations*, as criticized in the Philosophical Magazine for No
     vember and December 1824.
 W HEN   I had the pleasure of being your guest at Altona,
    you showed me the numbers of the Philosophical Ma
 gazine which contain a very severe censure of the Greenwich
 observations for 1821.               I
                              saw this censure with some surprise,
 because   Ihad  always  considered the collection of observations
 at Greenwich as singularly valuable, and as a rich source of as
 tronomical truths; nor were you, I believe, of a different opi
 nion; and we were perfectly agreed respecting the unimpor
 tance of the inaccuracies that were imputed to this work in the
 two papers published in the 64th volume of the Philosophical
 Magazine.
    For those who are acquainted with the Greenwich observa
tions, and who compare them with the critic's remarks, every
further explanation would be superfluous. But since it may be
supposed that these remarks will fall into the hands of many
persons not deeply versed in astronomy, I readily comply with
the request which you made, that           I
                                          would commit to writin
our common view of the subject.            I
                                          feel, as well as yourself,
the  propriety  of doing   my  best on the occasion, in order that
too   great importance    may   not be attached to this censure of
an establishment, to which astronomy is indebted for a great
                    is its
proportion of      advancement; and that            its
                                                 importance cannot
 be very great,     sufficiently shown         by
                                            the facility with which

     The greater number of          the errors which have been pointed
out   by   the censor are       merely     accidental errors of the pen.
Errors of this kind are          certainly   disagreeable, and it would be
better if    they   could be    entirely   avoided;      but since        collec               all

                                                  contain such errors, they
clearly appear               to   be
                            unavoidable.

   The second class contains the differences between different
records of the same observation. These must be errors                          the                   in

 six microscopes, seem to me to have been introduced without
  the least propriety: they are either insignificant errors of the
 pen, as in the case of y Draconis 28th March; or slight acci
  dental errors of observation, mixed with the changes of place
  of the stars and of the refraction; or, lastly, changes of the place
  of the pole on the instrument. For this last the observer can
 by no means be responsible.         Had the critic pointed out any
 new method of fixing the instrument so that it should be sub
 ject to no alterations, he would have deserved the thanks
 of all practical astronomers; but the constant result of past
  experience shows that the greatest possible care, in procuring
 a firm foundation for the pillars, affords us only a comparative
 and not an absolute stability.       The fixing of the instruments
 at Greenwich has been such as to keep them for a long time
 admirably firm; but at other times it has not been so success
 ful, as may be seen in the table of the place of the pole, printed
 in the Nachrichten, No. 73; the differences between the latter
 days of July and the beginning of August 1821 depending on
 a change of this kind, so that they cannot be considered as ac
 cidental errors of observation; nor are they of material impor
 tance, as they may be readily determined by a series of obser
 vations of the pole star, so complete as those which are made
 at Greenwich.        The accidental irregularities of the polar             di
 stances, which remain after the correction of the place of the
 pole, can be as little considered as an imputation on the accu
 racy of the observer, as those of the intervals of the micrometer
 wires. The truth of this remark is illustrated in the Nachrich
 ten, No. 73.
    The fourth class contains the differences between the times
 of transits observed with the transit telescope, and the mural
circle. The latter instrument, however, not being intended for
the observation of transits, nor being ever actually so employed,
it would have been of no manner of use to seek for greater
accuracy in the memorandums which are made merely with a
view of determining     its   place with respect   to  the meridian.
 We    ought  to   acknowledge    the occasional insertion         of
                                                                 these
memorandums with gratitude,

strument never deviates          much from the meridian        toaffect
the   polar  distances;   but  they  are not intended for   any  other
purpose. Neither Bradley nor Maskelyne have ever noted the
times  of  the transits by   their mural quadrant, although        was it
more liable   to   variation than the mural circle. But       correct

the place   of  the axis    this circle continually,      as
perfectly into the plane      ofthe meridian,  would  certainly          be   of it
no  advantage    to  the Greenwich observations.
    Other errors which are criticized,—for example, those          the  of
                                                                       Ilannes

           Prof. Bessel on the Greenwich Observations.           295
names   of the   stars, of the hour or minute of their transits, and
so forth,<-are of no material importance whatever; and how
difficult it is to avoid errors of this kind, may be inferred from
the circumstance of my having found about 1400 such errors
in Bradley’s observations. [The catalogue of these errors is
already printed at the expense of the Board of Longitude, and
is to be annexed to the publication of Mayer's original obser
vations, which is nearly completed.]
    The remark, that the observations at Greenwich are com
monly concluded at midnight, would be of some weight, if it
could be proved that any thing essential is omitted by this
practice, which does not appear to me to be the case. The ob
servations relate chiefly to the sun, the fundamental stars, the
moon, and the oppositions of the planets; and it may easily
be discovered that these different series are exhibited with an
uncommon degree of perfection.          Had the censor in the Phi
losophical Magazine pointed out any other series of observa
 tions which could have been combined with these, so as not to
interfere with them, no doubt the Astronomer Royal would
have been much obliged to him. Every thing cannot be done
at once in an observatory; and if as much is effected as can be
wished in one respect, something must be omitted in others.
 But to multiply observations, without any plan or object what
ever, would be mere idleness.        Whoever is dissatisfied with the
 actual riches of the Greenwich observations would do well to make
 the attempt to excel them; he would convince himself by such an
 experiment that the labour and patience required for doing so
 much are fully sufficient to exhaust the powers of any one man.
    The third class of errors, relating to the meteorological     in
 struments,    I have not yet mentioned, because     I  think myself
 that greater accuracy is required in this department than it
 has hitherto been usual to observe. And if I should be allowed
 to suggest any improvement that could be made in the obser
 vations at Greenwich, it would be a more correct account of
 the meteorological instruments, and of the place in which the
 exterior thermometer is fixed.       [It may, indeed, be expected
 with confidence that Professor Bessel's desire to possess a

 Antediluvian Phytology, illustrated by a collection of the Fossil
     Remains of Plants peculiar to the Coal Formations of Great
     Britain. By Edmund Tyrell Artis, F.S.A. & G.S. London,        -
     1825. 4to.     Introduction xiii. p. : pp. 24: plates 24.
 Pºol:        to the appearance of this publication, we believe,
       the only English works in which the vegetable remains so
 abundant in our coal strata, and in many instances so interest
 ing to the botanist as well as to the geologist, were attempted
 to be illustrated with any precision and detail, were Martin's
 Petrificata Derbiensia, and the late Mr. Parkinson's Organic
  Remains.     Some of them had also been described by Mr.
 Steinhauer, in the American Philosophical Transactions; and
 a few others in the Transactions of various scientific bodies,
 in two or three county histories, and in the philosophical jour
 nals. The late researches of MM. Schlotheim and Sternberg,
 with the memoirs of Professor Martius and of M. Adolphe
 Brongniart, have given the subject a new and more scientific
 form than it has hitherto possessed; though we are somewhat
 apprehensive that those naturalists have not been sufficiently
 cautious in their determinations of genera and species, so
 little of the organization of the plants being in their present
                                                            ...
 state capable of being correctly ascertained. We are not full
 satisfied, moreover, with the principles of classification
 they have adopted, as they appear to tend to the production
 of some confusion and anomalies in the established modes of
 discriminating the subjects of natural history.
    On the whole, however,-as we have just intimated,—the
investigation of the fossil remains of vegetables is rising in ac
curacy and usefulness; and though we might perhaps have
wished for a work upon the subject on a scale that would place
it within the compass of geological students in general, yet we
hail the publication of “Antediluvian Phytology” with plea
sure, as the first work in our language exclusively devoted to
this subject.
    In a brief introduction, Mr. Artis explains the motives and
circumstances which have led him to the undertaking, and
gives an outline of the respective systems of fossil vegetables
and their parts, proposed by the naturalists we have named
above; reserving an outline of a new arrangement, with va
rious observations on the fossil plants of the coal formation,
for another volume, or rather part, of his work, which he
states to be already in progress.                       .
    The part before us contains twenty-four plates, well en
graved by Weddell, from drawings chiefly by Mr. Curtis, but

    In concluding our notice of this useful work, we would
suggest to the author the propriety of giving, in future, his ge
neric and specific characters and descriptions in Latin as well
as in English; as we think this would add much to the utility
of the publication, the second part of which we hope soon to
have the pleasure of analysing.

all who are interested in the study of              remains, will be
to quote the Latin preface, written with an elegance seldom
found in modern scientific works in that language; and to give
the descriptions of some new genera, as specimens of the man

  nearly ten months, is in lat. 73° and long. 89°. They left that
  place on the 19th of July, when the ice broke up; and twelve
  days after this, while working southwards, exploring the inlet,
  the shipwreck of the Fury compelled them to forgo the further
 prosecution of their discoveries. It is satisfactory to learn that
 the ships have not lost a single man. As the progress of the
 expedition was cut short by an accident, and not by any thing
 depending on the climate, we think there is nothing in the re
 sult to discourage a new attempt. The Hecla was off the mouth
 of the Frith on Wednesday, and on her way southward.                In
 formation as to the general result of the expedition was com

     “Dear sir, We sailed from the west coast of Greenland on
 the 4th of July 1824.        In passing Davis's Straits we were
 beset 58 days in the ice. On the 9th of September we cleared
 the ice, and on the 13th of the same month entered Barrow’s
  Strait. The winter was now setting in fast; we therefore en
 deavoured to reach Port Bowen, in Prince Regent's Inlet,
 which we effected with some difficulty on the 28th. . By the
 6th of October we were completely surrounded with young
 ice. The winter passed more agreeably than could have been
 expected; we had a good library on board, and managed to
raise a tolerable masquerade in one of the ships every fort
night.     The winter was what might be called a mild one in
this  part  of the world, the thermometer never exceeding 48%
 degrees below zero. During          its
                                      continuance we had fine sport
chasing white bears, twelve     of which were killed. White grouse
were abundant       inspring: we shot        great number

On the 19th    of July  the ice broke   up,  and we bade farewell    to

Every effort was made      to  save her; but our exertions proving

extremely fortunate during the voyage, not having lost- a man
either by disease or accident.”
  The following is another account.
  The expedition was delayed in the summer of      1824 in getting
across Baffin's Bay by a most extraordinary accumulation of
ice; and it was not before the 9th of September that they
passed that barrier.
     On the 26th of September 1824, they arrived at the en
trance of Prince Regent's Inlet: after two or three days of
bad weather and obstruction from the ice, they got into Port
Bowen; and on the 1st of October the ships were safely
placed in their positions for the winter. During the spring of
1825, parties of discovery were sent under Captain Hoppner
inland to the eastward; under Lieutenant Sherer along the
coast to the southward; and under Lieutenant Ross to the
northward. Lieutenant Sherer reached Fitzgerald-bay in
72° 20', and Lieutenant Ross proceeded beyond Cape York,
in 73° 30'.
     The ships sailed from Port Bowen on the 20th of last July,
and on the 22d were driven back again to nearly Prince
 Leopold's Islands, in Lancaster Sound: on the 24th they got
hold of Cape Seppings, on the western entrance of the Re
 gent's Inlet, and they worked down the western shore till the
 1st of August, when the Fury was forced on shore by masses
 of ice; she however was got off, and hove down for repair a
 little further to the southward; but on the 23d of August
 they were forced, in consequence of increased severity of
 weather, to abandon her.       Her officers and men were re
 moved into the    Hecla,  (which had also been in great danger,)
 and   Captain  Parry  felt himself under the necessity of return
 ing to England, and accordingly stood to the northward, and
 on the 27th anchored in Niell’s Harbour, a little to the south
 ward of Port Bowen. After two or three days spent in re
 fitting, they sailed again on their way homewards, and on the
 17th of September got through the ice and passed the arctic
 circle.   On the 10th of October they made the Orkneys.
     Only two men were lost during the whole voyage—one
 drowned, and one by disease. The health, spirits, and disci
  pline of both ships’ companies were excellent  all  through.

and Biafra.     Sockatoo, the capital of a considerable state, and
at which   place he turned back, is situated in 12 degrees north
latitude, and in about 7 degrees east longitude, and upon a
river which flows west by it into the Joliba (the Niger) of
Mr. Park, distant about forty miles from the city mentioned.
The inhabitants of Sockatoo told Major Clapperton that they
traded up the Joliba with Timbuctoo, and down it with the
 Europeans who frequented the sea-coasts at the mouth of the
river.    Upon turning to a map of Africa, the reader will per
ceive that Sockatoo is about four hundred miles from Tim
buctoo, three hundred and fifty from the mouth of the Rio de
 Formosa, very near Bousa, where Park lost his life, and within
 a short distance of the position, as nearly as can be laid down,
 of the great city of Wassanah, mentioned to Captain Riley by
 Sidi Hamet. We have heard of other curious particulars, but
these are of minor importance, and sink into insignificance be
 fore the great pointmentioned and determined. It is with consi
derable satisfaction we are enabled also to state, that by the
activity and attention of the Colonial Office, Major Laing was
furnished with an abstract of Major Clapperton's important dis
coveries, to guide him in his researches and his journey,and that
this abstract reached him a few days before he left Tripoli.-
 He is by this time at or near Timbuctoo, and has taken with
him four or five carpenters (Blacks), from the United States of
                              i.
 America, in order to assist in building a vessel (of sufficient
 strength to pass the Rapids in safety) at Timbuctoo, in which
 he means to descend the Niger to the sea. The period of the
year and the state of his             are such as leave the most
 sanguine hopes of his early and complete success.       It is cal
 culated that he  might  be in the  Bight  of Benin  by the month
 of March next; but, taking into account the delay and diffi
culty of travelling in Africa, whether by land or by water, we
think this period too early. It is not necessary to unfold a
map of Africa, to perceive the commanding position of the

leaving for others who have more, to examine and consider the
objections that may be urged against them. It has been proved
by Sir Humphry Davy and others, that the earths which com
pose the surface or crust of our globe are not simple ele
ments, but compound substances; for instance,—lime, alumine,
silex, &c., are compounded of metallic bases and oxygen : it is
                                                                                  iº
also well known to chemists, that the oxides occupy more
space than the metals from which they are produced.
    If therefore the globe, in                   its
                                          original construction, was com
posed     of elementary substances, these would, particularly near

Polar Seas, read before the Wernerian Society (Edin. Ph.
Journ. vol. vi.) alludes to their definite elevation, and to the
sky above them being perfectly clear.
  It is possible, however, that two icebergs may be situated so
near each other, that their reciprocal horizontal radiations will
so cool the volume of air between them as to reduce it to a
temperature nearly uniform, and thereby prevent the forma
tion of mist. The cold volume of air so formed, may, how
ever, pass from between the icy masses, and by mingling with
the air reposing on the warmer water, beyond the icebergs,
produce mist at a distance from them.            Nor is it absolutely
necessary that two icebergs should exist, in order to form mist;
                             º
since the horizontal radiations of one, by cooling the portion
of air in contact with       it,
                              will cause       mingle with the warmer
                                              it   to
air  beyond     the last-mentioned    stratum,    and thus create fog.
The density       of
                   a  mist when formed under the latter conditions,
will be of more variable character than when
             a                                                    formed

between adjacent icebergs.
    The general diffusion          of
                                   fogs over the Northern Seas may
also   be  satisfactorily             for, from the scattered icebergs
separating the water into detached portions; and thereby
creating,    in  innumerable directions, volumes             of
                                                          air possessed
of  unequal temperatures. The cold air near the icebergs being

    Coblentz, Sept. 17.—The first experiment in steam naviga
tion has been made on this part of the Rhine, and apparently
with success.     A steam-vessel belonging to the Netherland
Steam-Boat Company, who had previously established steam
boats from Rotterdam to Cologne, left the latter place on Sun
day, and proceeded to Coblentz, where the king of Prussia
was reviewing the troops of the Grand Duchy of the Lower
Rhine. On Wednesday his majesty went on board the steam
boat at half-past eight in the morning, and proceeded down
the Rhine in the first vessel of this kind that had descended
this part of the river. The steam-boat went at a good rate,
and was hailed by the shouts of the people of the numerous
villages. . It returned here, yesterday about ten o'clock, and
proceeded towards Mentz, whence it will ascend to Frankfort.

322       Mr. Ivory     on the     Variation of Density and Pressure
ridian.      But there is one thing indispensable to the success of
both methods.         A degree of the meridian and the length of a
pendulum vibrating in a given portion of time, both vary with
extreme slowness in advancing from the equator to the pole.
.A pendulum that vibrates in a second at the equator, requires
to be lengthened only about 4%;ths of an inch in order to oscil
late in the same time at the pole. The experiments to be
 compared must therefore be made at places as distant from
 one another as possible. Unless this precaution is used, the
 unavoidable errors of observation will bear a considerable
proportion to the minute quantities to be found, and conse
 quently the results will be uncertain and irregular.
    Besides the two methods of investigating the figure of the
 earth by terrestrial experiments, there is another derived from
 astronomical observation.            If the earth and the moon were
 both spherical, the attractive forces which they exert upon one
 another would depend only on their quantities of matter and
 their distance. But as the earth has an oblate figure, the
 moon acts upon the protuberant matter at the equator, and
 causes a nutation of the axis, the theory of which is well
 known.       Now if the moon displace the axis of the earth, that
 luminary must itself be re-acted on, and must undergo some
 change of position in the heavens.             Astronomers have disco
 vered two     inequalities   of the  moon,--one    in longitude and one
 in  latitude,-which,      being    determined    by  actual observation,
 lead directly to a determination of the earth's ellipticity by
 which they are caused.
    When the results obtained from                all
                                                   the degrees that have
been measured are combined with the               pendulum    experiments
 made    in  England    and   France,    and with the determination de
 rived from astronomical observation, the terrestrial ellipticity
has been fixed          atsºn. But this          only the most probable
 quantity; for the discrepancies are         so is
                                                 great   as  prove either

 irregularities    in the figure     ofthe earth.

 has,   in the course       two voyages, made experiments with the
 pendulum     at    thirteen different stations from the equator                  to
  Spitzbergen   in    80°     ofnorth latitude. The distance           the   of
 extreme stations        nearly

 made at stations sufficiently distant from one another, and are

some power of the distance from the centre.     As the densities
decrease from the centre to the    surface, the exponent   of the
power must be negative; and he found that the ellipticities
must be proportional to a certain positive power of the distance.
Therefore the density would be infinitely great, and the ellip
ticity evanescent, at the centre; circumstances which render
the assumption of Clairaut altogether inapplicable to the case                                                              of

conducts immediately to the solution of Clairaut.

 LANDRIAN:        one of the first who made experiments
    on the heating power of the coloured light given by
  the prism, found the greatest heat in the yellow rays.     But
  Rochonf places the maximum of heat between the yellow and
 the red, in a point which he calls sometimes orangé, sometimes
jaune orangé. Sénebier; gives as the result of many experi
 ments, that the red light was always warmer than the violet,
 and the yellow sometimes warmer than the red; and in the
 examples given by him as a confirmation, and which he says
 are the mean of many experiments, the yellow light is found
 to be the warmest.    Herschel’s experiments || differ from
                                                                                                                                             all

    The apparatus just mentioned, consisted                    thermometer       of

 inches and lines, was fixed against the tube.               This scale was
 removed one inch from the bulb, and had there its zero.
 Thus the bulb and one inch             the tube were quite free. Within

                                of   a

each until the liquid became stationary.  The light under ex
amination   only fell on the bulb. A moveable screen, fixed at
a distance of from 12 to 18 inches from the thermoscope,                                   in
tercepted the remaining prismatic colours.                 The screen was
so made that the         opening   through     which the light fell could
be    enlarged   or contracted ad libitum. Sometimes only half
the screen was employed, at others it was removed altogether;
but this is mentioned every time it was done.
     The room in which the experiments were made (mostly
between 11 and 12 o'clock) lay facing the south, was large,
and could be completely darkened.                 The prism was some
times fastened in the        window-shutter,    and no other light was
admitted into the room but that which passed through

I    was convinced        by experiments made                 on

  colder.    If therefore the warmth increased whilst the thermo
  scope was lowered into the prismatic spectrum, the experi

334               Dr.     Seebeck         on the unequal Evolution
approached in most of them to an angle of 60°. With some
of those that deviated more, experiments were made with the
largest and smallest angle, without any material difference of
effect resulting from them.
   As I shall make use in the sequel of the expressions “beyond
the limit of the red, or the violet,” beyond the limit of colour
generally, I will explain here once for all, that in every ex
periment mentioned                I
                          have retained the limits of colours
adopted by Newton and most other natural philosophers; and
thus, like Herschel and other observers, placed the limit of
the red where the bright prismatic red ceases, losing itself in
a smaller edge of a fainter red; and that      have assumed the    I
whole of the coloured spectrum as being included within the
boundary wherein the colours present themselves to the naked

bounds, as will be more fully shown below; yet        did not wish          I
to deviate here, as I did not in my former treatise, from the
                                                                                        .
         manner of expression, because such a practice would
  ave rendered a comparison of my observations with those of
others more difficult.
   Although        I
                 think            I
                           may trust my eyes in recognizing and
distinguishing colours,               I
                              have nevertheless, for the         of
greater security, engaged other persons with eyes sensible to
colours, to determine the limits of the spectrum, and found
their determinations to agree with mine.
  I   have yet to observe, that the thermometer was emptied
every time after being used, and filled afresh for every new
series of experiments; whence the inequality in the figures in
the experiments made at different times, which however agree
in all other points.

   This experiment, which was made under the most favourable
circumstances on the 19th of September 1807, may be consi
dered as being decisive; and it not only serves to confirm the
results of the two preceding ones, but also shows that the ef
fect on the thermoscope extends, within the distance men
tioned, to four inches beyond the limits of the red, and the
entire spectrum.

     Erp.
       35. (7th September 1806.) A prism filled with water,
whose refracting angle was about 40°. The panes of glass
which inclosed the water had a breadth of about four inches.
 The prism was brought as near as possible to the normal posi
 tion, and the spectrum received at the distance of aboutfive feet.
 The same water-prism was applied in Experiment 36. The
 thermometer at the distance of four feet. In both experiments
 the colourless light in the centre of the spectrum always pos
 sessed the greatest degree of heat; the next in degree was the
 light above the yellow. In the red, however, the temperature
                                                                    -
 was much lower; the difference amounting to an inch. It is
 also remarkable, that the temperature in the white border un
 der the blue approached that in the red, it being but three lines
higher.            I
              must not omit to state, that a second and weaker
yellow and red (as first observed by Ritter in glass prisms)
 appeared also in this prism, immediately below the blue.
    Two other experiments (37 and 38) were made with this
water-prism, at distances from the thermometer of from four
to five feet.   Both experiments evinced that close under the
red the heat is much less than in the red or in the yellow. And
Experiment 39, made at the distance of six feet, not only con
firmed the preceding experiments, but proved also that the
heat in the yellow exceeds that in the red *, and this at the
distance mentioned, (yet               all

                of Heat in   the Prismatic Spectrum.         341
phuric acid, the maximum of heat seemed to fall between the
yellow and the red.   I   must however observe, that the experi
ments with the two liquids last named belonged to those which
were made last, and were therefore not so frequently repeated
as might have been necessary, not having been made under
the most favourable circumstances. With sulphuric acid this
was the only experiment.
    In the preceding experiments the prisms had generally the
normal position; and their refracting angles being always turned
downwards, the spectra had, at least at the beginning of every
series of experiments, the lowest station.
    But as (as has been observed) the prismatic colours were
sometimes carried over the thermoscope by turning the prism
round on its axis, and therefore as considerable deviations
from the above position occasionally took place, it was ne
cessary to know what influence this circumstance might have
had on the results, and in fact whether the effect on the ther
moscope was varied by opposite positions, viz, with the greatest
and smallest angle of incidence of the light; by which, in both
cases, the spectrum would be placed higher, with this difference,
that in the former case it would be more compressed, and in
the latter more enlarged, than in the normal position.
    For this purpose   I  made comparative experiments with
prisms of flint and crown glass (Experiments 44 and 45).        I
observed that the heat in the spectrum decreases when the     in
cident angle is greater or smaller than it is in the normal posi
tion; but the place of the greatest heat is not changed, falling
in the flint-glass always beyond the limit of the red. The
same experiments were made with prisms of Bohemian glass
(Nos. 1 and 4), and with a greater angle of incidence, when
the proportion remained the same as in the normal position,
 the heat in the red being greater than below the red, but the dif
 ference being much less: whilst with smaller angles it was the
 same in both, and one inch below the red, greater than in the
 green. The experiments therefore with these two prisms, re
 sembling crown-glass, also confirm the above axiom,--that the
 heat is always greatest in the same prismatic colours in the
 normal position, and is reduced in proportion to the distance
 of the prism from that position.      But then the brilliancy of
  the colours and the intensity of the light in general is also
  much diminished, which ought well to be borne in mind. The
  experiments also confirm the assertion, that the difference of
  warmth of those parts of the spectrum which closely bor
  der upon each other decreases, the more the position of the
  prism deviates from the normal,which is a result of the greater
  dispersion of light and the decrease of  itsintensity.

 342                     Dr. Seebeck          on the unequal Evolution
       By the results of these last experiments
                                              those of the former
 were not only confirmed, but obtained additional weight; for
 it appears from them, that the differences have been found
 rather too small than too great; since the elevation of the spec
 trum above the normal station, whether effected by the turn
ing of the prism or the change of position of the sun, could
not but have an injurious effect on the results obtained.
    Thus the differences of temperature in the different pris
matic colours will be most distinct with the normal position of
the prisms, in clear days without exception. But it is different
when the atmosphere is impregnated with vapours, especially
when they begin to collect before the sun. For then found                                               I
repeatedly, even in this favourable position of the apparatus,
but very small differences in the heat of colours closely bor
dering on one another, especially also between those of the

red and yellow half of the spectrum.
    The light of the sun then assumes a yellowish tinge. It
was to this circumstance that                               I
                                    thought the deviating effect
should be   chiefly attributed. This occasioned the following

   These experiments have not been carried further, as would
have been desirable, since the last experiment was not made
on a favourable day. Their result, however, seems to be, that
the effect of the prismatic red was more weakened by the
orange-coloured glass, than the glimmering light beyond                                                      it,

     DERson on Mr. BURNs's Mode of finding the Latitude by
     Double Altitudes.   By JAMES BURNS, Esq.
     To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         Sir,
THE  remarks made by two of your Correspondents on my
  method for solving the problem of double altitudes seem
 to call for some reply on my part, as they both appear to have
 misunderstood the foundation and object of                                  the first     it.    In
 place then, Mr. Riddle thinks that                “misapprehended  I                the
 nature      the problem altogether,” and asserts that
              of                                                            have as

 is no wonder that the calculations founded on them should be
 so. If this had struck Mr. R. or Mr. H., probably their cri
 tiques “would have been spared.”        It is very little to the
 purpose to tell us that some of the “greatest astronomers
  and mathematicians in Europe” would seem to merit censure
 for their proposed methods, if mine were unobjectionable: but
 no name, however great, can sanction error.              Philosophers
 have long recognised the propriety of Horace's “Nullius ad
 dictus jurare in verba magistri.”           e could enumerate many
 of the   greatest    names in    philosophy   guilty of such errors.
  Newton, for example, in his investigations on the precession
 of the equinoxes, finds that part of it caused by the sun but
 9"; while Euler, the greatest geometer, perhaps, of modern
 times, finds 22", and D'Alembert 23"; that             about 24 times             is,
 the quantity found                 by
                            Newton. And observation proves that
 the former were right.—But           return    our own simple ques

writers.      He proves that there are four distinct species, three
of which had been established by Temminck, whose names
he of course retains; the fourth species, which our author
admits, appears to be the same which Wilson had described
as the Procellaria pelagica: it is an inhabitant of North Ame
rica, but is seen at a considerable distance from our continent,
as is proved by the fact of our author's having killed an indi
vidual of it near the Azores. This species being distinct from
the pelagica of European writers, as well as from the other
species of this genus, our author has applied to it “the name
of Wilsonii, as a small testimony of respect to the memory of
the author of the American Ornithology, whose loss science
and America will long deplore.”                This species, besides                                 its

 Lesueur, whose exertions have furnished this year three                                  in
teresting memoirs, of which the two first deserve particular
notice; the third is still in the hands of the Committee of                           Ex
amination. They are entitled, 1st, “Description of two new
species of the genus Batrachoid of Lacépède.”       2nd,                             “De
scription of several species of the Linnaean genus Raia.” 3rd,
“Description of two new species of Blennius.” . The genus
Batrachoides, established by M. de Lacépède, has received
from Mr. Lesueur considerable modifications.       He discards
from it the B. blennoides and B. Gmelini, included in it by
Lacépède and Risso, and restricts it to the B. Tau of authors,
the B. vernuella published by him in the Annales du Museum
d’Histoire Naturelle, and to the two new species which he de
scribes in this memoir under the names of variegata and Die
mensis; the latter of which was formerly collected by him on
Van Diemen's Land: the other has been recently found on our
coast. Besides making known these two species, Mr. Lesueur’s
paper contains some general observations on the characters of
this genus, which has not yet received much attention from
naturalists, owing probably to the small number of species
known.                   -
   The genus Raia, established by Linné, has been long since
split into many genera, to accommodate all the species that
were found to belong to           it.
                               The necessity      describing fromof
dried specimens has doubtless been the cause          much      the   of             of
uncertainty and confusion attending the descriptions given                                by
authors       of
            the different species     Raia. Mr. Lesueur has

of  Raia Desmarestia, Raia Chantenay, Trygon Sabina, and
Myliobatis Freminvillii, and makes probable that,

pyre, &c., which may well be associated together, as names cal
culated to repel those who are disposed to admire the beauties
of nature and who have an inclination to cultivate scientific na
tural history. . How far preferable is the custom of applying
the names of those naturalists who have enriched science with
new discoveries, or new and valuable observations, to that
which introduces into our pages those chimeras that do not
elsewhere exist than in a morbid or timorous imagination?”
    It has frequently happened that, from the great scarcity or
shyness of certain animals, they have remained undiscovered
for a length of time, even in spots to which naturalists have
frequently resorted. Of this we find a new instance in the
discovery lately made known to the Academy by Mr. Gilliams,
who has described a very beautiful species of Scolopsis caught
by him in the neighbourhood of this city. Mr. Gilliams has
as yet seen but three individuals of this species, which he has
dedicated to his friend Mr. Say.
     The last communication in ichthyology which the Aca
demy received was from Mr. William W. Wood, and is en
titled “Descriptions of four new species of the Linnaean genus
Blennius, and of a new Exocetus.”         This paper has not yet

   Mollusca.-This department has already been enriched by
valuable papers from Mr. Lesueur; and in the last year he
has added to his former observations, by his “Description of
a new species of Cephalopoda, of the genus Loligo.”. The Lo
digos have been so fully studied, and the number of their spe
cies so much increased by this gentleman, that he may almost
 be considered as having appropriated to himself this genus of
 Lamarck's. His last communication makes us acquainted
 with an inhabitant of our bay, which has received from him
                                                                         j,
the name of L. brevipenna.       The individual which our author
observed, appeared to him to resemble the genus Sepiola more
closely than any other Loligo which he had seen.          In the same
communication Mr. Lesueur adverts to the fact of his having,
in the year 1814, observed a species of Sepiola in the
Channel.      This will prevent our erroneously drawing an infe
rence of their non-existence in those waters, from the statement
made by Mr. Blainville that he had never met with them there.
    Vermes.—Mr. Lesueur has described “three new species of
parasitic Vermes, belonging to the Linnaean genus Lernaea,”
which he refers to Mr. Blainville's genera Lerneocera and
Lerneopenna.      In order that two of his species, the cruciata
and radiata, may be included in the former genus,                generic
                                                                   its

Lerneocera not         admitted,
                        be        then Mr. Lesueur’s two         species
will constitute new genus, for which

Lerneaenicus.     The third species which               he

Lerneopenna Blainvillii which inhabits the Exocetus volitans.
   200phytes.—The same able naturalist has contributed               this   to
department     by his investigations     the Holothuria, from the
                                         of
island of St. Bartholomew.       In his classification of these ani
mals, Mr. Lesueur has been led             prefer divisions founded

LVII.           Reply to Mr. DAVIES’s “Further Thoughts on                                   Mr. HE
                    RAPATH's Demonstration.”   By P. Q.

plays towards the party opposed. We may with propriety
observe, that “intaminatis fulget honoribus.”
     Ifin the observation, “whether Mr. Herapath has failed
in his usual precision of expression,” Mr. Davies means to
imply that Mr. H. has written with a little too much brevity
for perfect elementary perspicuity, he is probably not far from
the truth. But this ought not to be charged as a fault so much
on Mr. Herapath as on the limits to which he was of neces
 sity confined.      It would have been impossible to comprise so
 many points, as he has in that paper treated                within any               of,
reasonable      bounds,    had     not     every     he

 most compression.
    As Mr. Davies has transferred his attack from the pre
viously contested points           others,     shallto    my defenceI            in                     of

SINº.   the application of the electro-chemical theory and
 of the doctrine of chemical proportions to mineralogy, a
far surer criterion of the greater or less accuracy of chemical
analyses has been gained; and it has consequently been found
that some minerals with whose composition we seemed pre
viously to have been pretty well acquainted, require in fact a
new examination.      Among these is peridot.
   It is well known that Haüy upon crystallographic grounds
             "...
united into one species the two fossils separated by Werner,
(chrysolite and olivine), and named them peridot. This deci
sion of                     ought first to receive its full con
firmation from    chemistry;  #. with the exception of Haüy's
regular bodies (as they are called), there has not yet been
found to exist a similarity of primitive form with essential
differences in the component parts. This confirmation is in
vain sought for in the specimens of peridot at present known,
which rather evince the contrary; for, if we except Achard’s
analysis of the chrysolite, and Gmelin's examination of the
olivine, the results of which entitle us to suppose that the mine
rals they had in their hands were very different from what they
named them, all the other known specimens correspond in
some degree with the formula y } S for chrysolite, and        S1}       *}

  According to these analyses, the composition of olivine may
very well be expressed by the formula *} s or R. Šº, sup
posing that R indicates the class of isomorphous bodies to
which magnesia and protoxide of iron belong.             we further                 If
compare with this the known analyses of chrysolite, which,
as  I stated, correspond with the same formula, it seems esta
blished also by chemistry that chrysolite and olivine must be
considered one and the same mineral, their chemical relations
being the same, and their integral nature being susceptible of
expression by the formula which         have proposed.    I
   It is well known that olivine often has a marked tendency to
disintegrate.    In order to trace the cause of this more closely
I examined some disintegrated olivine from the top of the                                      Wii

  According to this result the presence of an alkali could not
be conjectured; yet as the presence of alkali often contributes
to the disintegration of minerals exposed to the weather,                                       I
examined the olivine in respect to this particular, and took
a piece, of 1-901 gr., which was a little weathered.                  The
process consisted as usual in igniting it with carbonate of
barytes, separating the silica, and precipitating the solution
with sulphuric acid and caustic ammonia. The fluid sepa
rated from the precipitate was evaporated in a platina capsule
and heated to dryness.            On dissolving the dry mass a little
mixture of a grayish earth remained, which was separated,
and the solution again evaporated.               The remaining white
salt, weighing 0-155 gr., did not fuse with a low red heat:
it readily dissolved in water, and by spontaneous evapora
tion it produced long acicular crystals which showed no ten
dency to be altered by the weather. As it hence followed
that the greatest part of it consisted of sulphate of magnesia,                                 I
again dissolved it in water : a few spiculae of gypsum then
                                  I
remained behind; and decomposed it with acetate of barytes,
then evaporated the fluid which had been freed from the pre
cipitate, ignited the residuum, and deprived it of salt b
boiling water. After the evaporation of the filtered fluid and
 its  ignition in   a   suitable platina crucible,        weight had  its                   in
creased only about 0.0005 gr. On closer examination the
cause   of   this appeared          tosome earthy stains      the bottom,    at
which were not        changed     bybewater, and  which,  without doubt,
proceeded from          alittle residuum      magnesia. According
                                                          of                                    to
 this examination no alkali could have existed              this olivine.   in
   In    regard    to the change which the olivine suffers from the
 influence   of   the weather, from the mere appearance                           of      it,   it
 may    be   concluded that the protoxide                        of

mitted afresh to a careful examination; at the same time that
the more accurate knowledge of their constituents is so nearly
related to the researches concerning the chemical constitution
of meteoric stones; for, as is well known, the basis of most of
these remarkable substances seems to consist of a mineral
similar to the olivine species.—Engaged in an express chemical
investigation of meteoric iron and meteoric stones, Professor
Stromeyer found also occasion to attend to this object, and
now laid before the Royal Society of Göttingen, in the treatise
which has been mentioned, his analyses of these minerals.
   First, the investigations relating to the olivine are communi
cated.   For these, an extremely pure and perfectly undecayed
olivine from the basalts of the Vogelberg at Giessen was used
in preference; for which Professor Stromeyer was indebted to
the kindness of Professor Wernekinck at Giessen and Dr.                                              Thi

    The analysis of the olivine by Klaproth, therefore, states the
oxide of iron and the silica contained in this fossil much too
high, and on the other hand the quantity of the magnesia at
least 12 per cent too low.           From the process pursued by
this chemist, it is easy to perceive how so considerable a pro
portion of magnesia might have escaped him, and how the
silica and oxide of iron must thereby have appeared so much
the greater in quantity.
    According to the experiments of the same chemist, some
lime is also contained in olivine.         But neither in the olivine
from the    Vogelberg,    nor in that from Casalthof in Bohemia,
was there any trace of             and     it;

parated in the metallic residuum. The formation of olivine, on
the other hand, manifestly took place under the co-agency of
water, and therefore under circumstances favourable to the
combination of this metallic oxide.     Perhaps it is also hence
not improbable that the oxide of nickel was taken by the olivine
from the gangue, and it might therefore not be uninteresting to
examine the basalt and the basaltic tufa to ascertain the pre
sence of nickel.   The circumstance also, that oxide of nickel
likewise occurs in the chrysolite may, according to this, very
well accredit the conjecture that this mineral (whose true habi
tat and peculiar appearance we are not yet acquainted with)
exists also in basalts, and by no means has a meteoric origin.
   The analysis of two other fossils of the olivine kind, taken
from two more masses of meteoric iron, concludes this
treatise.
   One of these minerals is met with in a ramous mass of iron
very like that of Pallas, which was found at Otumpa in the pro
vince of Chaco-Gualamba, in South America; and a piece of
which the illustrious M. Von Struve of Hamburg was so kind
as to send to Professor Stromeyer for chemical examination.
   The olivine of this iron is externally like that which was taken
from the Pallas iron as the most perfect specimen.       Its specific
gravity is at 68° F. and barom. 29.429             3-3497. And          in.   =                     in

    This mineral consequently contains for three equivalents of
silica only one of magnesia, and is therefore to be considered
as a trisilicate of magnesia; while the mineral of the olivine
kind, from the Siberian and South American masses, as well
as the olivine from the basalts, and chrysolite, are merely a sim
ple silicate of magnesia.     Whether, moreover, the oxide of

we may conceive, round the middle of the element ds taken for
a centre, an infinity of spherical surfaces, which divide the com
plete circuit into infinitely small arcs, so that the two extreme
spherical surfaces touch it at the two points of this circuit, which
are, one the furthestfrom, and the other the nearest to, the mid

as being composed of two branches terminating at these two
points, and both divided into an equal number of infinitel
small arcs, so that every arc of one branch corresponds wit
that of the other branch comprised between the two same
consecutive spherical surfaces: for two corresponding arcs we
have then the same value of r, and the values of d rare equal,

the general value of the momentum of rotation resulting from
the mutual action of two rectilinear conductors LL", LLu
(fig. 4), situated in the same plane, in order to make each other
revolve round the point of intersection O of their directions.
In order to calculate more easily the value of this momentum,
which we shall call M, we            place that of the mutual ac

   In the year 1822 a new method of observing was introduced
at Greenwich, by means of the reflected images of stars from
an artificial horizon. To apply this to the determination of
the element in question, by comparing two catalogues, one
formed by direct vision, the other by reflection, that co-lati
tude being assumed to be the true one, which made the sum
of the small positive and negative differences equal to zero, and
that was found to be 38° 31' 21", differing by one second from
the determination furnished by Bradley's observations. This
result, however, may involve an error of from a quarter to
half a second, which subsequent observations may diminish.

 more obtuse, and at the instant after separation approximating
 to a rectilinear boundary.    At the emergence of the eastern
 limb of the globe of Saturn a similar effect was observed by
 Mr. Comfield, but not by Mr. Wallis.
    A paper was next read. On the determination of latitudes
by observations of azimuths and, altitudes alone, by M.                  Lit
trow, Assoc. Ast. Soc. This paper includes the consideration
of four cases. In the 1st, the latitude is computed from the
observed azimuth and altitude. In the 2d, two observed alti
tudes are taken, and the two instrumental azimuths at the
same respective moments; and the latitude is found from the
corrected altitudes, and the difference of the azimuths, with
the addition of an approximate latitude. In the 3d case, three
observed latitudes, and three corresponding azimuths, or two
azimuthal differences, are required; and the latitude is thence
determined.      In a 4th case, the problem is solved by means
of a watch instead of an azimuth circle; there are supposed
given, the time of culmination only within half or three-quar
ters of an hour, three altitudes taken within that distance of
the meridian, and their intervals in time; to find the true lati
tude. The solutions to all the four cases are exceedingly sim
ple, and the resulting formulae admit of the utmost facility of
application.
    Lastly, there was exhibited to the Society a model of one
of the large reflecting telescopes made by Mr. John Ramage,
of Aberdeen, and of the stands, frame, and mechanism
for facilitating itsmotions and adjustments. The reading                  of
a  descriptive paper,   by
                         Mr. Ramage, was also commenced; but
 itstermination was postponed until the December meeting.

               On an improved Cross
 ON MIR.       NEwToN’s IMPROVED CRoss For LAND-SURVEYING.
  To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    Sir,
  The                 of the Philosophical Magazine contains
            last Number
some   observations on Mr. Newton's improved cross for land
surveyors.
   The points on the diagonal of a field where the true perpendi
                      I
culars fall are, admit, as readily found by means of the old
cross as by means of the new one; but the measuring of these
or any other straight lines is certainly more accurately and
more expeditiously accomplished by the latter than the former.
“Leander’s” calculations, most probably through mere inad
vertence, are the very reverse of what they ought to-be.                                          In
stead of dividing the fraction + by the numbers 2, 3, 4, &c. he
ought to have multiplied by these numbers; which would have
given, instead of Tºo, Tºr, gº, &c. the numbers z, #, #, &c.
errors increasing in proportion to the length of the lines to be
measured. Now if this new instrument will enable the sur
veyor without any additional trouble to correct or avoid these
errors, there is doubtless an advantage attending the use of                                      it,
whatever may          be
                    the custom     the surveyor

desideratum in British       hydrography.     Authorized surveys
of them   have, it is true,  been made;    but of these some are
almost obsolete, and        are more       all
                                         less partial   defective:or                     or
and    errors

which that remote country has too often been the melancholy
Scene.
     It   not
          is       little surprising, that while the most extended,
                     a
expensive, and minute surveys have been executed,                    order                by              of
the   English   government,         many         of

                                             to                       inland,                 to
commerce; and we duly appretiate the laudable and fostering
care which our statesmen have evinced                  facilitate its exten to

    The Zetland Islands have too long been the bugbear, the
Scylla and Charybdis                       of
                                Northern mariners: hence commerce
has been repelled from them, and one grand source                        their                     of
improvement and prosperity injudiciously obstructed.                      Be
sides, they might afford         secure   refuge
                                            a      and   resting-place,    not
only      vessels trading
          to                       the North Sea, but also

              boisterous weather and unavoidable accidents into
their latitude. And when, superadded                 these circumstances,to
are considered the barbarous and iron-bound nature of the
coast, and the dangerous rapidity and variety                  the currents,       of
it  cannot but         highly
                          be   gratifying      learn that this important
                                                                 to

Mr. Allan, we may consider this important and almost only
deficient link in the chain of evidence that unites the English
fresh-water formations with those of France to be now sup
plied, and hope that this discovery will stimulate others whose
local position affords them opportunity, to persevere in the
attempt to collect further traces of the remains of this remark

  FORMATION OF ORES BY THE ACTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE
                       AND OF WOLCANIC HEAT.
   In a late Number of the Phil. Mag. we mentioned the for
mation of brown haematite by the action of water on cast-iron
pipes. We have now to enumerate, from the same source, some
other facts of a like description.
    Nöggerath, in the third volume of his work entitled Das
 Gebirge in Rheinland, Westphalen, notices the formation of
crystals of red copper-ore on a fragment of a Roman copper
vessel which was dug up near to the city of Bonn.       The inner
and outer surface of the vessel was covered next to the copper
with a delicate layer of red copper in small but beautiful do
decahedral and cubo-octahedral crystals; and immediately over
this was an extremely thin layer of film of a green colour, and
which might be considered as malachite. Nöggerath also ob
served, in a collection of antiquities at Triers, some wrought
pieces of copper, several inches long and pretty thick, which
were found amongst Roman ruins, and appeared to have served
 as architectural ornaments.       They were so corroded on the
 surface, that little of their original form could be observed.
 In some places traces of gilding were visible. Under the green
 crust or aerugo was a layer of well-marked crystals of red cop
 per.    The Roman vessel found near Bonn appears to have
 been   exposed  to considerable heat; therefore the red copper,
 in that case, may have been the result of fusion: but no traces
 of fire could be detected in the copper relics of Triers, nor in
 that of some other specimens we shall now mention. Sage
 observed crystals of red copper on an old copper statue found
 in the Soane in the year 1766. Demeste mentions crystals of
 red copper he saw in the hollows of the fragment of the leg
 of a bronze horse, which had lain for some hundred years un
 derground. Morveau says, the crystals were of two kinds; one
                                  3 D 2                      ruby

ruby-red, being red copper; the others emerald-green, and
these were malachite: and Demeste adds, that some of the
hollows also contained crystals of blue malachite or blue cop
per. Vauquelin informs us, that on examining the fragment of
a statue which had been long buried, he found the exterior
of red copper, and the interior of copper in its metallic state.
It is evident that these changes in the copper, in the speci
mens just enumerated, had been produced by the action of
the atmosphere and of percolating water.        It is equally well
known that similar changes have been        produced   on copper
when fused under particular circumstances.      Examples of this
kind were met with in masses of copper inclosed in the lava            .
 which, in the year 1794, flowed over a considerable space        of
the district of Torre del Greco.     Common copper coins were
converted into red  copper,  and in some specimens the surface
was crystallized. In some of the specimens of brass candlesticks
from Torre del Greco, preserved in the museum of the Univer
sity of Edinburgh, the zinc was separated from the copper.
On some of them there are small brownish crystals of translu
cent blende, numerous octahedrons of red copper, and very
beautiful copper-red cubes of pure copper.         In other speci
 mens from Vesuvius mentioned by authors, the zinc and cop
per have separated, and each appears crystallized in octahe
drons; and also in the state of iron-glance and sparry iron,
have been found in the lava of Vesuvius.       Silver in beautiful
 octahedrons, lead in the state of litharge, and galena, or lead
 glance, in the cubo-octahedral form, have also been collected
from the lava of Torre del Greco.—Vid. Schweigger's Journal.

ON VARIOUS    PLANT'S USED AS TEA    IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
    The plants used as tea are as widely separated from each
 other as the countries themselves are remote. In Mexico and
 Guatimala the leaves of the Psoralea glandulosa are generally
 used as tea; and in New Grenada the Alstonia theatformis of
 Mutis (the Symplocos Alstonia of Humboldt and Bonpland)
 affords a tea not inferior to that of China.       Further to the
 north on the same continent, a very wholesome tea is made
 from the leaves of the Gaultheria procumbens and Ledum        lati
folium.   This last is vulgarly called Labrador tea, and    its use
 was, I believe, first made known   by the late Sir Joseph Banks.
 The most famous     of all American teas, however,  is  the tea  of
 Paraguay,  of  which large quantities are annually imported into
 Peru, Chili, and the States   of Buenos Ayres; and the use       of
itis   souniversal  in South America, that the inhabitants have
 always some   of  this tea ready prepared, whether engaged       in
                                                       occupations

and is sipped, through a silver or glass tube, from a small
vessel called a Maté Pot, which is carried in the hand; or
should the person be on horseback, or engaged in any occu
pation requiring the use of his hands, it is suspended from the
neck by means of a small chain.            It is frequently mixed with
a little lemon-juice, and is used with or without sugar.                   Eu

to observe, that the common black Chinese teas consist chiefly
of the old leaves of the Thea viridis, mixed with those of the
Camellia Sasanqua or oleifera, and sometimes fragments of the
leaves of the Olea fragrans; and that the finest teas, whether

   We have to regret that the indisposition of our valuable correspondent
Dr. Burney has deprived us of the Gosport Register for this month. And
the decease of our much-respected friend Mr. Cary, who for a very long
time kindly supplied our Journal with his meteorological observations, has
occasioned a similar deficiency with regard to London.                   -
   In our next volume we propose to give the register of each month
entire ; considering this to be more useful than the bringing down the ob
servations so near to the day of publication.——Ed.

LXIII.       On the Anatomy         of the    Mole-cricket.  By J. KIDD,
     M.D. and F.R.S.         Reg.      Prof. of Medicine in the University
     of Oxford”.
THE    following observations contain the principal points of
  a laborious examination of the anatomical structure of the
gryllotalpa or mole-cricket; and if                  I
                                          dare hope that that ex
amination has been conducted with any thing like adequate
accuracy,     Ineed not apologize for the length of the details
with which the account of it is accompanied, since Cuvier has
affirmed of an entire volume written by Lyonnet on the ana
tomy of a single species of caterpillar, that it contains not one
word that is useless.
   Natural science indeed has now arrived at that point, in
which individual detail is requisite for the acquisition not only
of a surer basis of classification of species, but also of more
correct principles of general physiology.    Independently how
ever of these considerations, the insect which is the subject
of the present communication is so singular in           structure       its
and habits, and          some parts
                                                 its of
                       is   in           the world     formidable       so
to  the agriculturist,       as   to
                              render    history peculiarly inter
esting.

its general appearance; Vermis cucurbitarius, from the mischief
it  does    tocucumber-beds.     By the French naturalists                         it   is
called Courtilière.                          -

is

                                              Rösel, published                          at
Nuremberg         in
                  1749.   This account      accompanied   is    the                by
best engravings also         of
                           the external characters     the animal       of
in    its
        different states: and the value                    of
                                              these engravings                          is
greatly enhanced by the accuracy with which they are co
loured.
   Rösel says that about the month          June      July, rarely
                                                          of        or

she deposits her eggs in one heap, to the number of three hun
dred or more; and dies within a few weeks afterwards.                      At
the end of about a month the            young    mole-crickets are       pro
duced, and appear, on a hasty survey, to bear a general re
semblance to the ant. Between the time of their birth and
the commencement of winter the young animals cast their
skin three times: they                       lie
                                 dormant during the winter, deeper

and during this period cast their skin for the fourth time.
About May they leave their winter-quarters, and                    this time             at

  It    appears from Rösel’s account, that while very young
these insects are gregarious, but not afterwards: that they are
usually found         the vicinity

 may be heard at the distance of some yards; but when made
 by numerous individuals at the same time it may be heard, as
I  have reason to believe, at the distance of some hundred yards,
 provided the air be in a favourable state.              have usually       I
 found the insect within a foot and a half of the surface, and
in parts where the peat was neither quite dry nor very moist;
of such a consistence indeed as is most favourable to the
 mining operations of the animal.
    The accounts of different authors differ as to the food of the
mole-cricket.     Having kept several individuals in glass vessels
during some weeks,                  I
                          observed that of        kinds          all
                                                             vegetable               of
food they preferred the potatoe, while cucumber they hardly
 touched; but      raw meat were offered them they attacked
                      if                                                                       it
with  great  greediness,  and      preferencein     every thing else.
                                                                    to
And when      they  had been    kept, though   even but for      short                    a
time, without any food, they did not hesitate             attack each       to
other;     in
            which case the victor soon devoured the flesh and
softer parts         of
                  the vanquished.      As have not unfrequently
                                                           I

the  body, I  have  very little doubt  that, although   captivity may
increase their ferocity, they are not, even             natural state, in   a
free from each other's attacks.          they are carnivorous, they
                                                   If
probably feed             on
                    worms and various larvae, which are abun
dant  in the peat-bogs   above mentioned, for        have repeatedly I
found the horny and indigestible parts                          of

 this extremity, which is of a honey-yellow colour, is perfectly
 smooth, while every other part of the palpi has a rough and
 hairy surface. In their natural position the palpi are bent and
 projected forward, so as to resemble the fore legs of a horse
 in the act of cantering.
        The antennae, which   are situated near the articulation of the
  mandibles, consist of a great number of minute segments, re
  sembling beads of a circular form. The number of these beads,
  which varies in different instances, is usually from 100 to 110;
  rarely more or less: but it is worth noticing that in examining
  the two antennae of the same individual,                             I
                                                     sometimes found the
 number of beads greater in one than in the other; and as the
  terminal bead differs in its form from all the rest, the result of
 the examination is less open to doubt than it would otherwise
 have been.       Each bead is united to the one that precedes and
 the one that follows              it,

to whom I am indebted for the principal drawing which ac
companies this paper,) as a protection for the vertical transpa
rent portion.
    The thorax *.—The form of this part is that of an irregular
cylinder, passing into a cone towards the anterior part: the
upper portion and the sides, which are covered with a re
markably smooth down resembling the finest velvet, form a
horny case of considerable thickness and strength; which con
tains, or, more properly speaking, is almost entirely occupied
by the very large and powerful muscles which move the fore
legs. It is divided longitudinally into two equal parts, by an
almost bony septum of a complicated form: this septum upon
the whole bears an obvious resemblance, but in an inverted
position, to the deep sternum, together with the furcular cla
vicle of birds; and is destined indeed to a similar use,_to give
attachment to the powerful muscles which are to move the
anterior extremities.    It differs however from the correspond
ing part in birds in two considerable points. . It differs, first,
in consisting of two laminae instead of one: these laminae are
parallel to, but distinctly separated from each other, so as to
give passage to the oesophagus, and room for the attachment
of muscles which assist in moving the adjacent parts. It dif
fers again from the sternum of birds by having a very hard
spine, which resembles a common thorn, attached to the                                               in
ferior and posterior edge of the furcular bone, and passing
rather obliquely downwards and backwards.              This process
serves for the attachment of numerous muscles which adhere
very firmly to        it,                                   on

    It might think be asserted, without the fear of contradic
tion, that throughout the whole range of animated nature
there is not a stronger instance of what may be called inten
tional structure, than is afforded by that part of the mole
 cricket which       I
                    am now to describe”.
    The natural and constant position of this member is worth
noticing; the palm, as it may be called, facing outwards, and
 the claws ranging not in a horizontal but a vertical line, so
 that none of them but the lowermost, and not even this neces
 sarily, touches the surface on which the animal is walking.
 Accordingly the insect does not make much use of                          fore            its
legs  in wa<U+017F>king; and,        irritated,

is  formed by the four claws, while the apex                 situated       the  is            at
joint connecting this with the preceding part:                   which form    by
 and disposition, two important objects are gained; for the
joint  is thus capable           of
                                  much greater extent
                                      a                         motion than         of
it  could have possessed had the articulating surface been more
 than  a   mere point; and           the same time, the greater extent
                                           at
of   the base enables            it act with more powerful and more
                                      to
 rapid effect than could have been otherwise produced. The
 four claws which form this base constitute the proper bur
 rowing instrument; and their shape and structure are beauti
 fully adapted      the purpose: for instead

tain particles of the excavated earth; which, by filling up the
indentations of the claws, would necessarily impede their due
action. To obviate this inconvenience, an exceedingly curious
instrument is attached to the upper part of the concave sur
face of this member: this instrument consists of two claws,
closely resembling those already described, having by their
side a small brush as it were, which terminates in two spines.
These two claws, together with the piece bearing the spines,
arise from a single piece, or handle, which is articulated in
such a manner as to move in a plane parallel to that in which
the four claws are placed, but in a direction opposite to that
in which they are moved: they are also placed in such a man
ner that their points and cutting edges are opposed to the
points and cutting edges of the true claws; and hence the two
parts, thus opposed to each other, act like the blades of a pair
                                      I
of shears. When first considered this mechanism, and re
membered that in the localities where             had found the animal I
the earth was    frequently   traversed    by  fibrous vegetable roots,
                                                      of its
which must necessarily retard            progress,      supposed that           I                              it
used this instrument            pair
                                 as   a  shears       cut through those     to
fibres.     ItisRösel's opinion, however, that the instrument                                                  is
intended     to
              clear the true claws                    of
                                         the dirt that may from time
                  upon        clog  them;    and unless both opinions
beto
    time collect        and
    true, Rösel's appears the more probable.—But have not                                 I

caudiform appendage to the other wings, from under which
they emerge.         When folded, (and they fold themselves longi
tudinally like a fan,) their very delicate texture is protected by
the following simple contrivance. In each wing the two ex
terior longitudinal nervures, with their intervening membrane,
are comparatively strong and thick; and these form the lateral
walls of the wings when folded.
    In each wing also there are two other nervures not far from
the former, and circumstanced like them with respect to
strength; which, when the wings are folded, close together so
as to form a horizontal covering, or roof, of sufficient strength
to protect the subjacent membrane from ordinary accidents.
As the narrow case formed by the wings thus folded extends
beyond the extremity of the abdomen, and might easily slip
off so convex and smooth a surface, such an accident is guarded
against by the contrivance already described, namely, an ap
paratus of hairs or bristles placed on either side of the upper
surface of the last segment but one.
    The digestive organs”.-It is mentioned in the 48th letter
of White's Natural History of Selborne, on the authority of
anatomists who have examined the intestines of the mole
cricket, that “from the number of                stomachs  its  maws, there           or

have a tendency to force a part of any expressed fluid back
into the oesophagus, we may expect this organ to be so con

in Sir Everard Home's          Comparative     Anatomy, vol. i. pl. 84,
as   belonging   to the   Cape  grasshopper:     it was originally consi
dered by Mr. Hunter, and is considered                          at present,
as answering to the liver of the higher classes of animals.
    Each of these tubes springs out of a common cavity in
which the white tube from the intestine terminates; but at
their free extremity they are                    all
                                         impervious.       Each tube ap

structure of these tubes: their diameter for about one third
of   their course from the closed extremity               very small, andis
they are colourless and apparently empty; after which they
suddenly undergo             considerable enlargement, become yel

    upon observing them with a magnifying lens, I perceived that
    they exactly resembled a crystallized rosette of brown pearl
     spar.   Upon being removed and submitted to the requisite
     experiments, they proved to be of considerable hardness,
     sparry in their structure, and insoluble either in boiling water
    or alcohol; but they were dissolved with rapid effervescence
    in diluted muriatic acid. These calculous concretions were
    probably the result of diseased action in the vesicular glands,
    round the orifices of the excretory ducts of which they had
    been deposited.
        The blood.—Upon wounding the animal in almost any part
     of the body, even in cutting off a portion of the caudal an
     tenna, there oozes out a very clear thin fluid of a bright honey
    yellow colour, having sensibly alkaline properties, and co
    agulating either by heat or by the addition of alcohol.                  A
    quantity of this fluid, weighing 1.85 grain,
    under an exhausted receiver, in which was placed dry muriate      .#
                                                                  evaporated
    of lime, left a solid residuum of a bright golden yellow colour,
    which weighed 0.25 grain; this residuum was brittle, and
    had the general properties of solid albumen. The foregoing
    characters render it highly probably that the yellow fluid dis
    tributed through the body of the insect resembles in                    na              its
    ture the serum of common tººd and there can be no doubt,

  mation of mineral crystals, which are unorganized bodies, the
 attraction by which the component particles are aggregated is
 regulated by laws the most systematically framed and observed:
  and whoever has viewed with any attention that wonderful mo
 nument of human industry and sagacity,the AnatomicalMuseum
 of John Hunter, and has there seen the proofs of a sangui
 neous circulation in animals of an order so low that they can
 hardly be said to have any specific form or substance, will al
 most necessarily be disposed to expect a similar provision in
 a class of animals whose general structure is so elaborately
 and beautifully organized as that of insects. . But I shall again
 advert to this subject after having described the tracheal sy
 stem or respiratory organs of the insect under consideration.

 all animated beings,       admitted into the bodies

    420                   1)r.     Kidd       on the     Anatomy
    terous and lepidopterous insects, there are no stigmata, dis
    cernible at least either to the naked eye, or a common magni
    fying lens.
        But, to return to the stigmata of the gryllotalpa, the first in
    order, beginning from the 'head, is situated very near the lower
    part of the posterior ridge of the thorax. This stigma, not to
    object to the term in the present instance, is apparently con
    nected with all the tracheae both of the thorax and of the head
    itself. It differs remarkably in size and form from         the rest;             all
    for instead of   being   mere dot
                              a            point,   or    elongated fis

     sure, bounded       by
                         two horny lips. The second stigma, which
     somewhat resembles        form, though

                                      these lines.
     I    may state from repeated observations, that the stigmata,
    taken generally, are not the terminations                           of
                                                        single tubes: very
    frequently two, and often more than two, tracheae originate
    from the same stigma; and very soon after the commencement,
    one or even two of these tracheae subdivide into numerous
    branches, which follow         nearly
                                        as      may      as

parts on which they are respectively distributed; but as no
adequate object, nor indeed any object of importance, would
be gained by the description of a distribution which is not
marked by any physiological peculiarity, I shall only insist on
such points as appear to me to be either new or hitherto not
sufficiently elucidated.
     The tracheae of insects are generally described as tubes
constructed of a spiral thread, the successive coils of which
are closely in opposition with each other; such a structure is
represented in Swammerdam's plates, and I have no doubt
from his acknowledged accuracy that he represents what he
observed. It has not however happened to me, with the ex
ception of one equivocal instance, to perceive such a structure
in the mole-cricket, the character of the tracheae of which va
                                                                   j
ries in different parts of the insect; for sometimes they resem
ble the pulmonary tracheae of the higher classes of animals, in
having an annulated structure; and sometimes they appear as
tubes of a perfectly uniform substance like cuticle, or some
very thin and unorganized membrane.             It is generally under
 stood that the tracheae of insects        penetrate   each organ and
 every part of the body; and certainly the case is                in the
instance before us. Thus, in that brush of capillary yellow
 tubes supposed to constitute the hepatic system, the total num
 ber of which amounts to 150 or 200, there is reason to believe
 that each tube is accompanied by a distinct trachea coiled
 round it in a long spiral.        Again; the two medullary cords
 which connect the several ganglions of the nervous system,
 are in their natural state united together by means of the
 branches of a tracheal tube which runs between them, a simi
              .#.
 lar tube being attached to the exterior edge of the cords; and
 the surface             may be called the brain of this insect, is as
 beautifully characterized by the ramifications of the tracheae
 which pervade      it,   as
                         the surface      the pia mater
                                             of                of
                                                             the human
 brain   by  the blood-vessels which      penetrate  that membrane            in
  every direction.
    In   meditating       on
                         the difficult problem         the sanguineous
                                                         of

    The upper surface of the brain is covered by a mass of soft
substance somewhat resembling loose fat.
    The sexual organs of the female”. –These organs consist of
two ovaries, which occupy a considerable portion of the upper
part of the abdomen, and terminate by a narrow duct in a
common cavity or uterus, which opens externally under the
posterior edge of the last segment but one of the ventral sur
face of the abdomen.      Behind the uterus is an oblong white
body, which originating from a cul-de-sac, and then doubling
on itself in the form of a slender tube, terminates in the uterus.
The contents of this body resemble a thin white paste. The
ovaries are irregularly pear-shaped, and consist of a transpa
rent membrane irregularly convoluted, through which the
ova, enveloped in a gelatinous medium, are easily distinguish
ed. In the same ovary the ova are frequently of different sizes
 and colours; those which are the largest, and which I sup
 pose to be impregnated, are of a brownish yellow colour: they
 resist a considerable degree of force before they burst, and the
 contents when pressed out melt as it were into a soft jelly,
 leaving a tough membrane which enveloped them. The small
 er ova are of various sizes and of nearly a white colour, and
 of a much more slender and compressed form than those
 which   I have supposed to be impregnated. This difference in
 the  degree   of maturation corresponds with a fact stated by
  Rösel, that the mole-cricket does not deposit           the eggs        I all
  of the season     one time. In
                      at              few instances  a  found two
 or three ova which had entered the narrowest part                 the                 of

   The testicles of the male are situated similarly to the ovaries'
 of the female, and are not very unlike in general appearance
  to the ovaries of young females: they differ however in being
  divided pretty deeply into several unequal lobes, the free ex
  tremities of which look towards each other. They send out
  each a very fine capillary tube or duct; which, descending to

   Casting of the skin.-The following are the only observa
tions      I
        have had an opportunity of making as to this point of
the history of the mole-cricket.   In the process of moulting,
the skin of the abdomen  appears to split longitudinally down the
middle of the   upper part; and the skin of the thorax separates
in a similar direction; but the skin of the head only separates
partially in that direction, and then splits between the stem
mata, in a direction towards each of the antennae; so that the
line of separation somewhat resembles the lambdoidal suture
of the human skull.
       corneae of the eyes are cast with the rest of the skin,
     The
asin the case of the snake; but they lose their transparency,
and become of a grayish white colour.
  Even the covering of the claws is cast.
     The newly exposed surface of the whole body is covered
with the same kind of down as that which covered the prece-                 .
ding skin; except in the case of the long bristly hairs of the
caudal antennae, which apparently are produced afterwards.
The colour of the body immediately after the casting of the
skin is yellowish white, and it remains of that colour for a few
hours: it afterwards gradually darkens.
    The organ of sound.—I have very little doubt that the pecu
liar sound which is characteristic of this insect is produced by
                         I
the wings; for have observed in several individuals in their
                                  lº.
perfect state, that, when irritated, they will separate their upper
wings by a brisk motion                 from each other; and that
upon their being suddenly brought back to their natural posi
tion, a sound is at the same moment produced, resembling that
which          I
          have heard the insect spontaneously produce during
the season of summer: but could not fix the power of pro
                                     I
ducing this sound to either sex exclusively. .                   -
    There is a peculiar organ, forming a part of the common           in
teguments of the abdomen, and situated between the fourth
and fifth stigma on each side; the anterior portion of which
consists of a tense membrane, like fine parchment, of a semi
lunar form: this organ from              its
                                     individual character might        be

of a solid nucleus covered with one or more fluids.
   The labours of Maclaurin and Clairaut are here classed to
gether, because they are confined to investigating certain pro
perties of elliptical spheroids. But why is it necessary to sup
pose a particular figure? Ought not the
we suppose it fluid, to be deduced from the general laws of                #.

equilibrium? What is it that makes the investigation suc
ceed when an elliptical spheroid is supposed, thus seeming to
exclude every other figure? Is there but one figure of equi
librium ? And, if this be the case, how is the demonstration            -
to be made out?

discussion, it may be observed here that, in what follows, the
value of the integral is not estimated by the ordinary rules.
The reasoning turns on this principle: that whatever is proved
of every individual element or differential must be true of the
aggregate or integral.          No principle certainly can be more
clear or less exceptionable; and              that we have      all                                to

   =r         –

finite when n = 3, and infinitely great when n is greater than
 3.   In both cases the demonstration fails: in the one, at least
 some further discussion is necessary; and in the other, the ele

both infinitely great, instead of being evanescent.         The equa

Litchfield in Connecticut. The progressive, as our author
terms this variety, is described as a six-sided prism, having
four emarginated edges terminated by a dihedral summit.
   Dr. Troost’s last memoir, which is still in the hands of the
Committee of Examination, contains observations on the mi
nerals discovered at Franklin, New Jersey.
   Mr. Bowen has furnished the Academy with two communi
cations, one of which is an analysis of a copper ore, which ap
pears to be a bisilicate of copper with water, and which oc
curs at Somerville in New Jersey.              Mr. Bowen's analysis
proves the absence of phosphoric acid, which had been sup
posed to be one of the ingredients of this mineral.
   A mineral which was discovered by Dr. M'Clellan at Say
brook, in Connecticut, in 1817, has been examined by Mr.
Bowen, and proved to be new : he has dedicated it to Pro
fessor Silliman.      It bears some analogy to anthophyllite,
and was described under that name in Cleaveland's second
edition.   It occurs in rhomboidal prisms, and has but one
cleavage parallel to the longer diagonal.              analysis proves   Its
it   to

charcoal are well known, and have excited much interest, and

       Thus the difference in the statements of the philosophers
 mentioned at the beginning of this essay, respecting the place
 of the greatest heat, will also be more easily understood. Those
 who did not make use of similar instruments could not obtain
  similar results. There have, however, been instances in which
  prisms of the same kind were used by different observers, and
  still they pretended that their results were different.          We will
 now try whether by a closer examination and comparison of
 the experiments made by those natural philosophers,              to which
  we may also add those made subsequently by Wünsch, Berard,
 and Ruhland,-a reconciliation of the existing contradictions
 may not be obtained.
     But before doing so       I   will class together the chief results
 of   my   experiments.
     1. An increase of heat is effected in all spectrums, which is
 always least at the extreme limit of the violet.                          -
     2. Thence it increases progressively through the blue, green,
 and yellow, to the red; and

 viz.     in the water-prism (Experiment 39); and, according                        to
 M. Wünsch's experiments, also with prisms filled with spirits
 of   wine and oil   of   turpentine.
     4.   Some liquids, viz.       aperfectly clear solution       salam of
 moniac and corrosive sublimate, and likewise concentrated and
 colourless sulphuric acid, had the maximum                        of
                                                             heat between
 the yellow and the red,—in the orange. (Experiments 40–

     In  the two first positions,           all
                                           observers agree; but not                so
in  the others.     Many     have even   thought     superfluous     men      to

beyond the red: nor are we told what relation this prism
bears to the others which Herschel examined.            He merely
says (Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 442) that he also made experi
ments with prisms of white glass, crown-glass, flint-glass, and
water; and that “he found with all of them
rays beyond the visible red rays.”      He then merely mentions
a few instances of heat half an inch and an inch beyond the
                                                           heating
red, but not of that in the red itself; thus leaving it uncertain
                                                                                     j                    447
where the maximum of heat was found with these prisms.
Since Herschel was not sparing in the communication of his
experiments, he would not have withheld any comparative
experiments he had made on those prisms respecting the
heat in the two places mentioned.         therefore suppose that      I
                                               .
he contented himself with     simply  investigating  the heat be
yond the spectrum, concluding that the effect would be the
same in     It all
               the rest   the spectrum
                                     of          was with his first        as   it
prism.       would have been       desirable that      should have                        he
explained himself               on
                        this head,      well         the quality as             as   on                    of
his first prism, which     am inclined
                                 I          suppose      have been    to                     to
of flint-glass.
   Nor did Herschel his other investigations place the ther
                                 in
mometer       in   the prismatic colours; but only into the violet,
                     all
green, and red, and beyond the red, and once also beyond
the linit     the violet; wherefore                         of he
                                                 missed the discovery that
              of
with some prisms the maximum                    heat falls into the yellow
and orange.
   Sir H.        Englefield, who confirmed Herschel's experi
                 C.
ments, made use             only one prism; but
                                of                          does not state           he

never carried his thermometer beyond the limit                    the spec                   of
trum; and Leslie mentions but one experiment, and that made
in  1797 :  from which,           least,
                                      at    does not appear that

       et it has been shown by the above experiments that even
     there the effect on the thermometer is still continued.                To
     seek for   any  other  explanation   of this deviation would be use
     less, since Mr. L. has not thought proper to give us any de
     tails of his experiments.
         M. Wünsch, who has also appeared as an opponent of
     Herschel, maintains in the collection of the results of his ex
     periments *, that

 periments on the difference of heat in the red and in the orange
 of his flint-glass prism; in twelve of which he found the heat

450              Dr. Seebeck              on the unequal                     Evolution
     Of Landriani's            and Senebier's experiments we know but
little. Senebier says that the heat in the red was always greater
than in the violet, but sometimes greater in the yellow than in
the red. He seems to have used a mercurial thermometer
without the bulb being blackened, whence the differences proved
very small: for instance, between the violet and the red only
Tºth degree of Reaumur. He says his prism was English, but
Whether of flint- or crown-glass, he does not state.
   From        allthese remarks                    be on
                                         the investigations       these na               of
tural philosophers,           will
                                it      seen that the contradictions                               in
their observations and assertions, apparently               important, are        so
in effect   trifling;   but that several results       which,    considered
singly, seemed          contradict each other, when compared with
                          to
others and arranged with similar ones serve to confirm new
facts,    orsuch      as   #. not yet been sufficiently noticed.
I     will, however, now proceed             prove by experiments (also
                                                             to
important      in  other  respects)   that the above positions derived
from   my    observations             do
                                  not embrace        cases.                 all

was yet however sufficiently bright that, when the rays                                            of
the sun passed through             and the third side which had kept
its  polish,    a  spectrum           of it
                                   tolerably brilliant colours was pro

All gave the same result; the heat below the red being always
                                          or by
greater than          the red,

 obtained a    brighter    spectrum; but at the same time the red, re
 ceived at a distance of 6 feet, immediately fell lower by 2 Paris
 lines than it had done before. The same circumstance, then,
must have occurred with the bright prism; perhaps the limit
of the red expanded in it still lower, and                centre might have

 the same result may                seen from Experiment 22; which

 very faint spectrum, and where the maximum - heat still fell                       of

 might be rendered visible by concentration, than that the light
 existing there should be the cause of the heat. The conviction
 that the solar light was confined within the limits marked by
 Newton, and that therefore no light could be found beyond
 but such as came there by accident and irregular dispersion,
 may have induced Herschel to leave, in his investigations
 of the illuminating power of prismatic colours, the space be
 yond them unexplored; at least we find none respecting it in
 his microscopical investigations. Whether therefore there was
 any light there, and what were                        its
                                    effects, remained undecided.

  by oxygen gas, is very unfit for the fusion of charcoal, which
  when exposed to heat and oxygen passes off in the form of
  carbonous oxide, or carbonic acid gas;—but the opposite is
  true of the ignition of the deflagrator; in producing which,
  oxygen has little or no agency, and with whose effects it can
  not materially interfere, both on account of the excessive rare
  faction, and the vapour of- carbonaceous matter, produced by
  the extreme heat.
      The fusion of plumbago by the former was readily effected
  by me more than twenty years ago, as may be seen in my
  memoir on the supply and application of the blowpipe.                  The
  same result was       subsequently    accomplished      by   Professor                                Sil
  liman, and now, agreeably to the memoir before us, by Profes
  sor Vanuxem himself. According to the analysis mentioned
  in this memoir, in which plumbago is thus admitted to be fu
  sible, it differs from carbon only in containing three parts, in
 a hundred, of iron.          Upon what ground then has Professor
 Vanuxem been so          incredulous,    respecting the fusibility of car
 bon, as to believe more readily that Dr. Macneven had ob
 tained from it a globule of iron, than that Professor -Silliman
 could accomplish               its
                             fusion?

                    titude Problem, by E. RIDDLE, Esq.
     To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Sir,                                                     -
     S Mr. Burns admits that the method which he         proposed
      for finding the latitude is inapplicable unless the true ap
 parent times are given, and he now perceives that before these
 times can be known the latitude must be discovered by some
 other process, he admits therefore that                            I
                                                   was right in stating
 that his   “proposed    solution is not a solution to the problem
 at all,”—we are on that subject perfectly agreed.
    On another point however, and that a more important one,
I  shall simply contrast a paragraph in Mr. B.'s former com
 munication with one on the same subject in his reply. In his
 former letter, when speaking of the data on which he proposed
 to found his solution, he says, “All that is necessary to be
known       is,
             the time, the interval between the observations, and
the  altitudes;           all
                          which, from the improved state
                                of                                   our                        of
chronometers and other instruments, may                                  be
#.
                                                       known with the
           exactness.”     This     all that   is says            he
                                                           the subject.           on
   utin his reply          he
                       says, “When mentioned the chronometer,
                                                    I
I  did so, not for the purpose         deducing from
                                                   of     the apparent        it
time, but merely                to
                         determine the interval.”
I     pointed out that Mr. Burns was wrong              attributing the      in
discrepancies between the results             calculations   of his me—                    by
thod, and the approximate method                 Dr. Brinkley, of    the                        to
principles                 method,   and Mr.
                  he of
                the latter                                          B.
                                                    now admits that on
this point       was wrong; but,          way           by
                                                  apology for his mis
                                                                  of
take,   he  says that            he
                           has discovered “that the interval given
in  the Doctor's example          incorrect;” or,
                                              is             afterwards      as   he
varies the   charge,   “the data        Dr. B.'s  example
                                                    in       are incon
gruous.”
    Now this apology           singularly unfortunate one; for the
                                      is  a

 mate times given in the problem only for the purpose of finding
 the interval.
     In my remarks on Mr. Burns's letter      stated that “Mr.I
  Burns altogether misapprehends the nature of the problem;
 for he assumes as known, not only the interval of time between
 .
 the observations, but the true apparent time of each observa
 tion.”     I
            noted the mistake in his assumption in italics.  Mr.
 Burns, however, in referring to this remark, prints it the “ap
 parent time and the interval; ” and other observations in his
        show that the typographical transposition was not acci
   ental.
    Having before shown that Mr. Burns had failed in giving
any solution to the double altitude problem, and having now
shown that he has not rightly stated the cause of his mistake,
 I take my leave of the subject, as the peculiar method of trial
and error now proposed by Mr. Burns for the solution of this
problem is in no danger whatever of being adopted. Mr. Burns
is right in remarking that “no name however great can sanc
tion error,” and he is fully entitled to                all
                                            the consolation that
can be derived from the consideration that even Newton made
a  mistake.            am, sir, your obedient servant,

    The survey of Capt. King commenced on the north-east
 coast of Australia,-  about the latitude of 21° south, and pro

                                                            southward,
                                                      25°,-where
 coast had been examined by the French expedition under
                                                                      Gulf of Carpen

  Capt. Baudin.     The chasm in Capt. King's specimens has
 been   supplied  by those collected on the shores of the Gulf of
  Carpentaria by Mr. Brown, who accompanied Capt. Flinders
 in his survey of the coasts of New Holland.
     The land visible from the sea on the north-east coast, is in
 general mountainous, as far north as Cape Weymouth, be
 tween the latitudes 12° and 13° (south).          A high and rocky
 range especially, which begins about latitude 25°, is continued
 northward in a direction nearly parallel to the shore for more
 than 150 miles without interruption. The outline and aspect of
 this range, and of several other groups of mountains, are irre
 gular, and resemble those of primitive tracts: peaked summits
 are of frequent occurrence both on the mainland and the ad
jacent islands.     Mount Dryander, about latitude 20° 12, one
 of the chief mountains, is nearly 4500 feet high; Mount                         Hin
 chinbroke, lat. 8° 22', is more than 2000 feet; and several other
 mountains on this coast are of considerable elevation.
    Along this part of the coast granite has been found, in de
 tached points, through a space of about 500 miles: and rocks
 of the floetz-trap formation occur in several of the islands of
 the shore.
    The coast-line, on the north of latitude 14°, is thrown back
                                                   of its
 about 40 miles to the westward of            previous course; and,
 about the same    point,   the elevation     the land declines: the
 general height      the mainland about Cape York, the north
                     of
 eastern point   of Australia,      not more than 400
                                         is                500 feet.   or
    The eastern shore          of
                              the Gulf        of
                                           Carpentaria,   occupying               a
space  of  about 500 miles more, north            south,     very low,
                                                            to              is
and   very  uniform       its outline. The rock on the shore,
                          in                                                      at
 Coens River, the only point examined upon this coast, was                             º
found to be calcareous sandstone of recent formation. The west

Carpentaria, and are remarkable for the similarity of their
structure and their uniform direction, appear to consist prin
cipally of quartzose sandstone and conglomerate, reposing
upon primitive rocks. The level of the mainland of the north
coast from aboutlongitude 135° to Melville Island, about 131°,
is in general low, and is interrupted by the streams named    Li
verpool and Alligators Rivers; the last of which consists, in
fact, of three separate streams or branches.
    The specimens from Gouldburn's Islands, on the north of
this part of the coast, consist of reddish quartzose sandstone.
    Cambridge Gulf, about longitude 128° and latitude 15°, is
one of the most remarkable inlets on the north-west of       Au
stralia.    It has been traced to more than 60 miles from the
sea, between hills from 150 to 400 feet in height, which have
in general flat summits, and are composed of sandstone of a
reddish hue and of the same characters with that already men
tioned. The specimens from Lacrosse Island, at the entrance
of this Gulf, are not to be distinguished from the slaty strata
of the old red sandstone which occur in the banks of the Avon,
between Clifton and the Severn.                       -
    The outline of the north-west coast is remarkably broken;
and the shore is studded with very numerous islands; the
forms of which, as well as of the hills on the mainland, are
remarkable for their flat summits. In two detached points
about 70 miles apart, Port Warrender and Careening Bay,
epidote has been found in considerable quantity, both cry
 stallized in veins, and in a compact form as a component of a
                           º
rock of a conglomerated and amygdaloidal structure. Prince
 Regent's River has nearly a rectilinear course, from north-west
 to south-east, for more        60 miles; and its banks of sand
 stone are in some places between 300 and 400 feet high. The
 coast to the south-west of Prince Regent's River has not yet
 been completely surveyed; but several openings have been ob
 served there, of such width as to render the existence of rivers
 not improbable.
    The shore on the western coast is in several places covered
 with extensive dunes of sand, with which are associated in
 many instances beds and masses of a very recent arenaceous
 breccia, abounding in shells, concreted by carbonate of lime.
 This formation, which is particularly remarkable in the islands

 is analogous to that which occurs very extensively in Sicily,
 at Nice, and several other places on the shores of the Medi
 terranean, and of the West India Islands, and on many parts
 of the coasts within the Tropics. In New Holland it generally
 consists of sand cemented by stalagmitic or                  Car

bonate of lime, containing angular fragments of a compound
of the same nature, but previously consolidated and broken,
along with numerous shells and fragments of shells, very nearly
resembling those of the adjacent seas. Its date appears to be
more recent than that of the beds which constitute the Paris
and London basins; but anterior to the accumulation of the
diluvial gravel, and possibly coeval with that of the crag of
Suffolk, and the eastern coast of England; though the strata
are in several respects different from these last-mentioned de
posites.
     The calcareous concretions of New Holland have in some
instances a tubular and stem-like appearance, and have thence
been mistaken for corals and petrified branches of trees.
   On a general view of the north and north-west of New Hol
land, it will be observed that the outline of the coast, in several
distant quarters, has a direction nearly uniform, from south
west to north-east; which is the course also of the remarkable
ranges of islands on the north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
It appears also that reddish sandstone of ancient date is very
abundant throughout the north and west coasts; and it is not
altogether improbable that the prevailing direction of the
strata may be that above mentioned.

 had been mentioned as a remarkable phaenomenon, yet he
 would not wish to be understood as supposing that such a cir
 cumstance had never previously occurred, nor was likely to
 9ccur again. The fact was, that from the great attention
 had been paid by astronomers to the discovery of these bodies
within these few years, and the interest excited by the investi
 gation of the laws by which they were governed, a more than
 ordinary diligence had been employed in searching for them.
 And there was every reason to believe, that if there were more
labourers in the field, a still richer harvest would ensue: from
which there might fairly be expected some additional light on
the laws and constitution of the universe.
   The President likewise called the attention of the members
to the circumstance of the opposition of Mars in the month of
 May in the ensuing year. It was well known, he remarked,
that by a comparison of the observations of this planet with the
stars which were near it at that time, made at places situated
in these latitudes and at other latitudes having considerable
southern declination, the parallax of the planet might be rea
dily deduced, and thence the parallax of the sun. As there
were, at this time, two active observatories in the southern he
misphere, where this phaenomenon would probably be attend
ed to        (as
               had been
                   it           the two preceding oppositions),
                                        at                                            it
were extremely desirable that corresponding observations
should       be
            made     the northern hemisphere; without which, the
                             in
observations made                  in
                           the south would (as far         this subject     as        is
concerned)          be

                                                       or
fore, that those practical astronomers who were possessed                             of
the requisite instruments (and they were                           by

    The reading of the description of the large reflecting
telescope and frame made by Mr. John Ramage, of Aber
deen, was terminated.          Mr. Ramage has, ever since the
year 1806, devoted much of his time to the construction of
reflecting telescopes of large size, and of convenient frames
and supports, in which firmness of structure and facility of

      There was next read a paper on the subject of Parallaxes,
  taking the word in an enlarged sense, by M. Littrow.           It was
 in the excellent treatise of Lagrange on the determination of
  the solar parallax, from the observed transits of the inferior
 planets over the sun's disc, where the rectangular co-ordinates
  were first employed, instead of the less convenient expressions
 of spherical trigonometry, for the purpose of deducing the ap
 parent station of a planet from       longitude and latitude. The
                                                         its
 process has been since improved                           by

    The resulting expressions for these several solutions are ana
lytically simple. Those which are deduced           series are usually   in
of   this kind, namely,

tion of his principal formulae to the solution of various other
problems.
     Lastly, there was read a paper entitled A memoir on dif
ferent points relating to the theory of the perturbations of the
planets expounded in the Mécanique Céleste; by M. Plana,
                           .
astronomer royal at Turin and an associate of this Society.
     The object of the author in this memoir he states to be an
 examination of various points in the theory of the planetary
 perturbations as explained by M. de Laplace in the Méca
 nique Céleste. In undertaking this labour, he observes, he at
 first had no expectation of meeting with any instance in which
 an actual rectification of the results already arrived at would
 be necessary; but the progress of late made in the theory of
 perturbations having                him to treat certain particular
 questions more generally, and with more symmetry than here
 tofore, it is not to be wondered at if he has been led to re
 sults which surpass in exactness those hitherto published. But
 in all such cases, he adds, where he has arrived at conclusions
 not in accordance with those of the illustrious author of the
 Mécanique Céleste, he has thought it incumbent on him to give
 with the fullest detail, not only the developments, but even
 the arithmetical calculations on which these conclusions -
                                                                have
  been founded.
      The 1st chapter is devoted to the consideration of that ar
 tifice in the Mécanique Céleste in which M. Laplace transfers
  his formulae from the mean motions, axes, &c. of the primitive
  or undisturbed orbits, which are not given by observation, to
  those of the disturbed, which are given as they exist in nature.
  This he does by assuming an arbitrary constant introduced in
  one of the integrations by which the perturbation in longitude
           .
  is derived, in such a manner as to make the term in the result
                                                                         ;
  which depends on the mean motion vanish.              M. Plana de
  votes this chapter to the elucidation of this artifice, and shows
  the correctness of M. Laplace's results by obtaining the same
  conclusion by another, and direct method. He then applies
  his reasoning to numerical examples, and computes the quan
   tity by        the moon’s mean distance from the earth is per
   manently altered by the sun's action, which he finds to be
   about 1-100dth of the radius of the globe of the moon, in aug
  mentation, the corresponding increase of the periodic time
  being about 1-4th of a day. The excentricity too undergoes
  an alteration in  its   mean quantity from the same cause, equal
  to about 0.0007 of its actual amount.
      A  similar artifice in       of
                             the use    an  arbitrary constant added
 in    one of the  necessary   integrations  for arrivingat  the first
  term    ofthe motion    ofthe moon's  perigee,  M. Plana

has enabled M. Laplace to avoid an error in that research to
which his method seemed to expose him, and to obtain the
true result.     But he proceeds to show that this artifice is not
necessary, and that the same result may be obtained without
the use of the superfluous constant, by the aid of an equa
tion he deduces for the variable portion of the moon's radius
Vector.
    The method employed by M. Plana has the advantage, he
observes, of keeping distinctly in view throughout the whole
analysis the primitive elements, uninfluenced by the effect of
perturbation.       The other he states to have been first em
ployed by Lagrange in the volume of the Memoirs of the Aca
demy of Berlin for 1783.
    The author next proceeds to examine those parts of the
theory of perturbations, which depend on the non-sphericity of
the central body, and in which he remarks that the use of a
similar artifice in the Mécanique Céleste is accompanied with        .
greater obscurity, as a portion only of the arbitrary constant
is retained. He therefore enters on the investigation without
 the use of this artifice, and deduces the results #. the pertur
bations of the planets due to the ellipticity of the sun by the
 formulae for the variation of the arbitrary constants.
    The author next applies the same method to the theory of
 the perturbations of the seventh satellite of Saturn by the ellip
 tic figure of the planet ; and as he here arrives at final equa
 tions somewhat differing from those of M. Laplace, the whole
 process is given in copious detail.
    The 2d chapter of this paper is devoted to the consideration
 of the effect of the actions of the fixed stars on the secular
 variations of the planetary system. The expressions for the se
 cular variations of the excentricity and aphelion which the
 author brings out, agree perfectly with Laplace's in form, but
 differ in the numerical coefficients, one of the terms having the
  coefficient –liº, where Laplace has #, and another — # where
  Laplace makes it — 1. As he subsequently observes however,
  the action of the stars cannot possibly become sensible till
  after the lapse of many hundreds of centuries; so that these
  discrepancies are practically of no importance. He remarks too
  that this cause of perturbation prevents the equations between
  the squares of the excentricities, the masses, and square roots
  of the axes, so often referred to as insuring the stability of the
  planetary system,--as well as the similar one between the
  squares of the tangents of the inclinations, the masses, and
  square roots of the axes, from being mathematically exact.
                                                             *.
  It will be noted, however, that these equations can only be
  regarded as proved for the first powers of the disturbing

 while the action of the stars is at least                               of the order of their
 squares       or even cubes.
     The 3rd chapter is        devoted to the evaluation of those terms
 in the    theory   of the    perturbations      of Mercury by the Earth
 whose    coefficient,    being   divided   by  the square of the difference
 between the mean motion of              Mercury      and four times that of
 the Earth, may acquire a notable value by the smallness of                                            its
 divisor. The author first examines the indirect method fol
 lowed     by M. Laplace, which                         he
                                                considers defective and                               in

  The 5th chapter contains reflections on the Supplement to
the theory of Jupiter and Saturn in the fourth volume of the
Mécanique Céleste (p. 327–344); in which M. Laplace consi
ders several terms of the order of the square of the disturbing
force arising from the variation of the excentricities and peri
helia of the two planets, affected by the argument of the great
inequality.    M. Laplace has made use of an indirect but
more    expeditious method; and the object of the author in this
chapter (admitting, however, that the indirect method cannot
fail to give results very near the truth) is to estimate their de
       of accordance with those afforded by the direct method.
#. is conclusions in a numerical point of view agree with those
of Laplace, but he conceives that his analysis is more rigorous
and his formulae better adapted to further developments.
